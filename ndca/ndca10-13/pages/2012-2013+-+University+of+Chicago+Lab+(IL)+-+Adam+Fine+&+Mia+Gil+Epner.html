We are a proponent of full text, but we also want the wiki to be readable. Our solution is to post the full text of cards in really small font size. They can be easily copy and pasted into a Word doc to be read. If that gets frustrating, we'll go back to cites only.<br />

<strong><u>Comrades:¶ I will speak on the question of the Popular Front</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">However</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><strong><u>I do not want to equivocate.¶ We are not politicians.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">We want to express ourselves on the question of the Popular Front.</span><strong><u>It is necessary for us to define our position in relation to a new set of forces</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">that at the present tim e dominates the political scene.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> But when we urge people to have confidence in us, we are not thinking of </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">the kind of confidence that would be granted us because of more or less apt definitions derived, whether we wanted it or not, from </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">political maneuvers.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">We will not try to add new maneuvers to the already complex and often divergent maneuvers of the politicians.¶ </span><strong><u>When we speak</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">to those who want to hear us, </span><strong><u>we do not</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">essentially </span><strong><u>address</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">their </span><strong><u>political finesse. The reactions we hope for</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">from them</span><strong><u>are not calculations of positions, nor are they new political alliances</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>What we hope for is of a different nature</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.¶ </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>We see that the human masses are at the disposition of</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">blind</span><strong><u>forces which condemn them to inexplicable hecatombs, and which,</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> while making them wait,</span><strong><u>give them a morally empty and materially miserable life</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.¶ what we have before our eyes is the horror of human impotence.¶ We want to confront this horror directly. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>We address ourselves to the direct and violent drives which</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, in the minds of those who hear us</span><strong><u>, can contribute to the surge of power that will liberate</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">men</span><strong><u>[humyns] from the absurd swindlers who lead them.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">We know that</span><strong><u>such drives have little to do with the phraseology invented to maintain political positions</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The will to be done with impotence implies, even in our eyes, scorn for this phrasemongering; the taste for verbal agitation has never passed for a mark of power.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">On this point, we want to express ourselves in a precise way.¶ Derided </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">humanity</span><strong><u>[humynity] has</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">already </span><strong><u>known surges of power. These chaotic but</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> implacable</span><strong><u>power surges</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">dominate history and</span><strong><u>are known as Revolutions</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. On many occasions</span><strong><u>entire populations have gone into the street and nothing has been able to resist their force</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">It is an incontestable fact </span><strong><u>that if</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">men</span><strong><u>[humyns] have found themselves in the streets, armed, in a mass uprising, carrying with them the tumult of the total power of the people, it has never been the consequence of a</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">narrow and speciously defined</span><strong><u>political alliance.¶ What drives the crowds to the street is the emotion</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">directly</span><strong><u>aroused by striking events in the atmosphere of a storm, it is the contagious emotion that, from house to house, from suburb to suburb, suddenly turns a hesitating</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">man</span><strong><u>[humyn] into a frenzied being</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">It is evident that</span><strong><u>if,</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in general, </span><strong><u>insurrections had</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">had </span><strong><u>to wait for learned disputes</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">between committees and the political offices of parties, then</span><strong><u>there never would have been an insurrection</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.¶</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Still, as astonishing as this may seem, one frequently notes, among militant revolutionaries, a complete lack of confidence in the spontaneous reactions of the masses.¶ The need to organize parties has resulted in unusual habits among the</span><strong><u>so-called revolutionary agitators</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">who </span><strong><u>confuse the entry of the Revolution into the street with the political platforms, with the well-groomed programs, with their maneuvers in the halls of Congress</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Amazingly,</span><strong><u>a distrust of the same order prevails against intellectuals.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The distrust of intellectuals only apparently contradicts the one that underestimates the spontaneous movements of the masses.¶ As much as they can,</span><strong><u>certain</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">professional </span><strong><u>revolutionary activists would like to eliminate, from the</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">human</span><strong><u>[humyn] tragedy that the Revolution necessarily is, all its emotional resources, the brutal conversion of the masses, the atmosphere</u></strong><strong><u>charged with hope, the rages and enthusiasms express in periods of crisis by those who write.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">We are as far as we can be from the belief that a movement can do without its leaders, as far as we can be from the belief that this leadership can do without the resources of human knowledge contributed by the most recent advances of human understanding. But first of all we must protest against everything that is born in the poisoned atmosphere of professional congresses and committees, all of which are at the mercy of hallway maneuvers.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">¶ </span><strong><u>We do not think it is possible to raise a political question without having a debate. And for us having the debate means having it in the street, it means having it where emotion can seize</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">men</span><strong><u>[humyns] and push them to the limit, without meeting the eternal obstacles that result from the defense of old political positions</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>There were 42 homicides in Chicago last month. Twenty-one of them were within five minutes walking distance of our sheltered pristine world.</strong><br />

<strong>The Question: Why do we stay silent?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The Answer: Who would listen to us? What is protest now but a shout in the shadows?</strong><br />
<strong>--</strong><br />
<strong>In 1989 a group of students stormed Tiananmen Square in China to protest an increasingly rigid and oppressive government. Its origins began with the sons and daughters of the elite and the hope it provided rippled through for 3 days, rocking the authoritarian regime. When the crackdown began, it was brutal and swift. While the regime strutted in full military regalia, a peasant, sick of the atrocity moved himself in front of a tank. The horrifying violence—one person v. the system—had become visible.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This event reverberated from that one square to spark a new dissent that would spread past the borders of China into the Soviet Union. And in 1991, those protests would be a driving force in the downfall of the USSR.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Maybe their cause was good or maybe it wasn’t. But only that revolution opened up the grounds for change—something the self-interested and insipid political system could never have dreamed of. The rallying cry wasn’t a celebration of a victorious protest, a celebration of the deaths, but to remember an individual that stood up against all odds. The movement of the people to their rebellions is the only option to challenge the violences of the status quo.</strong><br />

<strong>In this debate we are called to affirm: Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States. The resolution hails us to work but we will not comply. Rather than lending volume to the echoes in the halls of congress we give the power of our voices to the purpose of revolutionary agitation. We furthermore affirm that this energy should be invested in outpourings into the streets…somewhere a smug politician asks what are you rebelling against…answer: what have you got?</strong><br />

<strong>Bataille 1985</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (Georges, “Visions of Excess”, ed. Allan Stoekl, p. 164-168)¶ We do not endorse Bataille’s gendered language.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">In a certain sense, the Popular Front meant nothing more than the revolutionaries’ abandonment of the anticapitalist offensive; the move to the defense of antifascism; the move to the simple defense of democracy; the abandonment, at the same time, of revolutionary defeatism.¶ Now comrades, what can we think of this abandonment of the anticapitalist offensive, at precisely the time when a great number of people, independently of their political tendencies, agreed upon the disastrous character of the capitalist system? From the revolutionary point of view, the abandonment of the anticapitalist offensive in the midst of the present crisis would represent the most scandalous possible weakness; isn’t it incredible to leave to the worst slave of capitalism, to the fascistic Croix de feu lackeys of the de Wendels, the rallying cry awaited by the anxious, disconcerted masses, the rallying cry to fight against a capitalism despised by the vast majority of men?¶ The default of the politicians thus would abandon the real world, the world of tragic sufferings and hopes, to the degrading verbal comedy of barracks-room thugs.¶ And at the same time, while dread mounts from day to day before the imminence of the physical extermination of men and human wealth, wouldn’t it be incredible to anticipate a new conflict by giving the idea of antifascism a value on the level of military struggle, when we know, meanwhile, that stupid imperialism precisely engendered this fascism that we mean to fight while marching in the ranks assigned to us by generals and industrial magnates.¶ Comrades, if human reality, or to be more precise, human reality in the street- personally, it is in tying to it all the hope that stirs me that I use this term “street,” which opposes life, real life, to the schemes as well as to the isolation of the absurdly involuted individual- if human reality did not in every possible way go beyond the mediocre conceptions and betrayals of conniving politicians, then the Popular Front would not have, for any of us, the profound meaning that it has acquired in the circumstances that we have lived and that we continue to live. ¶ </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Even today</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, while many people- rightly or wrongly- are claiming that the Popular Front is falling apart at the top, that, beyond an antifascist defense it will be incapable of setting forth a plan for concerted action essential to the exercise of power, </span><strong><u>we</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">continue to</span><strong><u>see growing among the masses</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">who make up its strength,</span><strong><u>who were in the street yesterday, who will invade the street tomorrow, the agitation of the people’s omnipotence</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Badly formed political conceptions have set these people in motion, but the Popular Front does not depend on the will of its founders to work exactly for their goals:</span><strong><u>the Popular Front is above all now a movement, an agitation, a crucible in which</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">formerly </span><strong><u>separated political forces meld with</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">an often</span><strong><u>tumultuous effervescence</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.¶ Now that the various social strata that constitute it have become conscious of the strength they represent when reunited, </span><strong><u>this strength</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">going to their heads,</span><strong><u>will attract them to each other and will break the chains meant to hold</u></strong><strong><u>them</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Therefore, when our comrades of the revolutionary Socialist left call for the transformation of the defense against fascism into an anticapitalist offensive, of the Popular Front into the Popular Front of combat, they are only expressing the dynamic movement inherent in the makeup of forces in motion. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Today it is not advisable for anyone to be opposed to the rise of the all-powerful populace.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ We must not be unaware, however, that difficulties must be overcome, before the offensive can be realized, without which the party will find itself in the hands of those who are still criminally talking of the “lost victory.”¶ We do not believe that organized parties should disappear, but </span><strong><u>we do not believe</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">either </span><strong><u>that the masses can attain the power to put an end to domination</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">by the capitalist lackeys</span><strong><u>unless a movement appears that can escape</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">the </span><strong><u>sterilizing control</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">of these parties.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">We must above all recognize as critical the period following the formation of a government that, without being the direct expression of the Popular Front, could nevertheless be brought to power by the parliamentarians who belonged to this Front.¶ From time to time the spokesmen of the Popular Front themselves are led to make statements that show an extreme uneasiness on this point. Concerning a Popular Front government, Pierre Jerome, secretary-general of the Vigilance Committee, a few weeks ago express the fear that he could not cover budgetary expenditures with forseen income: “In that case,” Pierre Jerome state, “we will see our enemies furnished with the best weapon they could hope for. To be sure, if panic sets in, we ourselves should not faint with fear…” Jerome in any case sees a way out of this great difficulty: “In the end, all we need to do is make the rich pay…”¶ In fact, nothing is more likely in the near future than a repeat of the disastrous events that sooner or later followed the electoral victories of the so-called Left of 1924 and 1932.¶ Without being able to have confidence in more or less arbitrary details, one can foresee, at one time or another, a serious crisis of the entire Left, a crisis that will not fail to serious affect the Popular Front itself.¶ To tell the truth, those of us who see the Popular Front as a reality in motion have nothing to become excessively alarmed about in such a crisis. We must only forestall it, knowing full well that </span><strong><u>no development of forces and no great social transformation can take place without a crisis</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">knowing as well above all that</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the forces destined to prevail are those that not only overcome their crises, but are capable of profiting by them</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.¶ The Popular Front means for us the awareness the people first attained, in the days of February, of their strength in the face of Fascist thugs and lackeys. We do not believe that this awareness will allow itself to be shaken on the day miserable directors betray their own impotence.¶ These conditions are, on the contrary, in our opinion, necessary so that the masses, who have no desire for the reactionary solutions leading to poverty and war, this time can become aware of the inherent necessities of power. It is possible that</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> a crisis is indispensable for the transformation</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">- as indicated from the outset by the menacing attitude of the masses in the street- of the defensive Popular Front into the Popular Front of combat, and, of course, of combat for the anticapitalist dictatorship of the people.¶ It is clear from now on that, in order to have confidence in its own resources, the Popular Front must first lose the confidence it currently has in its principal leaders.I do not think it necessary here to insist upon our reasons for having the greatest distrust and even the greatest contempt for given professional political parliamentarians, who tomorrow risk being entrusted with the position of leadership.¶ </span><strong><u>What interests us above all</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">- </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">the analysis of the economic bases of society having been accomplished, its results having proven, moreover, to be limited</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">- </span><strong><u>are the emotions that give the</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">human</span><strong><u>[humyn] masses the surges of power that tear them away from the domination of those who</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">only know how to</span><strong><u>lead them on to poverty and to the slaughterhouse</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">But we would not want to suggest that we blindly abandon ourselves to the spontaneous reactions of the street.¶ </span><strong><u>We are led to make an essential distinction between the reactions that agitate</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">men</span><strong><u>[humyns] in the street and the phrasemongering of politicians</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">and all the teachings of the present period at the very least show that </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">this </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">distinction </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">credits the men who have nothing </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">going for them</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> but their passions, to the detriment of those corrupted and </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">often </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">emptied of human content by the strategic task.¶ </span><strong><u>But we find no reason to renounce</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">the decisive intervention of</span><strong><u>judgment and</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">of</span><strong><u>the</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">methodological </span><strong><u>understanding of the facts. We only wish to apply intelligence less to</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">so-called</span><strong><u>political situations</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">and to the logical deductions that ensue,</span><strong><u>than to the immediate comprehension of life.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Even independently of the tragic events now taking place,</span><strong><u>we believe that there is more to learn in the streets of great cities,</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> for example, </span><strong><u>than in political newspapers or books. For us a significant reality is the s</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">tate of prostration and</span><strong><u>boredom expressed inside a bus by a dozen human faces, all of them complete strangers. For anyone not</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">already </span><strong><u>hardened by the emptiness of life, there is i</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">n this world, which seems to have at its disposal limitless resources, </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">a </span><strong><u>confusion remedied only by a kind of lazily accepted general imbecility</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Even poverty seems at the very least less incurable than this stupid distress</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. A </span><strong><u>beggar whose broken voice cries out a song one can barely hear in the rear of a courtyard seems at times to have lost less in the game of life than the human matter arranged in buses and trains during rush hour</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.¶ Someone told me the other day, correctly, that the source of the Croix de Feu’s might was very simple: the Croix de Feu, in general, are people who are bored. The minimum of contagious passion animating the Croix de Feu, the low budget exaltation- to tell the truth, an exaltation good for workrooms- maintained by this pillar of human boredom (family barracks) known as the Count Colonel de la Rocque, is somehow enough to maintain a vague gleam of life in empty brains, but no taste for what is burning or colorful in life grips them, and the sinister job of the Croix de Feu becomes their whole life.¶ </span><strong><u>The opium of the people in the present world is</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">perhaps not so much religion as it is</span><strong><u>accepted boredom. Such a world is at the mercy,</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">it must be known,</span><strong><u>of those who provide</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">at least the semblance of</span><strong><u>an escape from boredom.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">Human life aspires to the passions</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, and again encounters it exigencies.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">It can appear </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">out of place and even absolutely</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> absurd to those who worry about which platforms must serve as the basis for future actions, when we respond by saying that the world in which they bustle about is doomed to boredom.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">This remark, however, has a very simple meaning: in the Communist opposition, I have personally known a great number of people for whom the definition of platforms has had an essential value. Their activity resulted only in stunning boredom, which they saw precisely as the mark of revolutionary seriousness.¶ </span><strong><u>We want to say that we oppose these preoccupations.¶ We believe that strength will belong not to those for whom action is a demand for morose and disagreeable work, but to those who, on the contrary, will deliver the world from its exhausting boredom.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">We want to give precise answers to questions that demand precise answers, but we maintain that what is essential lies elsewhere.¶ </span><strong><u>We must contribute to the masses’ awareness of their own power; we are sure that strength results less from strategy than from collective exaltation, and exaltation can come only from words that touch not the reason but the passions of the masses</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.¶ </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">We want to hope that soon the masses will know how to gather and find together, in this reunion, the burning heat that attracts men from all sides and that will become the basis for an implacable popular domination.¶ We ask all those who, along with us, mean to pursue an action parallel to the one we see open before us how they hope to achieve the dictatorship of the working masses, how, first of all, they hope to realize the transformation of the defensive Popular Front into a Popular Front of combat.¶ As for us, we want to pose the question in a precise way. It seems to me personally that the only way to pose the question is the following: </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">it is not really a question of knowing </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">first of all </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">what must be done, but what result must be envisioned. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">We know that</span><strong><u>the question of the takeover of power is now being posed. We know that,</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in all likelihood,</span><strong><u>the democratic regime, which struggles amidst mortal contradictions, cannot be saved.¶ The succession is open</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. We have many reasons to think that the Croix de Feu provide no response to the necessities resulting from the current situation- neither in their social content, the tenor of their program, nor in the personality of their chief. Their effective value seems to us in this respect to be situated far below that of the Italian Fascists or the German National Socialists.¶ The Popular Front in its present form is not, nor does it present itself, as an organized force within sight of taking power. It must thus be transformed, according to the plan of the socialist revolutionary Left, into a Popular Front of combat.¶ As for us, we say that</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> this presupposes a renewal of political forms</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, a renewal possible in the present circumstances, when</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> it seems that all revolutionary forces are </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">called upon</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to fuse in an incandescent crucible. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">We are assured that insurrection is impossible for our adversaries.</span><strong><u>We believe that</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">of the </span><strong><u>two hostile forces that will engage in the struggle for power, the fascists and the people, the force that gets the upper hand will be the one that shows</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">itself </span><strong><u>most capable of</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">dominating events and</span><strong><u>imposing an implacable power on its adversaries</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><strong><u>What we demand is a</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">coherent disciplined organization, its entire</span><strong><u>will straining with enthusiasm toward popular power;</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">this is the sense of responsibility that must devolve on those who tomorrow must be the masters, who must subordinate the system of production to human interests, who must impose silence, in their own country and at the same time throughout the world, on the nationalists’ criminal and puerile passions.¶ After February 16.¶ </span><strong><u>500,000 workers, defied by little cockroaches, invaded the streets and caused an immense uproar.¶ Comrades, who has the right to lay down the law?¶ This ALL-POWERFUL multitude, this</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">HUMAN</span><strong><u>[HUMYN] OCEAN…¶ Only this ocean of</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">men</span><strong><u>[humyns] in revolt can save the world from the nightmare</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">of impotence</span><strong><u>and carnage in which it sinks</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">!</span><br />

<strong>Status quo structural violence outweighs nuclear war.</strong><br />

<strong><u>We live</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, equally immersed, and to a deeper degree, </span><strong><u>in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging &quot;structural' violence</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, of a kind </span><strong><u>that destroys human life with a breathtaking ruthlessness</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Former Massachusetts prison official and writer, Dr. James Gilligan observes; </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">By &quot;structural violence&quot; I mean </span><strong><u>the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, as contrasted by those who are above them. </span><strong><u>Those excess deaths</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">(or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) </span><strong><u>are a function</u></strong> <u>of the class structure</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; and that structure is itself a product </span><strong><u>of</u></strong> <u>society's collective human <strong>choices,</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting &quot;structural&quot; with &quot;behavioral violence&quot; by which I mean the non-natural deaths and injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide, suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on. --(Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New York: Vintage, 1996), 192.) </span><strong><u>This form of violence</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, not covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected media, </span><strong><u>is invisible to us and because of its invisibility, all the more insidious</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. How dangerous is it--really? Gilligan notes: [E]very fifteen years, on the average, </span><strong><u>as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war</u></strong> <u>that caused 232 million deaths;</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">of the Jews over a six-year period. </span><strong><u>This is</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, in effect, the equivalent of </span><strong><u>an ongoing, unending</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">in fact </span><strong><u>accelerating, thermonuclear war</u></strong><u>, <strong>or genocide on the</strong></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">weak and </span><strong><u>poor</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> every year of every decade, throughout the world</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9pt;">Man's [ humynkind’s] disregard for the material basis of his life still causes him to err in a serious way. Humanity </span><strong><u>[Humynity] exploits</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> given </span><strong><u>material resources, but by restricting them</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> as it does </span><strong><u>to a resolution of the immediate difficulties it encounters</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">(a resolution which it has hastily had to define as an ideal),</span><strong><u>it assigns to the forces it employs an end which they cannot have.

No doubt these ends and this movement may not be entirely irreconcilable; but if these two terms are to be reconciled we must cease to ignore one of them; otherwise, our works quickly turn to catastrophe</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. I will begin with a basic fact:</span><strong><u>The living organism</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, in a situation determined by the play of energy on the surface of the globe, </span><strong><u>ordinarily receives more energy than is necessary for maintaining life; the excess energy</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">(wealth)</span><strong><u>can be used for the growth of a system</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">(e.g., an organism);</span><strong><u>if the system can no longer grow</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, or if the excess cannot be completely absorbed in its growth, </span><strong><u>it must necessarily be lost without profit; It must be spent, willingly or not, gloriously or catastrophically.</u></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Badiou’s communism thus drives itself straightaway into the ditch separating new from the old: “at a distance from the state,” but still fundamentally oriented toward hoary ideas about the state’s withering away. Though </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">“</span><strong><u>organization</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> no longer </span><strong><u>means</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> a party capable of seizing state power and directing its military and bureaucratic power toward particular programmatic ends, it does mean </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">that </span><strong><u>“[y]ou decide what the state must do and find the means of forcing it to</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, while always keeping your distance from the state…</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">” And yet </span><strong><u>this orientation</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> toward the state</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> – regardless of its reliance on telekinesis rather than direct contact – </span><strong><u>reproduces the primary weakness of the riots and uprisings of the present</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, the very thing it seeks to overcome</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Whether or not they feature explicit demands, </span><strong><u>these riots are always heard by the state and powers-that-be as practical calls for reform:</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> “Mubarak must go!” and “No more austerity</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">!” are how the uprisings of Egypt and Greece sound in paraphrase. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">This has less to do with the ideas actually held by participants, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">who may indeed have anticapitalist and antistate aspirations, </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">than it does with their particular strategic and tactical choices</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">: massing in the square defensively, for instance, or attacking the parliament building on the eve of an austerity vote. Even </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">the supposedly “meaningless” violence of the London riots gets heard as a call for reform, for amelioration of poverty, social exclusion, and the racist harassment of the police.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> It is unclear, then, what solution Badiou’s call for “organization” might provide to the limits of the historical riot, which he rightly notes “does not by itself offer an alternative to the power it intends to overthrow.” The dubious case of “Latin American socialism” and the sloganizing of the antiglobalization movement notwithstanding, </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">no</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> such </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">alternative has yet emerged in the 21</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">st</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> century.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> We might wonder, instead, if </span><strong><u>the</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> very </span><strong><u>concept of</u></strong> <strong><u>an alternative</u></strong> <strong><u>belongs to the now-outmoded politics of party</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><strong><u>state</u></strong><strong><u>and program</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.

<strong>Our 1AC creates an opportunity to restructure the debate space and open it to protest – also we should look at the specifics of the protest in attempting to understand its efficiency</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 9pt;">The </span><strong><u>rhetorical deployment of place is a common tactic for social movements</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Calling on fond memories of or attachment to particular places, environmental social movements routinely ask their supporters to take action to ‘‘save’’ special places including Yosemite Valley, Glen Canyon, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Beyond referencing particular places in their arguments for social change, social movements have also relied on the rhetoricity of places themselves by holding protest events in particularly meaningful places or using protest events to create temporary fissures in the dominant meanings of places. The 1963 Civil Rights Movement’s March on Washington culminated at the Lincoln Memorial in the Washington Mall in part because of the significance of that place: both its proximity to the center of Federal Government and Abraham Lincoln’s role in freeing slaves. As Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech, the place and the presence of hundreds of thousands of people congregating in that place also constituted the movement’s goals. The 2003 anti-war (in Iraq) protesters who took to the streets*indeed, any protest that marches through city streets*not only sent a visual message of the strength of the movement through images of city streets brimming with people but also temporarily reconstructed city streets from places for transportation into places of protest. These are just a few examples of how place is rhetorically significant to social movement protest. ‘‘In short,’’ as Tim Cresswell notes, ‘‘the qualities of place that make them good strategic tools of power simultaneously make them ripe for resistance in highly visible and often outrageous ways.’’1</span><strong><u>(Re)constructing the meaning of place</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, even in temporary ways, </span><strong><u>can be a tactical act of resistance</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> along with the tactics we traditionally associate with protest,such as speeches, marches, and signs. As we will demonstrate, </span><strong><u>place (re)constructions can function rhetorically to challenge dominant meanings</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> and practices </span><strong><u>in a place</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Place is a performer along with activists in making and unmaking the possibilities of protest. Although scholars in geography and sociology regularly attend to the implications of theories of place for social movements and activism,2 rhetoricians have yet to turn to place as a way to examine the rhetorical performances of social movement protest. This essay provides a foundation for such an examination by articulating the rhetorical force of place in protest. We argue that place can serve as a unique heuristic for rhetorical studies of social movements. Traditionally research on social movements has been focused on the actions of protesters through their words or use of bodies, our discussion of place in protest shifts attention to how embodied rhetorics of protest are always situated in particular places. In other words, studying bodies and words can reveal only part of the rhetorical tactics of protest. Studying how words and bodies interact in and with place allows us to see social movement rhetoric from a new perspective. Beyond this specific contribution, our heuristic also contributes to a general understanding of the rhetoricity of place by specifically attending to how bodies, words, and places all interact in rhetoric. Further, the concept of place in protest has implications for understanding how to study the rhetoric of place. We build our argument by pulling together threads of existing research on place to offer a critical lens*place in protest*with which to ask questions relevant to a more comprehensive analysis of how place functions along with other rhetorical performances in social movement discourse. Place in protest allows us to understand how social movements use both place-based arguments and place-as-rhetoric</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><strong><u>Placebased arguments discursively invoke images</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> or memories </span><strong><u>of a place to support an argument</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, such as summoning the melting of the arctic as a reason to stop globalwarming, and </span><strong><u>make salient that dominant place meanings are sometimes linked to systems of power that discourage protest</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">In addition to examining such indirectinvocations of place, we are interested in how social movements construct andreconstruct places in line with their challenges to the status quo (e.g., gay pridecelebrations taking over everyday city streets to temporarily queer them). Place-asrhetoricis at the core of our contribution to the study of place in protest and placegenerally; it assumes that the very place in which a protest occurs is a rhetoricalperformance that is part of the message of the movement. We will further refineplace-as-rhetoric by distinguishing three ways in which places act rhetorically. First,protesters may build on a pre-existing meaning of a place to help make their point,such as holding a protest event at a state capital so that protesters can direct theirmessage to this symbol of government. Second</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><strong><u>protests can</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> temporarily </span><strong><u>reconstruct the meaning</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> (</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">and challenge the dominant meaning)</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">of a particular place</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, such as Critical Mass’s take-over of car lanes in downtown city streets to raise awareness about bicycles as a ‘‘legitimate’’ form of transportation. These temporary reconstructionsof places create short-term fissures in the dominant meanings of places inproductive ways. Third</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><strong><u>repeated reconstructions over time can result in new place meanings</u></strong><strong><u>, such as how the 1960s UC Berkeley Free Speech Movement’s repeated use of the front steps of Sproul Hall</u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> (</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">a building that at the time housed campusadministration offices) for</span><strong><u>their protests eventually resulted in its being known as a place for protest</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">on campus, even though the building now houses student services.In these three ways, places themselves*not discourse about places*are rhetoricaltactics in movements toward social change.</span><br />

<strong>The Panama Canal expansion drastically alters maritime trade—new harbor deepening is key to trade competitiveness</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Ports are dynamic, vibrant centers of trade and commerce, but what is most important to understand is that seaports rely on partnerships. Seaports invest more than $2.5 billion every year to maintain and improve their infrastructure. In recent years, however, this commitment has not been adequately matched by the federal government. Federal funding for dredging federal navigation channels has slowed and decreased, especially for new construction. Further, maintenance dredging is sorely underfunded, despite a more than $6 billion and growing surplus in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. Landside improvements have also been too low a priority, with little of the highway funds going to freight transportation projects. The only bright light has been the newly created TIGER grants, although not enough of this funding benefited ports. Virginia Port Authority received a TIGER grant for its heartland project. As we look to the future, we do know that there are challenges and opportunities. As we recover from this economic downturn, we must make investments today to address the trade realities of the future. Here are some the challenges and we have to ask: are we ready? The Panama Canal expansion is due to be completed in 2014 and is expected to influence trade patterns. VPA and other ports have been making investments, but federal funding has been slow to match these investments. Ship sizes continue to get larger, requiring on-'going modernization of ports and federal navigation channels, even for ports that will not require 50 feet of depth. Canada and Mexico are making investments which could result in losses of maritime jobs in the U.S. as cargo enters the U.S. through these countries. We have already seen this job loss on the West Coast. The U.S. seeks to double exports; however countries like Brazil and Chile, who we compete against the U.S. in terms of agricultural exports, are making investments that could make their exports more competitive. New trade agreements with Korea, Panama and Colombia have been approved, with other trade agreements under negotiations which should result in increased exports and imports through ports. In addition to these near-term challenges, we know that the U.S. population is forecast to grow by 100 million - a 30 percent increase - before the middle of the 2lst century. And many of the goods used by this population will flow through seaports. So are we ready? While ports are planning for the future, the federal government has not kept pace with the industry or our international competitors. The federal government has a unique Constitutional responsibility to maintain and improve the infrastructure that enables the flow of commerce, and much of that infrastructure in and around seaports have been neglected for too long. Many of our land and water connections are insufficient and outdated, affecting the ports' ability to move cargo efficiently into and out of the U.S. This hurts U.S. business, hurts U.S. workers and hurts our national economy. Port projects take decades to plan and build and we cannot wait. Federal investments in seaports are an essential and effective utilization of limited resources, paying dividends through increased trade and commerce, long-term job creation, secure borders, military support, environmental stewardship, and more than $200 billion in federal, state and local tax revenue. Earlier this month, the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness made an urgent plea for improvements in the nation's transportation infrastructure, including landside and waterside access to seaports. We cannot wait. </span><br />

<strong>Obama hasn’t actually allocated money, just perceived—at most one East Coast port would be ready by Panama expansion</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Thursday’s announcement by the White House does not mean money is likely to flow from the federal government any time soon. In March, pushing the much-needed dredging project along, Gov. Rick Scott visited the port and announced the state would advance the county more than $90 million. Scott’s hope was that the state would be reimbursed. Miami-Dade will cover the remainder of the $180 million cost to deepen the port from 42 to 50 feet, a move the county is undertaking to accommodate the mega-ships that will glide through the newer, deeper Panama Canal. Because Congress has ordered the Army Corps not to begin any new projects indefinitely, Johnson said, the White House would need to propose funding for Miami-Dade, which then would send the money back to the state. Asked Johnson: “I’ve got a big question mark: Where are the dollars? Is the president putting dollars for PortMiami into his budget next year?” That wasn’t clear Thursday, with one senior administration official saying only, “Today’s announcements focus just on expediting all remaining federal reviews.” Johnson and Gimenez, in their statement, went out of their way to praise the governor. “Governor Scott and the state Legislature made this project happen through advancing state financing of the federal share of the project,” Johnson said. When complete, PortMiami will be the only East Coast port below Norfolk, Va., with a 50-foot depth in time for the Panama Canal’s expected 2015 opening.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">ECONOMIC IMPACT: HUGE Currently, international trade accounts for more than a quarter of America’s GDP (gross domestic product). Oceangoing vessels that load and unload cargo at US seaports move 99.4 percent of the nation’s overseas trade by volume and 65.5 percent by value. Further, customs collections from seaport cargo provide tens of billions of dollars a year to the federal government, including $23.2 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2007, $24.1 billion in FY 2008, $20.3 billion in FY 2009 and $22.5 billion in FY 2010. The latest economic impacts analyses conducted in 2007 indicated that US seaport activities generated $3.15 trillion in annual economic output, with $3.8 billion worth of goods moving in and out of seaports every day. Impact extends far beyond seaport communities. On average, any given state uses the services of 15 different ports around the country to handle its imports and exports. Also, seaports are a proven job creator. In addition to handling international trade, US seaports – and the waterways that serve them – represent important transportation modes for the movement of domestic freight. Greater utilization of America’s coastal and inland water routes for freight transportation complements other surface transportation modes – providing a safe and secure alternative for cargo while offering significant energy savings and traffic congestion relief. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Exports Could Contribute to the Rebalancing of the U.S. Economy and a Lower Trade Deficit For the most of the last 20 years, the United States has witnessed strong economic growth and low unemployment in comparison with other developed countries.18 Yet, the U.S. economy was affected by the wide fluctuations at the end of two business cycles, the so called IT bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble that ended between sometime during 2006 and 2007. Meanwhile, in 2006 household income inequality reached its post-World War II peak.19 Real median income in 2008 fell below 1999 levels.20 These three conditions—a tepid rise in living standards, increasing inequality, and bubble economies—are embedded in the consumption driven American economy. In 1982, U.S. residents spent 86 cents of every dollar of after-tax income, but the intensity of consumption grew steadily such that by 2005, that share had reached 95 cents of every dollar.21 All this spending depleted savings, which dropped precipitously over the time period from over 10 percent in the early 1980s to just 1.7 percent in 2005.22 At the same time, an increasing share of consumption involved the purchase of imports. While the value of U.S. total imports was eight percent higher than the value of U.S. total exports in 1982, by 2005, the difference was 36 percent, the highest gap since 1960.23 With minimal household savings, domestic investment declined over the last two decades relative to the size of the economy. The United States invested about 7.3 percent of GDP in the 2000s, much less than the 9.4 percent rate of the 1970s.24 Moreover, from 2000 to 2007, private manufacturing investment as a share of GDP was just 0.26 percent per year compared to 0.37 percent during the 1990s. At the same time, foreign investment compensated to some extent, though more in the real estate sector. For example, Chinese holdings represented 6 percent of all federal agency debt and 29 percent of foreign-held agency debt in 2007, making China the largest foreign holder of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt.25 The externalization of risk is another major problem with trade deficits. A large portion of the dollars spent on imports end up being re-invested back into the United States and that process increases the risk of bubbles. No sector can sustain limitless growth, and as the safest and most valuable investments become saturated with funding, the excess liquidity begins to seep into riskier and riskier propositions like no-income-no-asset subprime mortgage derivatives. The economists Joshua Aizenman and Yothin Jinjarak have shown that current account deficits have coincided with and contributed to rapid housing price appreciation across OECD countries between 1990 and 2005.26 While the United States based its growth on private consumption over the last three decades, the other developed countries exploited foreign demand. Over the last 30 years, private consumption, as a share of GDP, increased by seven percentage points in the United States, while total exports grew by only two percentage points. The other large developed countries, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, maintained an almost constant share of private spending, but increased their share of total exports in GDP by seven percentage points.28 In 2008, the U.S. total exports were only 12.7 of domestic production, in comparison with 29.7 percent in the other large developed countries. Moreover, as a recent Brookings report shows, this underperformance is not entirely explained by the size of the U.S. economy and its distance from trading partners.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The United States faces enormous economic obstacles in the immediate future as it recovers from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. The private-sector recovery is under way, with industrial production growing by 9.2 percent from June 2009 to July 2010, and with business investment up by an inflation-adjusted 5.2 percent from June 2009 to June 2010. Private-sector employment is also on the rise with more than 1.1 million jobs created in 2010. This is good news, but large challenges still loom that could derail the fledgling private-sector momentum contributing to our economic recovery. An important challenge is the trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit is widening again, reaching 3.7 percent of gross domestic product (the total amount of goods and services produced in our economy) in the third quarter of 2010, up from 2.4 percent of GDP in the second quarter of 2009. This widening gap poses a drag on economic growth since the country has to borrow money overseas to pay for the extra imports—a debt that ultimately will have to be repaid. A country can only import more than it exports if overseas investors lend it money. For the United States this means a persistent trade deficit requires taking on ever more foreign debt to pay for the excess of imports over exports. That’s why maintaining U.S. international economic competitiveness and strengthening our exports must be a key component of any serious strategy to produce sustained and long-term economic growth.</span><br />

<strong>Second, Delays in supply chains crush the economy</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">As sourcing and product delivery operations span larger and longer distances, firms are transforming the way they look at and manage supply chains. No longer are individual companies competing with each other, entire supply chains are. Effective supply chains and just-in-time delivery systems drive modern global business. Supply chain infrastructure is the glue that binds successful trade routes. It affects the cost of every single product in the United States. Inefficient connections and capacity limitations lead to delays that raise the price of a company’s product, and make it harder to compete globally. Supply chain infrastructure is an important factor in a company’s decision on where to invest, build, and employ people. These decisions require substantial lead times, and the quality of the infrastructure determines the attractiveness of a particular location. As world commerce becomes more integrated, and as sourcing and product delivery operations span larger and longer distances, America’s firms and supply chains are being transformed. It has long been the case that it is no longer the individual companies that compete with each other. Rather, entire supply chains – fully integrated processes that connect manufacturer to transporter to distribution center to point of sale – are now the primary competitors in domestic and global commerce. Efficiencies in supply chains lead to competitive advantages, and they make possible global sourcing, just in time delivery systems, and modern global business itself. The velocity and efficiency of each supply chain depends on the infrastructure through which these goods and products flow. The increasingly time-sensitive and integrated nature of modern supply chains make smooth, just-in-time goods movement a critical element in that supply chain’s ability to compete in the global economy. Industry today sees infrastructure as an interconnected network of physical transport facilities, combined with modern information technology systems. The efficiency of this infrastructure -- and the industries that depend on it—is affected by environmental and sustainability considerations, new financing options, education, and regulatory and trade security measures. This speaks to the growing sophistication and complexity of modern supply chains, and their critical reliance on the quality of America’s supply chain infrastructure to support modern, high-tech manufacturing. Industry members have told us that supply chain infrastructure makes a difference because it affects the cost of every single product made or used in the United States. Missing connections and capacity limitations between port and manufacturer lead to delays that raise the price of every American export product and make it harder to compete with international producers. To illustrate this point, a recent Wall Street Journal article reported that a key harbor grain terminal in the Port of Los Angeles lacks enough space to handle the volume of exports arriving from inland producers due to the limited rail service to that terminal. Leading executives have also told us that a nation’s supply chain infrastructure also makes a difference when deciding where their firms will invest, build facilities and employ people. </span><br />

<strong>Strong US growth is key to promoting an American economic model – the alternative is mercantilism, which destroys economic cooperation and risks protectionism</strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><a class="wiki_link" href="/home#_msocom_1">[AY1</a>] </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In the postwar period, US power and prestige, beyond the nation's military might, have been based largely on American relative economic size and success. These facts enabled the US to promote economic openness and buy-in to a set of economic institutions, formal and informal, that resulted in increasing international economic integration. With the exception of the immediate post-Bretton Woods oil-shock period (1974-85), this combination produced generally growing prosperity at home and abroad, and underpinned the idea that there were benefits to other countries of following the American model and playing by American rules. Initially this system was most influential and successful in those countries in tight military alliance with the US, such as Canada, West Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. With the collapse of Soviet communism in 1989, and the concomitant switch of important emerging economies, notably Brazil, China, India, and Mexico, to increasingly free-market capitalism, global integration on American terms through American leadership has been increasingly dominant for the last two decades. The global financial crisis of 2008-09, however, represents a challenge to that world order. While overt financial panic has been averted, and most economic forecasts are for recovery to begin in the US and the major emerging markets well before end of 2009 (a belief I share), there remain significant risks for the US and its leadership. The global financial system, including but not limited to US-based entities, has not yet been sustainably reformed. In fact, financial stability will come under strain again when the current government financial guarantees and public ownership of financial firms and assets are unwound over the next couple of years. The growth rate of the US economy and the ability of the US government to finance responses to future crises, both military and economic, will be meaningfully curtailed for several years to come. Furthermore, the crisis will accelerate at least temporarily two related long-term trends eroding the viability of the current international economic arrangements. First, perhaps inevitably, the economic size and importance of China, India, Brazil, and other emerging markets (including oil-exporters like Russia) has been catching up with the US, and even more so with demographically and productivity challenged Europe and northeast Asia. Second, pressure has been building over the past fifteen years or so of these developing countries' economic rise to give their governments more voice and weight in international economic decision-making. Again, this implies a transfer of relative voting share from the US, but an even greater one from over-represented Western Europe. The near certainty that Brazil, China, and India, are to be less harmed in real economic terms by the current crisis than either the US or most other advanced economies will only emphasise their growing strength, and their ability to claim a role in leadership. The need for capital transfers from China and oil-exporters to fund deficits and bank recapitalisation throughout the West, not just in the US, increases these rising countries' leverage and legitimacy in international economic discussions. One aspect of this particular crisis is that American economic policymakers, both Democratic and Republican, became increasingly infatuated with financial services and innovation beginning in the mid-1990s. This reflected a number of factors, some ideological, some institutional, and some interest group driven. The key point here is that export of financial services and promotion of financial liberalisation on the US securitised model abroad came to dominate the US international economic policy agenda, and thus that of the IMF, the OECD, and the G8 as well. This came to be embodied by American multinational commercial and investment banks, in perception and in practice. That particular version of the American economic model has been widely discredited, because of the crisis' apparent origins in US lax regulation and over-consumption, as well as in excessive faith in American-style financial markets. Thus, American global economic leadership has been eroded over the long-term by the rise of major emerging market economies, disrupted in the short-term by the nature and scope of the financial crisis, and partially discredited by the excessive reliance upon and overselling of US-led financial capitalism. This crisis therefore presents the possibility of the US model for economic development being displaced, not only deservedly tarnished, and the US having limited resources in the near-term to try to respond to that challenge. Additionally, the US' traditional allies and co-capitalists in Western Europe and Northeast Asia have been at least as damaged economically by the crisis (though less damaged reputationally). Is there an alternative economic model? The preceding description would seem to confirm the rise of the Rest over the West. That would be premature. The empirical record is that economic recovery from financial crises, while painful, is doable even by the poorest countries, and in advanced countries rarely leads to significant political dislocation. Even large fiscal debt burdens can be reined in over a few years where political will and institutions allow, and the US has historically fit in that category. A few years of slower growth will be costly, but also may put the US back on a sustainable growth path in terms of savings versus consumption. Though the relative rise of the major emerging markets will be accelerated by the crisis, that acceleration will be insufficient to rapidly close the gap with the US in size, let alone in technology and well-being. None of those countries, except perhaps for China, can think in terms of rivaling the US in all the aspects of national power. These would include: a large, dynamic and open economy; favorable demographic dynamics; monetary stability and a currency with a global role; an ability to project hard power abroad; and an attractive economic model to export for wide emulation. This last point is key. In the area of alternative economic models, one cannot beat something with nothing - communism fell not just because of its internal contradictions, or the costly military build-up, but because capitalism presented a clearly superior alternative. The Chinese model is in part the American capitalist (albeit not high church financial liberalisation) model, and is in part mercantilism. There has been concern that some developing or small countries could take the lesson from China that building up lots of hard currency reserves through undervaluation and export orientation is smart. That would erode globalisation, and lead to greater conflict with and criticism of the US-led system. While in the abstract that is a concern, most emerging markets - and notably Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa, and South Korea - are not pursuing that extreme line. The recent victory of the incumbent Congress Party in India is one indication, and the statements about openness of Brazilian President Lula is another. Mexico's continued orientation towards NAFTA while seeking other investment flows (outside petroleum sector, admittedly) to and from abroad is a particularly brave example. Germany's and Japan's obvious crisis-prompted difficulties emerging from their very high export dependence, despite their being wealthy, serve as cautionary examples on the other side. So unlike in the1970s, the last time that the US economic performance and leadership were seriously compromised, we will not see leading developing economies like Brazil and India going down the import substitution or other self-destructive and uncooperative paths. If this assessment is correct, the policy challenge is to deal with relative US economic decline, but not outright hostility to the US model or displacement of the current international economic system. That is reassuring, for it leaves us in the realm of normal economic diplomacy, perhaps to be pursued more multilaterally and less high-handedly than the US has done over the past 20 years. It also suggests that adjustment of current international economic institutions is all that is required, rather than desperately defending economic globalisation itself. For all of that reassurance, however, the need to get buy-in from the rising new players to the current system is more pressing on the economic front than it ever has been before. Due to the crisis, the ability of the US and the other advanced industrial democracies to put up money and markets for rewards and side-payments to those new players is also more limited than it has been in the past, and will remain so for at least the next few years. The need for the US to avoid excessive domestic self-absorption is a real concern as well, given the combination of foreign policy fatigue from the Bush foreign policy agenda and economic insecurity from the financial crisis. Managing the post-crisis global economy Thus, the US faces a challenging but not truly threatening global economic situation as a result of the crisis and longer-term financial trends. Failure to act affirmatively to manage the situation, however, bears two significant and related risks: first, that China and perhaps some other rising economic powers will opportunistically divert countries in US-oriented integrated relationships to their economic sphere(s); second, that a leadership vacuum will arise in international financial affairs and in multilateral trade efforts, which will over time erode support for a globally integrated economy. Both of these risks if realised would diminish US foreign policy influence, make the economic system less resilient in response to future shocks (to every country's detriment), reduce economic growth and thus the rate of reduction in global poverty, and conflict with other foreign policy goals like controlling climate change or managing migration and demographic shifts. If the US is to rise to the challenge, it should concentrate on the following priority measures.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire<a class="wiki_link" href="/home#_msocom_2">[AY2</a>] the United States and other nations to spew forth protectionist legislation like the notorious Smoot-Hawley bill. Introduced at the start of the Great Depression, it triggered a series of tit-for-tat economic responses, which many commentators believe helped turn a serious economic downturn into a prolonged and devastating global disaster. But if history is any guide, those lessons will have been long forgotten during the next collapse. Eventually, fed by a mood of desperation and growing public anger, restrictions on trade, finance, investment, and immigration will almost certainly intensify. Authorities and ordinary citizens will likely scrutinize the cross-border movement of Americans and outsiders alike, and lawmakers may even call for a general crackdown on nonessential travel. Meanwhile, many nations will make transporting or sending funds to other countries exceedingly difficult. As desperate officials try to limit the fallout from decades of ill-conceived, corrupt, and reckless policies, they will introduce controls on foreign exchange. Foreign individuals and companies seeking to acquire certain American infrastructure assets, or trying to buy property and other assets on the cheap thanks to a rapidly depreciating dollar, will be stymied by limits on investment by noncitizens. Those efforts will cause spasms to ripple across economies and markets, disrupting global payment, settlement, and clearing mechanisms. All of this will, of course, continue to undermine business confidence and consumer spending. In a world of lockouts and lockdowns, any link that transmits systemic financial pressures across markets through arbitrage or portfolio-based risk management, or that allows diseases to be easily spread from one country to the next by tourists and wildlife, or that otherwise facilitates unwelcome exchanges of any kind will be viewed with suspicion and dealt with accordingly. The rise in isolationism and protectionism will bring about ever more heated arguments and dangerous confrontations over shared sources of oil, gas, and other key commodities as well as factors of production that must, out of necessity, be acquired from less-than-friendly nations. Whether involving raw materials used in strategic industries or basic necessities such as food, water, and energy, efforts to secure adequate supplies will take increasing precedence in a world where demand seems constantly out of kilter with supply. Disputes over the misuse, overuse, and pollution of the environment and natural resources will become more commonplace. Around the world, such tensions will give rise to full-scale military encounters, often with minimal provocation. In some instances, economic conditions will serve as a convenient pretext for conflicts that stem from cultural and religious differences. Alternatively, nations may look to divert attention away from domestic problems by channeling frustration and populist sentiment toward other countries and cultures. Enabled by cheap technology and the waning threat of American retribution, terrorist groups will likely boost the frequency and scale of their horrifying attacks, bringing the threat of random violence to a whole new level. Turbulent conditions will encourage aggressive saber rattling and interdictions by rogue nations running amok. Age-old clashes will also take on a new, more heated sense of urgency. China will likely assume an increasingly belligerent posture toward Taiwan, while Iran may embark on overt colonization of its neighbors in the Mideast. Israel, for its part, may look to draw a dwindling list of allies from around the world into a growing number of conflicts. Some observers, like John Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, have even speculated that an “intense confrontation” between the United States and China is “inevitable” at some point. More than a few disputes will turn out to be almost wholly ideological. Growing cultural and religious differences will be transformed from wars of words to battles soaked in blood. Long-simmering resentments could also degenerate quickly, spurring the basest of human instincts and triggering genocidal acts. Terrorists employing biological or nuclear weapons will vie with conventional forces using jets, cruise missiles, and bunker-busting bombs to cause widespread destruction. Many will interpret stepped-up conflicts between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.</span><br />

<strong>And even without protectionism, economic decline increases the likelihood of conflict</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Royal 10 – Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, 2010, “Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defense behavior of interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson’s (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous shocks such as economic crisis could usher in a redistribution of relative power (see also Gilpin, 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the risk of miscalculation (Fearon, 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner, 1999). Seperately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland’s (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that ‘future expectation of trade’ is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behavious of states. He argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations, However, if the expectations of future trade decline, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crisis could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states. Third, others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write, The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favor. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflict self-reinforce each other. (Blomberg &amp; Hess, 2002. P. 89) Economic decline has been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blomberg, Hess, &amp; Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. ‘Diversionary theory’ suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increase incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a ‘rally around the flag’ effect. Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995), and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlated economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels. This implied connection between integration, crisis and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Our more globalized world has also yielded a “peace dividend.” It may not be obvious when our daily news cycles are dominated by horrific images from the Gaza Strip, Afghanistan and Libya, but our more globalized world has somehow become a more peaceful world. The number of civil and international wars has dropped sharply in the past 15 years, along with battle deaths. The reasons behind the retreat of war are complex, but again the spread of trade and globalization have played a key role. Trade has been seen as a friend of peace for centuries. In the 19th century, British statesman Richard Cobden pursued free trade as a way not only to bring more affordable bread to English workers but also to promote peace with Britain’s neighbors. He negotiated the Cobden-Chevalier free trade agreement with France in 1860 that helped to cement an enduring alliance between two countries that had been bitter enemies for centuries. In the 20th century, President Franklin Roosevelt’s secretary of state, Cordell Hull, championed lower trade barriers as a way to promote peaceful commerce and reduce international tensions. Hull had witnessed first-hand the economic nationalism and retribution after World War I. Hull believed that “unhampered trade dovetail[s] with peace; high tariffs, trade barriers and unfair economic competition, with war.” Hull was awarded the 1945 Nobel Prize for Peace, in part because of his work to promote global trade. Free trade and globalization have promoted peace in three main ways. First, trade and globalization have reinforced the trend towards democracy, and democracies tend not to pick fights with each other. A second and even more potent way that trade has promoted peace is by raising the cost of war. As national economies become more intertwined, those nations have more to lose should war break out. War in a globalized world not only means the loss of human lives and tax dollars, but also ruptured trade and investment ties that impose lasting damage on the economy. Trade and economic integration has helped to keep the peace in Europe for more than 60 years. More recently, deepening economic ties between Mainland China and Taiwan are drawing those two governments closer together and helping to keep the peace. Leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Straight seem to understand that reckless nationalism would jeopardize the dramatic economic progress that region has enjoyed. A third reason why free trade promotes peace is because it has reduced the spoils of war. Trade allows nations to acquire wealth through production and exchange rather than conquest of territory and resources. As economies develop, wealth is increasingly measured in terms of intellectual property, financial assets, and human capital. Such assets cannot be easily seized by armies. In contrast, hard assets such as minerals and farmland are becoming relatively less important in high-tech, service economies. If people need resources outside their national borders, say oil or timber or farm products, they can acquire them peacefully by freely trading what they can produce best at home. The world today is harvesting the peaceful fruit of expanding trade. The first half of the 20th century was marred by two devastating wars among the great powers of Europe. In the ashes of World War II, the United States helped found the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, the precursor to the WTO that helped to spur trade between the United States and its major trading partners. As a condition to Marshall Plan aid, the U.S. government also insisted that the continental European powers, France, Germany, and Italy, eliminate trade barriers between themselves in what was to become the European Common Market. One purpose of the common market was to spur economic development, of course, but just as importantly, it was meant to tie the Europeans together economically. With six decades of hindsight, the plan must be considered a spectacular success. The notion of another major war between France, Germany and another Western European powers is unimaginable. Compared to past eras, our time is one of relative world peace. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the number of armed conflicts around the world has dropped sharply in the past two decades. Virtually all the conflicts today are civil and guerilla wars. The spectacle of two governments sending armies off to fight in the battlefield has become rare. In the decade from 1998 through 2007, only three actual wars were fought between states: Eritrea-Ethopia in 1998-2000, India-Pakistan in 1998-2003, and the United States-Iraq in 2003. From 2004 through 2007, no two nations were at war with one another. Civil wars have ended or at least ebbed in Aceh (in Indonesia), Angola, Burundi, Congo, Liberia, Nepal, Timor-Leste and Sierra Leone. Coming to the same conclusion is the Human Security Centre at the University of British Colombia in Canada. In a 2005 report, it documented a sharp decline in the number of armed conflicts, genocides and refugee numbers in the past 20 years. The average number of deaths per conflict has fallen from 38,000 in 1950 to 600 in 2002. Most armed conflicts in the world now take place in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the only form of political violence that has worsened in recent years is international terrorism. Many causes lie behind the good news – the end of the Cold War, the spread of democracy, and peacekeeping efforts by major powers among them – but expanding trade and globalization appear to be playing a major role in promoting world peace. In a chapter from the 2005 Economic Freedom of the World Report, Dr. Erik Gartzke of Columbia University compared the propensity of countries to engage in wars to their level of economic freedom. He came to the conclusion that economic freedom, including the freedom to trade, significantly decreases the probability that a country will experience a military dispute with another country. Through econometric analysis, he found that, “Making economies freer translates into making countries more peaceful. At the extremes, the least free states are about 14 times as conflict prone as the most free. A 2006 study for the institute for the Study of Labor in Bonn, Germany, found the same pacific effect of trade and globalization. Authors Solomon Polachek and Carlos Seiglie found that “trading nations cooperate more and fight less.” In fact, a doubling of trade reduces the probability that a country will be involved in a conflict by 20 percent. Trade was the most important channel for peace, they found, but investment flows also had a positive effect. A democratic form of government also proved to be a force for peace, but primarily because democracies trade more. All this helps explain why the world’s two most conflict-prone regions – the Arab Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa – are also the world’s two least globally and economically integrated regions. Terrorism does not spring from poverty, but from ideological fervor and political and economic frustration. If we want to blunt the appeal of radical ideology to the next generation of Muslim children coming of age, we can help create more economic opportunity in those societies by encouraging more trade and investment ties with the West. The U.S. initiative to enact free trade agreements with certain Muslim countries, such as Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain and Oman, represent small steps in the right direction. An even more effective policy would be to unilaterally open Western markets to products made and grown in Muslim countries. A young man or woman with a real job at an export-oriented factory making overcoats in Jordan or shorts in Egypt is less vulnerable to the appeal of an Al-Qaida recruiter. Of course, free trade and globalization do not guarantee peace or inoculation against terrorism, anymore than they guarantee democracy and civil liberty. Hot-blooded nationalism and ideological fervor can overwhelm cold economic calculations. Any relationship involving human beings will be messy and non-linear. There will always be exceptions and outliers in such complex relationships involving economies and governments. But deeper trade and investment ties among nations have made it more likely that democracy and civil liberties will take root, and less likely those gains will be destroyed by civil conflict and war.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Lack of attention to port maintenance and improvement dredging is starting to restrict trade and military movements. Some ports are struggling to keep up with newer, deeper draft container vessels which are now calling on the United States. Further, military movements onto some deployment docks are restricted to daylight operation because of channel width and depth restrictions. MARAD recommends that some of the most critical dredging and infrastructure projects be identified for the purpose of bringing attention to the areas that may soon restrict military or significant commercial cargo. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">But port facilities and maritime transportation are also important from another perspective, that of national security. They enable the supply of United States military forces deployed abroad. For example, DOT points out that ninety per cent of all supplies used in Operation Desert Storm were shipped from U.S. ports. 6 According to DOT, water transportation is environmentally sound, since ships and barges, when compared to other means of transportation, have the smallest number of accidental spills or collisions. 7 Further, water transportation is more fuel efficient per ton of cargo moved than other modes of transportation. 8 But these assessments focus only on the actual operation of transportation systems and do not consider, for example, potential environmental problems associated with dredging, an activity essential for contemporary maritime transportation. While the movement of goods in trade is shaped fundamentally by factors of supply and demand, it is also affected by the ability to transport goods from where they are found or manufactured to where they are desired, as well as the ability to do so in a dependable and efficient manner and on cost competitive terms. 9 Containerization 10 and the use of ever larger ships, tankers and bulk ships as well as container ships, represent responses by the shipping industry to these transportation influences. Simply put, larger ships benefit from economies of scale, so that a larger container vessel has lower costs per container and a larger tanker lower costs per unit of crude oil or other cargo. 11 DOT has noted the trend toward the use of mega-container ships, that is ships designed to carry over 4,500 boxes measured in terms of twenty foot equivalent units (TEUs). 12 The Regina Maersk, the first 6,000+ TEU containership, was delivered in early 1996, and in the period of 1997-1999 some thirty five new vessels were ordered with a TEU capacity ranging from 4,500 to 9,000 TEUs. 13 Ships on order now include what will be the two largest containerships in the world, with a capacity of 9,800 TEUs (for the China Shipping Group to be operated between Hong Kong and Los Angeles). 14 Industry sources suggest that in the near future ships with up to 12,000 TEU capacity will enter into service, 15 and DOT expects that, by 2010, almost one third of all general cargo tonnage will be transported on ships with more than 4,000 TEUs. 16 But if larger vessels offer cost efficiencies for ship operators, they present new problems for port managers. As ships have become larger, they have acquired deeper drafts, demanding deeper water to accommodate their hulls. At the start of the twentieth century, navigational channels of thirty 30 feet in depth were sufficient to allow safe movement of almost all ships, 17 but this is no longer the case. Since the introduction of container carrying ships in the 1950s, six generations of such ships have evolved, with successively deeper drafts (Figure 1). 18 It is believed that the drafts of the mega-containerships that will be coming online will not be greater than 14.5 meters, a figure that does not exceed the draft of the largest containerships now in service. 19 Megacontainership operations require a water depth of at least fifty feet in ship channels, turning basins, and ship berths. 20 According to the Maritime Administration, in 1997 only four of the ten major U.S. container ports that collectively loaded and unloaded almost eighty per cent of container traffic had channel and berthing areas deep enough in draft for fully laden megacontainerships. 21 (Table 2). It is not ship draft alone that must be considered in navigational dredging. Other factors, such as increased beam and windage, create maneuverability problems in narrow channels. 22 A particular port’s lack of the clearances needed by these larger, deeper draft vessels undercuts its potential for commercial success. To maximize their attraction for very large containerships, ports must be able to offer easy entrance and departure, the capacity to entertain such vessels even with full loads (high load factors), efficient loading and unloading, and ready access to other forms of transportation as part of the desired seamless network of intermodal carriage. For ship operators, fast turnaround time is essential, as any time lost at ports lessens the time that ships can move cargoes and generate revenues, frustrates the expectations of shippers regarding delivery, and generally raises questions about the reliability of service. In this market, ports with channels or berthing facilities that do not provide needed clearance for these newer and larger vessels may be avoided altogether. Otherwise, they may be left to served only by smaller ships or those that are not fully loaded. In the port of Oakland, for example, deep draft vessels have had to key their arrival times to tidal schedules, and delays in unloading might then cost an additional 10.5-14 hours of waiting for the next high tide. 23 Such scenarios have serious implications for the port, for businesses dependent on maritime transportation, and, ultimately, for the consumer. The needs of ports to accommodate larger vessels with deeper drafts, taken together with the natural process of sedimentation, create demands for the dredging of shipping lanes. As noted by a former DOT official, for ports “the competition to capture markets by having the deep channels required for mega-ships translates simply and inescapably into millions of tons of dredged materials.” 24 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that the Corps of Engineers annually dredges and disposes of some 300 million cubic yards of material from navigation maintenance and improvement projects. To this figure must be added some 100 million cubic yards of material dredged by port authorities, terminal owners, marinas, and private individuals. 25 In connection with maritime transportation, dredging is needed in three types of situations: to maintain present widths and depths by counteracting the natural redistribution of coastal sediments, to widen and deepen existing channels for access by new, larger vessels, and to create new port facilities where they have not existed before.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Vital national efforts such as military cargo moves for Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom would not be possible without U.S. seaports and the people who keep them working. As important as they are in times of peace, ports take on an added significance in wartime, when they provide the conduits for everything from armored vehicles to ammunition to get to battlefield locations on the other side of the planet. Military and civilian leaders agree that a network of multiple ports – each with sufficient rail capabilities and other intermodal infrastructure – is essential to war efforts. But, without proper funding for improvements to rail capacity and other facilities, ports are not able to maximize their ability to handle influxes of thousands of railcars loaded with military cargoes. “Ports are absolutely critical,” said Bill Lucas, the top civilian in the U.S. military transportation arena. “We couldn’t do it without them. “We are very, very dependent upon U.S. ports,” added Lucas, who for the past 13 years has served as deputy to the commander of the Alexandria, Va.-based Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC). Lucas noted that ports played an essential role as military loadouts in support of this year’s Iraq conflict moved with much greater efficiency than those associated with Operation Desert Storm in 1991.</span><br />

<strong>Federal funded dredging is vital to the competiveness of the shipping industry</strong><br />
<strong>Weakley 08</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">- President, Lake Carriers´ Association (James H.I., “Realize America's Maritime Promise”, April 30, 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ramphmtf.org/speeches_043008.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ramphmtf.org/speeches_043008.html</a>)//sjl</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">America´s deep-draft navigation system is at a crossroads, with a future that can be bright or bleak. Our waterways´ ability to support the Nation?s continuing growth in trade and in the defense of our Nation, hinges on much-needed Federal attention to unresolved funding needs that are derailing critical channel maintenance and deep-draft construction projects of the water highways to our ports. Because most ports do not have naturally deep harbors, they must be regularly dredged to allow ships to move safely through Federal navigation channels. Also, as modern vessels increase in size, navigation channel depths must increase accordingly, if we are to continue to be a player on the international marketplace. A recent U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study reports that almost 30 percent of the 95, 550 vessel calls at U.S. ports are constrained due to inadequate channel depths. Ladies and gentlemen, these are the things that cause port directors nightmares. Without a channel dredged to its authorized depth, nothing else comes into play. Attracting new customers, dealing with labor issues, environmental concerns, and the public - all go away - because without a properly-dredged channel, business goes away. Public ports are at a critical state in keeping their channels open for business. We are losing existing business and potential new business to ports outside of the United States ? and once lost, it is rarely regained. Dredging can literally make or break our industry, and a lack of dredging is an issue throughout the United States. In fact, it is not an overstatement to say that in many parts of the United States, we face a dredging crisis. On the Great Lakes, as Chairman James L. Oberstar of this Committee and Chairman David R. Obey of the Appropriations Committee well know, decades of inadequate funding for dredging have left a backlog of 18 million cubic yards of sediment. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates removing the backlog will cost more than $230 million on the Great Lakes alone. In some cases, ports on the Great Lakes have actually shutdown due to inadequate dredging. There are similar examples of dredging problems in ports and harbors on all coasts of our Nation. In many cases, vessels must ?load light? because of dredging shortfalls. The economic implications of light loading are enormous. On the Great Lakes, for example, vessels lose between 50 to 270 tons of cargo for each inch they must reduce their draft and, in some areas, the lost draft is measured in feet, not inches. Light loading because of inadequate dredging impacts everyone. A ship that is light-loaded reduces its efficiencies in the same way that a commercial airplane that is required to set aside seats with no passengers would quickly lose its efficiencies. </span><br />

<strong><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">The Maritime industry is key to naval primacy—it affects every sector of the Navy</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The American Maritime Industry also contributes to our national defense by sustaining the shipbuilding and repair sector of our national defense industrial base upon which our standing as a seapower is based. History has proven that without a strong maritime infrastructure—shipyards, suppliers, and seafarers—no country can hope to build and support a Navy of sufficient size and capability to protect its interests on a global basis. Both our commercial and naval fleets rely on U.S. shipyards and their numerous industrial vendors for building and repairs. The U.S. commercial shipbuilding and repair industry also impacts our national economy by adding billions of dollars to U.S. economic output annually. In 2004, there were 89 shipyards in the major shipbuilding and repair base of the United States, defined by the Maritime Administration as including those shipyards capable of building, repairing, or providing topside repairs for ships 122 meters (400 feet) in length and over. This includes six large shipyards that build large ships for the U.S. Navy. Based on U.S. Coast Guard vessel registration data for 2008, in that year U.S. shipyards delivered 13 large deep-draft vessels including naval ships, merchant ships, and drilling rigs; 58 offshore service vessels; 142 tugs and towboats, 51 passenger vessels greater than 50 feet in length; 9 commercial fishing vessels; 240 other self- propelled vessels; 23 mega-yachts; 10 oceangoing barges; and 224 tank barges under 5,000 GT. 11 Since the mid 1990’s, the industry has been experiencing a period of modernization and renewal that is largely market-driven, backed by long-term customer commitments. Over the six-year period from 2000-05, a total of $2.336 billion was invested in the industry, while in 2006, capital investments in the U.S. shipbuilding and repair industry amounted to $270 million.12 The state of the industrial base that services this nation’s Sea Services is of great concern to the U.S. Navy. Even a modest increase in oceangoing commercial shipbuilding would give a substantial boost to our shipyards and marine vendors. Shipyard facilities at the larger shipyards in the United States are capable of constructing merchant ships as well as warships, but often cannot match the output of shipyards in Europe and Asia. On the other hand, U.S. yards construct and equip the best warships, aircraft carriers and submarines in the world. They are unmatched in capability, but must maintain that lead. 13 Defense Industrial Base: Seafarers &amp; Shipyard Labor Maintaining a strong industrial base supporting the seagoing elements of the U.S. Merchant Marine and U.S. Navy includes having the trained and experienced manpower necessary to crew the vessels comprising the commercial merchant fleet and the skilled shipyard workers needed to build and repair both Navy and commercial ships. Thus seafarers and shipyard labor are key elements in maintaining U.S. maritime superiority.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Although cloaked in the reassuring boilerplate about American military preeminence and global leadership, in reality the Obama administration’s new Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG) is the first step in the United States’ adjustment to the end of the Pax Americana—the sixty-year period of dominance that began in 1945. As the Pentagon document says—without spelling out the long-term grand-strategic implications—the United States is facing “an inflection point.” In plain English, a profound power shift in international politics is taking place, which compels a rethinking of the U.S. world role. The DSG is a response to two drivers. First, the United States is in economic decline and will face a serious fiscal crisis by the end of this decade. As President Obama said, the DSG reflects the need to “put our fiscal house in order here at home and renew our long-term economic strength.” The best indicators of U.S. decline are its GDP relative to potential competitors and its share of world manufacturing output. China’s manufacturing output has now edged past that of the United States and accounts for just over 18 or 19 percent of world manufacturing output. With respect to GDP, virtually all leading economic forecasters agree that, measured by market-exchange rates, China’s aggregate GDP will exceed that of the United States by the end of the current decade. Measured by purchasing-power parity, some leading economists believe China already is the world’s number-one economy. Clearly, China is on the verge of overtaking the United States economically. At the end of this decade, when the ratio of U.S. government debt to GDP is likely to exceed the danger zone of 100 percent, the United States will face a severe fiscal crisis. In a June 2011 report, the Congressional Budget Office warned that unless Washington drastically slashes expenditures—including on entitlements and defense—and raises taxes, it is headed for a fiscal train wreck. Moreover, concerns about future inflation and America’s ability to repay its debts could imperil the U.S. dollar’s reserve-currency status. That currency status allows the United States to avoid difficult “guns-or-butter” trade-offs and live well beyond its means while enjoying entitlements at home and geopolitical preponderance abroad. But that works only so long as foreigners are willing to lend the United States money. Speculation is now commonplace about the dollar’s long-term hold on reserve-currency status. It would have been unheard of just a few years ago. The second driver behind the new Pentagon strategy is the shift in global wealth and power from the Euro-Atlantic world to Asia. As new great powers such as China and, eventually, India emerge, important regional powers such as Russia, Japan, Turkey, Korea, South Africa and Brazil will assume more prominent roles in international politics. Thus, the post-Cold War “unipolar moment,” when the United States commanded the global stage as the “sole remaining superpower,” will be replaced by a multipolar international system. The Economist recently projected that China’s defense spending will equal that of the United States by 2025. By the middle or end of the next decade, China will be positioned to shape a new international order based on the rules and norms that it prefers—and, perhaps, to provide the international economy with a new reserve currency. Two terms not found in the DSG are “decline” and “imperial overstretch” (the latter coined by the historian Paul Kennedy to describe the consequences when a great power’s economic resources can’t support its external ambitions). But, although President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta may not admit it, the DSG is the first move in what figures to be a dramatic strategic retrenchment by the United States over the next two decades. This retrenchment will push to the fore a new U.S. grand strategy—offshore balancing. In a 1997 article in International Security, I argued that offshore balancing would displace America’s primacy strategy because it would prove difficult to sustain U.S. primacy in the face of emerging new powers and the erosion of U.S. economic dominance. Even in 1997, it was foreseeable that as U.S. advantages eroded, there would be strong pressures for the United States to bring its commitments into line with its shrinking economic base. This would require scaling back the U.S. military presence abroad; setting clear strategic priorities; devolving the primary responsibility for maintaining security in Europe and East Asia to regional actors; and significantly reducing the size of the U.S. military. Subsequent to that article, offshore balancing has been embraced by other leading American thinkers, including John Mearsheimer, Stephen Walt, Barry Posen, Christopher Preble and Robert Pape. To be sure, the proponents of offshore balancing have differing ideas about its specifics. But they all agree that offshore balancing is based on a common set of core strategic principles. ● Fiscal and economic constraints require that the United States set strategic priorities. Accordingly, the country should withdraw or downsize its forces in Europe and the Middle East and concentrate its military power in East Asia. ● America’s comparative strategic advantages rest on naval and air power, not on sending land armies to fight ground wars in Eurasia. Thus the United States should opt for the strategic precepts of Alfred Thayer Mahan (the primacy of air and sea power) over those of Sir Halford Mackinder (the primacy of land power). Offshore balancing is a strategy of burden shifting, not burden sharing. It is based on getting other states to do more for their security so the United States can do less. ● By reducing its geopolitical and military footprint on the ground in the Middle East, the United States can reduce the incidence of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism directed against it. Islamic terrorism is a push back against U.S. dominance and policies in the region and against on-the-ground forces in the region. The one vital U.S. interest there—safeguarding the free flow of Persian Gult oil—can be ensured largely by naval and air power. ● The United States must avoid future large-scale nation-building exercises like those in Iraq and Afghanistan and refrain from fighting wars for the purpose of attaining regime change. Several of these points are incorporated in the new DSG. For example, the new strategy document declares that the United States “will of necessity rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region.” The document also states the United States will “rebalance [its] military investment in Europe” and that the American military posture on the Continent must “evolve.” (The Pentagon’s recent decision to cut U.S. ground forces in Europe from four brigades to two is an example of this “evolution.”) Finally, implicitly rejecting the post-9/11 American focus on counterinsurgency, the strategy document says that with the end of the Iraq war and the winding down of the conflict in Afghanistan, “U.S. forces will no longer be sized to conduct large-scale, prolonged stability operations.” The DSG reflects the reality that offshore balancing has jumped from the cloistered walls of academe to the real world of Washington policy making. In recent years the U.S. Navy, the Joint Staff and the National Intelligence Council all have shown interest in offshore balancing as an alternative to primacy. Indeed, in his February 2011 West Point speech, then defense secretary Robert Gates made two key points that expressed a clear strategic preference for Mahan over Mackinder. First, he said that “the most plausible, high-end scenarios for the U.S. military are primarily naval and air engagements—whether in Asia, the Persian Gulf, or elsewhere.” Second—with an eye on the brewing debate about intervention in Libya—he declared that “any future defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should ‘have his head examined,’ as General MacArthur so delicately put it.” In plain English, no more Eurasian land wars. The subsequent Libyan intervention bore the hallmarks of offshore balancing: The United States refused to commit ground forces and shifted the burden of military heavy lifting to the Europeans. Still, within the DSG document there is an uneasy tension between the recognition that economic constraints increasingly will impinge on the U.S. strategic posture and the assertion that America’s global interests and military role must remain undiminished. This reflects a deeper intellectual dissonance within the foreign-policy establishment, which is reluctant to accept the reality of American decline. In August 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proclaimed a “New American Moment;” reaffirmed the U.S. responsibility to lead the world; and laid out an ambitious U.S. global agenda. More recently, Mitt Romney, a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination, declared that the twenty-first century “must be an American century” and that “America is not destined to be one of several equally balanced global powers.” These views are echoed by foreign-policy scholars who refuse to acknowledge the reality of decline or embrace a theory of “painless decline” whereby Pax Americana’s norms and institutions will survive any American retrenchment. But, American “exceptionalism” notwithstanding, the United States is not exempt from the historical pattern of great-power decline. The country needs to adjust to the world of 2025 when China will be the number-one economy and spending more on defense than any other nation. Effective strategic retrenchment is about more than just cutting the defense budget; it also means redefining America’s interests and external ambitions. Hegemonic decline is never painless. As the twenty-first century’s second decade begins, history and multipolarity are staging a comeback. The central strategic preoccupation of the United States during the next two decades will be its own decline and China’s rise.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The United States has a legacy commitment to global stability, and that poses a particular challenge to the waning hegemon as it seeks to fulfill its commitment with dwindling resources. The fundamental challenge for the United States as it faces the future is closing the &quot;Lippmann gap,&quot; named for journalist Walter Lippmann. This means bringing America's commitments into balance with the resources available to support them while creating a surplus of power in reserve. To do this, the country will need to establish new strategic priorities and accept the inevitability that some commitments will need to be reduced because it no longer can afford them. These national imperatives will force the United States to craft some kind of foreign-policy approach that falls under the rubric of &quot;offshore balancing&quot;--directing American power and influence toward maintaining a balance of power in key strategic regions of the world. This concept--first articulated by this writer in a 1997 article in the journal International Security--has gained increasing attention over the past decade or so as other prominent geopolitical scholars, including John Mearsheimer, Stephen Walt, Robert Pape, Barry Posen and Andrew Bacevich, have embraced this approach. Although there are shades of difference among proponents of offshore balancing in terms of how they define the strategy, all of their formulations share core concepts in common. First, it assumes the United States will have to reduce its presence in some regions and develop commitment priorities. Europe and the Middle East are viewed as less important than they once were, with East Asia rising in strategic concern. Second, as the United States scales back its military presence abroad, other states need to step up to the challenge of maintaining stability in key regions. Offshore balancing, thus, is a strategy of devolving security responsibilities to others. Its goal is burden shifting, not burden sharing. Only when the United States makes clear that it will do less--in Europe, for example--will others do more to foster stability in their own regions. Third, the concept relies on naval and air power while eschewing land power as much as possible. This is designed to maximize America's comparative strategic advantages--standoff, precision-strike weapons; command-and-control capabilities; and superiority in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance. After all, fighting land wars in Eurasia is not what the United States does best. Fourth, the concept avoids Wilsonian crusades in foreign policy, &quot;nation-building&quot; initiatives and imperial impulses. Not only does Washington have a long record of failure in such adventures, but they are also expensive. In an age of domestic austerity, the United States cannot afford the luxury of participating in overseas engagements that contribute little to its security and can actually pose added security problems. Finally, offshore balancing would reduce the heavy American geopolitical footprint caused by U.S. boots on the ground in the Middle East--the backlash effect of which is to fuel Islamic extremism. An over-the-horizon U.S. military posture in the region thus would reduce the terrorist threat while still safeguarding the flow of Persian Gulf oil. During the next two decades, the United States will face some difficult choices between bad outcomes and worse ones. But such decisions could determine whether America will manage a graceful decline that conserves as much power and global stability as possible. A more ominous possibility is a precipitous power collapse that reduces U.S. global influence dramatically. In any event, Americans will have to adjust to the new order, accepting the loss of some elements of national life they had taken for granted. In an age of austerity, national resources will be limited, and competition for them will be intense. If the country wants to do more at home, it will have to do less abroad. It may have to choose between attempting to preserve American hegemony or repairing the U.S. economy and maintaining the country's social safety net. The Constellation of world power is changing, and U.S. grand strategy will have to change with it. American elites must come to grips with the fact that the West does not enjoy a predestined supremacy in international politics that is locked into the future for an indeterminate period of time. The Euro-Atlantic world had a long run of global dominance, but it is coming to an end. The future is more likely to be shaped by the East. At the same time, Pax Americana also is winding down. The United States can manage this relative decline effectively over the next couple of decades only if it first acknowledges the fundamental reality of decline. The problem is that many Americans, particularly among the elites, have embraced the notion of American exceptionalism with such fervor that they can't discern the world transformation occurring before their eyes.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Modernization and deepening of federal channels is another critical issue for our nation to be prepared for the 21th century trade realities. There are two trends in this area which are cause for great concern. First, the funding level of the Corps of Engineers’ new construction budget has decreased considerably, with the President’s current request at a level that is less than half of what we have seen historically. This decrease comes despite the challenges noted above, the need to be able to handle the current and future World fleet, the expansion of the Panama Canal, our new trade agreements, and America’s international competitiveness. Our neighbors and competitors are not waiting. We must make this a higher priority to avoid negative consequences resulting in job loss, worsening road congestion, and less competitive exports. Some may suggest that we should concentrate federal investment in just a few ports, but we must take a closer look at the diversity of port cargo and the impact of only deepening a few ports. Often a container port doesn’t handle significant bulk cargo, dangerous cargo or refrigerated cargo. Additionally, often smaller ports are located near key U.S. manufacturers to aid in their imports and exports. Each of our 50 states relies on about 15 seaports to handle its imports and exports. Concentrating port activity to a smaller geographic area will result in increased transportation costs and more congestion on roads and rails. Total throughput should not be the only calculation in determining federal investment. The second troubling trend that impacts our ability to be ready for the challenges of the future is the time it takes to complete new projects. Ports are growing increasingly wary of the time it takes to complete a project. The new norm is decades, with costs rising with each delay. There are a multitude of reasons for these delays, including a long, slow approval process, lack of funding which results in small amounts of funding for each project, and lack of resources to maintain expertise at the Corps. We must make port modernization a higher priority in our future funding. Maritime movement of cargo is the most cost-effective way to move cargo, and we should be encouraging this through effective federal project development processes, investments and funding. As our nation recovers from its economic troubles, we know that cargo growth will expand as well. As our nation invests in infrastructure, we must ensure that ports and their needs are high on the list. We are in a critical time for our nation. We face enormous challenges, and ports are making the necessary investments to build and maintain a world-class maritime transportation system which support U.S. jobs, our global competitiveness, and our economy. We need our federal partner to make that commitment, too. We urge your subcommittee to serve as advocates for waterside port infrastructure so that we can meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. </span><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 5pt;">With increasingly larger ships calling the East Coast, it is now more crucial than ever for the United States to invest in its gateway infrastructure. This call for federal investment should come as no surprise. Improving our nation’s waterways for navigation and security harkens back to the birth of our country, when General George Washington assigned such missions to the Continental Army. [7] In the U.S. Constitution, Congress is charged with the task of regulating commerce in Article I, Section 8. Yet, the full authorized depths and widths of U.S. waterway navigation channels are available only 35 percent of the time. [8] Harbor projects take an average of 12 years to complete. The Corps’ cumbersome review procedures are not consistent with the President’s initiative to reduce red tape and streamline preconstruction federal review procedures for major infrastructure “jobs creating” projects. The President’s Aug. 31 directive to five federal agencies ‐ Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Interior and Transportation ‐ called for identification of high priority infrastructure projects for expedited review. This expedited review initiative should be extended to the Army Corps. Additionally, Independent Peer Review – a procedure required by Sec. 2034 of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007 – should not be applied to Corps studies begun prior to the two year period preceding enactment of the law, as expressly stated in Sec. 2034 (h). Because of procedural delay, most East Coast ports are not authorized to dredge to deep‐draft requirements. Harbor project sponsors attempt to wade through the muddied and shifting approval, authorization and appropriation process, and changing requirements are making it increasingly difficult to move forward with these critical projects. In Jacksonville, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recently added an additional level of review by requiring “Harbor Sym modeling” for our city’s deep draft navigation project. This new requirement has not been applied to previous deep draft projects, will increase costs to the federal government and the Jacksonville Port Authority, and will extend the timeline for completion of the project by one year. Any business leader assessing the current situation would quickly determine our country’s process for prioritizing, approving and funding critical infrastructure projects is fundamentally broken.</span></em><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">However, the March update for the FPIP presentation (L2) shows a full one year slip to the USCV-1 mission, with a launch date penciled in for November 30, 2017, followed by a docking on December 2, 2017. The USCV-2 through to USCV-6 are shown to launch at intervals of six months, with a Russian Soyuz penciled in to provide a back up role “in the event the US Crewed Vehicle is unavailable” through to the USCV-4 mission in 2019. The slip is not official and the FPIP presentation is a planning document, meaning its information is preliminary. However, like its Shuttle equivalent – the Flight Assignment Working Group (FAWG) documents (L2) – changes to the schedule always begin at this stage of planning, and almost always become the reality. As to the reason for the slip, sources point to the squeeze on long-term funding projections as the major schedule driver. Also, according to Russian media, NASA began negotiations with Roscosmos in February, with a view to extending their deal to purchase seats on the Russian Soyuz by another year, taking the arrangement into the middle of 2017. A confirmed delay to the USCV flights will impact the ISS in several ways, not least because the USCV missions will carry four crewmembers, meaning that once they dock to the ISS, the crew of the station will be boosted to seven – allowing significant extra research activities to be performed. Notably, one of the crewmembers on the USCV will be Russian – just as one American crewmember will continue to be rotated on the Soyuz. This is done in order to ensure that a US crewmember is always present on the ISS, even when no USCV is docked to the station. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">While commercial customers are showing more interest in ULA’s Atlas and Delta vehicles despite their higher prices, the US government is looking for ways to bring down those prices as it tightens its own budgets. In addition to a block buy of those vehicles, the Air Force initiated a “new entrant” program that resulted in awards late last year of two launches to SpaceX, one on a Falcon 9 and the other on the Falcon Heavy. “The prices increased, frankly, due to the market. The market changed,” said Norman of NASA launch contract pricing. NASA is also acutely aware of increasing launch prices and the effect they have on the agency’s science missions. At the Space Studies Board’s Space Science Week meeting in Washington on March 6, Jim Norman, NASA’s director of launch services, noted that prices had gone up, in some cases significantly, between the older NASA Launch Services (NLS) I and current NLS II contracts. “The prices increased, frankly, due to the market. The market changed,” he said, referring to the competition between Boeing’s Delta IV and Lockheed Martin’s Atlas V that ended when the two companies merged those efforts under the ULA joint venture. “We no longer had the competition when NLS I was put into place, nor was the projected demand for satellites and for launches the same.” While the price for “intermediate-class” vehicles was $100–125 million under NLS I, the first such vehicle contracted under NLS II, an Atlas V for the MAVEN Mars mission, cost $187 million. Norman, in his presentation, addressed another issue about launch vehicle pricing: why NASA’s prices appear to be so much higher than for other customers. For example, while SpaceX markets the Falcon 9 at $54 million per launch, NASA’s first satellite launch contract (excluding ISS resupply missions) for the vehicle, for the Jason-3 Earth sciences satellite, was announced as $82 million last year. The difference, Norman explained, is that the awards made under the NLS contract vehicles include additional services, including payload services and mission-unique requirements, that go above the list price of the launch vehicle. “Under our NLS II contract we actually have some very good terms,” he said, including “grace days” that allow the payload to be up to several months late without any penalty. “It is true that NLS prices are higher than what you might be able to see on the Internet. You don’t necessarily get everything that you necessarily need to attain orbit with that pricing.” </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Obama tried to energize the space program by encouraging entrepreneurship. But his privatization model needs to be recalibrated. SpaceX, Boeing and Sierra Nevada Corp. are developing space vehicles to carry crews, but since most of their money comes from NASA, not venture capitalists, the space agency’s budget cuts hinder their progress. Mike Griffin, who ran NASA during the Bush administration, says the private space companies need an incentive beyond dwindling federal funds. Instead of limiting them to developing craft that, like the mothballed space shuttles, achieve only low-Earth orbit, give them a more lucrative goal, he says. Griffin told reporters in Huntsville, Ala., home of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, that missions to supply the International Space Station are not “a big enough or long-lasting enough market” to attract capital for commercial space enterprises. He said a more viable market would result if a moon base were created for deep-space missions. That idea was nixed last year when Obama said that instead of a return to the moon, he would prefer to invest in a new propulsion system that could take men to Mars by 2037. That approach seems logical, as Star Trek’s Mr. Spock would say. But it will be hard to ever reach Mars without a new approach to NASA’s budget. The sequester will trim its $17.8 billion budget by $894 million. In the current budget climate, that seems about right. With no new funding available, or even wise, it’s time to look at other alternatives.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">(CNN) -- A new era in space exploration dawned Tuesday as a slender rocket shot into the dark Florida sky before sunrise, carrying the first private spacecraft bound for the International Space Station. &quot;We're now back on the brink of a new future, a future that embraces the innovation the private sector brings to the table,&quot; NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said. &quot;The significance of this day cannot be overstated.&quot; The unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 3:44 a.m., carrying 1,300 pounds of food, clothing and scientific experiments on a demonstration mission to gauge the company's ability to safely and efficiently deliver supplies to astronauts staffing the orbiting station. Opinion: Private space travel -- A new era begins? If successful, the test could open the door to a wave of commercial exploitation of space. Dragon roars toward ISS CNN Explains: Commercial space flight Why SpaceX launch is important SpaceX makes history Tuesday's launch marks the culmination of six years of preparation to bring commercial flights to the space station following the retirement of NASA's space shuttle fleet last year. It's backed by entrepreneur Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal. Stellar week for SpaceX founder Elon Musk &quot;Every bit of adrenaline in my body released at that moment,&quot; Musk said of the launch, in a statement released by NASA. &quot;People were really giving it their all. For us, it was like winning the Super Bowl.&quot; The rocket launched without a hitch following a flawless countdown that came three days after a faulty valve on one of the rocket's engines forced a last-second postponement. Its solar array panels deployed later Tuesday. At 180 feet tall and 12 feet in diameter, the Falcon 9 rocket is tiny in comparison to the football-field-long Saturn V rockets that carried Apollo spacecraft into orbit. It carries the company's Dragon cargo capsule capable of carrying 13,228 pounds of supplies into orbit, the company said. The capsule is scheduled to perform a series of maneuvers that should bring it within reach of the space station's robotic arm on Friday. If NASA gives the go-ahead, the crew will use the arm to attach the capsule to the station and begin unloading supplies, according to SpaceX. It will remain attached to the station for two weeks before it plummets back into the atmosphere and splashes into the Pacific Ocean off the California coast, according to SpaceX. Read more about the launch on CNN's Light Years blog The cargo manifest for the trip includes 674 pounds of food, clothing and miscellaneous supplies, 46 pounds of supplies for use in science experiments, 271 pounds of cargo bags for use in future flights and 22 pounds of computer equipment. It will return with science experiments, hardware and used gear. Cremated human remains were placed in the second stage of the Falcon and will orbit the Earth. Celestis Inc. charges families $2,995 to launch 1 gram of remains in this type of memorial spaceflight. NASA's Internet tool SkyWatch is providing information on viewing the Dragon from Earth. The cargo capsule will continue its orbit Wednesday as it travels toward the space station. The launch is an important step for NASA and the United States, which currently has no means of independently reaching space. NASA relies on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit. &quot;What's really important is not control, as much as it is the fact that the United States will once again be in the lead, will be providing our own vehicles to take our own astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station,&quot; Bolden said. &quot;It's fine to rely on partners, but that's not where the greatest nation in the world wants to be.&quot; White House science adviser John P. Holdren also hailed the launch. &quot;Every launch into space is a thrilling event, but this one is especially exciting because it represents the potential of a new era in American spaceflight,&quot; he said. &quot;Partnering with U.S. companies such as SpaceX to provide cargo and eventually crew service to the International Space Station is a cornerstone of the president's plan for maintaining America's leadership in space.&quot;</span><br />

<strong>But no launch pads makes launch costs high, means limited private space ventures</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Yesterday, we published an article on how launch pad shortages are causing customers to bundle satellites to reduce the number of launches. Unfortunately, this creates a vicious cycle. The ultimate solution to the launch-pad problem is to transition from expendable launch vehicles to reusable vehicles, which can be prepped quickly and don’t spend a lot of time on the pad. But bundling satellites onto larger rockets reduces the number of launches, which reduces the apparent demand and harms the business case for reusable vehicles. As a result, the pad problem continues. Vicious cycles like this have prevented the development of reusable launch vehicles for 40 years. Right now, NASA is contributing to another vicious cycle in a big way (both figuratively and literally) with the development of the Space Launch System. An ambitious deep-space exploration backed by NASA, could create a market for many hundreds of smalls launches, or it could support the development a superheavy launch system like SLS – but it can’t afford both. At the same, the development of SLS will mean that any exploration hardware NASA develops will be designed to fit on SLS, and impossible to launch on smaller, more economical reusable vehicles which might be developed in the private sector. Thus, the Space Launch System threatens to lock NASA into high launch costs for another generation while depriving private industry of the chance to compete for a market that could bring about a revolution in launch costs. If America is to have a meaningful future in space, we need to break out of these vicious cycles. The solution is not, as some believe, to get the US government to buy a handful of flights to the International Space Station. (There’s a good reason why NASA’s COTS and CCDEV programs are funding expendable vehicles, not reusables.) To make real progress, we need thousands of launches. </span><br />

<strong>The ISS causes settlement, and tech progress makes it possible</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One of the most broadly recognized objectives of the ISS is articulated on the NASA Exploration Web site: its “use as a test bed for technology development, demonstration, and problem resolution in the areas of life support, fire safety, power, propulsion, thermal management, etc.” 34 The ISS provides the unique ability to carry out this important task. If the United States intends to undertake long-duration exploration missions, it is essential that NASA collects empirical data on the maintainability and availability of space hardware systems. This can only be accomplished with operating experience, and the ISS offers this capability. NASA has already been able to develop and refine ventilation systems, air filtration systems, water recycling systems, and oxygen producing systems, to name only a few. When hardware components malfunction, the ISS crews have demonstrated creativity, collaboration, and teamwork in order to carry out repairs in orbit. This has led to the development of new repair techniques and has provided valuable lessons on what does and does not work in space. 35 The benefits of having a relatively close “island in space” where systems can be tested are evident in the experience with the Remote Power Control Mechanism. This component, similar to a circuit breaker, is used frequently in space systems. When this component malfunctioned, NASA was able to study the problem and create an improved version. Thousands of replacements were shipped to the ISS and installed. Had this problem occurred on a vehicle destined for the Moon or Mars, studying the problem, creating replacements, and carrying out repairs would have been much more difficult, if not impossible. 36 Research on humans in space is at least as vital as research on space hardware. The ISS offers the only option for research on the effect of long-duration spaceflight on humans. The Vision for Space Exploration mentions the critical role of the ISS to “understanding the effects of space environments on the human body, developing techniques for mitigating these hazards, minimizing the logistical burden of supporting humans far from Earth, and addressing remote medical emergencies.” 37 Extensive research is being done to create countermeasures to the bone and muscle loss astronauts experience during long-duration flights. Research on medical devices and procedures is also essential. Similarly, research and advances in radiation exposure and protection will be vital to the safety of astronauts on future exploration missions. Human factors research associated with long duration space travel is also critically important. For example, research is now being carried out wherein an astronaut keeps journals that will be analyzed to help better understand the effects of living in an isolated and confined environment for extended periods. 38 Research is also being carried out on crew member and crew-ground interactions. Preliminary findings from this experiment indicate that crew members improve in mood and social climate over the course of their missions as they adapt to the new environment. 39 Research carried out on ISS allows the United States to be better prepared for its future exploration endeavors.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Costs for the development of low-cost orbital passenger transportation systems are of the order of 10 billion Euros [7–9]. Even 10 times this amount would be less than 5 years of space agencies' current budgets. The economic benefits seem sure to greatly outweigh the cost, due to the much larger commercial markets that would be created as a result, in contrast to the very small markets created with 1 trillion Euro-equivalents invested in satellite and launch vehicle manufacturing to date.That is, there seem to be no technical reasons why rapid growth of space travel services could not be realised: the technology has existed for decades, and companies wishing to develop vehicles are hampered by only one obstacle, which is the easiest for governments to solve—lack of funds. Hence the rest of this paper assumes that over coming decades households will start to purchase space ﬂight services, which will grow to reach 5 million passengers/year, out of a worldwide middle-class population of more than 2 billion people, a few decades from now.Starting from today, in order to achieve the scale of activity shown in Fig. 1 over the next 30 years, government funding equivalent to about 10% of space agencies' budgets, or some 2 billion Euros/year would probably suffice to stimulate private investment in reusable orbital passenger vehicle manufacturing and operations. Thereafter most of the funding would come from private companies, just as airline and hotel companies finance their own growth today. 1.1. Implications of launch cost reduction Reducing the cost of space travel to 1% of existing launch vehicles' costs, in combination with the growth of a new consumer service market in space, would greatly aid the growth of many commercial space activities, thereby creating numerous new business opportunities both on Earth and in space. This process is already at work on a small scale in relation to sub-orbital ﬂight services: in addition to a large number of travel companies acting as agents for sub-orbital ﬂights (including JTB, the largest travel company in Japan), Zero-G Corporation supplies parabolic ﬂight services, Bigelow Aerospace is developing the first space hotel, Spaceport Associates advises on spaceport design, Orbital Outfitters Inc. supplies customised ﬂight suits, spaceports are being developed in several places, and several support organisations have been established. All of this activity is occurring some years before the first high-priced services even start, so a much wider range of different space travel-related businesses are sure to grow in future. In the case of orbital services there will be an even wider range of companies with much larger revenues, including companies supplying various services to orbiting hotels. These will include services which terrestrial hotels typically purchase today, such as catering, cleaning, accounting, entertainment, plus such additional services as space-based window maintenance, air supply, solargenerated electricity, water supply, waste disposal services, and others. As activities in orbit expand progressively, they could grow to include use of materials extracted from the Moon and near-Earth asteroids and cometoids, of which the potential has been researched for several decades [11]. Due to the much higher cost of activities in orbit than on the surface of the Earth, orbiting hotels seem likely to create the first market for non-terrestrial materials like ice, water, oxygen and hydrogen, as discussed in [12]. Another potentially major space-based industry, which has been held back for 40 years by high launch costs, is the supply of solar power from space to Earth. Although the potential of this system was recognised in studies by the US Department of Energy in the late 1970s, and confirmed in the 1990s [13], total funding has remained minimal. However, progress could be rapid once launch costs fall to a few percent of ELV costs [14]. Hence, as passenger space travel activities expand to large scale, a growing range of manufacturing activities in Earth orbit, on the lunar surface and elsewhere could develop spontaneously, driven by entrepreneurial effort to exploit new business opportunities opened up by the growth of new commercial markets in Earth orbit. These will in turn open the door to the large-scale space activities described in [11]. The growth of orbital passenger space travel to several million passengers/year over a few decades would represent a direct commercial turnover of some 100 billion Euros/year. In such a scenario of rapid growth, annual investment in new facilities, research and development might add the same amount again. Indeed, having reached such a scale, there would be no foreseeable limit to further growth—in particular it need not be limited, like terrestrial activities, by environmental or political constraints. Quite apart from the numerous opportunities which such a scenario offers for growth of the space industry, it also offers great potential benefits for humanity, in several different fields, as discussed in turn in the following. 2. Employment In most countries, most of the population do not have economically significant land holdings, and so employment is the economic basis of social life, providing income and enabling people to have stable family lives. The high level of unemployment in most countries today is therefore not only wasteful, it also causes widespread poverty and unhappiness, and is socially damaging, creating further problems for the future. One reason for investing in the development of passenger space travel, therefore, is that it could create major new fields of employment, capable of growing as far into the future as we can see. As of 2001, the hotel, catering and tourism sector was estimated to employ 60 million people world-wide, or 3% of the global workforce, and 6% of Europeans [15]. Hence we can estimate that the passenger air travel industry, including airlines, airports, hotels and other tourismrelated work, indirectly employs 10–20 times the number of people employed in aircraft manufacturing alone. Likewise, passenger space travel services could presumably create employment many times that in launch vehicle manufacturing—in vehicle operations and maintenance, at spaceports, in orbiting hotels, in many companies supplying these, in services such as staff training, certification and insurance, and in a growing range of related businesses. This possibility is particularly valuable because high unemployment, both in richer and poorer countries, has been the major economic problem throughout the world for decades. Consequently the growth of such a major new market for advanced aerospace technology and services seems highly desirable, as discussed further in [16]. By contrast, in recent years employment in the traditional space industry in USA and Europe has been shrinking fast: a 2003 report by the US Federal Aviation Administration stated that employment in launch vehicle manufacturing and services fell from 28,617 in 1999 to 4828 in 2002, while employment in satellite manufacturing fell from 57,372 to 31,262 [17]. Likewise, European space industry employment fell by 20% from 1995 to 2005; the major space engineering company Astrium cut 3300 staff from 2003 through 2006; and in 2005 alone, European prime contractors cut 13.5% of their staff or some 2400 people [18]. Unfortunately, the probability of space industry employment recovering soon is low, because satellite manufacturing and launch services face both low demand and rapidly growing competition from India and China, where costs are significantly lower. It is therefore positively bizarre that government policy-makers have declined to even discuss the subject of investing in the development of passenger space travel services, and have permitted no significant investment to date out of the nearly 20 billion Euro-equivalents which space agencies spend every year! This is despite the very positive 1998 NASA report &quot;General Public Space Travel and Tourism&quot; [19], and the NASA-funded 2002 &quot;ASCENT&quot; study referred to above [2,3]. In the capitalist system, companies compete to reduce costs since this directly increases their profits. However, reducing the number of employees through improving productivity raises unemployment, except to the extent that new jobs are created in new and growing industries. In an economy with a lack of new industries, increasing so-called &quot;economic efficiency&quot; creates unemployment, which is a social cost. In this situation, governments concerned for public welfare should either increase the rate of creation of new industries, and/or slow the elimination of jobs, at least until the growth of new industries revives, or other desirable counter-measures, such as new social arrangements, are introduced. These may include more leisure time, job-sharing, and other policies designed to prevent the growth of a permanent &quot;under-class&quot; of unemployed and &quot;working poor&quot;—a development which would pose a major threat to western civilisation. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The major source of social friction, including international friction, has surely always been unequal access to resources. People ﬁght to control the valuable resources on and under the land, and in and under the sea. The natural resources of Earth are limited in quantity, and economically accessible resources even more so. As the population grows, and demand grows for a higher material standard of living, industrial activity grows exponentially. The threat of resources becoming scarce has led to the concept of ‘‘Resource Wars’’. Having begun long ago with wars to control the gold and diamonds of Africa and South America, and oil in the Middle East, the current phase is at centre stage of world events today [37]. A particular danger of ‘‘resource wars’’ is that, if the general public can be persuaded to support them, they may become impossible to stop as resources become increasingly scarce. Many commentators have noted the similarity of the language of US and UK government advocates of ‘‘war on terror’’ to the language of the novel ‘‘1984’’ which describes a dystopian future of endless, fraudulent war in which citizens are reduced to slaves. 7.1. Expansion into near-Earth space is the only alternative to endless ‘‘resource wars’’ As an alternative to the ‘‘resource wars’’ already devastating many countries today, opening access to the unlimited resources of near-Earth space could clearly facilitate world peace and security. The US National Security Space Ofﬁce, at the start of its report on the potential of space-based solar power (SSP) published in early 2007, stated: ‘‘Expanding human populations and declining natural resources are potential sources of local and strategic conﬂict in the 21st Century, and many see energy as the foremost threat to national security’’ [38]. The report ended by encouraging urgent research on the feasibility of SSP: ‘‘Considering the timescales that are involved, and the exponential growth of population and resource pressures within that same strategic period, it is imperative that this work for ‘‘drilling up’’ vs. drilling down for energy security begins immediately’’ [38]. Although the use of extra-terrestrial resources on a substantial scale may still be some decades away, it is important to recognise that simply acknowledging its feasibility using known technology is the surest way of ending the threat of resource wars. That is, if it is assumed that the resources available for human use are limited to those on Earth, then it can be argued that resource wars are inescapable [22,37]. If, by contrast, it is assumed that the resources of space are economically accessible, this not only eliminates the need for resource wars, it can also preserve the beneﬁts of civilisation which are being eroded today by ‘‘resource war-mongers’’, most notably the governments of the ‘‘Anglo-Saxon’’ countries and their ‘‘neo-con’’ advisers. It is also worth noting that the $1 trillion that these have already committed to wars in the Middle-East in the 21st century is orders of magnitude more than the public investment needed to aid companies sufﬁciently to start the commercial use of space resources. Industrial and ﬁnancial groups which proﬁt from monopolistic control of terrestrial supplies of various natural resources, like those which proﬁt from wars, have an economic interest in protecting their proﬁtable situation. However, these groups’ continuing proﬁts are justiﬁed neither by capitalism nor by democracy: they could be preserved only by maintaining the pretence that use of space resources is not feasible, and by preventing the development of low-cost space travel. Once the feasibility of low-cost space travel is understood, ‘‘resource wars’’ are clearly foolish as well as tragic. A visiting extra-terrestrial would be pityingly amused at the foolish antics of homo sapiens using longrange rockets to ﬁght each other over dwindling terrestrial resources—rather than using the same rockets to travel in space and have the use of all the resources they need! 7.2. High return in safety from extra-terrestrial settlement Investment in low-cost orbital access and other space infrastructure will facilitate the establishment of settlements on the Moon, Mars, asteroids and in man-made space structures. In the ﬁrst phase, development of new regulatory infrastructure in various Earth orbits, including property/usufruct rights, real estate, mortgage ﬁnancing and insurance, trafﬁc management, pilotage, policing and other services will enable the population living in Earth orbits to grow very large. Such activities aimed at making near-Earth space habitable are the logical extension of humans’ historical spread over the surface of the Earth. As trade spreads through near-Earth space, settlements are likely to follow, of which the inhabitants will add to the wealth of different cultures which humans have created in the many different environments in which they live. Success of such extra-terrestrial settlements will have the additional beneﬁt of reduc[e]ing the danger of human extinction due to planet-wide or cosmic accidents [27]. These horrors include both man-made disasters such as nuclear war, plagues or growing pollution, and natural disasters such as super-volcanoes or asteroid impact. It is hard to think of any objective that is more important than preserving peace. Weapons developed in recent decades are so destructive, and have such horriﬁc, long-term side-effects that their use should be discouraged as strongly as possible by the international community. Hence, reducing the incentive to use these weapons by rapidly developing the ability to use space-based resources on a large scale is surely equally important [11,16]. The achievement of this depends on low space travel costs which, at the present time, appear to be achievable only through the development of a vigorous space tourism industry. 8. Summary As discussed above, if space travel services had started during the 1950s, the space industry would be enormously more developed than it is today. Hence the failure to develop passenger space travel has seriously distorted the path taken by humans’ technological and economic development since WW2, away from the path which would have been followed if capitalism and democracy operated as intended. Technological know-how which could have been used to supply services which are known to be very popular with a large proportion of the population has not been used for that purpose, while waste and suffering due to the unemployment and environmental damage caused by the resulting lack of new industrial opportunities have increased. In response, policies should be implemented urgently to correct this error, and to catch up with the possibilities for industrial and economic growth that have been ignored for so long. This policy renewal is urgent because of the growing dangers of unemployment, economic stagnation, environmental pollution, educational and cultural decline, resource wars and loss of civil liberties which face civilisation today. In order to achieve the necessary progress there is a particular need for collaboration between those working in the two ﬁelds of civil aviation and civil space. Although the word ‘‘aerospace’’ is widely used, it is largely a misnomer since these two ﬁelds are in practice quite separate. True ‘‘aerospace’’ collaboration to realise passenger space travel will develop the wonderful profusion of possibilities outlined above. 8.1. Heaven or hell on Earth? As discussed above, the claim that the Earth’s resources are running out is used to justify wars which may never end: present-day rhetoric about ‘‘the long war’’ or ‘‘100 years war’’ in Iraq and Afghanistan are current examples. If political leaders do not change their viewpoint, the recent aggression by the rich ‘‘Anglo-Saxon’’ countries, and their cutting back of traditional civil liberties, are ominous for the future. However, this ‘‘hellish’’ vision of endless war is based on an assumption about a single number—the future cost of travel to orbit—about which a different assumption leads to a ‘‘heavenly’’ vision of peace and ever-rising living standards for everyone. If this cost stays above 10,000 Euros/kg, where it has been unchanged for nearly 50 years, the prospects for humanity are bleak. But if humans make the necessary effort, and use the tiny amount of resources needed to develop vehicles for passenger space travel, then this cost will fall to 100 Euros/kg, the use of extra-terrestrial resources will become economic, and arguments for resource wars will evaporate entirely. The main reason why this has not yet happened seems to be lack of understanding of the myriad opportunities by investors and policy-makers. Now that the potential to catch up half a century of delay in the growth of space travel is becoming understood, continuing to spend 20 billion Euro-equivalents/year on government space activities, while continuing to invest nothing in developing passenger space travel, would be a gross failure of economic policy, and strongly contrary to the economic and social interests of the public. Correcting this error, even after such a costly delay, will ameliorate many problems in the world today. As this policy error is corrected, and investment in proﬁtable space projects grows rapidly in coming years, we can look forward to a growing world-wide boom. Viewed as a whole, humans’ industrial activities have been seriously underperforming for decades, due to the failure to exploit these immensely promising ﬁelds of activity. The tens of thousands of unemployed space engineers in Russia, America and Europe alone are a huge waste. The potential manpower in rapidly developing India and China is clearly vast. The hundreds of millions of disappointed young people who have been taught that they cannot travel in space are another enormous wasted resource. We do not know for certain when the above scenario will be realised. However, it could have such enormous value that considerable expenditure is justiﬁed in order to study its feasibility in detail [5]. At the very least, vigorous investment by both private and public sectors in a range of different sub-orbital passenger vehicle projects and related businesses is highly desirable. Fortunately, the ambitious and rapid investment by the Indian and Chinese governments in growing space capabilities may ﬁnally jolt the space industries of Russia, America, Europe and Japan out of their long economic stagnation, and induce them to apply their accumulated know-how to economically valuable activities—notably supplying widely popular travel services to the general public.</span><br />

<strong>A reduction of the risk of extinction by 1 millionth of 1 percent outweighs</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Holding probability constant, risks become more serious as we move toward the upper-right region of figure 2. For any fixed probability, existential risks are thus more serious than other risk categories. But just how much more serious might not be intuitively obvious. One might think we could get a grip on how bad an existential catastrophe would be by considering some of the worst historical disasters we can think of—such as the two world wars, the Spanish flu pandemic, or the Holocaust—and then imagining something just a bit worse. Yet if we look at global population statistics over time, we find that these horrible events of the past century fail to register (figure 3). Figure 3: World population over the last century. Calamities such as the Spanish flu pandemic, the two world wars, and the Holocaust scarcely register. (If one stares hard at the graph, one can perhaps just barely make out a slight temporary reduction in the rate of growth of the world population during these events.) But even this reflection fails to bring out the seriousness of existential risk. What makes existential catastrophes especially bad is not that they would show up robustly on a plot like the one in figure 3, causing a precipitous drop in world population or average quality of life. Instead, their significance lies primarily in the fact that they would destroy the future. The philosopher Derek Parfit made a similar point with the following thought experiment: I believe that if we destroy mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people think. Compare three outcomes: (1) Peace. (2) A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world’s existing population. (3) A nuclear war that kills 100%. (2) would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of these two differences? Most people believe that the greater difference is between (1) and (2). I believe that the difference between (2) and (3) is very much greater. … The Earth will remain habitable for at least another billion years. Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If we do not destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny fraction of the whole of civilized human history. The difference between (2) and (3) may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of this history. If we compare this possible history to a day, what has occurred so far is only a fraction of a second. (10: 453-454) To calculate the loss associated with an existential catastrophe, we must consider how much value would come to exist in its absence. It turns out that the ultimate potential for Earth-originating intelligent life is literally astronomical. One gets a large number even if one confines one’s consideration to the potential for biological human beings living on Earth. If we suppose with Parfit that our planet will remain habitable for at least another billion years, and we assume that at least one billion people could live on it sustainably, then the potential exist for at least 1018 human lives. These lives could also be considerably better than the average contemporary human life, which is so often marred by disease, poverty, injustice, and various biological limitations that could be partly overcome through continuing technological and moral progress. To calculate the loss associated with an existential catastrophe, we must consider how much value would come to exist in its absence. It turns out that the ultimate potential for Earth-originating intelligent life is literally astronomical. One gets a large number even if one confines one’s consideration to the potential for biological human beings living on Earth. If we suppose with Parfit that our planet will remain habitable for at least another billion years, and we assume that at least one billion people could live on it sustainably, then the potential exist for at least 10^18 human lives. These lives could also be considerably better than the average contemporary human life, which is so often marred by disease, poverty, injustice, and various biological limitations that could be partly overcome through continuing technological and moral progress. However, the relevant figure is not how many people could live on Earth but how many descendants we could have in total. One lower bound of the number of biological human life-years in the future accessible universe (based on current cosmological estimates) is 10^34 years.[10] Another estimate, which assumes that future minds will be mainly implemented in computational hardware instead of biological neuronal wetware, produces a lower bound of 10^54 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years (or 10^71 basic computational operations).(4)[11] If we make the less conservative assumption that future civilizations could eventually press close to the absolute bounds of known physics (using some as yet unimagined technology), we get radically higher estimates of the amount of computation and memory storage that is achievable and thus of the number of years of subjective experience that could be realized.[12] Even if we use the most conservative of these estimates, which entirely ignores the possibility of space colonization and software minds, we find that the expected loss of an existential catastrophe is greater than the value of 10^18 human lives. This implies that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one millionth of one percentage point is at least ten times the value of a billion human lives. The more technologically comprehensive estimate of 1054 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years (or 1052 lives of ordinary length) makes the same point even more starkly. Even if we give this allegedly lower bound on the cumulative output potential of a technologically mature civilization a mere 1% chance of being correct, we find that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred billion times as much as a billion human lives. One might consequently argue that even the tiniest reduction of existential risk has an expected value greater than that of the definite provision of any “ordinary” good, such as the direct benefit of saving 1 billion lives. And, further, that the absolute value of the indirect effect of saving 1 billion lives on the total cumulative amount of existential risk—positive or negative—is almost certainly larger than the positive value of the direct benefit of such an action.[13] </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Deadly bacteria that have spent time in space are already on Earth—but instead of killing humans, they might just save lives. Scientists are using bacteria cultivated on the International Space Station to help develop vaccines that experts say could revolutionize the medical field. In 1998, researchers began studying how microbes such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and yeast behaved in space because NASA wanted to be able to keep astronauts safe in the closed space station environment. What they found, specifically with certain types of bacteria, was surprising, says Tara Ruttley, NASA's associate program scientist for the International Space Station. [See Spectacular Snapshots of Space] &quot;Bacteria can either respond in microgravity by sitting there and doing nothing, or they can become more aggressive and virulent,&quot; meaning they reproduce and evolve to cause disease more readily, she says. But that property of bacteria allows scientists to study exactly why certain bacteria, such as salmonella and MRSA, make people sick. Scientists aren't exactly sure why certain bacteria become more virulent in space, but Ruttley says they believe it might be a stress response to being put into a low-gravity environment. But whatever the reason, studying bacteria that have spent time in space can make it easier for scientists to develop defenses. &quot;If you know the gene that makes bacteria more aggressive, you can build a defense against it,&quot; she says. Last week, William Gerstenmaier, NASA's head of human explorations and operations, told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that medical discoveries and vaccines developed on the International Space Station could help the United States &quot;create a new economy based on space-based research.&quot; &quot;It's like when we went to Africa to look for new plant species to use for drugs,&quot; he said. &quot;We can create a new industry with this.&quot; [NASA: Private U.S. Spacecraft Could Save Agency Millions] Cheryl Nickerson and Roy Curtiss, professors at Arizona State University's Biodesign Institute, are leading the charge. They are studying salmonella that has spent time in space, in an attempt to &quot;turn it from foe to friend&quot; by crippling the disease-causing genes and replacing them with ones that protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacteria that causes meningitis, pneumonia, and many other diseases. In space, &quot;we can unveil many of [salmonella's] responses that are happening here on earth but are masked by gravity,&quot; Nickerson says. &quot;We've been able to identify missing info and use the new information to understand how [salmonella] causes disease … what you have now is a discovery platform that … can be used to create new vaccine technologies.&quot; Nickerson and Curtiss also believe that a vaccine developed on Earth, when flown to space, could become more potent if it spends time in orbit. ASU's institute recently finished an experiment in which they kept a strain of their salmonella-based vaccine in space for six weeks and compared it with the same vaccine strain developed on Earth. &quot;It's too early to give any updates, but we have a lot of data we're very excitedly digging into as we speak,&quot; she says. Although her initial experiments have been promising, Nickerson says people need to be wary of getting too far ahead of themselves—she says it'll likely be 8-10 years before her vaccine or any others developed using bacteria that spent time in space are ready for commercial sale. [Stolen NASA Laptop Contained International Space Station Codes] &quot;I've heard people promise a translational product, and that's not what a responsible scientist will do. I can't guarantee a whole lot of things,&quot; she says. &quot;I believe, but cannot guarantee that we're going to have next-generation breakthroughs. I think it'll happen in infectious disease, cancer, aging, and visual disorders … but we have to be careful about making claims.&quot; But many companies are already banking on the promise of developing medical breakthroughs on the International Space Station. Ruttley says NASA's research on the human body has already led to greater understanding about bone, muscle, and heart atrophy, vision impairments, and more. Mike Gold, director of D.C. operations and business growth at Bigelow Aerospace, a company developing commercial spaceflight solutions, says that private industry's ability to go to space will speed up research. &quot;We're underestimating the impact of [microgravity research and development] on our economy,&quot; he told the Senate panel last week, adding that researchers at Johns Hopkins University are interested in developing cancer drugs in space and other companies are studying treatments for muscular dystrophy and osteoporosis based on space research. &quot;The companies and countries that have an expertise in microgravity manufacturing will be the economic giants of the future, and the first place we're going to see that is in pharmaceuticals,&quot; he told U.S. News in a separate interview. But he says researchers need to be able to send experiments to space more often before any treatments become a reality. &quot;Scientists need to be able to repeat an experiment a number of times,&quot; he says. &quot;We can't fly an experiment once and then wait five years to fly it again. To become a reality, we need to allow researchers to fly their experiments numerous times to get results.&quot; </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">It is a considerable comfort and undoubtedly a key to our survival that, so far, the main lines of defense against this threat have not depended on explicit policies or organized efforts. In the long course of evolution, the human body has developed physical barriers and a biochemical immune system whose sophistication and effectiveness exceed anything we could design or as yet even fully understand. But evolution is a sword that cuts both ways: New diseases emerge, while old diseases mutate and adapt. Throughout history, there have been epidemics during which human immunity has broken down on an epic scale. An infectious agent believed to have been the plague bacterium killed an estimated 20 million people over a four-year period in the fourteenth century, including nearly one-quarter of Western Europe's population at the time. Since its recognized appearance in 1981, some 20 variations of the HIV virus have infected an estimated 29.4 million worldwide, with 1.5 million people currently dying of AIDS each year. Malaria, tuberculosis, and cholera - once thought to be under control - are now making a comeback. As we enter the twenty-first century, changing conditions have enhanced the potential for widespread contagion. The rapid growth rate of the total world population, the unprecedented freedom of movement across international borders, and scientific advances that expand the capability for the deliberate manipulation of pathogens are all cause for worry that the problem might be greater in the future than it has ever been in the past. The threat of infectious pathogens is not just an issue of public health, but a fundamental security problem for the species as a whole.</span><br />

 <strong>Spaceflight capabilities are failing, we need an incentive for companies to develop to become a space industrial power</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Point 1: America must recapture world leadership in commercial space transportation. We are now fourth in the world in commercial space transportation, behind Russia, Europe, and Ukraine. China and India are coming on fast. This is completely unacceptable. The loss of these markets is an economic tragedy. With a radical reduction in launch costs, and high flight rates, we are a next generation space industrial power. Without it, we are not. If this was only about jobs and profits, I would say let the markets decide. But this is a national security problem. Our national security is harmed because US launch vehicles are more expensive, and less reliable, because they fly less often. Our national security is harmed because of the hollowing out of the space industrial base. Our national security is harmed when it depends on Russian rocket engines. Becoming number one again in commercial space transportation is an easy first goal. We may already be on a path to achieve this goal because of the American entrepreneurial spirit. But we need to declare this an important goal, and take effective action to see it through. Point 2: We should set the national goal of low-cost, reliable access to space—an order of magnitude reduction in cost, and an order of magnitude increase in reliability. Low-cost access is a critical national and economic /security issue. It is the one key point to becoming a Next Generation Space Industrial Power. It is the one key point to expanding human civilization across the solar system. With a radical reduction in launch costs, and high flight rates, we are a next generation space industrial power. Without it, we are not. Whichever country achieves low-cost and reliable access to space first will start a virtuous cycle that will deliver tremendous national and economic security benefits. This nation will dominate the carrying trade, which will create new markets, which will drive new technologies and new capabilities, which will increase flight rates and lower launch costs, which will allow us to expand into more new markets and so on. Low-cost access is Mahanian theory in action. At NASA, in the summer of 2011, a team I led that included all mission directorates and all centers unequivocally concluded that low-cost and reliable access to space was the number one priority from among all emerging commercial space opportunities. This NASA team came to two other critical conclusions: American industry can build a two-stage reusable launch vehicles with today's technology. Technology was the primary barrier forty years ago. Technology is not the primary barrier today. The primary problem is that we can’t close a traditional business case. The flight rate from existing markets does not justify the investment. In another business, private risk-taking capital would take over at this point, and make the investment. But the huge size of the required investment, combined with the speculative nature of the future markets, makes the risks far too high for any private investor. This has much in common with the Transcontinental Railroad, which could not be justified as a pure commercial investment. Both are examples of market failure at the national strategic level. The key to closing the business case is not for government to take over design and development. It is not loan guarantees. It is not a multibillion-dollar 2nd Generation RLV technology program. The key is to stimulate on the demand side, to create incentives that drive up the flight rate and close the business case for reusable systems. </span><br />

<strong>It fuels perception of decline - lack of a strong civil space commitment kills credibility and cooperation</strong><br />
<strong>(Stone 11)</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Recently, Lou Friedman wrote a piece where he articulated his view on what American leadership in space means to many and what it means to him (see “American leadership”, The Space Review, February 14, 2011). I would like to respond by providing some context that I think is lacking from the discussion. The United States’ goal should be leadership through spacefaring capabilities, in all sectors. First, let me start by saying that I agree with Mr. Friedman’s assertion that “American leadership is a phrase we hear bandied about a lot in political circles in the United States, as well as in many space policy discussions.” I have been at many space forums in my career where I’ve heard the phrase used by speakers of various backgrounds, political ideologies, and nation. Like Mr. Friedman states, “it has many different meanings, most derived from cultural or political biases, some of them contradictory”. This is true: many nations, as well as organizations and individuals worldwide, have different preferences and views as to what American leadership in space is, and/or what it should be. He also concludes that paragraph by stating that American leadership in space could also be viewed as “synonymous with American… hegemony”. I again will agree that some people within the United Stats and elsewhere have this view toward American leadership. However, just because people believe certain viewpoints regarding American leadership does not mean that those views are accurate assessments or definitions of what actions demonstrate US leadership in the space medium. When it comes to space exploration and development, including national security space and commercial, I would disagree somewhat with Mr. Friedman’s assertion that space is “often” overlooked in “foreign relations and geopolitical strategies”. My contention is that while space is indeed overlooked in national grand geopolitical strategies by many in national leadership, space is used as a tool for foreign policy and relations more often than not. In fact, I will say that the US space program has become less of an effort for the advancement of US space power and exploration, and is used more as a foreign policy tool to “shape” the strategic environment to what President Obama referred to in his National Security Strategy as “The World We Seek”. Using space to shape the strategic environment is not a bad thing in and of itself. What concerns me with this form of “shaping” is that we appear to have changed the definition of American leadership as a nation away from the traditional sense of the word. Some seem to want to base our future national foundations in space using the important international collaboration piece as the starting point. Traditional national leadership would start by advancing United States’ space power capabilities and strategies first, then proceed toward shaping the international environment through allied cooperation efforts. The United States’ goal should be leadership through spacefaring capabilities, in all sectors. Achieving and maintaining such leadership through capability will allow for increased space security and opportunities for all and for America to lead the international space community by both technological and political example. As other nations pursue excellence in space, we should take our responsibilities seriously, both from a national capability standpoint, and as country who desires expanded international engagement in space. The world has recognized America as the leaders in space because it demonstrated technological advancement by the Apollo lunar landings, our deep space exploration probes to the outer planets, and deploying national security space missions. We did not become the recognized leaders in astronautics and space technology because we decided to fund billions into research programs with no firm budgetary commitment or attainable goals. We did it because we made a national level decision to do each of them, stuck with it, and achieved exceptional things in manned and unmanned spaceflight. We have allowed ourselves to drift from this traditional strategic definition of leadership in space exploration, rapidly becoming participants in spaceflight rather than the leader of the global space community. One example is shutting down the space shuttle program without a viable domestic spacecraft chosen and funded to commence operations upon retirement of the fleet. We are paying millions to rely on Russia to ferry our astronauts to an International Space Station that US taxpayers paid the lion’s share of the cost of construction. Why would we, as United States citizens and space advocates, settle for this? The current debate on commercial crew and cargo as the stopgap between shuttle and whatever comes next could and hopefully will provide some new and exciting solutions to this particular issue. However, we need to made a decision sooner rather than later. Finally, one other issue that concerns me is the view of the world “hegemony” or “superiority” as dirty words. Some seem to view these words used in policy statements or speeches as a direct threat. In my view, each nation (should they desire) should have freedom of access to space for the purpose of advancing their “security, prestige and wealth” through exploration like we do. However, to maintain leadership in the space environment, space superiority is a worthy and necessary byproduct of the traditional leadership model. If your nation is the leader in space, it would pursue and maintain superiority in their mission sets and capabilities. In my opinion, space superiority does not imply a wall of orbital weapons preventing other nations from access to space, nor does it preclude international cooperation among friendly nations. Rather, it indicates a desire as a country to achieve its goals for national security, prestige, and economic prosperity for its people, and to be known as the best in the world with regards to space technology and astronautics. I can assure you that many other nations with aggressive space programs, like ours traditionally has been, desire the same prestige of being the best at some, if not all, parts of the space pie. Space has been characterized recently as “congested, contested, and competitive”; the quest for excellence is just one part of international space competition that, in my view, is a good and healthy thing. As other nations pursue excellence in space, we should take our responsibilities seriously, both from a national capability standpoint, and as country who desires expanded international engagement in space. If America wants to retain its true leadership in space, it must approach its space programs as the advancement of its national “security, prestige and wealth” by maintaining its edge in spaceflight capabilities and use those demonstrated talents to advance international prestige and influence in the space community. These energies and influence can be channeled to create the international space coalitions of the future that many desire and benefit mankind as well as America. Leadership will require sound, long-range exploration strategies with national and international political will behind it. American leadership in space is not a choice. It is a requirement if we are to truly lead the world into space with programs and objectives “worthy of a great nation”.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Whether or not the US HSF program is actually in retreat depends on one’s point of view. But, as long as the US is not flying humans into space, that point of view is largely irrelevant. What matters in this discussion is the point of view of other nations—and from where they sit, the US suffers from diminished prestige relative to earlier times. It is also seen as a labile partner in cooperative HSF efforts.1 The global response to the release of China’s white paper—evident within 24 hours—suggests there is widespread understanding of (and in some quarters, concern about) at least some of the implications therein. The paper details a methodical approach that builds on what has come before.2 By contrast, when looking to the US for leadership in space, for almost two years other nations have borne witness to a community and a government stuck in a squabble about the merits of “commercial spaceflight” vs. “government spaceflight” or about “Shuttle” vs. “future programs”, or even about “whether government should be involved in spaceflight at all,” a point of view that can only be seriously considered if one is willing to dismiss foreign policy as part of the bargain. Other valuable components of the Obama Administration’s space policy, such as technology development and a focus on capabilities—also with positive implications for soft power—are generally lost in the noise. Seen from a national security perspective, these arguments are mostly spurious. The roles played by NASA and commercial spaceflight providers are not the same. From the point of view of other nations, there is a major policy statement and a variety of implications inherent in a government commitment to a national space program (NASA), particularly HSF: the very Value Proposition (VP) this series has focused on. The same VP does not apply to commercial efforts. They have Value Propositions of their own. A key issue underlying these struggles is lack of clarity within the government as to how—or perhaps if—the United States will balance capabilities and responsibilities resident in private and public civil space sectors, in the interests of national security. In the opinion of the author, this was a major reason for Congressional resistance to the policy shift brought forward by the Obama Administration, although certainly not the only one.3 Pundits have been quick to point to jobs, “pork”, and re-election—and only a naïve observer would disregard those realities—but the hole in US space policy suddenly revealed by the joint occurrence of the end of the Space Shuttle program, the cancellation of Constellation, and the shift to new vendors and procurement processes was not caused by the change in policy, it culminated in it.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973).</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Initially, states are analogizing spaceports to airports, which can be reasonable, and relationships among local, state, and federal authorities can be forged using the airport model. As spaceports develop, however, it may become necessary to consider factors that are inapplicable to airports, chief among which is Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, which makes the U.S. government responsible for supervising all U.S. nongovernmental space actors.21 As a result, the federal government may increasingly need to supervise spaceport operations more closely than it does traditional airports, and may need to invoke the constitutional doctrine of preemption to ensure that the United States meets its obligations under that treaty.22 The Future of the Future for Spaceports In August 2009, the U.S. Department of Transportation created the Commercial Space Transportation Center of Excellence, led by New Mexico State University, as part of the FAA’s Air Transportation Centers of Excellence Program.23 Under the program, the FAA works with universities and members of the aviation industry with the goal of increasing the safety and efficiency of the air transportation system. Because commercial space flight is not confined to the United States, its development and, in turn, that of spaceports are likely to affect the development of international law. For example, a spaceport is planned for Kiruna, Sweden. In January 2009, Spaceport America and Spaceport Sweden signed a memorandum of understanding outlining cooperative efforts, and will consider each other to be “Sister Spaceports,” analogous to the “Sister Cities” program between U.S. and non-U.S. cities. In October 2009, seven nonfederal existing or proposed spaceports and three non-U.S. spaceports formed the Spaceports Council within the Commercial Spaceflight Federation.24 Spaceports also have international law implications. For example, in order to reduce travel time, there are plans to operate point-to-point, longdistance commercial transportation using suborbital flights. This could lead to the development of spaceports near large cities, rather than the current preference for remote or smaller city locations, in order to facilitate suborbital transportation on U.S.–foreign city–pair routes. This will also involve the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), comprehensive improvements to the National Airspace System, and plans to reduce airspace and airport congestion throughout the U.S. air transportation system.25 On May 4, 2010, the FAA announced the inauguration of the Commercial Space Transportation Grants Program and requested applications for grants.26 More significantly, on June 28, 2010, the Obama administration announced a new National Space Policy of the United States of America, including initiatives for increased commercial and other private-sector space activity and public–private sector cooperation. The Space Policy contemplates increases in NASA’s budget of $6 billion over the next five years. NASA had already invested $50 million in five private-sector entities for commercial space flight research and development. The Space Policy’s Second Principle states: A robust and competitive commercial space sector is vital to continued progress in space. The United States is committed to encouraging and facilitating the growth of a U.S. commercial space sector that supports U.S. needs, is globally competitive, and advances U.S. leadership in the generation of new markets and innovation-driven entrepreneurship.27 Most recently, on September 29, 2010, the Senate passed S. 3729, giving NASA a three-year authorization and matching the $19 billion that the Obama administration had requested for NASA for fiscal year 2011. The bill authorizes $612 million for commercial crew and cargo services development in 2011 and $500 million for commercial crew development in 2012 and 2013. Conclusion A range of developments, including current and proposed spaceport projects, the new federal grant program, contemplated international suborbital travel, the Spaceports Council, NextGen, the new National Space Policy, and the NASA authorization, all indicate an increasing role for spaceports in aviation and aerospace law. Taking a long-term view that looks beyond the immediate state of the recovering economy, these developments hopefully mark a revival of the interest in space that was so prevalent during the 1950s and 1960s. This renewed interest in space draws on the support of international cooperation, rather than the competition and hostility between superpowers that characterized the Cold War and its related “space race.” In today’s environment, competition will focus on the business and commercial spheres, rather than solely or principally on political and military aspects. The diversity of issues presented by the planning, funding, development, and operation of spaceports similarly raises a wide, and increasingly diverse, range of legal issues for spaceports and their owners, operators, and users.</span><br />

<strong>The ISS fosters cooperation</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, strong international partnerships are essential to the success of any nation, including the United States. The ISS allows the United States to maintain and continue to forge such partnerships and to explore ways of working successfully with other nations on technical projects. It provides a starting point for future collaboration beyond space programs, for projects of any kind. The utility of international partnerships was recognized early in NASA’s history. In 1969, considering the future of the U.S. space program, the Space Task Group noted the importance of international participation and communication. It believed this would promote a sense of world community; optimize international scientific, technical, and economic participation; apply space technology to humanity’s needs; and share the benefits and costs of space research and exploration. 16 These factors continue to drive international cooperation today. Even if increased cooperation is desirable and has been put into action during the construction phase, one may still question whether the ISS program is designed to promote future collaboration. In The Evolution of Cooperation by Robert Axelrod, an expert on strategic interactions, two of the primary methods for promoting future partnerships include making interactions more durable and more frequent. 17 The ISS does both. It is a highly visible, long-lasting program backed by international agreements, and therefore is more durable than other, less publicized or less formal Japan’s H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) on its maiden flight in September 2009, shortly before docking and unloading at the ISS. Additional HTV missions are planned as part of the resupply process for the ISS. Credit: NASAThe International Space Station: Decision 2015 — SpaCe fouNDatioN 7 international arrangements. Due to the technological challenges involved in design, development, production, launch, and operation of so complex an orbital facility, frequent international interaction and iterative cooperation are essential. Global cooperation on large-scale technical projects is a growing phenomenon, and the International Space Station has been studied as a model for these types of partnerships. 18 A great example is the 2008 integration of two international laboratories, the European Columbus lab and the Japanese Kibo lab, into the ISS. The Canadian Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator has been added, and both the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) have successfully performed servicing missions. These concrete steps forward provide strong evidence that the program is succeeding. 19 International partners place a great deal of importance in the ISS. The name of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s ( JAXA) laboratory Kibo means “hope” in Japanese. When the first module of the laboratory was delivered in March 2008, the Prime Minister of Japan hailed it as the beginning of Japan’s new “home in space.” 20 Each international partner mentions its participation in the ISS program as a major effort of its space program. The JAXA vision statement, written in 2005, notes that participation in the ISS program shows Japan’s status as an “equal partner with the United States and European countries” and establishes its status in the international community. 21 Russian, European, and Japanese space policy documents all mention the importance of research done on the ISS to successful future human spaceflight missions. 22 If U.S. support for the ISS program lapses in 2015, it is likely that one of the most significant negative impacts would be on international relations, and global perceptions as to whether or not the U.S. is a reliable partner. Concern over U.S. intentions is already apparent. Even amid the excitement of the Kibo module being launched, an article was published in the Daily Yomiuri, an English-language online supplement to Japan’s largest selling newspaper, that warned people not to be overly optimistic. 23 The article notes that the United States plans to shut down the ISS in 2015 and, if that happens, the Kibo laboratory will not be operational for the 10 years it was designed to last, in which case benefits from the project may be limited. The article highlights the risks of “international projects in cooperation with countries like the United States, where policies can change abruptly with the changing of administrations.” The article also says that Europe has engaged in diplomatic talks with Russia and the United States about the ISS, while Japan, “has relied almost completely on the United States, and has fallen behind Europe as a result.” 24 At the 2009 Paris Air Show, international partners voiced their interest in continuing the ISS mission past 2015, possibly to 2025. European Space Agency partners noted that they have a strong desire to extend the program to fully exploit their Columbus science lab. 25 The ramifications of a decision to withdraw from the ISS program in 2015 would, therefore, extend far beyond this single project. The United States’ choice to honor (or not) international commitments vis-à-vis the ISS will affect other countries’ views of the United States as a partner in virtually all future endeavors. The ISS provides the opportunity to cement lasting partnerships and cooperation in many areas. A unilateral U.S. decision to end the program against the wishes of the international partners will adversely affect future programs. If the United States is unable to sustain its engagement with its international partners, it will either have to forgo future large-scale space programs, or undertake all costs on its own.</span><br />

<strong>Science diplomacy is key to sustainable relations and prevents the escalation of wars</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Science diplomacy can function as a tool for conflict prevention and be understood as fostering cooperation between the scientific communities of hostile countries. Cooperation in the field of scientific research can help bridge the gap between the countries by creating a forum of mutual support and common interests. In recent years, there have been numerous examples of scientific cooperation between countries that otherwise have no official diplomatic relations. One such example is the &quot;inter-Korean cooperation&quot; in the chemistry, biotech and nano-science arenas, which was first proposed in March 2010. Science diplomacy between the two Koreas is also exemplified by the foundation of the first privately funded university in communist North Korea, the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology by Dr. Kim Chin-Kyung, a former war prisoner in North Korea. &quot;Educating people is a way to share what they love, and share their values,&quot; said the South Korean in an interview. Another example is the earthquake research cooperation between China and Taiwan initiated in January 2010. Chen Cheng-hung, vice chairman of the National Science Council in Taipei calls the initiative the “biggest scientific cooperation program between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits so far.” The United States launched a science diplomacy campaign toward Iran. The two countries, which have had no formal relations since 1980, have re-launched their ‘broken dialogue” though science. In the summer of 2009, the American Association for the Advancement of Science established a new Center for Science Diplomacy in Iran. According to Miller-McCune, this “scientist-to scientist exchange” is more effective that governmental public diplomacy initiatives. The two countries instead of trying to “influence each other’s behavior…will learn something in the process.” In addition, science diplomacy for conflict prevention can also be understood as the use of science and technology to enhance global or regional security. Solving regional problems and advancing peoples’ well-being though technology by providing them with access to water, clean energy, food, and information can prevent the rise of conflicts. The United States had been the leading country in the use of science and technology diplomacy for the purpose of advancing security. This kind of public diplomacy is particularly directed towards the Muslim world. One example of this is &quot;vaccine diplomacy.&quot; In an interview for SciDevNet in March 2010, Peter J. Hotez, president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington D.C. stated: “the United States could help reduce the burden of neglected diseases and promote peace by engaging Islamic nations in collaborative vaccine research and development.” This would “improve vaccine development for neglected diseases” in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan where vaccine diplomacy is currently being implemented.</span><br />

<strong>Increased leadership opens diplomatic channels with China and facilitates a code of conduct</strong><br />
<strong>Foust 12</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Jeff, editor and publisher of The Space Review, “Key space issues for 2013” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2211/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2211/1</a> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Besides these big issues, there are a number of smaller ones to watch in 2013. One of them deals with the future, if any, of a proposed code of conduct for outer space activities. The European Union has proposed such a code, and in 2012 the State Department expressed its support for the concept of a code, although not explicitly endorsing the EU proposal. That raised concerns among some in Congress that the code was a step towards space arms control treaties that they opposed. In the defense authorization bill passed this month, a provision addresses that issue, requiring the administration, should it sign any such code of conduct, to certify “that such agreement has no legally-binding effect or basis for limiting the activities of the United States in outer space.” In addition, the administration is required to provide briefings to Congress about the status any code negotiations and notification upon signing of any such document. However, those provisions may be moot since there seems to be little, if any, progress on the development of a code of conduct. “It’s a good idea in principle. However, I believe it’s largely dead,” said Scott Pace of George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute at the SWF event. “The diplomatic aspect of that has been so badly fumbled that I don’t really think there’s a prospect right now for how to move forward with it.” SWF’s Brian Weeden wasn’t quite as ready to write off the code, but acknowledged the prospects for it weren’t good. Nonetheless, he said, it made sense to continue international dialogue on issues raised by the code. Such discussions are likely to include China, as some people play up a rivalry between the two nations. But others still hold out hope for increased cooperation between China and the US, noting that China’s competition is more with other Asian space powers, like India and Japan, than with America. “I would see forthcoming, maybe in the next four years of the Obama Administration, an opening on a government-to-government cooperative basis for space cooperation between the US and China,” said Eligar Sadeh of Astroconsulting International. “China really is looking for the United States to take the initiative and lead” on space cooperation between the two nations. The challenges with dealing with China, not to mention other obstacles like reduced budgets, point to a need for changes in culture in various government agencies and other organizations, including a willingness to adopt other approaches of doing business that can be faster and less expensive that current methods. </span><br />

<strong>Treaties prevent global conflicts</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">Hitchens, 8</span></strong><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 5pt;"> – president of the Center for Defense Information (Theresa, “Space Wars - Coming to the Sky Near You?”, Scientific American, February, </span><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 5pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you</a></span><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 5pt;">)</span><br />
<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 5pt;">Perhaps of even greater concern is that several other nations, including one of China’s regional rivals, India, may feel compelled to seek ­offensive as well as defensive capabilities in space. The U.S. trade journal Defense News, for instance, quoted unidentified Indian defense officials as stating that their country had already begun developing its own kinetic-energy (nonexplosive, hit-to-kill) and laser-based antisatellite weapons. If India goes down that path, its archrival Pakistan will probably follow suit. Like India, Pakistan has a well-developed ballistic missile program, including medium-range missiles that could launch an antisatellite system. Even Japan, the third major Asian power, might join such a space race. In June 2007 the National Diet of Japan began considering a bill backed by the current Fukuda government that would permit the development of satellites for “military and national security” purposes. As for Russia, in the wake of the Chinese test President Vladimir Putin reiterated Moscow’s stance against the weaponization of space. At the same time, though, he refused to criticize Beijing’s actions and blamed the U.S. instead. The American efforts to build a missile defense system, Putin charged, and the increasingly aggressive American plans for a military position in space were prompting China’s moves. Yet Russia itself, as a major spacefaring power that has incorporated satellites into its national security structure, would be hard-pressed to forgo entering an arms race in space. Given the proliferation of spacefaring entities, proponents of a robust space warfare strategy believe that arming the heavens is inevitable and that it would be best for the U.S. to get there first with firepower. Antisatellite and space-based weapons, they argue, will be necessary not only to defend U.S. military and commercial satellites but also to deny any future adversary the use of space capabilities to enhance the performance of its forces on the battlefield. Yet any arms race in space would almost inevitably destabilize the balance of power and thereby multiply the risks of global conflict. In such headlong competition—whether in space or elsewhere—equilibrium among the adversaries would be virtually impossible to maintain. Even if the major powers did achieve stability, that reality would still provide no guarantee that both sides would perceive it to be so. The moment one side saw itself to be slipping behind the other, the first side would be strongly tempted to launch a preemptive strike, before things got even worse. Ironically, the same would hold for the side that perceived itself to have gained an advantage. Again, there would be strong temptation to strike first, before the adversary could catch up. Finally, a space weapons race would ratchet up the chances that a mere technological mistake could trigger a battle. After all, in the distant void, reliably distinguishing an intentional act from an accidental one would be highly problematic. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Hit-to-Kill InterceptorsAccording to assessments by U.S. military and intelligence officials as well as by independent experts, the Chinese probably destroyed their weather satellite with a kinetic-energy vehicle boosted by a two-stage medium-range ballistic missile. Technologically, launching such direct-ascent antisatellite weapons is one of the simplest ways to take out a satellite. About a dozen nations and consortia can reach low Earth orbit (between roughly 100 and 2,000 kilometers, or 60 to 1,250 miles, high) with a medium-range missile; eight of those countries can reach geostationary orbit (about 36,000 kilometers, or 22,000 miles, above Earth).But the real technical hurdle to making a hit-to-kill vehicle is not launch capacity; it is the precision maneuverability and guidance technology needed to steer the vehicle into its target. Just how well China has mastered those techniques is unclear. Because the weather satellite was still operating when it was destroyed, the Chinese operators would have known its exact location at all times.Ground-Based LasersThe test of China’s direct-ascent antisatellite device came on the heels of press reports in September 2006 that the Chinese had also managed to “paint,” or illuminate, U.S. spy satellites with a ground-based laser [see lower box on page 83]. Was Beijing actually trying to “blind” or otherwise damage the satellites? No one knows, and no consensus seems to have emerged in official Washington circles about the Chinese intent. Per­haps China was simply testing how well its network of low-power laser-ranging stations could track American orbital observation platforms.Even so, the test was provocative. Not all satellites have to be electronically “fried” to be put out of commission. A 1997 test of the army’s MIRACL system (for midinfrared advanced chemical laser) showed that satellites designed to collect optical images can be temporarily disrupted—dazzled—by low-power beams. It follows that among the satellites vulnerable to such an attack are the orbital spies.The U.S. and the former Soviet Union began experimenting with laser-based antisatellite weapons in the 1970s. Engineers in both countries have focused on the many problems of building high-power laser systems that could reliably destroy low-flying satellites from the ground. Such systems could be guided by “adaptive optics”: deformable mirrors that can continuously compensate for atmospheric distortions. But tremendous amounts of energy would be needed to feed high-power lasers, and even then the range and effectiveness of the beams would be severely limited by dispersion, by attenuation as they passed through smoke or clouds, and by the difficulty of keeping the beams on-target long enough to do damage.During the development of the SDI, the U.S. conducted several laser experiments from Hawaii, including a test in which a beam was bounced off a mirror mounted on a satellite. Laser experiments continue at the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. Pentagon budget documents from fiscal years 2004 through 2007 listed antisatellite operations among the goals of the Starfire research, but that language was removed from budget documents in fiscal year 2008 after Congress made inquiries. The Starfire system incorporates adaptive optics that narrow the outgoing laser beam and thus increase the density of its power. That capability is not required for imagery or tracking, further suggesting that Starfire could be used as a weapon.Yet despite decades of work, battle-ready versions of directed-energy weapons still seem far away. An air force planning document, for instance, predicted in 2003 that a ground-based weapon able to “propagate laser beams through the atmosphere to [stun or kill low Earth orbit] satellites” could be available between 2015 and 2030. Given the current state of research, even those dates seem optimistic.Co-orbital SatellitesRecent advances in miniaturized sensors, powerful onboard computers and efficient rocket thrusters have made a third kind of antisatellite technology increasingly feasible: the offensive microsatellite. One example that demonstrates the potential is the air force’s experimental satellite series (XSS) project, which is developing microsatellites intended to conduct “autonomous proximity operations” around larger satellites. The first two microsatellites in the program, the XSS-10 and XSS-11, were launched in 2003 and 2005. Though ostensibly intended to inspect larger satellites, such microsatellites could also ram target satellites or carry explosives or directed-energy payloads such as radio-frequency jamming systems or high-powered microwave emitters. Air force budget documents show that the XSS effort is tied to a program called Advanced Weapons Technology, which is dedicated to research on military laser and microwave systems.During the cold war the Soviet Union developed, tested and even declared operational a co-orbital antisatellite system—a maneuverable interceptor with an explosive payload that was launched by missile into an orbit near a target satellite in low Earth orbit. In effect, the device was a smart “space mine,” but it was last demonstrated in 1982 and is probably no longer working. Today such an interceptor would likely be a microsatellite that could be parked in an orbit that would cross the orbits of several of its potential targets. It could then be activated on command during a close encounter.In 2005 the air force described a program that would provide “localized” space “situational awareness” and “anomaly characterization” for friendly host satellites in geostationary orbit. The program is dubbed ANGELS (for autonomous nanosatellite guardian for evaluating local space), and the budget line believed to represent it focuses on acquiring “high value space asset defensive capabilities,” including a “warning sensor for detection of a direct ascent or co-orbital vehicle.” It is clear that such guardian nanosatellites could also serve as offensive weapons if they were maneuvered close to enemy satellites.And the list goes on. A “parasitic satellite” would shadow or even attach itself to a target in geostationary orbit. Farsat, which was mentioned in an appendix to the [Donald] Rumsfeld Space Commission report in 2001, “would be placed in a ‘storage’ orbit (perhaps with many microsatellites housed inside) relatively far from its target but ready to be maneuvered in for a kill.”Finally, the air force proposed some time ago a space-based radio-frequency weapon system, which “would be a constellation of satellites containing high-power radio-frequency transmitters that possess the capability to disrupt/­destroy/disable a wide variety of electronics and national-level command and control systems.”Air force planning documents from 2003 envisioned that such a technology would emerge after 2015. But outside experts think that orbital radio-frequency and microwave weapons are technically feasible today and could be deployed in the relatively near future.Space BombersThough not by definition a space weapon, the Pentagon’s Common Aero Vehicle/Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (often called CAV) enters into this discussion because, like an ICBM, it would travel through space to strike Earth-bound targets. An unpowered but highly maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle, the CAV would be deployed from a future hypersonic space plane, swoop down into the atmosphere from orbit and drop conventional bombs on ground targets. Congress recently began funding the project but, to avoid stoking a potential arms race in space, has prohibited any work to place weapons on the CAV. Although engineers are making steady progress on the key technologies for the CAV program, both the vehicle and its space plane mothership are still likely decades off.Some of the congressional sensitivity to the design of the CAV may have arisen from another, much more controversial space weapons concept with parallel goals: hypervelocity rod bundles that would be dropped to Earth from orbital platforms. For decades air force planners have been thinking about placing weapons in orbit that could strike terrestrial targets, particularly buried, “hardened” bunkers and caches of weapons of mass destruction. Commonly called “rods from God,” the bundles would be made up of large tungsten rods, each as long as six meters (20 feet) and 30 centimeters (12 inches) across. Each rod would be hurled downward from an orbiting spacecraft and guided to its target at tremendous speed.Both high costs and the laws of physics, however, challenge their feasibility. Ensuring that the projectiles do not burn up or deform from reentry friction while sustaining a precise, nearly vertical flight path would be extremely difficult. Calculations indicate that the nonexplosive rods would probably be no more effective than more conventional munitions. Furthermore, the expense of lofting the heavy projectiles into orbit would be exorbitant. Thus, despite continued interest in them, rods from God seem to fall into the realm of science fiction.Obstacles to Space WeaponsWhat, then, is holding the U.S. (and other nations) back from a full-bore pursuit of space weapons? The countervailing pressures are threefold: political opposition, technological challenges and high costs.The American body politic is deeply divided over the wisdom of making space warfare a part of the national military strategy. The risks are manifold. I remarked earlier on the general instabilities of an arms race, but there is a further issue of stability among the nuclear powers. Early-warning and spy satellites have traditionally played a crucial role in reducing fears of a surprise nuclear attack. But if antisatellite weapons disabled those eyes-in-the-sky, the resulting uncertainty and distrust could rapidly lead to catastrophe.One of the most serious technological challenges posed by space weapons is the proliferation of space debris, to which I alluded earlier. According to investigators at the air force, NASA and Celestrak (an independent space-monitoring Web site), the Chinese antisatellite test left more than 2,000 pieces of junk, baseball-size and larger, orbiting the globe in a cloud that lies between about 200 kilometers (125 miles) and 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) above Earth’s surface. Perhaps another 150,000 objects that are a centimeter (half an inch) across and larger were released. High orbital velocities make even tiny pieces of space junk dangerous to spacecraft of all kinds. And ground stations cannot reliably monitor or track objects smaller than about five centimeters (two inches) across in low Earth orbit (around a meter in geostationary orbit), a capability that might enable satellites to maneuver out of the way. To avoid being damaged by the Chinese space debris, in fact, two U.S. satellites had to alter course. Any shooting war in space would raise the specter of a polluted space environment no longer navigable by Earth-orbiting satellites.Basing weapons in orbit also pre­sents difficult technical obstacles. They would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all kinds of outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic signals, even natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against such threats would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is bulky and adds mass, thereby greatly increasing launch costs. Orbital weapons would be mostly autonomous mechanisms, which would make operational errors and failures likely. The paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to predict, which would make hiding large weapons problematic. And because satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many weapons.Finally, getting into space and operating there is extremely expensive: between $2,000 and $10,000 a pound to reach low Earth orbit and between $15,000 and $20,000 a pound for geostationary orbit. Each space-based weapon would require replacement every seven to 15 years, and in-orbit repairs would not be cheap, either.Alternatives to Space WarfareGiven the risks of space warfare to national and international security, as well as the technical and financial hurdles that must be overcome, it would seem only prudent for spacefaring nations to find ways to prevent an arms race in space. The U.S. focus has been to reduce the vulnerability of its satellite fleet and explore alternatives to its dependence on satellite services. Most other space-capable countries are instead seeking multilateral diplomatic and legal measures. The options range from treaties that would ban antisatellite and space-based weapons to voluntary measures that would help build transparency and mutual confidence.The Bush administration has adamantly opposed any form of negotiations regarding space weapons. Opponents of multilateral space weapons agreements contend that others (particularly China) will sign up but build secret arsenals at the same time, because such treaty violations cannot be detected. They argue further that the U.S. cannot sit idly as potential adversaries gain spaceborne resources that could enhance their terrestrial combat capabilities.Proponents of international treaties counter that failure to negotiate such agreements entails real opportunity costs. An arms race in space may end up compromising the security of all nations, including that of the U.S., while it stretches the economic capacities of the competitors to the breaking point. And whereas many advocates of a space weapons ban concede that it will be difficult to construct a fully verifiable treaty—because space technology can be used for both military and civilian ends—effective treaties already exist that do not require strict verification. A good example is the Biological Weapons Convention. Certainly a prohibition on the testing and use (as opposed to the deployment) of the most dangerous class of near-term space weapons—destructive (as opposed to jamming) antisatellite systems—would be easily verifiable, because earthbound observers can readily detect orbital debris. Furthermore, any party to a treaty would know that all its space launches would be tracked from the ground, and any suspicious object in orbit would promptly be labeled as such. The international outcry that would ensue from such overt treaty violations could deter would-be violators.Since the mid-1990s, however, progress on establishing a new multilateral space regime has lagged. The U.S. has blocked efforts at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to begin negotiations on a treaty to ban space weapons. China, meanwhile, has refused to accept anything less. Hence, intermediate measures such as voluntary confidence-building, space traffic control or a code of responsible conduct for spacefaring nations have remained stalled.Space warfare is not inevitable. But the recent policy shift in the U.S. and China’s provocative actions have highlighted the fact that the world is approaching a crossroads. Countries must come to grips with their strong self-interest in preventing the testing and use of orbital weapons. The nations of Earth must soon decide whether it is possible to sustain the predominantly peaceful human space exploration that has already lasted half a century. The likely alternative would be unacceptable to all.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The MARS needs to continue to distinguish itself as a leading spaceport. Virginia has led the way in promoting its space industry and will need to continue these efforts. The symbiotic relationship between the MARS and NASA’s WFF will need to continue to evolve. With the declining NASA budget a thriving commercial space industry will be vital in reducing operating costs and ensuring stability and growth during a time of Federal downsizing. NASA has studied the possibility of closing WFF several times. This closure has been prevented by strong political opposition. It is in the best interests of the MARS, NASA, and the commercial space industry to ensure each other’s success and continued utilization of WFF. Since NASA awarded Virginia-based Orbital Science Corporation a CRS contract, a consistent line of funding is in place that must be utilized to the greatest extent possible. NASA will be required to purchase, at a minimum, another 27 cargo flights and 10 crew flights through 2020. The existing contract and the possible future NASA contracts should be used as the anchor tenant to attract more business. The U.S. Air Force Operationally Responsive Space Office has launched four spacecraft from Wallops with the possibility for more launches in the future. This relationship should continue to be developed and MARS promoted as a responsive, lean launch provider. While the orbital market has a much higher entry cost than the sub-orbital market, continued demonstration of MARS as a lean launch provider could attract emerging space companies like Bigelow Aerospace. The sub-orbital market should take advantage of WFF’s existing airport and infrastructure to perform sub-orbital flights. The MARS’ unique location on the East Coast and near the nation’s capital, and other population centers, places it in a key position to offer sub-orbital flights. The sub-orbital tourism, point-to-point, and research markets are likely to be the highest in demand and should be targeted for future growth. Wallops has a long history of suborbital research and could expand this field to include more commercial launches. FAA’s commercial space transportation regulations are in their infancy but are still minimal. The NASA regulations while more mature and far more complex are being adapted for commercial usage. NASA plans on leaving all commercial space licensing to the FAA. In the future even a NASA mission launched from a Federal range would require an FAA license. NASA is likely to still have their own safety requirements that will be redundant to FAA requirements. A key part to enabling commercial space transportation industry at MARS is reducing the uncertainty about how NASA and FAA regulations will coexist. The nascent commercial space transportation industry has been enabled by NASA investment in COTS, CCDev and CRS. This, along with the FAA’s matching grants and other Federal and state incentives, has helped jump-start the commercial space transportation industry. The possible roadblocks of excessive regulation have been minimized by the FAA’s limited Final Rule on Crew and Space Flight Requirements and the CSLAA. By not certifying vehicles as safe, the FAA acknowledges that passengers will fly at their own risk. While this congressional “hands off” mandate will encourage research and development in this emerging market it could backfire if an accident occurs that results in more strict regulation. After December 23, 2012 the FAA may propose new regulations on the commercial space industry without restriction. The amount of regulations will be dependent upon how much the commercial space industry has matured. Industry lessons learned and best practices are needed to determine future requirements. The FAA has already held public meetings to address many of the concerns facing this emerging market. Specifically, the deconfliction of FAA and NASA regulations will be necessary to prevent duplication of efforts. Both regulators need to ensure their requirements are compatible or complementary for both government and non-government organizations. The development of a robust commercial space transportation industry is important to the U. S. and its National Security in many different areas. Economically, a strong space industry and a vigorous space launch schedule will promote space jobs and programs to stay in the U. S. A larger and more experienced space industrial base will greatly benefit National Security Space programs and develop national capabilities in new technical realms. Another important impact to National Security Space is the required expansion and growth of the space transportation infrastructure. Similar to the railroads, interstate highways, and airports of today a space transportation infrastructure will need to be developed and will be a requirement for future growth and expansion. Without this infrastructure National Security Space will be required to maintain its own aging infrastructure and would not be able to benefit from new construction, technology and innovations that the commercial space sector would develop on its own. In a shrinking Global economy the commercial space industry will be vital in maintaining the competitive edge in, and our access to, space. The more developed the U.S. commercial space industry is the more likely it will be able to adapt and overcome any challenges it is faced with. It is in the U.S. Government’s strategic interest to remain a leader in the Global space transportation industry. This emerging commercial space transportation market has the potential to become a thriving industry with proper investment and minimal regulation.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The Final Report of the President's Commission on the Future of the US Aerospace Industry came out with some very strong recommendations. And it did so at a time when the country is re-evaluating its commitment to the further exploration and development of space, in the aftermath of the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia. It is not necessary to repeat here all of the recommendations of the Commission. But instead it is worthwhile to pick out those aspects that derive directly from the ASCENT work, and of which NASA and other government agencies associated with the development of space, need to be aware. The country has already lost its leadership in space. US industry has only 40% of global launches today, and the ASCENT Study indicates that unless there is a shift in focus and priorities, then the figure will be down to 25% twenty years from now. There are ramifications both in employment and in the education of our future generations. Even the financially stretched Russian industry is doing better in terms of market share, and is already taking the initiative in the early development of the new commercial opportunities represented by public space travel. The Europeans are gearing up to use the Russian Soyuz system capabilities for their own purposes from the European launch facilities at Kourou. It seems clear that the Chinese will not be far behind, with imminent launches of their first Shenzhou crews. The message for the US government is therefore no less than a need to seek to bring about a reversal of the relative decline of the US as a space power. One part of doing this is to remove some of the impediments for foreign customers to fly their payloads on US launch vehicles. Another way is by taking steps to encourage those infrastructure-and regulatory- developments that will facilitate the growth of a domestic space tourism industry. In this context one must include both sub-orbital and orbital developments and facilities, although the ASCENT Study focused on the latter. The States seem so far to be way ahead of the Federal government in this regard. Many States are exploring the possibilities of having spaceports within their territories to help in their employment and other needs. The Federal government should play its part in facilitating these first steps as the spaceports are being established. The commercial development of space, and its next logical step of space tourism, is the most American of endeavors: it is a way to make money out of people being free and having fun. Of course, down the road, there are other benefits for the nation, and even the world. But at least the ASCENT Study makes abundantly clear that the US cannot expect to rank itself amongst the world's most thriving civilizations if it does not continue on the road that it set for itself at the start of the space age. The more entrepreneurial parts of the commercial sector have seized the message already, and soon we shall see the first sub-orbital space tourists follow in Alan Shepard's footsteps. The Federal government must also play its part. NASA can be directed to work with these new realities. The Aerospace Commission identifies public space travel as an important new sector &quot;??.that holds the potential for increasing launch demand and improvements in space launch reliability and reusability?.?? and would ultimately support a robust space transportation industry with &quot;airline-like operations&quot;?..?&quot; Perhaps the best way for this redirection of NASA to take effect would be in terms of budgetary resource re-allocation. As was discussed earlier, there is no justification for significant expenditures to be taking place on ideas and concepts that have no likelihood of taking place within the next twenty years. The ASCENT Study provides the guidance for this necessary resource reallocation, as discussed earlier in the paper. By the same token, there is a need to actively support initiatives to bring about the new industry of space tourism. At the very least, NASA needs to create a small Office of Public Space Travel to facilitate the needs of the emerging sector, and to coordinate those needs with the Administration's other long-term plans. A good example of an early role for such an office would be an involvement in the OSP architecture design discussions to find ways to ensure that the resulting OSP vehicle design can play a useful part in the future of orbital space tourism. This can be the way in which the US takes back the lead from the Russians in this area, and/or prevents the Chinese from taking this initiative of providing trips for American space tourists. The ASCENT Study makes it very clear what the implications will be if the US does not develop an RLV that can eventually be used for public space travel purposes. The OSP is the best shot we have at this for the short term. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Following the first successful flight of an airplane in 1903, the focus of the aviation industry was on research and development of aircraft technology, not on the development of airfields. A rudimentary set of airfields was established during World War I, but the significant development of airfields in the United States was driven by commerce, such as the need for airmail flights to have refueling and mail drop off sites in various locations. The aviation industry began growing rapidly in the late 1920’s, which then drove the need for improved infrastructure and regulatory frameworks, including licensing. As passenger travel became more commonplace and high capacity aircraft emerged (such as the Boeing 747), the construction of larger airports became a requirement as well as the expansion and improvement of existing airports. This was expensive and required a great deal of government support. Some key dates and events in the development of the airport infrastructure in the United States are presented below in Table 5-1. It is important to note that the overall development of the airport system in the United States was largely reactive, rather than proactive. This was particularly true in the technical and legal regimes. Similarly, spaceport development will likely be driven by the development of the space vehicle industry; however, the additional challenge of integrating spacecraft traffic and infrastructure requirements with that of existing air traffic and infrastructure exists. This will be particularly important for the development of PTP transportation, and unlike the history of airport development, the development and integration of spaceports may require proactive initiatives with regard to legal and technical challenges. The costs of developing the infrastructure to support a growing space industry, particularly that of a PTP suborbital industry, may also have some parallels to early airport development. With respect to demand and public safety, additional construction and improvement of the airport infrastructure was required as the aviation industry evolved. Such improvements were quite expensive and therefore required government support, such as the U.S. Airport and Airway Development Act. Similarly, spaceport construction and infrastructure costs are high, and such ventures often require support from the government. Many spaceports are already supported at least in part by public funding. A selection of spaceports currently under development for suborbital space tourism, their estimated development costs, and sources of funding are shown in Table 5-2 below: As the example of Spaceport America has shown recently, garnering public support and funds can be a challenge (Medina, 2008). Development of a network of spaceports, or integration into the existing airport system, will be an expensive and challenging endeavor. Some savings may be made by using existing facilities, such as decommissioned military bases, and their runways, or by using existing rocket range facilities. Europe in particular, has large numbers of long runways left over from the cold war which would be capable of supporting some suborbital concepts. It may be viable to develop a purpose built spaceport without public funding, especially if it is designed for tourism purposes other than PTP transportation. This is the case with the joint ventures creating the tourism infrastructure for Spaceport Sweden in Kiruna (Spaceport Sweden, 2008).</span><br />

 <strong>First, Shuttle cancellation makes continued support for the ISS physically impossible</strong><br />
<strong>(Abbey 11)</strong><br />

Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, July 20, 2011, “Restore the Vision”, accessed August 22, 2011, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bakerinstitute.org/publications/SPACE-pub-AbbeySpaceShuttleVision-072011.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bakerinstitute.org/publications/SPACE-pub-AbbeySpaceShuttleVision-072011.pdf</a></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The director general of the European Space Agency (ESA), Jean-Jacques Dordain, has stated that the International Space Station is facing lean times as a result of the U.S. shuttle phaseout and has said project planning for transport to the ISS had been “anarchy.” The shuttle has been the key means to take humans and freight toa and from the ISS, and Dordain stated that NASA made a unilateral 2004 decision to stop the shuttle. The space shuttle’s retirement after the mission launched on July 8, 2011, means that the station will depend entirely on the Russian Soyuz system for transporting astronauts. The European automated transfer vehicle (ATV) and the Japanese H-Il transfer vehicle (HTV) are unmanned supply ships, as is Russia's Progress freighter. These three cargo systems are all designed to be one-way systems, which mean they burn up in the atmosphere after leaving the station. The Sovuz, which does return for a landing, cannot take large nonhuman payloads, such as large experiments or equipment that needs to be returned to be repaired on Earth. Dordain has said the scheduled phaseout of the space shuttle meant “we are not in a very comfortable situation, and that’s just a euphemism. The International Space Station was designed to be not only built and assembled with the space shuttle, but it was designed to be logistically supported by the shuttle. The uncomfortable situation cited by Dordain is an understatement. On June 12, 2011, the New York Daily News printed an opinion article by Christopher Krait, former director of NASA’s Manned Spaceflight Center in Houston, and Scott Spencer, a transportation management consultant, that emphasized the need to continue to operate the space shuttle in support of the station. As they state in their article, “For more than 10 years, space crews from the United States, Russia, and other countries have successfully lived and worked year round, in six-month shifts, on the International Space Station, where they have conducted scientific research. In the coming years, that work will continue—but with a crucial safeguard missing: the space shuttle fleet that gives human beings a unique capability to fix the space station's guidance system and rocket thrusters in the event of a terrible failure.” They point out what will become a clear and present danger: “Loss of control of the space station would mean a catastrophic reentry into the Earth's atmosphere of the massive structure—the largest object ever placed in orbit around the Earth, measuring over three football fields long and weighing more than 400 tons. The tons of falling debris that would survive reentry would pose an unprecedented threat to populated areas around the world. They point out that the space station does have redundant life support and control systems that might make such a failure unlikely. But to say it is so redundant that it could never happen ignores the tragic lessons learned due to overconfidence in fail-safe technology in disasters throughout history, from the sinking of the Titanic to the nuclear reactor crisis in Japan. Such a catastrophe would have significant international ramifications and liability for the United States, Russia, and the other space station partners. In the event of damage from a fire, space debris, or a potential collision from the frequent clocking of manned or unmanned commercial resupply spacecraft, the space station backup systems offer little margin of safety. If the life support or guidance systems or rocket thrusters are damaged, the station could need a rapid rescue mission to stay in orbit. The shuttles have unique capabilities as repair vehicles. They are the only spacecraft that have the vital airlocks and life-support supplies, and the robotic arm that is needed to move the equipment necessary for spacewalking repair crews. Spare parts needed for critical repairs have been taken up by the space shuttle, and stowed on the station—but none could be installed to repair and regain control and use of the $100 billion space station if it is deemed uninhabitable for repair crews. The Soyuz and other potential commercial spacecraft that are intended to support the station all lack the life support systems needed for the multiple six-hour repair spacewalks.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">(CNN) -- A new era in space exploration dawned Tuesday as a slender rocket shot into the dark Florida sky before sunrise, carrying the first private spacecraft bound for the International Space Station. &quot;We're now back on the brink of a new future, a future that embraces the innovation the private sector brings to the table,&quot; NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said. &quot;The significance of this day cannot be overstated.&quot; The unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 3:44 a.m., carrying 1,300 pounds of food, clothing and scientific experiments on a demonstration mission to gauge the company's ability to safely and efficiently deliver supplies to astronauts staffing the orbiting station. Opinion: Private space travel -- A new era begins? If successful, the test could open the door to a wave of commercial exploitation of space. Dragon roars toward ISS CNN Explains: Commercial space flight Why SpaceX launch is important SpaceX makes history Tuesday's launch marks the culmination of six years of preparation to bring commercial flights to the space station following the retirement of NASA's space shuttle fleet last year. It's backed by entrepreneur Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal. Stellar week for SpaceX founder Elon Musk &quot;Every bit of adrenaline in my body released at that moment,&quot; Musk said of the launch, in a statement released by NASA. &quot;People were really giving it their all. For us, it was like winning the Super Bowl.&quot; The rocket launched without a hitch following a flawless countdown that came three days after a faulty valve on one of the rocket's engines forced a last-second postponement. Its solar array panels deployed later Tuesday. At 180 feet tall and 12 feet in diameter, the Falcon 9 rocket is tiny in comparison to the football-field-long Saturn V rockets that carried Apollo spacecraft into orbit. It carries the company's Dragon cargo capsule capable of carrying 13,228 pounds of supplies into orbit, the company said. The capsule is scheduled to perform a series of maneuvers that should bring it within reach of the space station's robotic arm on Friday. If NASA gives the go-ahead, the crew will use the arm to attach the capsule to the station and begin unloading supplies, according to SpaceX. It will remain attached to the station for two weeks before it plummets back into the atmosphere and splashes into the Pacific Ocean off the California coast, according to SpaceX. Read more about the launch on CNN's Light Years blog The cargo manifest for the trip includes 674 pounds of food, clothing and miscellaneous supplies, 46 pounds of supplies for use in science experiments, 271 pounds of cargo bags for use in future flights and 22 pounds of computer equipment. It will return with science experiments, hardware and used gear. Cremated human remains were placed in the second stage of the Falcon and will orbit the Earth. Celestis Inc. charges families $2,995 to launch 1 gram of remains in this type of memorial spaceflight. NASA's Internet tool SkyWatch is providing information on viewing the Dragon from Earth. The cargo capsule will continue its orbit Wednesday as it travels toward the space station. The launch is an important step for NASA and the United States, which currently has no means of independently reaching space. NASA relies on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit. &quot;What's really important is not control, as much as it is the fact that the United States will once again be in the lead, will be providing our own vehicles to take our own astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station,&quot; Bolden said. &quot;It's fine to rely on partners, but that's not where the greatest nation in the world wants to be.&quot; White House science adviser John P. Holdren also hailed the launch. &quot;Every launch into space is a thrilling event, but this one is especially exciting because it represents the potential of a new era in American spaceflight,&quot; he said. &quot;Partnering with U.S. companies such as SpaceX to provide cargo and eventually crew service to the International Space Station is a cornerstone of the president's plan for maintaining America's leadership in space.&quot;</span><br />

<strong>But no launch pads makes launch costs high, means limited private space ventures</strong><br />
<strong>Citizen Space 12</strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">(a project of the United States Rocket Academy, is dedicated to citizen science and citizen space exploration, “Another Vicious Cycle” 9/7/12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.citizensinspace.org/2012/09/another-vicious-circle/" rel="nofollow">http://www.citizensinspace.org/2012/09/another-vicious-circle/</a> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Yesterday, we published an article on how launch pad shortages are causing customers to bundle satellites to reduce the number of launches. Unfortunately, this creates a vicious cycle. The ultimate solution to the launch-pad problem is to transition from expendable launch vehicles to reusable vehicles, which can be prepped quickly and don’t spend a lot of time on the pad. But bundling satellites onto larger rockets reduces the number of launches, which reduces the apparent demand and harms the business case for reusable vehicles. As a result, the pad problem continues. Vicious cycles like this have prevented the development of reusable launch vehicles for 40 years. Right now, NASA is contributing to another vicious cycle in a big way (both figuratively and literally) with the development of the Space Launch System. An ambitious deep-space exploration backed by NASA, could create a market for many hundreds of smalls launches, or it could support the development a superheavy launch system like SLS – but it can’t afford both. At the same, the development of SLS will mean that any exploration hardware NASA develops will be designed to fit on SLS, and impossible to launch on smaller, more economical reusable vehicles which might be developed in the private sector. Thus, the Space Launch System threatens to lock NASA into high launch costs for another generation while depriving private industry of the chance to compete for a market that could bring about a revolution in launch costs. If America is to have a meaningful future in space, we need to break out of these vicious cycles. The solution is not, as some believe, to get the US government to buy a handful of flights to the International Space Station. (There’s a good reason why NASA’s COTS and CCDEV programs are funding expendable vehicles, not reusables.) To make real progress, we need thousands of launches. </span><br />

<strong>The ISS causes settlement, and tech progress makes it possible</strong><br />
<strong>Hauser and John 9</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Marty Hauser VP, Washington Operations, Research and Analysis Mariel John Research Analyst, Space Foundation, “The International Space Station: Decision 2015” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacefoundation.org/docs/ISS_Decision_2015.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacefoundation.org/docs/ISS_Decision_2015.pdf</a> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One of the most broadly recognized objectives of the ISS is articulated on the NASA Exploration Web site: its “use as a test bed for technology development, demonstration, and problem resolution in the areas of life support, fire safety, power, propulsion, thermal management, etc.” 34 The ISS provides the unique ability to carry out this important task. If the United States intends to undertake long-duration exploration missions, it is essential that NASA collects empirical data on the maintainability and availability of space hardware systems. This can only be accomplished with operating experience, and the ISS offers this capability. NASA has already been able to develop and refine ventilation systems, air filtration systems, water recycling systems, and oxygen producing systems, to name only a few. When hardware components malfunction, the ISS crews have demonstrated creativity, collaboration, and teamwork in order to carry out repairs in orbit. This has led to the development of new repair techniques and has provided valuable lessons on what does and does not work in space. 35 The benefits of having a relatively close “island in space” where systems can be tested are evident in the experience with the Remote Power Control Mechanism. This component, similar to a circuit breaker, is used frequently in space systems. When this component malfunctioned, NASA was able to study the problem and create an improved version. Thousands of replacements were shipped to the ISS and installed. Had this problem occurred on a vehicle destined for the Moon or Mars, studying the problem, creating replacements, and carrying out repairs would have been much more difficult, if not impossible. 36 Research on humans in space is at least as vital as research on space hardware. The ISS offers the only option for research on the effect of long-duration spaceflight on humans. The Vision for Space Exploration mentions the critical role of the ISS to “understanding the effects of space environments on the human body, developing techniques for mitigating these hazards, minimizing the logistical burden of supporting humans far from Earth, and addressing remote medical emergencies.” 37 Extensive research is being done to create countermeasures to the bone and muscle loss astronauts experience during long-duration flights. Research on medical devices and procedures is also essential. Similarly, research and advances in radiation exposure and protection will be vital to the safety of astronauts on future exploration missions. Human factors research associated with long duration space travel is also critically important. For example, research is now being carried out wherein an astronaut keeps journals that will be analyzed to help better understand the effects of living in an isolated and confined environment for extended periods. 38 Research is also being carried out on crew member and crew-ground interactions. Preliminary findings from this experiment indicate that crew members improve in mood and social climate over the course of their missions as they adapt to the new environment. 39 Research carried out on ISS allows the United States to be better prepared for its future exploration endeavors.</span><br />

<strong>Even without the ISS, lower launch costs facilitate settlement</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Patrick Collins (exceptionally well known and respected authority on space economics, space tourism, reusable launch vehicles, and space solar power), and Adriano Autino (prolific science and space writer/lecturer for leading magazines, journals, and space advocate organizations), Acta Astronautica, July 2010, “What the growth of a space tourism industry could contribute to employment, economic growth, environmental protection, education, culture and world peace”, accessed August 24, 2011, Volume 66, Issues 11-12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576509004512" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576509004512</a></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Costs for the development of low-cost orbital passenger transportation systems are of the order of 10 billion Euros [7–9]. Even 10 times this amount would be less than 5 years of space agencies' current budgets. The economic benefits seem sure to greatly outweigh the cost, due to the much larger commercial markets that would be created as a result, in contrast to the very small markets created with 1 trillion Euro-equivalents invested in satellite and launch vehicle manufacturing to date.That is, there seem to be no technical reasons why rapid growth of space travel services could not be realised: the technology has existed for decades, and companies wishing to develop vehicles are hampered by only one obstacle, which is the easiest for governments to solve—lack of funds. Hence the rest of this paper assumes that over coming decades households will start to purchase space ﬂight services, which will grow to reach 5 million passengers/year, out of a worldwide middle-class population of more than 2 billion people, a few decades from now.Starting from today, in order to achieve the scale of activity shown in Fig. 1 over the next 30 years, government funding equivalent to about 10% of space agencies' budgets, or some 2 billion Euros/year would probably suffice to stimulate private investment in reusable orbital passenger vehicle manufacturing and operations. Thereafter most of the funding would come from private companies, just as airline and hotel companies finance their own growth today. 1.1. Implications of launch cost reduction Reducing the cost of space travel to 1% of existing launch vehicles' costs, in combination with the growth of a new consumer service market in space, would greatly aid the growth of many commercial space activities, thereby creating numerous new business opportunities both on Earth and in space. This process is already at work on a small scale in relation to sub-orbital ﬂight services: in addition to a large number of travel companies acting as agents for sub-orbital ﬂights (including JTB, the largest travel company in Japan), Zero-G Corporation supplies parabolic ﬂight services, Bigelow Aerospace is developing the first space hotel, Spaceport Associates advises on spaceport design, Orbital Outfitters Inc. supplies customised ﬂight suits, spaceports are being developed in several places, and several support organisations have been established. All of this activity is occurring some years before the first high-priced services even start, so a much wider range of different space travel-related businesses are sure to grow in future. In the case of orbital services there will be an even wider range of companies with much larger revenues, including companies supplying various services to orbiting hotels. These will include services which terrestrial hotels typically purchase today, such as catering, cleaning, accounting, entertainment, plus such additional services as space-based window maintenance, air supply, solargenerated electricity, water supply, waste disposal services, and others. As activities in orbit expand progressively, they could grow to include use of materials extracted from the Moon and near-Earth asteroids and cometoids, of which the potential has been researched for several decades [11]. Due to the much higher cost of activities in orbit than on the surface of the Earth, orbiting hotels seem likely to create the first market for non-terrestrial materials like ice, water, oxygen and hydrogen, as discussed in [12]. Another potentially major space-based industry, which has been held back for 40 years by high launch costs, is the supply of solar power from space to Earth. Although the potential of this system was recognised in studies by the US Department of Energy in the late 1970s, and confirmed in the 1990s [13], total funding has remained minimal. However, progress could be rapid once launch costs fall to a few percent of ELV costs [14]. Hence, as passenger space travel activities expand to large scale, a growing range of manufacturing activities in Earth orbit, on the lunar surface and elsewhere could develop spontaneously, driven by entrepreneurial effort to exploit new business opportunities opened up by the growth of new commercial markets in Earth orbit. These will in turn open the door to the large-scale space activities described in [11]. The growth of orbital passenger space travel to several million passengers/year over a few decades would represent a direct commercial turnover of some 100 billion Euros/year. In such a scenario of rapid growth, annual investment in new facilities, research and development might add the same amount again. Indeed, having reached such a scale, there would be no foreseeable limit to further growth—in particular it need not be limited, like terrestrial activities, by environmental or political constraints. Quite apart from the numerous opportunities which such a scenario offers for growth of the space industry, it also offers great potential benefits for humanity, in several different fields, as discussed in turn in the following. 2. Employment In most countries, most of the population do not have economically significant land holdings, and so employment is the economic basis of social life, providing income and enabling people to have stable family lives. The high level of unemployment in most countries today is therefore not only wasteful, it also causes widespread poverty and unhappiness, and is socially damaging, creating further problems for the future. One reason for investing in the development of passenger space travel, therefore, is that it could create major new fields of employment, capable of growing as far into the future as we can see. As of 2001, the hotel, catering and tourism sector was estimated to employ 60 million people world-wide, or 3% of the global workforce, and 6% of Europeans [15]. Hence we can estimate that the passenger air travel industry, including airlines, airports, hotels and other tourismrelated work, indirectly employs 10–20 times the number of people employed in aircraft manufacturing alone. Likewise, passenger space travel services could presumably create employment many times that in launch vehicle manufacturing—in vehicle operations and maintenance, at spaceports, in orbiting hotels, in many companies supplying these, in services such as staff training, certification and insurance, and in a growing range of related businesses. This possibility is particularly valuable because high unemployment, both in richer and poorer countries, has been the major economic problem throughout the world for decades. Consequently the growth of such a major new market for advanced aerospace technology and services seems highly desirable, as discussed further in [16]. By contrast, in recent years employment in the traditional space industry in USA and Europe has been shrinking fast: a 2003 report by the US Federal Aviation Administration stated that employment in launch vehicle manufacturing and services fell from 28,617 in 1999 to 4828 in 2002, while employment in satellite manufacturing fell from 57,372 to 31,262 [17]. Likewise, European space industry employment fell by 20% from 1995 to 2005; the major space engineering company Astrium cut 3300 staff from 2003 through 2006; and in 2005 alone, European prime contractors cut 13.5% of their staff or some 2400 people [18]. Unfortunately, the probability of space industry employment recovering soon is low, because satellite manufacturing and launch services face both low demand and rapidly growing competition from India and China, where costs are significantly lower. It is therefore positively bizarre that government policy-makers have declined to even discuss the subject of investing in the development of passenger space travel services, and have permitted no significant investment to date out of the nearly 20 billion Euro-equivalents which space agencies spend every year! This is despite the very positive 1998 NASA report &quot;General Public Space Travel and Tourism&quot; [19], and the NASA-funded 2002 &quot;ASCENT&quot; study referred to above [2,3]. In the capitalist system, companies compete to reduce costs since this directly increases their profits. However, reducing the number of employees through improving productivity raises unemployment, except to the extent that new jobs are created in new and growing industries. In an economy with a lack of new industries, increasing so-called &quot;economic efficiency&quot; creates unemployment, which is a social cost. In this situation, governments concerned for public welfare should either increase the rate of creation of new industries, and/or slow the elimination of jobs, at least until the growth of new industries revives, or other desirable counter-measures, such as new social arrangements, are introduced. These may include more leisure time, job-sharing, and other policies designed to prevent the growth of a permanent &quot;under-class&quot; of unemployed and &quot;working poor&quot;—a development which would pose a major threat to western civilisation. </span><br />

<strong>Space settlement solves risk of endless resource wars and every scenario for extinction</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The major source of social friction, including international friction, has surely always been unequal access to resources. People ﬁght to control the valuable resources on and under the land, and in and under the sea. The natural resources of Earth are limited in quantity, and economically accessible resources even more so. As the population grows, and demand grows for a higher material standard of living, industrial activity grows exponentially. The threat of resources becoming scarce has led to the concept of ‘‘Resource Wars’’. Having begun long ago with wars to control the gold and diamonds of Africa and South America, and oil in the Middle East, the current phase is at centre stage of world events today [37]. A particular danger of ‘‘resource wars’’ is that, if the general public can be persuaded to support them, they may become impossible to stop as resources become increasingly scarce. Many commentators have noted the similarity of the language of US and UK government advocates of ‘‘war on terror’’ to the language of the novel ‘‘1984’’ which describes a dystopian future of endless, fraudulent war in which citizens are reduced to slaves. 7.1. Expansion into near-Earth space is the only alternative to endless ‘‘resource wars’’ As an alternative to the ‘‘resource wars’’ already devastating many countries today, opening access to the unlimited resources of near-Earth space could clearly facilitate world peace and security. The US National Security Space Ofﬁce, at the start of its report on the potential of space-based solar power (SSP) published in early 2007, stated: ‘‘Expanding human populations and declining natural resources are potential sources of local and strategic conﬂict in the 21st Century, and many see energy as the foremost threat to national security’’ [38]. The report ended by encouraging urgent research on the feasibility of SSP: ‘‘Considering the timescales that are involved, and the exponential growth of population and resource pressures within that same strategic period, it is imperative that this work for ‘‘drilling up’’ vs. drilling down for energy security begins immediately’’ [38]. Although the use of extra-terrestrial resources on a substantial scale may still be some decades away, it is important to recognise that simply acknowledging its feasibility using known technology is the surest way of ending the threat of resource wars. That is, if it is assumed that the resources available for human use are limited to those on Earth, then it can be argued that resource wars are inescapable [22,37]. If, by contrast, it is assumed that the resources of space are economically accessible, this not only eliminates the need for resource wars, it can also preserve the beneﬁts of civilisation which are being eroded today by ‘‘resource war-mongers’’, most notably the governments of the ‘‘Anglo-Saxon’’ countries and their ‘‘neo-con’’ advisers. It is also worth noting that the $1 trillion that these have already committed to wars in the Middle-East in the 21st century is orders of magnitude more than the public investment needed to aid companies sufﬁciently to start the commercial use of space resources. Industrial and ﬁnancial groups which proﬁt from monopolistic control of terrestrial supplies of various natural resources, like those which proﬁt from wars, have an economic interest in protecting their proﬁtable situation. However, these groups’ continuing proﬁts are justiﬁed neither by capitalism nor by democracy: they could be preserved only by maintaining the pretence that use of space resources is not feasible, and by preventing the development of low-cost space travel. Once the feasibility of low-cost space travel is understood, ‘‘resource wars’’ are clearly foolish as well as tragic. A visiting extra-terrestrial would be pityingly amused at the foolish antics of homo sapiens using longrange rockets to ﬁght each other over dwindling terrestrial resources—rather than using the same rockets to travel in space and have the use of all the resources they need! 7.2. High return in safety from extra-terrestrial settlement Investment in low-cost orbital access and other space infrastructure will facilitate the establishment of settlements on the Moon, Mars, asteroids and in man-made space structures. In the ﬁrst phase, development of new regulatory infrastructure in various Earth orbits, including property/usufruct rights, real estate, mortgage ﬁnancing and insurance, trafﬁc management, pilotage, policing and other services will enable the population living in Earth orbits to grow very large. Such activities aimed at making near-Earth space habitable are the logical extension of humans’ historical spread over the surface of the Earth. As trade spreads through near-Earth space, settlements are likely to follow, of which the inhabitants will add to the wealth of different cultures which humans have created in the many different environments in which they live. Success of such extra-terrestrial settlements will have the additional beneﬁt of reduc[e]ing the danger of human extinction due to planet-wide or cosmic accidents [27]. These horrors include both man-made disasters such as nuclear war, plagues or growing pollution, and natural disasters such as super-volcanoes or asteroid impact. It is hard to think of any objective that is more important than preserving peace. Weapons developed in recent decades are so destructive, and have such horriﬁc, long-term side-effects that their use should be discouraged as strongly as possible by the international community. Hence, reducing the incentive to use these weapons by rapidly developing the ability to use space-based resources on a large scale is surely equally important [11,16]. The achievement of this depends on low space travel costs which, at the present time, appear to be achievable only through the development of a vigorous space tourism industry. 8. Summary As discussed above, if space travel services had started during the 1950s, the space industry would be enormously more developed than it is today. Hence the failure to develop passenger space travel has seriously distorted the path taken by humans’ technological and economic development since WW2, away from the path which would have been followed if capitalism and democracy operated as intended. Technological know-how which could have been used to supply services which are known to be very popular with a large proportion of the population has not been used for that purpose, while waste and suffering due to the unemployment and environmental damage caused by the resulting lack of new industrial opportunities have increased. In response, policies should be implemented urgently to correct this error, and to catch up with the possibilities for industrial and economic growth that have been ignored for so long. This policy renewal is urgent because of the growing dangers of unemployment, economic stagnation, environmental pollution, educational and cultural decline, resource wars and loss of civil liberties which face civilisation today. In order to achieve the necessary progress there is a particular need for collaboration between those working in the two ﬁelds of civil aviation and civil space. Although the word ‘‘aerospace’’ is widely used, it is largely a misnomer since these two ﬁelds are in practice quite separate. True ‘‘aerospace’’ collaboration to realise passenger space travel will develop the wonderful profusion of possibilities outlined above. 8.1. Heaven or hell on Earth? As discussed above, the claim that the Earth’s resources are running out is used to justify wars which may never end: present-day rhetoric about ‘‘the long war’’ or ‘‘100 years war’’ in Iraq and Afghanistan are current examples. If political leaders do not change their viewpoint, the recent aggression by the rich ‘‘Anglo-Saxon’’ countries, and their cutting back of traditional civil liberties, are ominous for the future. However, this ‘‘hellish’’ vision of endless war is based on an assumption about a single number—the future cost of travel to orbit—about which a different assumption leads to a ‘‘heavenly’’ vision of peace and ever-rising living standards for everyone. If this cost stays above 10,000 Euros/kg, where it has been unchanged for nearly 50 years, the prospects for humanity are bleak. But if humans make the necessary effort, and use the tiny amount of resources needed to develop vehicles for passenger space travel, then this cost will fall to 100 Euros/kg, the use of extra-terrestrial resources will become economic, and arguments for resource wars will evaporate entirely. The main reason why this has not yet happened seems to be lack of understanding of the myriad opportunities by investors and policy-makers. Now that the potential to catch up half a century of delay in the growth of space travel is becoming understood, continuing to spend 20 billion Euro-equivalents/year on government space activities, while continuing to invest nothing in developing passenger space travel, would be a gross failure of economic policy, and strongly contrary to the economic and social interests of the public. Correcting this error, even after such a costly delay, will ameliorate many problems in the world today. As this policy error is corrected, and investment in proﬁtable space projects grows rapidly in coming years, we can look forward to a growing world-wide boom. Viewed as a whole, humans’ industrial activities have been seriously underperforming for decades, due to the failure to exploit these immensely promising ﬁelds of activity. The tens of thousands of unemployed space engineers in Russia, America and Europe alone are a huge waste. The potential manpower in rapidly developing India and China is clearly vast. The hundreds of millions of disappointed young people who have been taught that they cannot travel in space are another enormous wasted resource. We do not know for certain when the above scenario will be realised. However, it could have such enormous value that considerable expenditure is justiﬁed in order to study its feasibility in detail [5]. At the very least, vigorous investment by both private and public sectors in a range of different sub-orbital passenger vehicle projects and related businesses is highly desirable. Fortunately, the ambitious and rapid investment by the Indian and Chinese governments in growing space capabilities may ﬁnally jolt the space industries of Russia, America, Europe and Japan out of their long economic stagnation, and induce them to apply their accumulated know-how to economically valuable activities—notably supplying widely popular travel services to the general public.</span><br />

<strong>A reduction of the risk of extinction by 1 millionth of 1 percent outweighs</strong><br />
<strong>Bostrom 11</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Nick, Oxford Martin School &amp; Faculty of Philosophy, 2011, “The Concept of Existential Risk” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3404:http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3404 --> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Holding probability constant, risks become more serious as we move toward the upper-right region of figure 2. For any fixed probability, existential risks are thus more serious than other risk categories. But just how much more serious might not be intuitively obvious. One might think we could get a grip on how bad an existential catastrophe would be by considering some of the worst historical disasters we can think of—such as the two world wars, the Spanish flu pandemic, or the Holocaust—and then imagining something just a bit worse. Yet if we look at global population statistics over time, we find that these horrible events of the past century fail to register (figure 3). Figure 3: World population over the last century. Calamities such as the Spanish flu pandemic, the two world wars, and the Holocaust scarcely register. (If one stares hard at the graph, one can perhaps just barely make out a slight temporary reduction in the rate of growth of the world population during these events.) But even this reflection fails to bring out the seriousness of existential risk. What makes existential catastrophes especially bad is not that they would show up robustly on a plot like the one in figure 3, causing a precipitous drop in world population or average quality of life. Instead, their significance lies primarily in the fact that they would destroy the future. The philosopher Derek Parfit made a similar point with the following thought experiment: I believe that if we destroy mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people think. Compare three outcomes: (1) Peace. (2) A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world’s existing population. (3) A nuclear war that kills 100%. (2) would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of these two differences? Most people believe that the greater difference is between (1) and (2). I believe that the difference between (2) and (3) is very much greater. … The Earth will remain habitable for at least another billion years. Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If we do not destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny fraction of the whole of civilized human history. The difference between (2) and (3) may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of this history. If we compare this possible history to a day, what has occurred so far is only a fraction of a second. (10: 453-454) To calculate the loss associated with an existential catastrophe, we must consider how much value would come to exist in its absence. It turns out that the ultimate potential for Earth-originating intelligent life is literally astronomical. One gets a large number even if one confines one’s consideration to the potential for biological human beings living on Earth. If we suppose with Parfit that our planet will remain habitable for at least another billion years, and we assume that at least one billion people could live on it sustainably, then the potential exist for at least 1018 human lives. These lives could also be considerably better than the average contemporary human life, which is so often marred by disease, poverty, injustice, and various biological limitations that could be partly overcome through continuing technological and moral progress. To calculate the loss associated with an existential catastrophe, we must consider how much value would come to exist in its absence. It turns out that the ultimate potential for Earth-originating intelligent life is literally astronomical. One gets a large number even if one confines one’s consideration to the potential for biological human beings living on Earth. If we suppose with Parfit that our planet will remain habitable for at least another billion years, and we assume that at least one billion people could live on it sustainably, then the potential exist for at least 10^18 human lives. These lives could also be considerably better than the average contemporary human life, which is so often marred by disease, poverty, injustice, and various biological limitations that could be partly overcome through continuing technological and moral progress. However, the relevant figure is not how many people could live on Earth but how many descendants we could have in total. One lower bound of the number of biological human life-years in the future accessible universe (based on current cosmological estimates) is 10^34 years.[10] Another estimate, which assumes that future minds will be mainly implemented in computational hardware instead of biological neuronal wetware, produces a lower bound of 10^54 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years (or 10^71 basic computational operations).(4)[11] If we make the less conservative assumption that future civilizations could eventually press close to the absolute bounds of known physics (using some as yet unimagined technology), we get radically higher estimates of the amount of computation and memory storage that is achievable and thus of the number of years of subjective experience that could be realized.[12] Even if we use the most conservative of these estimates, which entirely ignores the possibility of space colonization and software minds, we find that the expected loss of an existential catastrophe is greater than the value of 10^18 human lives. This implies that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one millionth of one percentage point is at least ten times the value of a billion human lives. The more technologically comprehensive estimate of 1054 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years (or 1052 lives of ordinary length) makes the same point even more starkly. Even if we give this allegedly lower bound on the cumulative output potential of a technologically mature civilization a mere 1% chance of being correct, we find that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred billion times as much as a billion human lives. One might consequently argue that even the tiniest reduction of existential risk has an expected value greater than that of the definite provision of any “ordinary” good, such as the direct benefit of saving 1 billion lives. And, further, that the absolute value of the indirect effect of saving 1 billion lives on the total cumulative amount of existential risk—positive or negative—is almost certainly larger than the positive value of the direct benefit of such an action.[13] </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Deadly bacteria that have spent time in space are already on Earth—but instead of killing humans, they might just save lives. Scientists are using bacteria cultivated on the International Space Station to help develop vaccines that experts say could revolutionize the medical field. In 1998, researchers began studying how microbes such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and yeast behaved in space because NASA wanted to be able to keep astronauts safe in the closed space station environment. What they found, specifically with certain types of bacteria, was surprising, says Tara Ruttley, NASA's associate program scientist for the International Space Station. [See Spectacular Snapshots of Space] &quot;Bacteria can either respond in microgravity by sitting there and doing nothing, or they can become more aggressive and virulent,&quot; meaning they reproduce and evolve to cause disease more readily, she says. But that property of bacteria allows scientists to study exactly why certain bacteria, such as salmonella and MRSA, make people sick. Scientists aren't exactly sure why certain bacteria become more virulent in space, but Ruttley says they believe it might be a stress response to being put into a low-gravity environment. But whatever the reason, studying bacteria that have spent time in space can make it easier for scientists to develop defenses. &quot;If you know the gene that makes bacteria more aggressive, you can build a defense against it,&quot; she says. Last week, William Gerstenmaier, NASA's head of human explorations and operations, told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that medical discoveries and vaccines developed on the International Space Station could help the United States &quot;create a new economy based on space-based research.&quot; &quot;It's like when we went to Africa to look for new plant species to use for drugs,&quot; he said. &quot;We can create a new industry with this.&quot; [NASA: Private U.S. Spacecraft Could Save Agency Millions] Cheryl Nickerson and Roy Curtiss, professors at Arizona State University's Biodesign Institute, are leading the charge. They are studying salmonella that has spent time in space, in an attempt to &quot;turn it from foe to friend&quot; by crippling the disease-causing genes and replacing them with ones that protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacteria that causes meningitis, pneumonia, and many other diseases. In space, &quot;we can unveil many of [salmonella's] responses that are happening here on earth but are masked by gravity,&quot; Nickerson says. &quot;We've been able to identify missing info and use the new information to understand how [salmonella] causes disease … what you have now is a discovery platform that … can be used to create new vaccine technologies.&quot; Nickerson and Curtiss also believe that a vaccine developed on Earth, when flown to space, could become more potent if it spends time in orbit. ASU's institute recently finished an experiment in which they kept a strain of their salmonella-based vaccine in space for six weeks and compared it with the same vaccine strain developed on Earth. &quot;It's too early to give any updates, but we have a lot of data we're very excitedly digging into as we speak,&quot; she says. Although her initial experiments have been promising, Nickerson says people need to be wary of getting too far ahead of themselves—she says it'll likely be 8-10 years before her vaccine or any others developed using bacteria that spent time in space are ready for commercial sale. [Stolen NASA Laptop Contained International Space Station Codes] &quot;I've heard people promise a translational product, and that's not what a responsible scientist will do. I can't guarantee a whole lot of things,&quot; she says. &quot;I believe, but cannot guarantee that we're going to have next-generation breakthroughs. I think it'll happen in infectious disease, cancer, aging, and visual disorders … but we have to be careful about making claims.&quot; But many companies are already banking on the promise of developing medical breakthroughs on the International Space Station. Ruttley says NASA's research on the human body has already led to greater understanding about bone, muscle, and heart atrophy, vision impairments, and more. Mike Gold, director of D.C. operations and business growth at Bigelow Aerospace, a company developing commercial spaceflight solutions, says that private industry's ability to go to space will speed up research. &quot;We're underestimating the impact of [microgravity research and development] on our economy,&quot; he told the Senate panel last week, adding that researchers at Johns Hopkins University are interested in developing cancer drugs in space and other companies are studying treatments for muscular dystrophy and osteoporosis based on space research. &quot;The companies and countries that have an expertise in microgravity manufacturing will be the economic giants of the future, and the first place we're going to see that is in pharmaceuticals,&quot; he told U.S. News in a separate interview. But he says researchers need to be able to send experiments to space more often before any treatments become a reality. &quot;Scientists need to be able to repeat an experiment a number of times,&quot; he says. &quot;We can't fly an experiment once and then wait five years to fly it again. To become a reality, we need to allow researchers to fly their experiments numerous times to get results.&quot; </span><br />

<strong>Extinction</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">It is a considerable comfort and undoubtedly a key to our survival that, so far, the main lines of defense against this threat have not depended on explicit policies or organized efforts. In the long course of evolution, the human body has developed physical barriers and a biochemical immune system whose sophistication and effectiveness exceed anything we could design or as yet even fully understand. But evolution is a sword that cuts both ways: New diseases emerge, while old diseases mutate and adapt. Throughout history, there have been epidemics during which human immunity has broken down on an epic scale. An infectious agent believed to have been the plague bacterium killed an estimated 20 million people over a four-year period in the fourteenth century, including nearly one-quarter of Western Europe's population at the time. Since its recognized appearance in 1981, some 20 variations of the HIV virus have infected an estimated 29.4 million worldwide, with 1.5 million people currently dying of AIDS each year. Malaria, tuberculosis, and cholera - once thought to be under control - are now making a comeback. As we enter the twenty-first century, changing conditions have enhanced the potential for widespread contagion. The rapid growth rate of the total world population, the unprecedented freedom of movement across international borders, and scientific advances that expand the capability for the deliberate manipulation of pathogens are all cause for worry that the problem might be greater in the future than it has ever been in the past. The threat of infectious pathogens is not just an issue of public health, but a fundamental security problem for the species as a whole.</span><br />

 <strong>Spaceflight capabilities are failing, we need an incentive for companies to develop to become a space industrial power</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Point 1: America must recapture world leadership in commercial space transportation. We are now fourth in the world in commercial space transportation, behind Russia, Europe, and Ukraine. China and India are coming on fast. This is completely unacceptable. The loss of these markets is an economic tragedy. With a radical reduction in launch costs, and high flight rates, we are a next generation space industrial power. Without it, we are not. If this was only about jobs and profits, I would say let the markets decide. But this is a national security problem. Our national security is harmed because US launch vehicles are more expensive, and less reliable, because they fly less often. Our national security is harmed because of the hollowing out of the space industrial base. Our national security is harmed when it depends on Russian rocket engines. Becoming number one again in commercial space transportation is an easy first goal. We may already be on a path to achieve this goal because of the American entrepreneurial spirit. But we need to declare this an important goal, and take effective action to see it through. Point 2: We should set the national goal of low-cost, reliable access to space—an order of magnitude reduction in cost, and an order of magnitude increase in reliability. Low-cost access is a critical national and economic /security issue. It is the one key point to becoming a Next Generation Space Industrial Power. It is the one key point to expanding human civilization across the solar system. With a radical reduction in launch costs, and high flight rates, we are a next generation space industrial power. Without it, we are not. Whichever country achieves low-cost and reliable access to space first will start a virtuous cycle that will deliver tremendous national and economic security benefits. This nation will dominate the carrying trade, which will create new markets, which will drive new technologies and new capabilities, which will increase flight rates and lower launch costs, which will allow us to expand into more new markets and so on. Low-cost access is Mahanian theory in action. At NASA, in the summer of 2011, a team I led that included all mission directorates and all centers unequivocally concluded that low-cost and reliable access to space was the number one priority from among all emerging commercial space opportunities. This NASA team came to two other critical conclusions: American industry can build a two-stage reusable launch vehicles with today's technology. Technology was the primary barrier forty years ago. Technology is not the primary barrier today. The primary problem is that we can’t close a traditional business case. The flight rate from existing markets does not justify the investment. In another business, private risk-taking capital would take over at this point, and make the investment. But the huge size of the required investment, combined with the speculative nature of the future markets, makes the risks far too high for any private investor. This has much in common with the Transcontinental Railroad, which could not be justified as a pure commercial investment. Both are examples of market failure at the national strategic level. The key to closing the business case is not for government to take over design and development. It is not loan guarantees. It is not a multibillion-dollar 2nd Generation RLV technology program. The key is to stimulate on the demand side, to create incentives that drive up the flight rate and close the business case for reusable systems. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Recently, Lou Friedman wrote a piece where he articulated his view on what American leadership in space means to many and what it means to him (see “American leadership”, The Space Review, February 14, 2011). I would like to respond by providing some context that I think is lacking from the discussion. The United States’ goal should be leadership through spacefaring capabilities, in all sectors. First, let me start by saying that I agree with Mr. Friedman’s assertion that “American leadership is a phrase we hear bandied about a lot in political circles in the United States, as well as in many space policy discussions.” I have been at many space forums in my career where I’ve heard the phrase used by speakers of various backgrounds, political ideologies, and nation. Like Mr. Friedman states, “it has many different meanings, most derived from cultural or political biases, some of them contradictory”. This is true: many nations, as well as organizations and individuals worldwide, have different preferences and views as to what American leadership in space is, and/or what it should be. He also concludes that paragraph by stating that American leadership in space could also be viewed as “synonymous with American… hegemony”. I again will agree that some people within the United Stats and elsewhere have this view toward American leadership. However, just because people believe certain viewpoints regarding American leadership does not mean that those views are accurate assessments or definitions of what actions demonstrate US leadership in the space medium. When it comes to space exploration and development, including national security space and commercial, I would disagree somewhat with Mr. Friedman’s assertion that space is “often” overlooked in “foreign relations and geopolitical strategies”. My contention is that while space is indeed overlooked in national grand geopolitical strategies by many in national leadership, space is used as a tool for foreign policy and relations more often than not. In fact, I will say that the US space program has become less of an effort for the advancement of US space power and exploration, and is used more as a foreign policy tool to “shape” the strategic environment to what President Obama referred to in his National Security Strategy as “The World We Seek”. Using space to shape the strategic environment is not a bad thing in and of itself. What concerns me with this form of “shaping” is that we appear to have changed the definition of American leadership as a nation away from the traditional sense of the word. Some seem to want to base our future national foundations in space using the important international collaboration piece as the starting point. Traditional national leadership would start by advancing United States’ space power capabilities and strategies first, then proceed toward shaping the international environment through allied cooperation efforts. The United States’ goal should be leadership through spacefaring capabilities, in all sectors. Achieving and maintaining such leadership through capability will allow for increased space security and opportunities for all and for America to lead the international space community by both technological and political example. As other nations pursue excellence in space, we should take our responsibilities seriously, both from a national capability standpoint, and as country who desires expanded international engagement in space. The world has recognized America as the leaders in space because it demonstrated technological advancement by the Apollo lunar landings, our deep space exploration probes to the outer planets, and deploying national security space missions. We did not become the recognized leaders in astronautics and space technology because we decided to fund billions into research programs with no firm budgetary commitment or attainable goals. We did it because we made a national level decision to do each of them, stuck with it, and achieved exceptional things in manned and unmanned spaceflight. We have allowed ourselves to drift from this traditional strategic definition of leadership in space exploration, rapidly becoming participants in spaceflight rather than the leader of the global space community. One example is shutting down the space shuttle program without a viable domestic spacecraft chosen and funded to commence operations upon retirement of the fleet. We are paying millions to rely on Russia to ferry our astronauts to an International Space Station that US taxpayers paid the lion’s share of the cost of construction. Why would we, as United States citizens and space advocates, settle for this? The current debate on commercial crew and cargo as the stopgap between shuttle and whatever comes next could and hopefully will provide some new and exciting solutions to this particular issue. However, we need to made a decision sooner rather than later. Finally, one other issue that concerns me is the view of the world “hegemony” or “superiority” as dirty words. Some seem to view these words used in policy statements or speeches as a direct threat. In my view, each nation (should they desire) should have freedom of access to space for the purpose of advancing their “security, prestige and wealth” through exploration like we do. However, to maintain leadership in the space environment, space superiority is a worthy and necessary byproduct of the traditional leadership model. If your nation is the leader in space, it would pursue and maintain superiority in their mission sets and capabilities. In my opinion, space superiority does not imply a wall of orbital weapons preventing other nations from access to space, nor does it preclude international cooperation among friendly nations. Rather, it indicates a desire as a country to achieve its goals for national security, prestige, and economic prosperity for its people, and to be known as the best in the world with regards to space technology and astronautics. I can assure you that many other nations with aggressive space programs, like ours traditionally has been, desire the same prestige of being the best at some, if not all, parts of the space pie. Space has been characterized recently as “congested, contested, and competitive”; the quest for excellence is just one part of international space competition that, in my view, is a good and healthy thing. As other nations pursue excellence in space, we should take our responsibilities seriously, both from a national capability standpoint, and as country who desires expanded international engagement in space. If America wants to retain its true leadership in space, it must approach its space programs as the advancement of its national “security, prestige and wealth” by maintaining its edge in spaceflight capabilities and use those demonstrated talents to advance international prestige and influence in the space community. These energies and influence can be channeled to create the international space coalitions of the future that many desire and benefit mankind as well as America. Leadership will require sound, long-range exploration strategies with national and international political will behind it. American leadership in space is not a choice. It is a requirement if we are to truly lead the world into space with programs and objectives “worthy of a great nation”.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Whether or not the US HSF program is actually in retreat depends on one’s point of view. But, as long as the US is not flying humans into space, that point of view is largely irrelevant. What matters in this discussion is the point of view of other nations—and from where they sit, the US suffers from diminished prestige relative to earlier times. It is also seen as a labile partner in cooperative HSF efforts.1 The global response to the release of China’s white paper—evident within 24 hours—suggests there is widespread understanding of (and in some quarters, concern about) at least some of the implications therein. The paper details a methodical approach that builds on what has come before.2 By contrast, when looking to the US for leadership in space, for almost two years other nations have borne witness to a community and a government stuck in a squabble about the merits of “commercial spaceflight” vs. “government spaceflight” or about “Shuttle” vs. “future programs”, or even about “whether government should be involved in spaceflight at all,” a point of view that can only be seriously considered if one is willing to dismiss foreign policy as part of the bargain. Other valuable components of the Obama Administration’s space policy, such as technology development and a focus on capabilities—also with positive implications for soft power—are generally lost in the noise. Seen from a national security perspective, these arguments are mostly spurious. The roles played by NASA and commercial spaceflight providers are not the same. From the point of view of other nations, there is a major policy statement and a variety of implications inherent in a government commitment to a national space program (NASA), particularly HSF: the very Value Proposition (VP) this series has focused on. The same VP does not apply to commercial efforts. They have Value Propositions of their own. A key issue underlying these struggles is lack of clarity within the government as to how—or perhaps if—the United States will balance capabilities and responsibilities resident in private and public civil space sectors, in the interests of national security. In the opinion of the author, this was a major reason for Congressional resistance to the policy shift brought forward by the Obama Administration, although certainly not the only one.3 Pundits have been quick to point to jobs, “pork”, and re-election—and only a naïve observer would disregard those realities—but the hole in US space policy suddenly revealed by the joint occurrence of the end of the Space Shuttle program, the cancellation of Constellation, and the shift to new vendors and procurement processes was not caused by the change in policy, it culminated in it.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973).</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Initially, states are analogizing spaceports to airports, which can be reasonable, and relationships among local, state, and federal authorities can be forged using the airport model. As spaceports develop, however, it may become necessary to consider factors that are inapplicable to airports, chief among which is Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, which makes the U.S. government responsible for supervising all U.S. nongovernmental space actors.21 As a result, the federal government may increasingly need to supervise spaceport operations more closely than it does traditional airports, and may need to invoke the constitutional doctrine of preemption to ensure that the United States meets its obligations under that treaty.22 The Future of the Future for Spaceports In August 2009, the U.S. Department of Transportation created the Commercial Space Transportation Center of Excellence, led by New Mexico State University, as part of the FAA’s Air Transportation Centers of Excellence Program.23 Under the program, the FAA works with universities and members of the aviation industry with the goal of increasing the safety and efficiency of the air transportation system. Because commercial space flight is not confined to the United States, its development and, in turn, that of spaceports are likely to affect the development of international law. For example, a spaceport is planned for Kiruna, Sweden. In January 2009, Spaceport America and Spaceport Sweden signed a memorandum of understanding outlining cooperative efforts, and will consider each other to be “Sister Spaceports,” analogous to the “Sister Cities” program between U.S. and non-U.S. cities. In October 2009, seven nonfederal existing or proposed spaceports and three non-U.S. spaceports formed the Spaceports Council within the Commercial Spaceflight Federation.24 Spaceports also have international law implications. For example, in order to reduce travel time, there are plans to operate point-to-point, longdistance commercial transportation using suborbital flights. This could lead to the development of spaceports near large cities, rather than the current preference for remote or smaller city locations, in order to facilitate suborbital transportation on U.S.–foreign city–pair routes. This will also involve the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), comprehensive improvements to the National Airspace System, and plans to reduce airspace and airport congestion throughout the U.S. air transportation system.25 On May 4, 2010, the FAA announced the inauguration of the Commercial Space Transportation Grants Program and requested applications for grants.26 More significantly, on June 28, 2010, the Obama administration announced a new National Space Policy of the United States of America, including initiatives for increased commercial and other private-sector space activity and public–private sector cooperation. The Space Policy contemplates increases in NASA’s budget of $6 billion over the next five years. NASA had already invested $50 million in five private-sector entities for commercial space flight research and development. The Space Policy’s Second Principle states: A robust and competitive commercial space sector is vital to continued progress in space. The United States is committed to encouraging and facilitating the growth of a U.S. commercial space sector that supports U.S. needs, is globally competitive, and advances U.S. leadership in the generation of new markets and innovation-driven entrepreneurship.27 Most recently, on September 29, 2010, the Senate passed S. 3729, giving NASA a three-year authorization and matching the $19 billion that the Obama administration had requested for NASA for fiscal year 2011. The bill authorizes $612 million for commercial crew and cargo services development in 2011 and $500 million for commercial crew development in 2012 and 2013. Conclusion A range of developments, including current and proposed spaceport projects, the new federal grant program, contemplated international suborbital travel, the Spaceports Council, NextGen, the new National Space Policy, and the NASA authorization, all indicate an increasing role for spaceports in aviation and aerospace law. Taking a long-term view that looks beyond the immediate state of the recovering economy, these developments hopefully mark a revival of the interest in space that was so prevalent during the 1950s and 1960s. This renewed interest in space draws on the support of international cooperation, rather than the competition and hostility between superpowers that characterized the Cold War and its related “space race.” In today’s environment, competition will focus on the business and commercial spheres, rather than solely or principally on political and military aspects. The diversity of issues presented by the planning, funding, development, and operation of spaceports similarly raises a wide, and increasingly diverse, range of legal issues for spaceports and their owners, operators, and users.</span><br />

<strong>The ISS fosters cooperation</strong><br />
<strong>Hauser and John 9</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Marty Hauser VP, Washington Operations, Research and Analysis Mariel John Research Analyst, Space Foundation, “The International Space Station: Decision 2015” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacefoundation.org/docs/ISS_Decision_2015.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacefoundation.org/docs/ISS_Decision_2015.pdf</a> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, strong international partnerships are essential to the success of any nation, including the United States. The ISS allows the United States to maintain and continue to forge such partnerships and to explore ways of working successfully with other nations on technical projects. It provides a starting point for future collaboration beyond space programs, for projects of any kind. The utility of international partnerships was recognized early in NASA’s history. In 1969, considering the future of the U.S. space program, the Space Task Group noted the importance of international participation and communication. It believed this would promote a sense of world community; optimize international scientific, technical, and economic participation; apply space technology to humanity’s needs; and share the benefits and costs of space research and exploration. 16 These factors continue to drive international cooperation today. Even if increased cooperation is desirable and has been put into action during the construction phase, one may still question whether the ISS program is designed to promote future collaboration. In The Evolution of Cooperation by Robert Axelrod, an expert on strategic interactions, two of the primary methods for promoting future partnerships include making interactions more durable and more frequent. 17 The ISS does both. It is a highly visible, long-lasting program backed by international agreements, and therefore is more durable than other, less publicized or less formal Japan’s H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) on its maiden flight in September 2009, shortly before docking and unloading at the ISS. Additional HTV missions are planned as part of the resupply process for the ISS. Credit: NASAThe International Space Station: Decision 2015 — SpaCe fouNDatioN 7 international arrangements. Due to the technological challenges involved in design, development, production, launch, and operation of so complex an orbital facility, frequent international interaction and iterative cooperation are essential. Global cooperation on large-scale technical projects is a growing phenomenon, and the International Space Station has been studied as a model for these types of partnerships. 18 A great example is the 2008 integration of two international laboratories, the European Columbus lab and the Japanese Kibo lab, into the ISS. The Canadian Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator has been added, and both the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) have successfully performed servicing missions. These concrete steps forward provide strong evidence that the program is succeeding. 19 International partners place a great deal of importance in the ISS. The name of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s ( JAXA) laboratory Kibo means “hope” in Japanese. When the first module of the laboratory was delivered in March 2008, the Prime Minister of Japan hailed it as the beginning of Japan’s new “home in space.” 20 Each international partner mentions its participation in the ISS program as a major effort of its space program. The JAXA vision statement, written in 2005, notes that participation in the ISS program shows Japan’s status as an “equal partner with the United States and European countries” and establishes its status in the international community. 21 Russian, European, and Japanese space policy documents all mention the importance of research done on the ISS to successful future human spaceflight missions. 22 If U.S. support for the ISS program lapses in 2015, it is likely that one of the most significant negative impacts would be on international relations, and global perceptions as to whether or not the U.S. is a reliable partner. Concern over U.S. intentions is already apparent. Even amid the excitement of the Kibo module being launched, an article was published in the Daily Yomiuri, an English-language online supplement to Japan’s largest selling newspaper, that warned people not to be overly optimistic. 23 The article notes that the United States plans to shut down the ISS in 2015 and, if that happens, the Kibo laboratory will not be operational for the 10 years it was designed to last, in which case benefits from the project may be limited. The article highlights the risks of “international projects in cooperation with countries like the United States, where policies can change abruptly with the changing of administrations.” The article also says that Europe has engaged in diplomatic talks with Russia and the United States about the ISS, while Japan, “has relied almost completely on the United States, and has fallen behind Europe as a result.” 24 At the 2009 Paris Air Show, international partners voiced their interest in continuing the ISS mission past 2015, possibly to 2025. European Space Agency partners noted that they have a strong desire to extend the program to fully exploit their Columbus science lab. 25 The ramifications of a decision to withdraw from the ISS program in 2015 would, therefore, extend far beyond this single project. The United States’ choice to honor (or not) international commitments vis-à-vis the ISS will affect other countries’ views of the United States as a partner in virtually all future endeavors. The ISS provides the opportunity to cement lasting partnerships and cooperation in many areas. A unilateral U.S. decision to end the program against the wishes of the international partners will adversely affect future programs. If the United States is unable to sustain its engagement with its international partners, it will either have to forgo future large-scale space programs, or undertake all costs on its own.</span><br />

<strong>Science leadership is key to sustainable hegemony and prevents the escalation of wars</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">To discover sustainable hegemony in an increasingly multipolar world, American policy makers will need more than the Kaysen list of advantages from basic science. Dr. Carl Kaysen served President John Kennedy as deputy national security adviser and over his long career held distinguished professorships in Political Economy at Harvard and MIT. During the 1960s, Kaysen laid out a framework with four important reasons why a great power, the United States in particular, should take a strategic interest in the basic sciences. 1. Scientific discoveries provided the input for applied research, which in turn produced technologies crucial for wielding economic and military power. 2. Scientific activity educated a cadre of operators for leadership in industries relevant to government such as health care and defense. 3. Science proficiency generated the raw elements for mounting focused, applied efforts such as the Manhattan Project during World War II to build the first atomic bomb. 4. Scientific progress built a basic research reserve that when necessary could move quickly to shore up national needs. 1 These arguments underscored science‘s contribution to new products and services that provided market or military advantages. The pursuit of physics, chemistry, and biology at the frontiers of knowledge could have direct effects on national excellence. The following sections of this article extend Kaysen‘s list for the present multi-polar world. The United States‘ largest military and economic shares in such a world do not guarantee empire. Soft power from scientific achievement, however, may make up part of the deficit, enough to augment America‘s reputation and American leadership in the international order. The U.S. science establishment is then described and evaluated for its capacity to integrate and leverage the complete list of science benefits: Kaysen‘s nation-based items plus the civilization-based advantages exposited here. Case studies of the Office of Naval Research and U.S. scientific outreach to Brazil illustrate underlying strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. system for maintaining the lead in basic science. Among the weaknesses, democratic regimes tend to suffocate professions, particularly in the sciences, due to natural hostility between democracy and technocracy. The United States might yet find the right balance by inculcating a politically sophisticated professionalism. In other areas of heavy government responsibility—finance, health care, foreign intelligence, and defense—officials and the public have over time placed considerable trust in expert agents. With greater scientific literacy at the mass level and greater political literacy at the scientific level, America‘s state and society may forge a somewhat freer, healthier relationship with American science, accruing benefits for U.S. material power in the long run and, in the short run, for persuasive influence in the international system. Science and International Leadership In their book on Leading Sectors and World Powers (1996), George Modelski and William Thompson extended their analysis of innovation back, beyond the birth of industrial capitalism, to the Sung Dynasty in China at the turn of the First Millennium. 2 Modelski and Thompson mentioned inventions like the compass that helped leaders extract wealth from maritime East-West trade routes, but they also noted the Sung rulers‘ cultivation of knowledge and the influence of Chinese intellectuals on administrative reform. A scientific society has the opportunity to apply methods and models toward political and economic questions. Just before the November 2008 elections, the New York Times’ David Ignatius sat down with two former national security advisers, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft, for a series of interviews on foreign policy. 3 In their discussion of complementary strengths that could lay the groundwork for greater transatlantic cooperation, the advisers noted how impressive it was that the European Union could knit together so many independent states with sophisticated, comprehensive rules and regulations without inadvertently strangling economic growth. It seems improbable that Europe could build the administrative structures for a successful common currency or a single labor market without an ethos that came from scientific competence. Progress in the physical sciences can spill over in a way that supports modern institutions and efficient public policy. Spillover to social sciences reinforces the notion that scientific progress and scientific literacy are civilizing influences. As such they can fortify what Joseph Nye termed a country‘s soft power, its capacity to establish appealing precedents for the rest of the world. 4 Science shares properties with Olympic sport in that it can open avenues for non-coercive cultural hegemony. Foreign emulation in science, though, counts for more than soccer or gymnastics. The demonstration effect in physics may initially appear as man-overcoming-Nature rather than man-versusman, but great scientific advance is more cumulative than victory in the Games. Anyone seeking to take the next step must accommodate the vernacular of the pioneer and accept his tutelage in the universal logic governing scientific concepts. Moreover, the ingenuity and skills on display as a citizen in a specific nation-state, albeit working at university, unlocks another secret of nature register around the world as excellence that could someday be harnessed by government and adapted to the state-versus-state context. That fungibility garners international respect and piques interest in greater collaboration. In his study of American science overtures to Europe during the first decades of the Cold War, John Krige related how overlapping interests and in some instances the overlapping community of scientists and government officials infused pure science aid with foreign policy purpose. The construction of CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) for all-European particle research in Geneva. European conferences of the well-connected Ford Foundation and the development of the NATO Science Committee did not simply advance basic knowledge; they also nurtured a special dialogue, unencumbered by normal diplomatic preoccupations. This privileged communication nevertheless facilitated American hegemony and buttressed Western solidarity against intimidation, or alternate offers, from the Soviet Union. In material balance of power terms, the larger economy and more capable nuclear forces of the United States were seen as less threatening to Western Europe than the Red Army, deployed just over the makeshift border with East Germany. 5 Cultural appeal, including scientific prowess as well as liberal democratic ideals, afforded the United States extra diplomatic margin as it simultaneously expanded its own arsenal and its alliances against a technically inferior opponent. Finally, during the late-Cold War, after 1970, the economic rise of Germany and Japan, the larger diplomatic role of China, and the greater international participation from post-colonial governments in the developing world reshaped the global agenda. Problems traditionally managed by the great powers— arms control, arms proliferation, international development, environmental consequences of industrialization and urbanization—were picked up by non-governmental entities who sought to influence state behavior. Given their small budgets and their status as outside observers rather than diplomats or official negotiators, specialized knowledge was their instrument of choice. As transportation and communication technologies improved through the 1980s and 1990s, issue-based groups and public policy institutes proliferated, combining with academic researchers to build epistemic communities.</span><br />

<strong>Increased leadership opens diplomatic channels with China and facilitates a code of conduct</strong><br />
<strong>Foust 12</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Jeff, editor and publisher of The Space Review, “Key space issues for 2013” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2211/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2211/1</a> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Besides these big issues, there are a number of smaller ones to watch in 2013. One of them deals with the future, if any, of a proposed code of conduct for outer space activities. The European Union has proposed such a code, and in 2012 the State Department expressed its support for the concept of a code, although not explicitly endorsing the EU proposal. That raised concerns among some in Congress that the code was a step towards space arms control treaties that they opposed. In the defense authorization bill passed this month, a provision addresses that issue, requiring the administration, should it sign any such code of conduct, to certify “that such agreement has no legally-binding effect or basis for limiting the activities of the United States in outer space.” In addition, the administration is required to provide briefings to Congress about the status any code negotiations and notification upon signing of any such document. However, those provisions may be moot since there seems to be little, if any, progress on the development of a code of conduct. “It’s a good idea in principle. However, I believe it’s largely dead,” said Scott Pace of George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute at the SWF event. “The diplomatic aspect of that has been so badly fumbled that I don’t really think there’s a prospect right now for how to move forward with it.” SWF’s Brian Weeden wasn’t quite as ready to write off the code, but acknowledged the prospects for it weren’t good. Nonetheless, he said, it made sense to continue international dialogue on issues raised by the code. Such discussions are likely to include China, as some people play up a rivalry between the two nations. But others still hold out hope for increased cooperation between China and the US, noting that China’s competition is more with other Asian space powers, like India and Japan, than with America. “I would see forthcoming, maybe in the next four years of the Obama Administration, an opening on a government-to-government cooperative basis for space cooperation between the US and China,” said Eligar Sadeh of Astroconsulting International. “China really is looking for the United States to take the initiative and lead” on space cooperation between the two nations. The challenges with dealing with China, not to mention other obstacles like reduced budgets, point to a need for changes in culture in various government agencies and other organizations, including a willingness to adopt other approaches of doing business that can be faster and less expensive that current methods. </span><br />

<strong>Treaties prevent global conflicts</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #0d0d0d;">Hitchens, 8</span></strong><span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 5pt;"> – president of the Center for Defense Information (Theresa, “Space Wars - Coming to the Sky Near You?”, Scientific American, February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you</a>)</span><br />
<span style="color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 5pt;">Perhaps of even greater concern is that several other nations, including one of China’s regional rivals, India, may feel compelled to seek ­offensive as well as defensive capabilities in space. The U.S. trade journal Defense News, for instance, quoted unidentified Indian defense officials as stating that their country had already begun developing its own kinetic-energy (nonexplosive, hit-to-kill) and laser-based antisatellite weapons. If India goes down that path, its archrival Pakistan will probably follow suit. Like India, Pakistan has a well-developed ballistic missile program, including medium-range missiles that could launch an antisatellite system. Even Japan, the third major Asian power, might join such a space race. In June 2007 the National Diet of Japan began considering a bill backed by the current Fukuda government that would permit the development of satellites for “military and national security” purposes. As for Russia, in the wake of the Chinese test President Vladimir Putin reiterated Moscow’s stance against the weaponization of space. At the same time, though, he refused to criticize Beijing’s actions and blamed the U.S. instead. The American efforts to build a missile defense system, Putin charged, and the increasingly aggressive American plans for a military position in space were prompting China’s moves. Yet Russia itself, as a major spacefaring power that has incorporated satellites into its national security structure, would be hard-pressed to forgo entering an arms race in space. Given the proliferation of spacefaring entities, proponents of a robust space warfare strategy believe that arming the heavens is inevitable and that it would be best for the U.S. to get there first with firepower. Antisatellite and space-based weapons, they argue, will be necessary not only to defend U.S. military and commercial satellites but also to deny any future adversary the use of space capabilities to enhance the performance of its forces on the battlefield. Yet any arms race in space would almost inevitably destabilize the balance of power and thereby multiply the risks of global conflict. In such headlong competition—whether in space or elsewhere—equilibrium among the adversaries would be virtually impossible to maintain. Even if the major powers did achieve stability, that reality would still provide no guarantee that both sides would perceive it to be so. The moment one side saw itself to be slipping behind the other, the first side would be strongly tempted to launch a preemptive strike, before things got even worse. Ironically, the same would hold for the side that perceived itself to have gained an advantage. Again, there would be strong temptation to strike first, before the adversary could catch up. Finally, a space weapons race would ratchet up the chances that a mere technological mistake could trigger a battle. After all, in the distant void, reliably distinguishing an intentional act from an accidental one would be highly problematic. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">Hit-to-Kill InterceptorsAccording to assessments by U.S. military and intelligence officials as well as by independent experts, the Chinese probably destroyed their weather satellite with a kinetic-energy vehicle boosted by a two-stage medium-range ballistic missile. Technologically, launching such direct-ascent antisatellite weapons is one of the simplest ways to take out a satellite. About a dozen nations and consortia can reach low Earth orbit (between roughly 100 and 2,000 kilometers, or 60 to 1,250 miles, high) with a medium-range missile; eight of those countries can reach geostationary orbit (about 36,000 kilometers, or 22,000 miles, above Earth).But the real technical hurdle to making a hit-to-kill vehicle is not launch capacity; it is the precision maneuverability and guidance technology needed to steer the vehicle into its target. Just how well China has mastered those techniques is unclear. Because the weather satellite was still operating when it was destroyed, the Chinese operators would have known its exact location at all times.Ground-Based LasersThe test of China’s direct-ascent antisatellite device came on the heels of press reports in September 2006 that the Chinese had also managed to “paint,” or illuminate, U.S. spy satellites with a ground-based laser [see lower box on page 83]. Was Beijing actually trying to “blind” or otherwise damage the satellites? No one knows, and no consensus seems to have emerged in official Washington circles about the Chinese intent. Per­haps China was simply testing how well its network of low-power laser-ranging stations could track American orbital observation platforms.Even so, the test was provocative. Not all satellites have to be electronically “fried” to be put out of commission. A 1997 test of the army’s MIRACL system (for midinfrared advanced chemical laser) showed that satellites designed to collect optical images can be temporarily disrupted—dazzled—by low-power beams. It follows that among the satellites vulnerable to such an attack are the orbital spies.The U.S. and the former Soviet Union began experimenting with laser-based antisatellite weapons in the 1970s. Engineers in both countries have focused on the many problems of building high-power laser systems that could reliably destroy low-flying satellites from the ground. Such systems could be guided by “adaptive optics”: deformable mirrors that can continuously compensate for atmospheric distortions. But tremendous amounts of energy would be needed to feed high-power lasers, and even then the range and effectiveness of the beams would be severely limited by dispersion, by attenuation as they passed through smoke or clouds, and by the difficulty of keeping the beams on-target long enough to do damage.During the development of the SDI, the U.S. conducted several laser experiments from Hawaii, including a test in which a beam was bounced off a mirror mounted on a satellite. Laser experiments continue at the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. Pentagon budget documents from fiscal years 2004 through 2007 listed antisatellite operations among the goals of the Starfire research, but that language was removed from budget documents in fiscal year 2008 after Congress made inquiries. The Starfire system incorporates adaptive optics that narrow the outgoing laser beam and thus increase the density of its power. That capability is not required for imagery or tracking, further suggesting that Starfire could be used as a weapon.Yet despite decades of work, battle-ready versions of directed-energy weapons still seem far away. An air force planning document, for instance, predicted in 2003 that a ground-based weapon able to “propagate laser beams through the atmosphere to [stun or kill low Earth orbit] satellites” could be available between 2015 and 2030. Given the current state of research, even those dates seem optimistic.Co-orbital SatellitesRecent advances in miniaturized sensors, powerful onboard computers and efficient rocket thrusters have made a third kind of antisatellite technology increasingly feasible: the offensive microsatellite. One example that demonstrates the potential is the air force’s experimental satellite series (XSS) project, which is developing microsatellites intended to conduct “autonomous proximity operations” around larger satellites. The first two microsatellites in the program, the XSS-10 and XSS-11, were launched in 2003 and 2005. Though ostensibly intended to inspect larger satellites, such microsatellites could also ram target satellites or carry explosives or directed-energy payloads such as radio-frequency jamming systems or high-powered microwave emitters. Air force budget documents show that the XSS effort is tied to a program called Advanced Weapons Technology, which is dedicated to research on military laser and microwave systems.During the cold war the Soviet Union developed, tested and even declared operational a co-orbital antisatellite system—a maneuverable interceptor with an explosive payload that was launched by missile into an orbit near a target satellite in low Earth orbit. In effect, the device was a smart “space mine,” but it was last demonstrated in 1982 and is probably no longer working. Today such an interceptor would likely be a microsatellite that could be parked in an orbit that would cross the orbits of several of its potential targets. It could then be activated on command during a close encounter.In 2005 the air force described a program that would provide “localized” space “situational awareness” and “anomaly characterization” for friendly host satellites in geostationary orbit. The program is dubbed ANGELS (for autonomous nanosatellite guardian for evaluating local space), and the budget line believed to represent it focuses on acquiring “high value space asset defensive capabilities,” including a “warning sensor for detection of a direct ascent or co-orbital vehicle.” It is clear that such guardian nanosatellites could also serve as offensive weapons if they were maneuvered close to enemy satellites.And the list goes on. A “parasitic satellite” would shadow or even attach itself to a target in geostationary orbit. Farsat, which was mentioned in an appendix to the [Donald] Rumsfeld Space Commission report in 2001, “would be placed in a ‘storage’ orbit (perhaps with many microsatellites housed inside) relatively far from its target but ready to be maneuvered in for a kill.”Finally, the air force proposed some time ago a space-based radio-frequency weapon system, which “would be a constellation of satellites containing high-power radio-frequency transmitters that possess the capability to disrupt/­destroy/disable a wide variety of electronics and national-level command and control systems.”Air force planning documents from 2003 envisioned that such a technology would emerge after 2015. But outside experts think that orbital radio-frequency and microwave weapons are technically feasible today and could be deployed in the relatively near future.Space BombersThough not by definition a space weapon, the Pentagon’s Common Aero Vehicle/Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (often called CAV) enters into this discussion because, like an ICBM, it would travel through space to strike Earth-bound targets. An unpowered but highly maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle, the CAV would be deployed from a future hypersonic space plane, swoop down into the atmosphere from orbit and drop conventional bombs on ground targets. Congress recently began funding the project but, to avoid stoking a potential arms race in space, has prohibited any work to place weapons on the CAV. Although engineers are making steady progress on the key technologies for the CAV program, both the vehicle and its space plane mothership are still likely decades off.Some of the congressional sensitivity to the design of the CAV may have arisen from another, much more controversial space weapons concept with parallel goals: hypervelocity rod bundles that would be dropped to Earth from orbital platforms. For decades air force planners have been thinking about placing weapons in orbit that could strike terrestrial targets, particularly buried, “hardened” bunkers and caches of weapons of mass destruction. Commonly called “rods from God,” the bundles would be made up of large tungsten rods, each as long as six meters (20 feet) and 30 centimeters (12 inches) across. Each rod would be hurled downward from an orbiting spacecraft and guided to its target at tremendous speed.Both high costs and the laws of physics, however, challenge their feasibility. Ensuring that the projectiles do not burn up or deform from reentry friction while sustaining a precise, nearly vertical flight path would be extremely difficult. Calculations indicate that the nonexplosive rods would probably be no more effective than more conventional munitions. Furthermore, the expense of lofting the heavy projectiles into orbit would be exorbitant. Thus, despite continued interest in them, rods from God seem to fall into the realm of science fiction.Obstacles to Space WeaponsWhat, then, is holding the U.S. (and other nations) back from a full-bore pursuit of space weapons? The countervailing pressures are threefold: political opposition, technological challenges and high costs.The American body politic is deeply divided over the wisdom of making space warfare a part of the national military strategy. The risks are manifold. I remarked earlier on the general instabilities of an arms race, but there is a further issue of stability among the nuclear powers. Early-warning and spy satellites have traditionally played a crucial role in reducing fears of a surprise nuclear attack. But if antisatellite weapons disabled those eyes-in-the-sky, the resulting uncertainty and distrust could rapidly lead to catastrophe.One of the most serious technological challenges posed by space weapons is the proliferation of space debris, to which I alluded earlier. According to investigators at the air force, NASA and Celestrak (an independent space-monitoring Web site), the Chinese antisatellite test left more than 2,000 pieces of junk, baseball-size and larger, orbiting the globe in a cloud that lies between about 200 kilometers (125 miles) and 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) above Earth’s surface. Perhaps another 150,000 objects that are a centimeter (half an inch) across and larger were released. High orbital velocities make even tiny pieces of space junk dangerous to spacecraft of all kinds. And ground stations cannot reliably monitor or track objects smaller than about five centimeters (two inches) across in low Earth orbit (around a meter in geostationary orbit), a capability that might enable satellites to maneuver out of the way. To avoid being damaged by the Chinese space debris, in fact, two U.S. satellites had to alter course. Any shooting war in space would raise the specter of a polluted space environment no longer navigable by Earth-orbiting satellites.Basing weapons in orbit also pre­sents difficult technical obstacles. They would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all kinds of outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic signals, even natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against such threats would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is bulky and adds mass, thereby greatly increasing launch costs. Orbital weapons would be mostly autonomous mechanisms, which would make operational errors and failures likely. The paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to predict, which would make hiding large weapons problematic. And because satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many weapons.Finally, getting into space and operating there is extremely expensive: between $2,000 and $10,000 a pound to reach low Earth orbit and between $15,000 and $20,000 a pound for geostationary orbit. Each space-based weapon would require replacement every seven to 15 years, and in-orbit repairs would not be cheap, either.Alternatives to Space WarfareGiven the risks of space warfare to national and international security, as well as the technical and financial hurdles that must be overcome, it would seem only prudent for spacefaring nations to find ways to prevent an arms race in space. The U.S. focus has been to reduce the vulnerability of its satellite fleet and explore alternatives to its dependence on satellite services. Most other space-capable countries are instead seeking multilateral diplomatic and legal measures. The options range from treaties that would ban antisatellite and space-based weapons to voluntary measures that would help build transparency and mutual confidence.The Bush administration has adamantly opposed any form of negotiations regarding space weapons. Opponents of multilateral space weapons agreements contend that others (particularly China) will sign up but build secret arsenals at the same time, because such treaty violations cannot be detected. They argue further that the U.S. cannot sit idly as potential adversaries gain spaceborne resources that could enhance their terrestrial combat capabilities.Proponents of international treaties counter that failure to negotiate such agreements entails real opportunity costs. An arms race in space may end up compromising the security of all nations, including that of the U.S., while it stretches the economic capacities of the competitors to the breaking point. And whereas many advocates of a space weapons ban concede that it will be difficult to construct a fully verifiable treaty—because space technology can be used for both military and civilian ends—effective treaties already exist that do not require strict verification. A good example is the Biological Weapons Convention. Certainly a prohibition on the testing and use (as opposed to the deployment) of the most dangerous class of near-term space weapons—destructive (as opposed to jamming) antisatellite systems—would be easily verifiable, because earthbound observers can readily detect orbital debris. Furthermore, any party to a treaty would know that all its space launches would be tracked from the ground, and any suspicious object in orbit would promptly be labeled as such. The international outcry that would ensue from such overt treaty violations could deter would-be violators.Since the mid-1990s, however, progress on establishing a new multilateral space regime has lagged. The U.S. has blocked efforts at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to begin negotiations on a treaty to ban space weapons. China, meanwhile, has refused to accept anything less. Hence, intermediate measures such as voluntary confidence-building, space traffic control or a code of responsible conduct for spacefaring nations have remained stalled.Space warfare is not inevitable. But the recent policy shift in the U.S. and China’s provocative actions have highlighted the fact that the world is approaching a crossroads. Countries must come to grips with their strong self-interest in preventing the testing and use of orbital weapons. The nations of Earth must soon decide whether it is possible to sustain the predominantly peaceful human space exploration that has already lasted half a century. The likely alternative would be unacceptable to all.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">C. 1. Lack of reliable access to launch suppliers effectively reduces launch supply. While manufacturing capacity of launch vehicles may be ample, commercial satellite launch customers have a limited range of launch options available. Commercial access to U.S. and Chinese launch services are constrained, leaving Arianespace and ILS as the principal options. In the future, Sea Launch may be a viable option if it emerges from bankruptcy successfully. SpaceX, with the recent successful launch of a Falcon 9 medium-launch vehicle, may also become a viable option—in the long- term, but not now or in the near future. U.S. launch vehicles have an extraordinary record of reliability during the past decade. This has resulted in part from the national security community’s priority on and continued investment in mission assurance. Not surprisingly, given the dominance of the U.S. government as a launch customer and the U.S. government’s focus on mission assurance, the systems and processes for U.S. launch range and operations have been primarily developed around government requirements and culture. Many believe that this has reduced access to launch ranges and added schedule risk for commercial launch customers. These effects can be seen in launch scheduling, the current practice of which often prevents commercial entities from establishing reliable launch dates. The DoD now reserves a launch slot with ULA 30 to 36 m’onths before the launch is scheduled. Typical commercial customers place launch reservations 24 months ahead of the anticipated launch date. Thus, ULA is fully booked for the next three years with government launches, and commercial customers seeking a launch slot are shut out. DoD launches are often delayed, but program offices often release those launch slots very late—a few months before the scheduled launch—thus not allowing commercial customers to take advantage of the newly opened launch slot and leaving valuable launch opportunities unused. As government launch needs change, ULA is provided incentives to meet those changing needs before it meets the needs of any commercial customer. DoD also tends to view specific launch vehicles as committed to a specific DoD launch; when program delays occur, those specific launch vehicles are often not released for commercial use. Finally, commercial launches have sometimes lost launch slots because launch schedules for higher-priority government payloads changed. As a consequence, commercial satellite launch consumers currently have little confidence in their access to U.S. launch or in their ability to hold launch dates even if manifested. Several senior leaders among commercial launch customers and launch providers contend that government and ULA credibility with commercial launch customers is very low. Some suggest that neither the government nor ULA has much incentive to change their practices. Accommodating commercial satellite launches may detract from DoD’s focus on and ULAs support of mission assurance, and some interviewees maintain that the government-ULA contract provides disincentives for ULA to support commercial launches.’4 The lack of structured, constructive dialogue between commercial operators and DoD launch range operators makes addressing some of these problems difficult.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The MARS needs to continue to distinguish itself as a leading spaceport. Virginia has led the way in promoting its space industry and will need to continue these efforts. The symbiotic relationship between the MARS and NASA’s WFF will need to continue to evolve. With the declining NASA budget a thriving commercial space industry will be vital in reducing operating costs and ensuring stability and growth during a time of Federal downsizing. NASA has studied the possibility of closing WFF several times. This closure has been prevented by strong political opposition. It is in the best interests of the MARS, NASA, and the commercial space industry to ensure each other’s success and continued utilization of WFF. Since NASA awarded Virginia-based Orbital Science Corporation a CRS contract, a consistent line of funding is in place that must be utilized to the greatest extent possible. NASA will be required to purchase, at a minimum, another 27 cargo flights and 10 crew flights through 2020. The existing contract and the possible future NASA contracts should be used as the anchor tenant to attract more business. The U.S. Air Force Operationally Responsive Space Office has launched four spacecraft from Wallops with the possibility for more launches in the future. This relationship should continue to be developed and MARS promoted as a responsive, lean launch provider. While the orbital market has a much higher entry cost than the sub-orbital market, continued demonstration of MARS as a lean launch provider could attract emerging space companies like Bigelow Aerospace. The sub-orbital market should take advantage of WFF’s existing airport and infrastructure to perform sub-orbital flights. The MARS’ unique location on the East Coast and near the nation’s capital, and other population centers, places it in a key position to offer sub-orbital flights. The sub-orbital tourism, point-to-point, and research markets are likely to be the highest in demand and should be targeted for future growth. Wallops has a long history of suborbital research and could expand this field to include more commercial launches. FAA’s commercial space transportation regulations are in their infancy but are still minimal. The NASA regulations while more mature and far more complex are being adapted for commercial usage. NASA plans on leaving all commercial space licensing to the FAA. In the future even a NASA mission launched from a Federal range would require an FAA license. NASA is likely to still have their own safety requirements that will be redundant to FAA requirements. A key part to enabling commercial space transportation industry at MARS is reducing the uncertainty about how NASA and FAA regulations will coexist. The nascent commercial space transportation industry has been enabled by NASA investment in COTS, CCDev and CRS. This, along with the FAA’s matching grants and other Federal and state incentives, has helped jump-start the commercial space transportation industry. The possible roadblocks of excessive regulation have been minimized by the FAA’s limited Final Rule on Crew and Space Flight Requirements and the CSLAA. By not certifying vehicles as safe, the FAA acknowledges that passengers will fly at their own risk. While this congressional “hands off” mandate will encourage research and development in this emerging market it could backfire if an accident occurs that results in more strict regulation. After December 23, 2012 the FAA may propose new regulations on the commercial space industry without restriction. The amount of regulations will be dependent upon how much the commercial space industry has matured. Industry lessons learned and best practices are needed to determine future requirements. The FAA has already held public meetings to address many of the concerns facing this emerging market. Specifically, the deconfliction of FAA and NASA regulations will be necessary to prevent duplication of efforts. Both regulators need to ensure their requirements are compatible or complementary for both government and non-government organizations. The development of a robust commercial space transportation industry is important to the U. S. and its National Security in many different areas. Economically, a strong space industry and a vigorous space launch schedule will promote space jobs and programs to stay in the U. S. A larger and more experienced space industrial base will greatly benefit National Security Space programs and develop national capabilities in new technical realms. Another important impact to National Security Space is the required expansion and growth of the space transportation infrastructure. Similar to the railroads, interstate highways, and airports of today a space transportation infrastructure will need to be developed and will be a requirement for future growth and expansion. Without this infrastructure National Security Space will be required to maintain its own aging infrastructure and would not be able to benefit from new construction, technology and innovations that the commercial space sector would develop on its own. In a shrinking Global economy the commercial space industry will be vital in maintaining the competitive edge in, and our access to, space. The more developed the U.S. commercial space industry is the more likely it will be able to adapt and overcome any challenges it is faced with. It is in the U.S. Government’s strategic interest to remain a leader in the Global space transportation industry. This emerging commercial space transportation market has the potential to become a thriving industry with proper investment and minimal regulation.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Space policy retains a peculiar character to it in that the rhetoric is often frontier analogy driven but the economic realities remain often government funded development with the private sector taking over once developmental success has been acquired. This means that the industry is dominated by the desires of the federal government whether the military or civilian, meaning NASA. This mind set reflects the early growth of the field in a time when national security needs drove what was done in terms of space activities. Over the years, that pattern has broken down with regards to many space applications especially in communications and navigation. Space launch however retains that imprint of the national security state. The Ansari X-Prize was a deliberate attempt to break the cycle of government control but that was only partially successful. Sending humans to orbit still remains strictly a government activity, suborbital is now open to private vendors but efforts at orbital flight remain more distant even though there was an earlier America Prize suggested for encouraging efforts at reaching orbit and back similar to the Ansari X-Prize with the prize being set at $50 million. 25 What appears to be occurring is that a separation is growing between the older spaceports located on federal spaceports and the newer proposals. All three, California, Florida and Virginia, remain focused on orbital flights using ELVs presently but are open to RLVs once those are developed especially in the case of Florida with shuttle shutdown looming. That pathway is only possible with the cooperation of the operators of the federal spaceports a reality which remains a hindrance but accommodations are being made. By focusing on processing facilities, the state entities provide a service that lessens the burden on the federal operator. The newer spaceports are more heavily invested in the space tourism aspect of commercial space activities which poses a dilemma. The dilemma is a simple one, what if RLVs do not become economically successful, remember their client base is the private sector, interested in making a profit. Given the cost of purchasing a flight ($200,000 presently), how large the market will be is unclear once you get past the optimism-hype. This reality makes the state spaceport arena more problematic than appears at first glance. 26 Several initiatives are premised on a specific vehicle coming to fruition such as the Rocketplane in Oklahoma; others are in effect being done on spec with no actual tenant identified. As Florida has already found with its RLV storage hanger, that leaves a state in the situation that there is no occupant given the paucity of available tenants. As was mentioned earlier, the death of the VentureStar meant that the many states lost their justification for pursuing a spaceport so their pursuit slackened and in some cases went dormant. The continuing issue’s with SpaceX regarding successful flight is particularly disappointing for Florida since they have in effect bet their money on the Falcon 1 and its successor the Falcon 9 being successful and being used to supply the ISS. What is more troubling for state spaceport initiatives is the reality that there are international competitors for the opportunity to be the launch port for RLV vehicles. Singapore and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates have been put forth as launch points for the Explorer vehicle, a derivative of the “Cosmopolis XXI (C-21), a multi-passenger space plane designed by Russia's Myasishchev Design Bureau (MDB).” 27 What is more important is that the choice was made among ten different sites including several in the United States. The Singapore spaceport appears to be lagging while the site in the UAE appears more substantial. The economics are that the UAE site is closer to potential customers and is less difficult to enter than the United States with its restrictions on foreign travelers. What is more critical here is recognition that U.S. state spaceports are competing clearly in an international market for a limited roster of potential flight partners. Virginia Galactic is rumored to be interested in both locations especially Singapore but is deferring any immediate plans to build facilities – this reflects the fact that development of SpaceShipTwo has been delayed by an accident during development that resulted in three deaths. The Explorer vehicle was not part of the Ansari X-Prize competition; in fact, the Ansari family is invested in the project after helping sponsor the X-Prize. What this does is further heighten the competition between space tourism vendors and states who wish to service them as spaceports. Even in Europe, there is interest in moving into the spaceport business in support of space tourism in the form of Spaceport Sweden. 28 Even more troubling from a state perspective is the fact that suborbital flight as presently conceived is a dead end in that those flights do not get you to orbit in the end. Reaching orbit remains a much more difficult feat given the realities and physics of space launch. A RLV has to overcome weight issues relative to applicable lift capacity. Those weight issues in the end led to the X-33 cancelation; NASA evaluations were either negative or inconclusive whether the weight issue inherent in a single stage to orbit vehicle could be overcome. Making it two stage to orbit is one option but using a lift plane to be the first stage runs into weight and safety questions including re-entry. If reaching orbit was easy; then it would be done already commercially. Presently, all commercially viable space industries operate on the assumption that you do not have to bring the payload back to earth safely. Once the payload’s useful life is exhausted, you either lift it higher into a parking orbit or you allow it either to slowly descend into the atmosphere to be destroyed or you eject it out of orbit in a controlled crash as it were. The result is a major problem with space debris but that is strictly an international level issue; spaceports are becoming increasingly attractive for a number of states as symbols of technological progress and potential economic growth. Space remains glamorous which draws attention but the economics remain much more daunting than the rhetoric would lead one to understand. There is likely to be a continuing market for suborbital tourism but whether that will grow sufficiently in the United States to justify expanded state investment in spaceports is unclear. The original state spaceports, California, Florida, Virginia and Alaska, arose out of the perceived need for more accessible launch facilities for ELVs. The initial focus was upon small launch vehicles, a market that has not met expectations. The first three also have the potential for conducting human spaceflight in the form of RLVs while Alaska’s future is more problematic since it launches government payloads which are more a function of their present political clout than any economic incentive. However, having a useful facility regardless of who funded it originally gives a state an asset that can be exploited as Alaska remains a player. The newer spaceports such as Spaceport America and the Oklahoma Spaceport also have economic potential since they have launch vendors already on board but in the former case, international competition may reduce the economic impact as Virgin Galactic opens up other launch sites closer to its customer base. Other spaceports such as Spaceport Sheboygan have potential as economic incubators fostering industries related to space activities. Launching vehicles will likely remain a lesser priority. There exists no easy road to success for state spaceports because as was clear a decade ago; too much relies on others to develop the technologies that will facilitate reliable and cheaper space launch whether human spaceflight or payloads of applications. The legislative obstacles to state spaceports have been significantly reduced in impact but the spaceports still operate in an environment controlled by the federal government because ultimately that is what international law and practice demand. Private individuals and ventures all enter space with consent of a national government. Other governments remain reluctant to change that pattern since they, as the United States does, remain very much aware of the military potential of space launch regardless of its ostensible peaceful purpose</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The Final Report of the President's Commission on the Future of the US Aerospace Industry came out with some very strong recommendations. And it did so at a time when the country is re-evaluating its commitment to the further exploration and development of space, in the aftermath of the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia. It is not necessary to repeat here all of the recommendations of the Commission. But instead it is worthwhile to pick out those aspects that derive directly from the ASCENT work, and of which NASA and other government agencies associated with the development of space, need to be aware. The country has already lost its leadership in space. US industry has only 40% of global launches today, and the ASCENT Study indicates that unless there is a shift in focus and priorities, then the figure will be down to 25% twenty years from now. There are ramifications both in employment and in the education of our future generations. Even the financially stretched Russian industry is doing better in terms of market share, and is already taking the initiative in the early development of the new commercial opportunities represented by public space travel. The Europeans are gearing up to use the Russian Soyuz system capabilities for their own purposes from the European launch facilities at Kourou. It seems clear that the Chinese will not be far behind, with imminent launches of their first Shenzhou crews. The message for the US government is therefore no less than a need to seek to bring about a reversal of the relative decline of the US as a space power. One part of doing this is to remove some of the impediments for foreign customers to fly their payloads on US launch vehicles. Another way is by taking steps to encourage those infrastructure-and regulatory- developments that will facilitate the growth of a domestic space tourism industry. In this context one must include both sub-orbital and orbital developments and facilities, although the ASCENT Study focused on the latter. The States seem so far to be way ahead of the Federal government in this regard. Many States are exploring the possibilities of having spaceports within their territories to help in their employment and other needs. The Federal government should play its part in facilitating these first steps as the spaceports are being established. The commercial development of space, and its next logical step of space tourism, is the most American of endeavors: it is a way to make money out of people being free and having fun. Of course, down the road, there are other benefits for the nation, and even the world. But at least the ASCENT Study makes abundantly clear that the US cannot expect to rank itself amongst the world's most thriving civilizations if it does not continue on the road that it set for itself at the start of the space age. The more entrepreneurial parts of the commercial sector have seized the message already, and soon we shall see the first sub-orbital space tourists follow in Alan Shepard's footsteps. The Federal government must also play its part. NASA can be directed to work with these new realities. The Aerospace Commission identifies public space travel as an important new sector &quot;??.that holds the potential for increasing launch demand and improvements in space launch reliability and reusability?.?? and would ultimately support a robust space transportation industry with &quot;airline-like operations&quot;?..?&quot; Perhaps the best way for this redirection of NASA to take effect would be in terms of budgetary resource re-allocation. As was discussed earlier, there is no justification for significant expenditures to be taking place on ideas and concepts that have no likelihood of taking place within the next twenty years. The ASCENT Study provides the guidance for this necessary resource reallocation, as discussed earlier in the paper. By the same token, there is a need to actively support initiatives to bring about the new industry of space tourism. At the very least, NASA needs to create a small Office of Public Space Travel to facilitate the needs of the emerging sector, and to coordinate those needs with the Administration's other long-term plans. A good example of an early role for such an office would be an involvement in the OSP architecture design discussions to find ways to ensure that the resulting OSP vehicle design can play a useful part in the future of orbital space tourism. This can be the way in which the US takes back the lead from the Russians in this area, and/or prevents the Chinese from taking this initiative of providing trips for American space tourists. The ASCENT Study makes it very clear what the implications will be if the US does not develop an RLV that can eventually be used for public space travel purposes. The OSP is the best shot we have at this for the short term. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Following the first successful flight of an airplane in 1903, the focus of the aviation industry was on research and development of aircraft technology, not on the development of airfields. A rudimentary set of airfields was established during World War I, but the significant development of airfields in the United States was driven by commerce, such as the need for airmail flights to have refueling and mail drop off sites in various locations. The aviation industry began growing rapidly in the late 1920’s, which then drove the need for improved infrastructure and regulatory frameworks, including licensing. As passenger travel became more commonplace and high capacity aircraft emerged (such as the Boeing 747), the construction of larger airports became a requirement as well as the expansion and improvement of existing airports. This was expensive and required a great deal of government support. Some key dates and events in the development of the airport infrastructure in the United States are presented below in Table 5-1. It is important to note that the overall development of the airport system in the United States was largely reactive, rather than proactive. This was particularly true in the technical and legal regimes. Similarly, spaceport development will likely be driven by the development of the space vehicle industry; however, the additional challenge of integrating spacecraft traffic and infrastructure requirements with that of existing air traffic and infrastructure exists. This will be particularly important for the development of PTP transportation, and unlike the history of airport development, the development and integration of spaceports may require proactive initiatives with regard to legal and technical challenges. The costs of developing the infrastructure to support a growing space industry, particularly that of a PTP suborbital industry, may also have some parallels to early airport development. With respect to demand and public safety, additional construction and improvement of the airport infrastructure was required as the aviation industry evolved. Such improvements were quite expensive and therefore required government support, such as the U.S. Airport and Airway Development Act. Similarly, spaceport construction and infrastructure costs are high, and such ventures often require support from the government. Many spaceports are already supported at least in part by public funding. A selection of spaceports currently under development for suborbital space tourism, their estimated development costs, and sources of funding are shown in Table 5-2 below: As the example of Spaceport America has shown recently, garnering public support and funds can be a challenge (Medina, 2008). Development of a network of spaceports, or integration into the existing airport system, will be an expensive and challenging endeavor. Some savings may be made by using existing facilities, such as decommissioned military bases, and their runways, or by using existing rocket range facilities. Europe in particular, has large numbers of long runways left over from the cold war which would be capable of supporting some suborbital concepts. It may be viable to develop a purpose built spaceport without public funding, especially if it is designed for tourism purposes other than PTP transportation. This is the case with the joint ventures creating the tourism infrastructure for Spaceport Sweden in Kiruna (Spaceport Sweden, 2008).</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Whether or not the US HSF program is actually in retreat depends on one’s point of view. But, as long as the US is not flying humans into space, that point of view is largely irrelevant. What matters in this discussion is the point of view of other nations—and from where they sit, the US suffers from diminished prestige relative to earlier times. It is also seen as a labile partner in cooperative HSF efforts.1 The global response to the release of China’s white paper—evident within 24 hours—suggests there is widespread understanding of (and in some quarters, concern about) at least some of the implications therein. The paper details a methodical approach that builds on what has come before.2 By contrast, when looking to the US for leadership in space, for almost two years other nations have borne witness to a community and a government stuck in a squabble about the merits of “commercial spaceflight” vs. “government spaceflight” or about “Shuttle” vs. “future programs”, or even about “whether government should be involved in spaceflight at all,” a point of view that can only be seriously considered if one is willing to dismiss foreign policy as part of the bargain. Other valuable components of the Obama Administration’s space policy, such as technology development and a focus on capabilities—also with positive implications for soft power—are generally lost in the noise. Seen from a national security perspective, these arguments are mostly spurious. The roles played by NASA and commercial spaceflight providers are not the same. From the point of view of other nations, there is a major policy statement and a variety of implications inherent in a government commitment to a national space program (NASA), particularly HSF: the very Value Proposition (VP) this series has focused on. The same VP does not apply to commercial efforts. They have Value Propositions of their own. A key issue underlying these struggles is lack of clarity within the government as to how—or perhaps if—the United States will balance capabilities and responsibilities resident in private and public civil space sectors, in the interests of national security. In the opinion of the author, this was a major reason for Congressional resistance to the policy shift brought forward by the Obama Administration, although certainly not the only one.3 Pundits have been quick to point to jobs, “pork”, and re-election—and only a naïve observer would disregard those realities—but the hole in US space policy suddenly revealed by the joint occurrence of the end of the Space Shuttle program, the cancellation of Constellation, and the shift to new vendors and procurement processes was not caused by the change in policy, it culminated in it.</span><br />

<strong>No launch pads makes launch costs high, means no private space ventures</strong><br />
<strong>Citizen Space 9/7</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (a project of the United States Rocket Academy, is dedicated to citizen science and citizen space exploration, “Another Vicious Cycle” 9/7/12, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.citizensinspace.org/2012/09/another-vicious-circle/" rel="nofollow">http://www.citizensinspace.org/2012/09/another-vicious-circle/</a></span> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Yesterday, we published an article on how launch pad shortages are causing customers to bundle satellites to reduce the number of launches. Unfortunately, this creates a vicious cycle. The ultimate solution to the launch-pad problem is to transition from expendable launch vehicles to reusable vehicles, which can be prepped quickly and don’t spend a lot of time on the pad. But bundling satellites onto larger rockets reduces the number of launches, which reduces the apparent demand and harms the business case for reusable vehicles. As a result, the pad problem continues. Vicious cycles like this have prevented the development of reusable launch vehicles for 40 years. Right now, NASA is contributing to another vicious cycle in a big way (both figuratively and literally) with the development of the Space Launch System. An ambitious deep-space exploration backed by NASA, could create a market for many hundreds of smalls launches, or it could support the development a superheavy launch system like SLS – but it can’t afford both. At the same, the development of SLS will mean that any exploration hardware NASA develops will be designed to fit on SLS, and impossible to launch on smaller, more economical reusable vehicles which might be developed in the private sector. Thus, the Space Launch System threatens to lock NASA into high launch costs for another generation while depriving private industry of the chance to compete for a market that could bring about a revolution in launch costs. If America is to have a meaningful future in space, we need to break out of these vicious cycles. The solution is not, as some believe, to get the US government to buy a handful of flights to the International Space Station. (There’s a good reason why NASA’s COTS and CCDEV programs are funding expendable vehicles, not reusables.) To make real progress, we need thousands of launches. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Initially, states are analogizing spaceports to airports, which can be reasonable, and relationships among local, state, and federal authorities can be forged using the airport model. As spaceports develop, however, it may become necessary to consider factors that are inapplicable to airports, chief among which is Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, which makes the U.S. government responsible for supervising all U.S. nongovernmental space actors.21 As a result, the federal government may increasingly need to supervise spaceport operations more closely than it does traditional airports, and may need to invoke the constitutional doctrine of preemption to ensure that the United States meets its obligations under that treaty.22 The Future of the Future for Spaceports In August 2009, the U.S. Department of Transportation created the Commercial Space Transportation Center of Excellence, led by New Mexico State University, as part of the FAA’s Air Transportation Centers of Excellence Program.23 Under the program, the FAA works with universities and members of the aviation industry with the goal of increasing the safety and efficiency of the air transportation system. Because commercial space flight is not confined to the United States, its development and, in turn, that of spaceports are likely to affect the development of international law. For example, a spaceport is planned for Kiruna, Sweden. In January 2009, Spaceport America and Spaceport Sweden signed a memorandum of understanding outlining cooperative efforts, and will consider each other to be “Sister Spaceports,” analogous to the “Sister Cities” program between U.S. and non-U.S. cities. In October 2009, seven nonfederal existing or proposed spaceports and three non-U.S. spaceports formed the Spaceports Council within the Commercial Spaceflight Federation.24 Spaceports also have international law implications. For example, in order to reduce travel time, there are plans to operate point-to-point, longdistance commercial transportation using suborbital flights. This could lead to the development of spaceports near large cities, rather than the current preference for remote or smaller city locations, in order to facilitate suborbital transportation on U.S.–foreign city–pair routes. This will also involve the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), comprehensive improvements to the National Airspace System, and plans to reduce airspace and airport congestion throughout the U.S. air transportation system.25 On May 4, 2010, the FAA announced the inauguration of the Commercial Space Transportation Grants Program and requested applications for grants.26 More significantly, on June 28, 2010, the Obama administration announced a new National Space Policy of the United States of America, including initiatives for increased commercial and other private-sector space activity and public–private sector cooperation. The Space Policy contemplates increases in NASA’s budget of $6 billion over the next five years. NASA had already invested $50 million in five private-sector entities for commercial space flight research and development. The Space Policy’s Second Principle states: A robust and competitive commercial space sector is vital to continued progress in space. The United States is committed to encouraging and facilitating the growth of a U.S. commercial space sector that supports U.S. needs, is globally competitive, and advances U.S. leadership in the generation of new markets and innovation-driven entrepreneurship.27 Most recently, on September 29, 2010, the Senate passed S. 3729, giving NASA a three-year authorization and matching the $19 billion that the Obama administration had requested for NASA for fiscal year 2011. The bill authorizes $612 million for commercial crew and cargo services development in 2011 and $500 million for commercial crew development in 2012 and 2013. Conclusion A range of developments, including current and proposed spaceport projects, the new federal grant program, contemplated international suborbital travel, the Spaceports Council, NextGen, the new National Space Policy, and the NASA authorization, all indicate an increasing role for spaceports in aviation and aerospace law. Taking a long-term view that looks beyond the immediate state of the recovering economy, these developments hopefully mark a revival of the interest in space that was so prevalent during the 1950s and 1960s. This renewed interest in space draws on the support of international cooperation, rather than the competition and hostility between superpowers that characterized the Cold War and its related “space race.” In today’s environment, competition will focus on the business and commercial spheres, rather than solely or principally on political and military aspects. The diversity of issues presented by the planning, funding, development, and operation of spaceports similarly raises a wide, and increasingly diverse, range of legal issues for spaceports and their owners, operators, and users.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">I will start my discussion with neoliberal institutionalism (Keohane 1989; Keohane 1984), one of the most prominent theories of international cooperation. Neoliberal institutionalism belongs to the rationalist approaches to international regimes that conceptualize their actors as self-interested and goal-seeking. States are the central actors in international relations; they have stable preferences and aim at the maximization of their individual utility. States’ preferences about outcomes are seen as stable over time. This, however, does not mean that change on the international level cannot be explained by this approach. Preferences over policy options can change, mostly as a result of a change in the expected utility of certain options. Cooperation within a certain issue-area may seem too risky, but with the establishment of an international regime, cooperation becomes the preferred policy. The central point here is that the interests of the states – conceptualized as their preferences over outcomes that maximize their utility – determine their behaviour and thereby their interaction on the international levels. How do states manage to cooperate within the rather cooperation-unfriendly environment of international anarchy? The answer of institutionalism is straightforward. International institutions, especially international regimes, enable states to cooperate despite the fact that in an anarchic world, there is no power that can hinder the other states from cheating. In an interdependent world, states often have mutual interests. Zero-sum games are the exception, not the rule. However, these mutual interests must not be taken as a guarantee for international cooperation, as there are various collective action problems that hinder international cooperation. The most famous of these is the so-called “prisoner’s dilemma”. The prisoner’s dilemma is a symmetrical game with two players. Each has the option to cooperate (C) or to defect (D), and each player prefers mutual cooperation to mutual defection. However, the best outcome for each player is a situation in which he defects while the other side chooses to cooperate (DC). It follows that cooperating while the other player defects (CD) is the worst outcome. In such a situation, cooperation is highly unlikely because it is rational for each player to choose defection since he will achieve a higher pay-off than with cooperation.7 International regimes help rational egoists to cooperate in situations similar to the “prisoner’s dilemma”, where uncertainty is the central problem. States do not know if they can trust in their partners – if they can expect them to stick to their commitments. At this point, regimes come into play. Regimes reduce this risk of defection by clearly defining cooperation and often by setting up monitoring agreements. These agreements make information available on the compliance of the cooperation partners, lowering the risk of cooperation. Each is informed about the non-cooperation of the other(s) and can change its own strategy, and the probability of being identified as a cheater reduces the expected utility of cheating. However, it is important that the “game” is not played as a one-shot-game, as it is essential that the so-called “shadow of the future” enables states to follow a strategy of reciprocity. This means that a state chooses to reward cooperation of the other side with cooperation in the future and accordingly to punish current defection with defection in the future.8 The explanation for the establishment of international regimes is a functional one, meaning that it “account*s+ for causes in terms of their effects” (Keohane 1984, 80). In the case of international regimes, the positive effects of regimes are the causes that lead to their establishment. “Institutions exist, because they would have reasonably been expected to increase the welfare of their creator” (Keohane 1984, 80). In the literature, it is quite common to analyze the decisions of states to arm or not to arm as a prisoner’s dilemma (Müller and Schörnig 2006, 40–7; Stein 1983, 312–3). The collective optimum would be no armament or at least the control of armament on both sides. However, there is the temptation to acquire a (decisive) advantage by choosing defection (arming). The insecurity about the motives of the other state(s) makes all sides choose defection and arming is the dominant strategy. This basic logic holds for preventive arms control in space, too. Luithardt (2009) analyses the case of space weapons from this perspective. I follow his argument and present some data to support it. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The NSSS does not go far enough, in Grego's opinion. She criticized the document for failing to emphasize arms control agreements &quot;as part of a larger scheme for keeping space secure&quot; and for failing to recommend that the United States take the lead on space diplomacy. Well-crafted arms control proposals could lower the risk of arms races or conflicts in space or on the ground, Grego said, and protect the space environment from the harmful debris caused when countries deliberately destroy satellites. &quot;A more robust diplomatic initiative that includes the major space-faring countries would have the potential to increase cooperation with countries that are not traditional US military allies,&quot; she added, &quot;and spur other countries to develop realistic proposals that could ensure a safe and sustainable future in space. Diplomatic engagement could help relieve suspicions among countries, reduce incentives for building anti-satellite systems and other space weapons by establishing negotiated limits, and avert space disputes.&quot; The UCS released a report last year which called for the US government to &quot;declare that the United States will not intentionally damage or disable satellites&quot; and &quot;press other space powers to make the same pledge.&quot; The report recommended that the US make satellites &quot;more resistant to interference and develop ways to quickly replace them or compensate with other measures if they are disabled.&quot; The report also called for the US to assemble an expert negotiating team and to &quot;engage in international discussions on space.&quot; &quot;The United States should play an active and leading role in engaging the international community to further develop space laws and norms and to keep space free of weapons,&quot; said Grego. &quot;A Code of Conduct provides a useful but preliminary standard for responsible space conduct. It should be a first step, but not the last.”</span><br />

<strong>AND, Space operations key to national credibility and soft power</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">John Logsdon (Professor of Political Science at George Washington University, former director of the Space Policy Institute), The Journal for Space and Missile Professionals, March 2007, “Human Space Flight and National Power”, Volume 3, Number 2, accessed March 13, 2012, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3416:http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA520377 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA520377" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA520377</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3416 --></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">What the above analysis suggests is that if human space flight has made, and will continue to make, a significant contribution to US national power, that contribution will come in the form of “soft power.” That this could be the case has been recognized from the start of the US human space flight program. For example, the first comprehensive statement of US space policy, approved by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in January 1960, declared, “To the layman, manned space flight and exploration will represent the true conquest of outer space. No unmanned experiment can substitute for manned exploration in its psychological effect on the peoples of the world.” 7 The May 1961 DoD memorandum suggesting to President John F. Kennedy that he set a manned lunar landing as a national goal noted that “Dramatic achievements in space … symbolize the technological power and organizing capabilities of a nation,” that “This nation needs to make a positive decision to pursue space projects aimed at national prestige. Our attainments are a major element in the international competition between the Soviet system and our own. … ‘civilian’ projects such as lunar and planetary exploration are, in this sense, part of the battle along the fluid front of the cold war,” that “such undertakings may affect our military strength only indirectly if at all, but they have an increasing effect on our national posture,” and that “It is man, not machines, that captures the imagination of the world.” 8 The case for the soft power payoffs from human space flight may have most clearly and pungently been stated by former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who in 1971 was deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Writing to President Richard M. Nixon about recommendations of the OMB staff to cancel the two remaining Apollo flights and to not approve Space Shuttle development decision which would have had the effect of ending the US human space flight program, Weinberger suggested: Recent Apollo flights have been very successful from all points of view. Most important is the fact that they give the American people a much needed lift in spirit, (and the people of the world an equally needed look at American superiority). [Canceling Apollo 16 and 17 and not approving Shuttle development] would be confirming in some respects a belief that I fear is gaining credence at home and abroad: That our best years are behind us, that we are turning inward, reducing our defense commitments, and voluntarily starting to give up our super-power status, and our desire to maintain world superiority. 9 Twelve years later, NASA made much the same argument in the briefing to President Ronald W. Reagan which asked him to approve the development of a space station, saying that “The presence of man is the key to leadership in space.” 10 Unfortunately, neither the Space Shuttle nor the International Space Station (ISS) programs have lived up to their promised performance, and thus it is a fair question to ask whether human space flight as carried out by NASA over the past quarter century has been a significant contributor to US soft power. The recent contribution of human spaceflight to US national prestige is uncertain, particularly given the uneven record of the international partnership on the ISS. However, the ability to carry non-US astronauts on the space shuttle is a useful foreign policy tool. Even so, space achievements involving direct human presence remain a potent source of national pride, and that such pride is the primary underpinning reason why the US public continues to support human spaceflight. Certainly, space images—an American astronaut on the Moon, a Space Shuttle launch—rank only below the American flag and the bald eagle as patriotic symbols, and such patriotism is a foundation of US soft (and hard) power. The self-image of the United States as a successful nation is threatened when we fail in our space efforts, and catastrophes such as Challenger and Columbia seem to tap deep emotions. Space Exploration and National Power President George W. Bush announced a new US “Vision for Space Exploration” on 14 January 2004; that vision aims at “a sustained and affordable human and robotic partnership to explore the solar system and beyond,” with an initial human return to the Moon and the human missions to Mars. The fundamental goal of the vision is “to advance US scientific, security, and economic objectives.” [emphasis added] 11 In what ways can human exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond contribute to space power, and thus to national security? This question has been eloquently addressed by the current NASA administrator, Dr. Michael D. Griffin: “The most enlightened, yet least discussed, aspect of national security involves being the kind of nation and, doing the kinds of things, that inspire others to want to cooperate as allies and partners rather than to be adversaries. And in my opinion, this is NASA’s greatest contribution to our Nation’s future in the world.” He added, Today, and yet not for much longer, America’s ability to lead a robust program of human and robotic exploration sets us above and apart from all others. It offers the perfect venue for leadership in an alliance of great nations, and provides the perfect opportunity to bind others to us as partners in the pursuit of common dreams. And if we are a nation joined with others in pursuit of such goals, all will be less likely to pursue conflict in other arenas. Griffin went even further in his analysis: “Imagine if you will a world of some future time—whether it be 2020 or 2040 or whenever—when some other nations or alliances are capable of reaching and exploring the Moon, or voyaging to Mars, and the United States cannot and does not. Is it even conceivable that in such a world America would still be regarded as a leader among nations, never mind the leader?” He asked “Are we willing to accept those consequences?” 12 These remarks have been quoted at some length because they sum up the core argument of this essay—that human space flight, well conceived and well executed, is a valuable source of soft power for the United States. Whether or not direct military or economic benefits flow from having the ability to send people to orbit and beyond, human space flight will continue to make an important contribution to having the rest of the world see the United States as a great country.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">To discover sustainable hegemony in an increasingly multipolar world, American policy makers will need more than the Kaysen list of advantages from basic science. Dr. Carl Kaysen served President John Kennedy as deputy national security adviser and over his long career held distinguished professorships in Political Economy at Harvard and MIT. During the 1960s, Kaysen laid out a framework with four important reasons why a great power, the United States in particular, should take a strategic interest in the basic sciences. 1. Scientific discoveries provided the input for applied research, which in turn produced technologies crucial for wielding economic and military power. 2. Scientific activity educated a cadre of operators for leadership in industries relevant to government such as health care and defense. 3. Science proficiency generated the raw elements for mounting focused, applied efforts such as the Manhattan Project during World War II to build the first atomic bomb. 4. Scientific progress built a basic research reserve that when necessary could move quickly to shore up national needs. 1 These arguments underscored science‘s contribution to new products and services that provided market or military advantages. The pursuit of physics, chemistry, and biology at the frontiers of knowledge could have direct effects on national excellence. The following sections of this article extend Kaysen‘s list for the present multi-polar world. The United States‘ largest military and economic shares in such a world do not guarantee empire. Soft power from scientific achievement, however, may make up part of the deficit, enough to augment America‘s reputation and American leadership in the international order. The U.S. science establishment is then described and evaluated for its capacity to integrate and leverage the complete list of science benefits: Kaysen‘s nation-based items plus the civilization-based advantages exposited here. Case studies of the Office of Naval Research and U.S. scientific outreach to Brazil illustrate underlying strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. system for maintaining the lead in basic science. Among the weaknesses, democratic regimes tend to suffocate professions, particularly in the sciences, due to natural hostility between democracy and technocracy. The United States might yet find the right balance by inculcating a politically sophisticated professionalism. In other areas of heavy government responsibility—finance, health care, foreign intelligence, and defense—officials and the public have over time placed considerable trust in expert agents. With greater scientific literacy at the mass level and greater political literacy at the scientific level, America‘s state and society may forge a somewhat freer, healthier relationship with American science, accruing benefits for U.S. material power in the long run and, in the short run, for persuasive influence in the international system. Science and International Leadership In their book on Leading Sectors and World Powers (1996), George Modelski and William Thompson extended their analysis of innovation back, beyond the birth of industrial capitalism, to the Sung Dynasty in China at the turn of the First Millennium. 2 Modelski and Thompson mentioned inventions like the compass that helped leaders extract wealth from maritime East-West trade routes, but they also noted the Sung rulers‘ cultivation of knowledge and the influence of Chinese intellectuals on administrative reform. A scientific society has the opportunity to apply methods and models toward political and economic questions. Just before the November 2008 elections, the New York Times’ David Ignatius sat down with two former national security advisers, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft, for a series of interviews on foreign policy. 3 In their discussion of complementary strengths that could lay the groundwork for greater transatlantic cooperation, the advisers noted how impressive it was that the European Union could knit together so many independent states with sophisticated, comprehensive rules and regulations without inadvertently strangling economic growth. It seems improbable that Europe could build the administrative structures for a successful common currency or a single labor market without an ethos that came from scientific competence. Progress in the physical sciences can spill over in a way that supports modern institutions and efficient public policy. Spillover to social sciences reinforces the notion that scientific progress and scientific literacy are civilizing influences. As such they can fortify what Joseph Nye termed a country‘s soft power, its capacity to establish appealing precedents for the rest of the world. 4 Science shares properties with Olympic sport in that it can open avenues for non-coercive cultural hegemony. Foreign emulation in science, though, counts for more than soccer or gymnastics. The demonstration effect in physics may initially appear as man-overcoming-Nature rather than man-versusman, but great scientific advance is more cumulative than victory in the Games. Anyone seeking to take the next step must accommodate the vernacular of the pioneer and accept his tutelage in the universal logic governing scientific concepts. Moreover, the ingenuity and skills on display as a citizen in a specific nation-state, albeit working at university, unlocks another secret of nature register around the world as excellence that could someday be harnessed by government and adapted to the state-versus-state context. That fungibility garners international respect and piques interest in greater collaboration. In his study of American science overtures to Europe during the first decades of the Cold War, John Krige related how overlapping interests and in some instances the overlapping community of scientists and government officials infused pure science aid with foreign policy purpose. The construction of CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) for all-European particle research in Geneva. European conferences of the well-connected Ford Foundation and the development of the NATO Science Committee did not simply advance basic knowledge; they also nurtured a special dialogue, unencumbered by normal diplomatic preoccupations. This privileged communication nevertheless facilitated American hegemony and buttressed Western solidarity against intimidation, or alternate offers, from the Soviet Union. In material balance of power terms, the larger economy and more capable nuclear forces of the United States were seen as less threatening to Western Europe than the Red Army, deployed just over the makeshift border with East Germany. 5 Cultural appeal, including scientific prowess as well as liberal democratic ideals, afforded the United States extra diplomatic margin as it simultaneously expanded its own arsenal and its alliances against a technically inferior opponent. Finally, during the late-Cold War, after 1970, the economic rise of Germany and Japan, the larger diplomatic role of China, and the greater international participation from post-colonial governments in the developing world reshaped the global agenda. Problems traditionally managed by the great powers— arms control, arms proliferation, international development, environmental consequences of industrialization and urbanization—were picked up by non-governmental entities who sought to influence state behavior. Given their small budgets and their status as outside observers rather than diplomats or official negotiators, specialized knowledge was their instrument of choice. As transportation and communication technologies improved through the 1980s and 1990s, issue-based groups and public policy institutes proliferated, combining with academic researchers to build epistemic communities.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Soft power is the ability to attract people to our side without coercion. Legitimacy is central to soft power. If a people or nation believes American objectives to be legitimate, we are more likely to persuade them to follow our lead without using threats and bribes. Legitimacy can also reduce opposition to—and the costs of—using hard power when the situation demands. Appealing to others’ values, interests, and preferences can, in certain circumstances, replace the dependence on carrots and sticks. Cooperation is always a matter of degree, and it is profoundly influenced by attraction. This is evident in the changing nature of conflict today, including in Iraq and against al Qaeda. In traditional conflict, once the enemy is vanquished militarily, he is likely to sue for peace. But many of the organizations against which we are fighting control no territory, hold few assets, and sprout new leaders for each one that is killed. Victory in the traditional sense is elusive. Militaries are well suited to defeating states, but they are often poor instruments to fight ideas. Today, victory depends on attracting foreign populations to our side and helping them to build capable, democratic states. Soft power is essential to winning the peace. It is easier to attract people to democracy than to coerce them to be democratic. Since America rose on the world stage in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it has wielded a distinctive blend of hard and soft power. Despite nineteenth-century military adventures in the Western hemisphere and in the Philippines, the U.S. military has not been put in the service of building a colonial empire in the manner of European militaries. Particularly since World War II, America has sought to promote rules and order in a world in which life continues to be nasty, brutish, and short for the majority of inhabitants. American sources of soft power are plentiful. Soft power is more than mere cultural power, although the appeal of Hollywood and American products can play a role in inspiring the dreams and desires of others. Sources include the political values and ideas enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights, U.S. economic and educational systems, personal contacts and exchanges, and our somewhat reluctant participation and leadership in institutions that help shape the global agenda. One of the biggest sources of U.S. soft power is quite simply America’s obvious success as a nation. Not everyone looks forward to a more interconnected and tolerant world. These ideas can be threatening to those who consider their way of life to be under siege by the West. Those who feel this divide most strongly are often the very people who seek to fight America and its allies. Yet every year the United States attracts more than four times the number of immigrants than any other country, and hundreds of thousands of foreign scholars and students as well. America’s history as an immigrant nation is an important source of its soft power. There is an enormous strength and vitality in the American civic spirit of opportunity, tolerance, mutual respect, and shared commitment and in an economy that rewards innovation and hard work. For people everywhere, the United States can be a partner for a better life. wHat IS Smart Power? Smart power is neither hard nor soft—it is the skillful combination of both. Smart power means developing an integrated strategy, resource base, and tool kit to achieve American objectives, drawing on both hard and soft power. It is an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships, and institutions at all levels to expand American influence and establish the legitimacy of American action. Providing for the global good is central to this effort because it helps America reconcile its overwhelming power with the rest of the world’s interests and values. Elements of this approach exist today in U.S. foreign policy, but they lack a cohesive rationale and institutional grounding. Three main obstacles exist. First, U.S. foreign policy has tended to over-rely on hard power because it is the most direct and visible source of American strength. The Pentagon is the best trained and best resourced arm of the federal government. As a result, it tends to fill every void, even those that civilian instruments should fill. America must retain its military superiority, but in today’s context, there are limits to what hard power can achieve on its own. Second, U.S. foreign policy is still struggling to develop soft power instruments. Diplomatic tools and foreign assistance are often directed toward states, which increasingly compete for power with non-state actors within their borders. Diplomacy and foreign assistance are often underfunded and underused. These tools are neglected i part because of the difficulty of demonstrating their short-term impact on critical challenges. Figure 1 shows U.S. spending on international affairs over the past 20 years. Note that funding was generally stagnant for a decade. Increases in the early 1990s—due primarily to economic aid to Eastern and Central Europe—were offset by reductions in development assistance and public diplomacy funding. Increases from 1999 to 2002 were driven in part by security concerns following the embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar el Salaam. Recent increases are on account of support to critical countries in the war on terror, the Millennium Challenge Corporation and PEPFAR initiatives, and humanitarian emergencies. It should come as no surprise that some of the best-funded and most appreciated soft power tools have been humanitarian operations carried out by the U.S. military such as tsunami relief in Southeast Asia and the earthquake response in Pakistan, since these operations produced results that were clear, measurable, and unassailable. Wielding soft power is especially difficult, however, because many of America’s soft power resources lie outside of government in the private sector and civil society, in its bilateral alliances, or through its participation in multilateral institutions. Third, U.S. foreign policy institutions are fractured and compartmentalized. Coordination, where there is any, happens either at a relatively low level or else at the very highest levels of government—both typically in crisis settings that drive out long-range planning. Stovepiped institutional cultures inhibit joint action. More thought should also be put into sequencing and integrating hard and soft power instruments, particularly in the same operating theater. Some elements of this approach are already occurring in the conduct of ongoing counterinsurgency, nation building, and counterterrorism operations—tasks that depend critically but only partially on hard power. The United States has in its past wielded hard and soft power in concert, with each contributing a necessary component to a larger aim. We used hard power to deter the Soviet Union during the Cold War and soft power to rebuild Japan and Europe with the Marshall Plan and to establish institutions and norms that have become the core of the international system. Today’s context presents a unique set of challenges, however, and requires a new way of thinking about American power Today's Challenges The twenty-first century presents a number of unique foreign policy challenges for today’s decisionmakers. These challenges exist at an international, transnational, and global level. Despite America’s status as the lone global power and concerns about the durability of the current international order, America should renew its commitment to the current order and help find a way for today’s norms and institutions to accommodate rising powers that may hold a different set of principles and values. Furthermore, even countries invested in the current order may waver in their commitment to take action to minimize the threats posed by violent non-state actors and regional powers who challenge this order. The information age has heightened political consciousness, but also made political groupings less cohesive. Small, adaptable, transnational networks have access to tools of destruction that are increasingly cheap, easy to conceal, and more readily available. Although the integration of the global economy has brought tremendous benefits, threats such as pandemic disease and the collapse of financial markets are more distributed and more likely to arise without warning. The threat of widespread physical harm to the planet posed by nuclear catastrophe has existed for half a century, though the realization of the threat will become more likely as the number of nuclear weapons states increases. The potential security challenges posed by climate change raise the possibility of an entirely new set of threats for the United States to consider. The next administration will need a strategy that speaks to each of these challenges. Whatever specific approach it decides to take, two principles will be certain: First, an extra dollar spent on hard power will not necessarily bring an extra dollar’s worth of security. It is difficult to know how to invest wisely when there is not a budget based on a strategy that specifies trade-offs among instruments. Moreover, hard power capabilities are a necessary but insufficient guarantee of security in today’s context. Second, success and failure will turn on the ability to win new allies and strengthen old ones both in government and civil society. The key is not how many enemies the United States kills, but how many allies it grows.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Cooperation on the scientific aspects of sensitive issues may sometimes be the only way to initiate a wider political dialogue. The soft power of science, and the universality of scientific methods, can be used to diffuse tensions even in ‘hard power’ scenarios, such as those relating to traditional military threats. For example, technologies to verify nuclear arms control agreements were a rare focus of joint working between the US and USSR during the Cold War. Lessons from the Cold War are once again highly pertinent. In the run-up to the May 2010 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nuclear disarmament is firmly back on the international agenda. However, the timescale for disarmament is long, as illustrated by the history of negotiations over the Chemical Weapons Convention. After the Geneva Convention banned the use of chemical weapons in 1925, negotiations for a treaty banning their production and stockpiling did not start until the 1980s, and the convention entered into force only in 1997. Even now, stockpiles of chemical weapons in the US and Russia have yet to be destroyed. So focusing in 2010 on the challenges of the final stages of a nuclear disarmament process may be premature. A more practical next step could be to establish the scientific requirements for the verification regime necessary to support future stages of negotiation (Pregenzer 2008). In 2008, the Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs suggested that a high-level Intergovernmental Panel on Nuclear Disarmament could be established (based on the model of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). This panel could begin by identifying the scientific and technical aspects of disarmament, and then set out a research agenda necessary to achieve them. International cooperation would be essential, both between nuclear and non-nuclear weapon states, as all would need to have confidence that reductions are taking place. The recent initiative between the UK and Norwegian governments on disarmament verification sets a precedent here, and could be expanded to include additional States (VERTIC 2009). However, security threats now extend beyond the military domain, with environmental security attracting particular attention (Abbott C, Rogers P &amp; Sloboda S 2007). Essential resources, such as freshwater, cultivable land, crop yields and fish stocks, are likely to become scarcer in many parts of the world, increasing the risk of competition over resources within and between states (UNEP 2009). This could intensify as previously inaccessible regions, such as the Arctic Ocean, open up as a consequence of climate change and ice melt. Substantial parts of the world also risk being left uninhabitable by rising sea levels, reduced freshwater availability or declining agricultural capacity. Many of the regions that are vulnerable to the impacts of these multiple stresses are already the locus of existing instability and conflict (see Figure 2).</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973).</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Andrew Mack and his colleagues at the Human Security Report Project are to be congratulated. Not only do they present a study with a striking conclusion, driven by data, free of theoretical or ideological bias, but they also do something quite unfashionable: they bear good news. Social scientists really are not supposed to do that. Our job is, if not to be Malthusians, then at least to point out disturbing trends, looming catastrophes, and the imbecility and mendacity of policy makers. And then it is to say why, if people listen to us, things will get better. We do this as if our careers depended upon it, and perhaps they do; for if all is going to be well, what need then for us? Our colleagues at Simon Fraser University are brave indeed. That may sound like a setup, but it is not. I shall challenge neither the data nor the general conclusion that violent conflict around the world has been decreasing in fits and starts since the Second World War. When it comes to violent conflict among and within countries, things have been getting better. (The trends have not been linear—Figure 1.1 actually shows that the frequency of interstate wars peaked in the 1980s—but the 65-year movement is clear.) Instead I shall accept that Mack et al. are correct on the macro-trends, and focus on their explanations they advance for these remarkable trends. With apologies to any readers of this forum who recoil from academic debates, this might get mildly theoretical and even more mildly methodological. Concerning international wars, one version of the “nuclear-peace” theory is not in fact laid to rest by the data. It is certainly true that nuclear-armed states have been involved in many wars. They have even been attacked (think of Israel), which falsifies the simple claim of “assured destruction”—that any nuclear country A will deter any kind of attack by any country B because B fears a retaliatory nuclear strike from A. But the most important “nuclear-peace” claim has been about mutually assured destruction, which obtains between two robustly nuclear-armed states. The claim is that (1) rational states having second-strike capabilities—enough deliverable nuclear weaponry to survive a nuclear first strike by an enemy—will have an overwhelming incentive not to attack one another; and (2) we can safely assume that nuclear-armed states are rational. It follows that states with a second-strike capability will not fight one another. Their colossal atomic arsenals neither kept the United States at peace with North Vietnam during the Cold War nor the Soviet Union at peace with Afghanistan. But the argument remains strong that those arsenals did help keep the United States and Soviet Union at peace with each other. Why non-nuclear states are not deterred from fighting nuclear states is an important and open question. But in a time when calls to ban the Bomb are being heard from more and more quarters, we must be clear about precisely what the broad trends toward peace can and cannot tell us. They may tell us nothing about why we have had no World War III, and little about the wisdom of banning the Bomb now. Regarding the downward trend in international war, Professor Mack is friendlier to more palatable theories such as the “democratic peace” (democracies do not fight one another, and the proportion of democracies has increased, hence less war); the interdependence or “commercial peace” (states with extensive economic ties find it irrational to fight one another, and interdependence has increased, hence less war); and the notion that people around the world are more anti-war than their forebears were. Concerning the downward trend in civil wars, he favors theories of economic growth (where commerce is enriching enough people, violence is less appealing—a logic similar to that of the “commercial peace” thesis that applies among nations) and the end of the Cold War (which end reduced superpower support for rival rebel factions in so many Third-World countries). These are all plausible mechanisms for peace. What is more, none of them excludes any other; all could be working toward the same end. That would be somewhat puzzling, however. Is the world just lucky these days? How is it that an array of peace-inducing factors happens to be working coincidentally in our time, when such a magical array was absent in the past? The answer may be that one or more of these mechanisms reinforces some of the others, or perhaps some of them are mutually reinforcing. Some scholars, for example, have been focusing on whether economic growth might support democracy and vice versa, and whether both might support international cooperation, including to end civil wars. We would still need to explain how this charmed circle of causes got started, however. And here let me raise another factor, perhaps even less appealing than the “nuclear peace” thesis, at least outside of the United States. That factor is what international relations scholars call hegemony—specifically American hegemony. A theory that many regard as discredited, but that refuses to go away, is called hegemonic stability theory. The theory emerged in the 1970s in the realm of international political economy. It asserts that for the global economy to remain open—for countries to keep barriers to trade and investment low—one powerful country must take the lead. Depending on the theorist we consult, “taking the lead” entails paying for global public goods (keeping the sea lanes open, providing liquidity to the international economy), coercion (threatening to raise trade barriers or withdraw military protection from countries that cheat on the rules), or both. The theory is skeptical that international cooperation in economic matters can emerge or endure absent a hegemon. The distastefulness of such claims is self-evident: they imply that it is good for everyone the world over if one country has more wealth and power than others. More precisely, they imply that it has been good for the world that the United States has been so predominant. There is no obvious reason why hegemonic stability theory could not apply to other areas of international cooperation, including in security affairs, human rights, international law, peacekeeping (UN or otherwise), and so on. What I want to suggest here—suggest, not test—is that American hegemony might just be a deep cause of the steady decline of political deaths in the world. How could that be? After all, the report states that United States is the third most war-prone country since 1945. Many of the deaths depicted in Figure 10.4 were in wars that involved the United States (the Vietnam War being the leading one). Notwithstanding politicians’ claims to the contrary, a candid look at U.S. foreign policy reveals that the country is as ruthlessly self-interested as any other great power in history. The answer is that U.S. hegemony might just be a deeper cause of the proximate causes outlined by Professor Mack. Consider economic growth and openness to foreign trade and investment, which (so say some theories) render violence irrational. American power and policies may be responsible for these in two related ways. First, at least since the 1940s Washington has prodded other countries to embrace the market capitalism that entails economic openness and produces sustainable economic growth. The United States promotes capitalism for selfish reasons, of course: its own domestic system depends upon growth, which in turn depends upon the efficiency gains from economic interaction with foreign countries, and the more the better. During the Cold War most of its allies accepted some degree of market-driven growth. Second, the U.S.-led western victory in the Cold War damaged the credibility of alternative paths to development—communism and import-substituting industrialization being the two leading ones—and left market capitalism the best model. The end of the Cold War also involved an end to the billions of rubles in Soviet material support for regimes that tried to make these alternative models work. (It also, as Professor Mack notes, eliminated the superpowers’ incentives to feed civil violence in the Third World.) What we call globalization is caused in part by the emergence of the United States as the global hegemon.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The history of the past two decades suggests that adjusting to a plural world is not easy for the United States. As its economic strength is increasingly challenged by relative decline, it clings all the more to its peerless military prowess. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown, that overwhelming military power, evolved over the Cold War, is less and less effective. In many respects, America's geopolitical imagination seems frozen in the posture of the Cold War. The lingering pretension to be the dominant powereverywhere has encouraged the United States to hazard two unpromising land wars, plus a diffuse and interminable struggle against 'terrorism'. Paying for these wars and the pretensions behind them confirms the United States in a new version of Cold War finance. Once more, unmanageable fiscal problems poison the currency, an old pathology that firmly reinstates the nation on its path to decline. It was the hegemonic Cold War role, after all, that put the United States so out of balance with the rest of the world economy. In its hegemonic Cold War position, the United States found it necessary to run very large deficits and was able to finance them simply by creating and exporting more and more dollars. The consequence is today's restless mass of accumulated global money. Hence, whereas the value of all global financial assets in 1980 was just over 100% of global output, by 2008, even after the worst of the financial implosion, that figure had exploded to just under 300%.25 Much of this is no doubt tied up in the massive but relatively inert holdings of the Chinese and Japanese. But thanks to today's instantaneous electronic transfers, huge sums can be marshalled and deployed on very short notice. It is this excess of volatile money that arguably fuels the world's great recurring bubbles. It can create the semblance of vast real wealth for a time, but can also (with little notice) sow chaos in markets, wipe out savings and dry up credit for real investment. What constitutes a morbid overstretch in the American political economy thus ends up as a threat to the world economy in general. To lead itself and the world into a more secure future the United States must put aside its old, unmeasured geopolitical ambitions paid for by unlimited cheap credit. Instead, the United States needs a more balanced view of its role in history. But America's post-Soviet pundits have, unfortunately, proved more skilful at perpetuating outmoded dreams of past glory than at promoting the more modest visions appropriate to a plural future. One can always hope that newer generations of Americans will find it easier to adjust to pluralist reality. The last administration, however, was not very encouraging in this regard. III What about Barack Obama? So far, his economic policy has shown itself probably more intelligent and certainly more articulate than his predecessor's. His thinking is less hobbled by simple-minded doctrines. It accepts government's inescapable role in regulating markets and providing a durable framework for orderly governance and societal fellowship. To be sure, the Obama administration, following in the path of the Bush administration, has carried short-term counter-cyclical stimulation to a previously unimagined level. Perhaps so radical an expansion of credit is unavoidable under present circumstances. The administration is caught between the need to rebalance by scaling back and the fear that restraint applied now will trigger a severe depression. Obama's chief aide, Rahm Emanuel, is famous for observing: 'Rule one: Never allow a crisis to go to waste. They are opportunities to do big things.'26 So far, Obama's administration has made use of its crisis to promote an unprecedented expansion of welfare spending.27 Much of the spending is doubtless good in itself and certainly serves the administration's strong counter-cyclical purposes. But at some point the need to pass from expansion to stabilisation will presumably be inescapable. Budget cuts will have to be found somewhere, and demographic trends suggest that drastic reductions in civilian welfare spending are unlikely. Elementary prudence might suggest that today's financial crisis is an ideal occasion for America's long-overdue retreat from geopolitical overstretch, a time for bringing America's geopolitical pretensions into harmony with its diminishing foreign possibilities and expanding domestic needs. The opportunities for geopolitical saving appear significant. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), current military plans will require an average military budget of $652bn (in 2010 dollars) each year through 2028. The estimate optimistically assumes only 30,000 troops will be engaged abroad after 2013. As the CBO observes, these projections exceed the peak budgets of the Reagan administration's military build-up of the mid-1980s (about $500bn annually in 2010 dollars). This presumes a military budget consuming 3.5% of GDP through 2020.28 Comparable figures for other nations are troubling: 2.28% for the United Kingdom, 2.35% for France, 2.41% for Russia and 1.36% for China.29 Thus, while the financial crisis has certainly made Americans fear for their economic future, it does not yet seem to have resulted in a more modest view of the country's place in the world, or a more prudent approach to military spending. Instead, an addiction to hegemonic status continues to blight the prospects for sound fiscal policy. Financing the inevitable deficits inexorably turns the dollar into an imperial instrument that threatens the world with inflation.</span><br />

<strong>AND, Leadership transition causes apolarity and competition</strong><br />
<strong>(Brezezinski, IR Professor, 12)</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">For if America falters, the world is unlikely to be dominated by a single preeminent successor -- not even China. International uncertainty, increased tension among global competitors, and even outright chaos would be far more likely outcomes. While a sudden, massive crisis of the American system -- for instance, another financial crisis -- would produce a fast-moving chain reaction leading to global political and economic disorder, a steady drift by America into increasingly pervasive decay or endlessly widening warfare with Islam would be unlikely to produce, even by 2025, an effective global successor. No single power will be ready by then to exercise the role that the world, upon the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, expected the United States to play: the leader of a new, globally cooperative world order. More probable would be a protracted phase of rather inconclusive realignments of both global and regional power, with no grand winners and many more losers, in a setting of international uncertainty and even of potentially fatal risks to global well-being. Rather than a world where dreams of democracy flourish, a Hobbesian world of enhanced national security based on varying fusions of authoritarianism, nationalism, and religion could ensue. The leaders of the world's second-rank powers, among them India, Japan, Russia, and some European countries, are already assessing the potential impact of U.S. decline on their respective national interests. The Japanese, fearful of an assertive China dominating the Asian mainland, may be thinking of closer links with Europe. Leaders in India and Japan may be considering closer political and even military cooperation in case America falters and China rises. Russia, while perhaps engaging in wishful thinking (even schadenfreude) about America's uncertain prospects, will almost certainly have its eye on the independent states of the former Soviet Union. Europe, not yet cohesive, would likely be pulled in several directions: Germany and Italy toward Russia because of commercial interests, France and insecure Central Europe in favor of a politically tighter European Union, and Britain toward manipulating a balance within the EU while preserving its special relationship with a declining United States. Others may move more rapidly to carve out their own regional spheres: Turkey in the area of the old Ottoman Empire, Brazil in the Southern Hemisphere, and so forth. None of these countries, however, will have the requisite combination of economic, financial, technological, and military power even to consider inheriting America's leading role. […] At the same time, the security ofa number of weakerstates locatedgeographicallynext to majorregional powers</span><strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> also </span></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">depends on the international status quo reinforced by America's global preeminence -- and would be made significantly more vulnerable in proportion to America's decline. The states in that exposed position -- including Georgia, Taiwan, South Korea, Belarus, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, and the greater Middle East -- are today's geopolitical equivalents of nature's most endangered species. Their fates are closely tied to the nature of the international environment left behind by a waning America, be it ordered and restrained or, much more likely, self-serving and expansionist. A faltering United States could also find its strategic partnership with Mexico in jeopardy. America's economic resilience and political stability have so far mitigated many of the challenges posed by such sensitive neighborhood issues as economic dependence, immigration, and the narcotics trade. A decline in American power, however, would likely undermine the health and good judgment of the U.S. economic and political systems. A waning United States would likely be more nationalistic, more defensive about its national identity, more paranoid about its homeland security, and less willing to sacrifice resources for the sake of others' development. The worsening of relations between a declining America and an internally troubled Mexico could even give rise to a particularly ominous phenomenon: the emergence, as a major issue in nationalistically aroused Mexican politics, of territorial claims justified by history and ignited by cross-border incidents. Another consequence of American decline could be a corrosion of the generally cooperative management of the global commons -- shared interests such as sea lanes, space, cyberspace, and the environment, whose protection is imperative to the long-term growth of the global economy and the continuation of basic geopolitical stability. In almost every case, the potential absence of a constructive and influential U.S. role would fatally undermine the essential communality of the global commons because the superiority and ubiquity of American power creates order where there would normally be conflict.</span><br />

 <strong>Extinction inevitable</strong><br />
<strong>Matheny 7</strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">(Jason G., Research Associate at the Future of Human Institute at Oxford University, Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University, holds a Master’s in Public Health from the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University and an M.B.A. from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, “Reducing the Risk of Human Extinction,” Risk Analysis, Volume 27, Issue 5, October, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3422:http://jgmatheny.org/matheny_extinction_risk.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://jgmatheny.org/matheny_extinction_risk.htm" rel="nofollow">http://jgmatheny.org/matheny_extinction_risk.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3422 --> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">It is possible for humanity (or its descendents) to survive a million years or more, but we could succumb to extinction as soon as this century. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, U.S. President Kennedy estimated the probability of a nuclear holocaust as &quot;somewhere between one out of three and even&quot; (Kennedy, 1969 , p. 110). John von Neumann, as Chairman of the U.S. Air Force Strategic Missiles Evaluation Committee, predicted that it was &quot;absolutely certain (1) that there would be a nuclear war; and (2) that everyone would die in it&quot; (Leslie, 1996 , p. 26). More recent predictions of human extinction are little more optimistic. In their catalogs of extinction risks, Britain's Astronomer Royal, Sir Martin Rees (2003) , gives humanity 50-50 odds on surviving the 21st century; philosopher Nick Bostrom argues that it would be &quot;misguided&quot; to assume that the probability of extinction is less than 25%; and philosopher John Leslie (1996) assigns a 30% probability to extinction during the next five centuries. The &quot;Stern Review&quot; for the U.K. Treasury (2006) assumes that the probability of human extinction during the next century is 10%. And some explanations of the &quot;Fermi Paradox&quot; imply a high probability (close to 100%) of extinction among technological civilizations (Pisani, 2006 ).4 Estimating the probabilities of unprecedented events is subjective, so we should treat these numbers skeptically. Still, even if the probability of extinction is several orders lower, because the stakes are high, it could be wise to invest in extinction countermeasures.</span><br />

<strong>A reduction of the risk of extinction by 1 millionth of 1 percent is would save ten billion lives and comes before any other impact</strong><br />
<strong>Bostrom 11</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Nick, Oxford Martin School &amp; Faculty of Philosophy, 2011, “The Concept of Existential Risk” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3423:http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3423 --> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Holding probability constant, risks become more serious as we move toward the upper-right region of figure 2. For any fixed probability, existential risks are thus more serious than other risk categories. But just how much more serious might not be intuitively obvious. One might think we could get a grip on how bad an existential catastrophe would be by considering some of the worst historical disasters we can think of—such as the two world wars, the Spanish flu pandemic, or the Holocaust—and then imagining something just a bit worse. Yet if we look at global population statistics over time, we find that these horrible events of the past century fail to register (figure 3). Figure 3: World population over the last century. Calamities such as the Spanish flu pandemic, the two world wars, and the Holocaust scarcely register. (If one stares hard at the graph, one can perhaps just barely make out a slight temporary reduction in the rate of growth of the world population during these events.) But even this reflection fails to bring out the seriousness of existential risk. What makes existential catastrophes especially bad is not that they would show up robustly on a plot like the one in figure 3, causing a precipitous drop in world population or average quality of life. Instead, their significance lies primarily in the fact that they would destroy the future. The philosopher Derek Parfit made a similar point with the following thought experiment: I believe that if we destroy mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people think. Compare three outcomes: (1) Peace. (2) A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world’s existing population. (3) A nuclear war that kills 100%. (2) would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of these two differences? Most people believe that the greater difference is between (1) and (2). I believe that the difference between (2) and (3) is very much greater. … The Earth will remain habitable for at least another billion years. Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If we do not destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny fraction of the whole of civilized human history. The difference between (2) and (3) may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of this history. If we compare this possible history to a day, what has occurred so far is only a fraction of a second. (10: 453-454) To calculate the loss associated with an existential catastrophe, we must consider how much value would come to exist in its absence. It turns out that the ultimate potential for Earth-originating intelligent life is literally astronomical. One gets a large number even if one confines one’s consideration to the potential for biological human beings living on Earth. If we suppose with Parfit that our planet will remain habitable for at least another billion years, and we assume that at least one billion people could live on it sustainably, then the potential exist for at least 1018 human lives. These lives could also be considerably better than the average contemporary human life, which is so often marred by disease, poverty, injustice, and various biological limitations that could be partly overcome through continuing technological and moral progress. To calculate the loss associated with an existential catastrophe, we must consider how much value would come to exist in its absence. It turns out that the ultimate potential for Earth-originating intelligent life is literally astronomical. One gets a large number even if one confines one’s consideration to the potential for biological human beings living on Earth. If we suppose with Parfit that our planet will remain habitable for at least another billion years, and we assume that at least one billion people could live on it sustainably, then the potential exist for at least 10^18 human lives. These lives could also be considerably better than the average contemporary human life, which is so often marred by disease, poverty, injustice, and various biological limitations that could be partly overcome through continuing technological and moral progress. However, the relevant figure is not how many people could live on Earth but how many descendants we could have in total. One lower bound of the number of biological human life-years in the future accessible universe (based on current cosmological estimates) is 10^34 years.[10] Another estimate, which assumes that future minds will be mainly implemented in computational hardware instead of biological neuronal wetware, produces a lower bound of 10^54 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years (or 10^71 basic computational operations).(4)[11] If we make the less conservative assumption that future civilizations could eventually press close to the absolute bounds of known physics (using some as yet unimagined technology), we get radically higher estimates of the amount of computation and memory storage that is achievable and thus of the number of years of subjective experience that could be realized.[12] Even if we use the most conservative of these estimates, which entirely ignores the possibility of space colonization and software minds, we find that the expected loss of an existential catastrophe is greater than the value of 10^18 human lives. This implies that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one millionth of one percentage point is at least ten times the value of a billion human lives. The more technologically comprehensive estimate of 1054 human-brain-emulation subjective life-years (or 1052 lives of ordinary length) makes the same point even more starkly. Even if we give this allegedly lower bound on the cumulative output potential of a technologically mature civilization a mere 1% chance of being correct, we find that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred billion times as much as a billion human lives. One might consequently argue that even the tiniest reduction of existential risk has an expected value greater than that of the definite provision of any “ordinary” good, such as the direct benefit of saving 1 billion lives. And, further, that the absolute value of the indirect effect of saving 1 billion lives on the total cumulative amount of existential risk—positive or negative—is almost certainly larger than the positive value of the direct benefit of such an action.[13] </span><br />

<strong>Integration and public funding key is widespread space travel</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The question then remains: will private investment and pubic-private partnerships be enough to create the infrastructure required for viable PTP suborbital transportation? Only time will tell, but if history is any indication, it will take significant public funding to develop the network of spaceports that would function similar to the world’s current network of airports. Moreover, the ability to use the existing airport infrastructure could be a key in developing PTP suborbital travel, but will be limited to specific spacecraft designs that are suitable to existing airport infrastructure.For the industry to be sustainable there will be the need to integrate space vehicle operations with traditional air traffic operations in a seamless manner. The FAA proposed concept of operations for Space and Air Traffic Management System is a step in the right direction. Although its provisions as currently stated will be insufficient to handle full fledged PTP suborbital transportation (as it appears to be more geared towards traditional space operations and space tourism), it will nonetheless be very useful at the nascent stage of the industry when the reliability levels of the vehicles are yet to be fully ascertained. The rules and procedures to be adopted will depend on the characteristics of the vehicle with respect to ATC clearances. It is hoped, however, that the ultimate vehicle will be one that will be more responsive to ATC clearance (notably, horizontal take off and powered reentry and landing). STM as a means of tracking objects in space would be necessary to ensure a safe flight path for the vehicles. This would have to depend on national or international arrangements to provide space surveillance capability which at present is possessed by only a few nations.</span><br />

<strong>cost reduction jumpstarts the space industry, causes settlement and exploration</strong><br />
<strong>(Collins and Autino 10)</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Patrick Collins (exceptionally well known and respected authority on space economics, space tourism, reusable launch vehicles, and space solar power), and Adriano Autino (prolific science and space writer/lecturer for leading magazines, journals, and space advocate organizations), Acta Astronautica, July 2010, “What the growth of a space tourism industry could contribute to employment, economic growth, environmental protection, education, culture and world peace”, accessed August 24, 2011, Volume 66, Issues 11-12, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576509004512" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576509004512</a></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Costs for the development of low-cost orbital passenger transportation systems are of the order of 10 billion Euros [7–9]. Even 10 times this amount would be less than 5 years of space agencies' current budgets. The economic benefits seem sure to greatly outweigh the cost, due to the much larger commercial markets that would be created as a result, in contrast to the very small markets created with 1 trillion Euro-equivalents invested in satellite and launch vehicle manufacturing to date.That is, there seem to be no technical reasons why rapid growth of space travel services could not be realised: the technology has existed for decades, and companies wishing to develop vehicles are hampered by only one obstacle, which is the easiest for governments to solve—lack of funds. Hence the rest of this paper assumes that over coming decades households will start to purchase space ﬂight services, which will grow to reach 5 million passengers/year, out of a worldwide middle-class population of more than 2 billion people, a few decades from now.Starting from today, in order to achieve the scale of activity shown in Fig. 1 over the next 30 years, government funding equivalent to about 10% of space agencies' budgets, or some 2 billion Euros/year would probably suffice to stimulate private investment in reusable orbital passenger vehicle manufacturing and operations. Thereafter most of the funding would come from private companies, just as airline and hotel companies finance their own growth today. 1.1. Implications of launch cost reduction Reducing the cost of space travel to 1% of existing launch vehicles' costs, in combination with the growth of a new consumer service market in space, would greatly aid the growth of many commercial space activities, thereby creating numerous new business opportunities both on Earth and in space. This process is already at work on a small scale in relation to sub-orbital ﬂight services: in addition to a large number of travel companies acting as agents for sub-orbital ﬂights (including JTB, the largest travel company in Japan), Zero-G Corporation supplies parabolic ﬂight services, Bigelow Aerospace is developing the first space hotel, Spaceport Associates advises on spaceport design, Orbital Outfitters Inc. supplies customised ﬂight suits, spaceports are being developed in several places, and several support organisations have been established. All of this activity is occurring some years before the first high-priced services even start, so a much wider range of different space travel-related businesses are sure to grow in future. In the case of orbital services there will be an even wider range of companies with much larger revenues, including companies supplying various services to orbiting hotels. These will include services which terrestrial hotels typically purchase today, such as catering, cleaning, accounting, entertainment, plus such additional services as space-based window maintenance, air supply, solargenerated electricity, water supply, waste disposal services, and others. As activities in orbit expand progressively, they could grow to include use of materials extracted from the Moon and near-Earth asteroids and cometoids, of which the potential has been researched for several decades [11]. Due to the much higher cost of activities in orbit than on the surface of the Earth, orbiting hotels seem likely to create the first market for non-terrestrial materials like ice, water, oxygen and hydrogen, as discussed in [12]. Another potentially major space-based industry, which has been held back for 40 years by high launch costs, is the supply of solar power from space to Earth. Although the potential of this system was recognised in studies by the US Department of Energy in the late 1970s, and confirmed in the 1990s [13], total funding has remained minimal. However, progress could be rapid once launch costs fall to a few percent of ELV costs [14]. Hence, as passenger space travel activities expand to large scale, a growing range of manufacturing activities in Earth orbit, on the lunar surface and elsewhere could develop spontaneously, driven by entrepreneurial effort to exploit new business opportunities opened up by the growth of new commercial markets in Earth orbit. These will in turn open the door to the large-scale space activities described in [11]. The growth of orbital passenger space travel to several million passengers/year over a few decades would represent a direct commercial turnover of some 100 billion Euros/year. In such a scenario of rapid growth, annual investment in new facilities, research and development might add the same amount again. Indeed, having reached such a scale, there would be no foreseeable limit to further growth—in particular it need not be limited, like terrestrial activities, by environmental or political constraints. Quite apart from the numerous opportunities which such a scenario offers for growth of the space industry, it also offers great potential benefits for humanity, in several different fields, as discussed in turn in the following. 2. Employment In most countries, most of the population do not have economically significant land holdings, and so employment is the economic basis of social life, providing income and enabling people to have stable family lives. The high level of unemployment in most countries today is therefore not only wasteful, it also causes widespread poverty and unhappiness, and is socially damaging, creating further problems for the future. One reason for investing in the development of passenger space travel, therefore, is that it could create major new fields of employment, capable of growing as far into the future as we can see. As of 2001, the hotel, catering and tourism sector was estimated to employ 60 million people world-wide, or 3% of the global workforce, and 6% of Europeans [15]. Hence we can estimate that the passenger air travel industry, including airlines, airports, hotels and other tourismrelated work, indirectly employs 10–20 times the number of people employed in aircraft manufacturing alone. Likewise, passenger space travel services could presumably create employment many times that in launch vehicle manufacturing—in vehicle operations and maintenance, at spaceports, in orbiting hotels, in many companies supplying these, in services such as staff training, certification and insurance, and in a growing range of related businesses. This possibility is particularly valuable because high unemployment, both in richer and poorer countries, has been the major economic problem throughout the world for decades. Consequently the growth of such a major new market for advanced aerospace technology and services seems highly desirable, as discussed further in [16]. By contrast, in recent years employment in the traditional space industry in USA and Europe has been shrinking fast: a 2003 report by the US Federal Aviation Administration stated that employment in launch vehicle manufacturing and services fell from 28,617 in 1999 to 4828 in 2002, while employment in satellite manufacturing fell from 57,372 to 31,262 [17]. Likewise, European space industry employment fell by 20% from 1995 to 2005; the major space engineering company Astrium cut 3300 staff from 2003 through 2006; and in 2005 alone, European prime contractors cut 13.5% of their staff or some 2400 people [18]. Unfortunately, the probability of space industry employment recovering soon is low, because satellite manufacturing and launch services face both low demand and rapidly growing competition from India and China, where costs are significantly lower. It is therefore positively bizarre that government policy-makers have declined to even discuss the subject of investing in the development of passenger space travel services, and have permitted no significant investment to date out of the nearly 20 billion Euro-equivalents which space agencies spend every year! This is despite the very positive 1998 NASA report &quot;General Public Space Travel and Tourism&quot; [19], and the NASA-funded 2002 &quot;ASCENT&quot; study referred to above [2,3]. In the capitalist system, companies compete to reduce costs since this directly increases their profits. However, reducing the number of employees through improving productivity raises unemployment, except to the extent that new jobs are created in new and growing industries. In an economy with a lack of new industries, increasing so-called &quot;economic efficiency&quot; creates unemployment, which is a social cost. In this situation, governments concerned for public welfare should either increase the rate of creation of new industries, and/or slow the elimination of jobs, at least until the growth of new industries revives, or other desirable counter-measures, such as new social arrangements, are introduced. These may include more leisure time, job-sharing, and other policies designed to prevent the growth of a permanent &quot;under-class&quot; of unemployed and &quot;working poor&quot;—a development which would pose a major threat to western civilisation. </span><br />

<strong>Settlement feasible - exponential tech progress</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Advances in such areas as propulsion, power, using space resources, and giving other worlds a planetary makeover through terraforming -- along with public space travel -- are hastening the day of space colonization. Backing that view is Eric Rice, chair of a symposium on space colonization held at STAIF this year. Rice is leader of an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) technical committee that focuses on space colonization issues. &quot;There are so many things underway now that relate to space colonization. The International Space Station is part of this too, as well as the long-term potential for terraforming Mars into another planet for humans to live on,&quot; Rice told SPACE.com. Rice said that </span><span style="font-size: 50%;">the growing business of public space tourism &quot;is really the spirit of colonization.&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">The giggle factor of citizen space travelers is totally gone, he said. Part of that &quot;de-giggling&quot;, Rice said, stems from last year's set of flights by SpaceShipOne. Then there's the work of Las Vegas, Nevada entrepreneur Robert Bigelow in fabricating inflatable space modules to be planted in Earth orbit. Also the pay-for-a-seat travels to the space station of Dennis Tito and Mark Shuttleworth in past years are milestones along the route, he added. Lastly, toss in numbers of firms and organizations now busy making space tourism a growing profitable concern. It all adds up to &quot;a quiet revolution,&quot; Rice said. Exponential trajectory The prognosis for space colonization is good, said Edward McCullough, principal scientist for The Boeing Company in Huntington Beach, California. He pointed to numbers of technologies that are on exponential growth curves - that is, showing signs of increasing rapid growth. &quot;During the last half of the 20th century, a host of technologies and disciplines which had witnessed millennia of slow or no growth...suddenly went exponential,&quot; McCullough reported at the STAIF meeting. McCullough pointed to photography, chemistry and quantum mechanics that have combined to produce a new industrial revolution. Electrical and mechanical engineering are on courses that appear to indicate unbounded exponential improvement. Delving into the structure of DNA has spurred a better understanding of the cellular processes. The human genome has been sequenced and micro biomechanics has taken off, he said. Furthermore, the centuries old technology of printing has been extended to three dimensions with inks of polymers, ceramics, wood and metals.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">C. 1. Lack of reliable access to launch suppliers effectively reduces launch supply. While manufacturing capacity of launch vehicles may be ample, commercial satellite launch customers have a limited range of launch options available. Commercial access to U.S. and Chinese launch services are constrained, leaving Arianespace and ILS as the principal options. In the future, Sea Launch may be a viable option if it emerges from bankruptcy successfully. SpaceX, with the recent successful launch of a Falcon 9 medium-launch vehicle, may also become a viable option—in the long- term, but not now or in the near future. U.S. launch vehicles have an extraordinary record of reliability during the past decade. This has resulted in part from the national security community’s priority on and continued investment in mission assurance. Not surprisingly, given the dominance of the U.S. government as a launch customer and the U.S. government’s focus on mission assurance, the systems and processes for U.S. launch range and operations have been primarily developed around government requirements and culture. Many believe that this has reduced access to launch ranges and added schedule risk for commercial launch customers. These effects can be seen in launch scheduling, the current practice of which often prevents commercial entities from establishing reliable launch dates. The DoD now reserves a launch slot with ULA 30 to 36 months before the launch is scheduled. Typical commercial customers place launch reservations 24 months ahead of the anticipated launch date. Thus, ULA is fully booked for the next three years with government launches, and commercial customers seeking a launch slot are shut out. DoD launches are often delayed, but program offices often release those launch slots very late—a few months before the scheduled launch—thus not allowing commercial customers to take advantage of the newly opened launch slot and leaving valuable launch opportunities unused. As government launch needs change, ULA is provided incentives to meet those changing needs before it meets the needs of any commercial customer. DoD also tends to view specific launch vehicles as committed to a specific DoD launch; when program delays occur, those specific launch vehicles are often not released for commercial use. Finally, commercial launches have sometimes lost launch slots because launch schedules for higher-priority government payloads changed. As a consequence, commercial satellite launch consumers currently have little confidence in their access to U.S. launch or in their ability to hold launch dates even if manifested. Several senior leaders among commercial launch customers and launch providers contend that government and ULA credibility with commercial launch customers is very low. Some suggest that neither the government nor ULA has much incentive to change their practices. Accommodating commercial satellite launches may detract from DoD’s focus on and ULAs support of mission assurance, and some interviewees maintain that the government-ULA contract provides disincentives for ULA to support commercial launches.’4 The lack of structured, constructive dialogue between commercial operators and DoD launch range operators makes addressing some of these problems difficult.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The MARS needs to continue to distinguish itself as a leading spaceport. Virginia has led the way in promoting its space industry and will need to continue these efforts. The symbiotic relationship between the MARS and NASA’s WFF will need to continue to evolve. With the declining NASA budget a thriving commercial space industry will be vital in reducing operating costs and ensuring stability and growth during a time of Federal downsizing. NASA has studied the possibility of closing WFF several times. This closure has been prevented by strong political opposition. It is in the best interests of the MARS, NASA, and the commercial space industry to ensure each other’s success and continued utilization of WFF. Since NASA awarded Virginia-based Orbital Science Corporation a CRS contract, a consistent line of funding is in place that must be utilized to the greatest extent possible. NASA will be required to purchase, at a minimum, another 27 cargo flights and 10 crew flights through 2020. The existing contract and the possible future NASA contracts should be used as the anchor tenant to attract more business. The U.S. Air Force Operationally Responsive Space Office has launched four spacecraft from Wallops with the possibility for more launches in the future. This relationship should continue to be developed and MARS promoted as a responsive, lean launch provider. While the orbital market has a much higher entry cost than the sub-orbital market, continued demonstration of MARS as a lean launch provider could attract emerging space companies like Bigelow Aerospace. The sub-orbital market should take advantage of WFF’s existing airport and infrastructure to perform sub-orbital flights. The MARS’ unique location on the East Coast and near the nation’s capital, and other population centers, places it in a key position to offer sub-orbital flights. The sub-orbital tourism, point-to-point, and research markets are likely to be the highest in demand and should be targeted for future growth. Wallops has a long history of suborbital research and could expand this field to include more commercial launches. FAA’s commercial space transportation regulations are in their infancy but are still minimal. The NASA regulations while more mature and far more complex are being adapted for commercial usage. NASA plans on leaving all commercial space licensing to the FAA. In the future even a NASA mission launched from a Federal range would require an FAA license. NASA is likely to still have their own safety requirements that will be redundant to FAA requirements. A key part to enabling commercial space transportation industry at MARS is reducing the uncertainty about how NASA and FAA regulations will coexist. The nascent commercial space transportation industry has been enabled by NASA investment in COTS, CCDev and CRS. This, along with the FAA’s matching grants and other Federal and state incentives, has helped jump-start the commercial space transportation industry. The possible roadblocks of excessive regulation have been minimized by the FAA’s limited Final Rule on Crew and Space Flight Requirements and the CSLAA. By not certifying vehicles as safe, the FAA acknowledges that passengers will fly at their own risk. While this congressional “hands off” mandate will encourage research and development in this emerging market it could backfire if an accident occurs that results in more strict regulation. After December 23, 2012 the FAA may propose new regulations on the commercial space industry without restriction. The amount of regulations will be dependent upon how much the commercial space industry has matured. Industry lessons learned and best practices are needed to determine future requirements. The FAA has already held public meetings to address many of the concerns facing this emerging market. Specifically, the deconfliction of FAA and NASA regulations will be necessary to prevent duplication of efforts. Both regulators need to ensure their requirements are compatible or complementary for both government and non-government organizations. The development of a robust commercial space transportation industry is important to the U. S. and its National Security in many different areas. Economically, a strong space industry and a vigorous space launch schedule will promote space jobs and programs to stay in the U. S. A larger and more experienced space industrial base will greatly benefit National Security Space programs and develop national capabilities in new technical realms. Another important impact to National Security Space is the required expansion and growth of the space transportation infrastructure. Similar to the railroads, interstate highways, and airports of today a space transportation infrastructure will need to be developed and will be a requirement for future growth and expansion. Without this infrastructure National Security Space will be required to maintain its own aging infrastructure and would not be able to benefit from new construction, technology and innovations that the commercial space sector would develop on its own. In a shrinking Global economy the commercial space industry will be vital in maintaining the competitive edge in, and our access to, space. The more developed the U.S. commercial space industry is the more likely it will be able to adapt and overcome any challenges it is faced with. It is in the U.S. Government’s strategic interest to remain a leader in the Global space transportation industry. This emerging commercial space transportation market has the potential to become a thriving industry with proper investment and minimal regulation.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Congress needs to take the necessary steps to identify and resolve legal and political challenges inhibiting the growth of commercial spaceports. Not addressing these challenges and allowing commercial spaceports to falter would undermine the economic and national security of the United States. Alternatively, resolving these challenges and supporting commercial spaceport development at this nascent stage will position the United States as a world leader in commercial space transportation infrastructure, capable of attracting entrepreneurship, capital, technology, and human resources. One can imagine a future not so far away where spaceports are centers of great economic activity, supporting passenger flights around the world, into orbit, or to celestial bodies. Mankind is reaching out to the stars, and spaceports are where our first steps are being taken. By fostering the development of commercial spaceports today, we build a road to tomorrow.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Space policy retains a peculiar character to it in that the rhetoric is often frontier analogy driven but the economic realities remain often government funded development with the private sector taking over once developmental success has been acquired. This means that the industry is dominated by the desires of the federal government whether the military or civilian, meaning NASA. This mind set reflects the early growth of the field in a time when national security needs drove what was done in terms of space activities. Over the years, that pattern has broken down with regards to many space applications especially in communications and navigation. Space launch however retains that imprint of the national security state. The Ansari X-Prize was a deliberate attempt to break the cycle of government control but that was only partially successful. Sending humans to orbit still remains strictly a government activity, suborbital is now open to private vendors but efforts at orbital flight remain more distant even though there was an earlier America Prize suggested for encouraging efforts at reaching orbit and back similar to the Ansari X-Prize with the prize being set at $50 million. 25 What appears to be occurring is that a separation is growing between the older spaceports located on federal spaceports and the newer proposals. All three, California, Florida and Virginia, remain focused on orbital flights using ELVs presently but are open to RLVs once those are developed especially in the case of Florida with shuttle shutdown looming. That pathway is only possible with the cooperation of the operators of the federal spaceports a reality which remains a hindrance but accommodations are being made. By focusing on processing facilities, the state entities provide a service that lessens the burden on the federal operator. The newer spaceports are more heavily invested in the space tourism aspect of commercial space activities which poses a dilemma. The dilemma is a simple one, what if RLVs do not become economically successful, remember their client base is the private sector, interested in making a profit. Given the cost of purchasing a flight ($200,000 presently), how large the market will be is unclear once you get past the optimism-hype. This reality makes the state spaceport arena more problematic than appears at first glance. 26 Several initiatives are premised on a specific vehicle coming to fruition such as the Rocketplane in Oklahoma; others are in effect being done on spec with no actual tenant identified. As Florida has already found with its RLV storage hanger, that leaves a state in the situation that there is no occupant given the paucity of available tenants. As was mentioned earlier, the death of the VentureStar meant that the many states lost their justification for pursuing a spaceport so their pursuit slackened and in some cases went dormant. The continuing issues with SpaceX regarding successful flight is particularly disappointing for Florida since they have in effect bet their money on the Falcon 1 and its successor the Falcon 9 being successful and being used to supply the ISS. What is more troubling for state spaceport initiatives is the reality that there are international competitors for the opportunity to be the launch port for RLV vehicles. Singapore and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates have been put forth as launch points for the Explorer vehicle, a derivative of the “Cosmopolis XXI (C-21), a multi-passenger space plane designed by Russia's Myasishchev Design Bureau (MDB).” 27 What is more important is that the choice was made among ten different sites including several in the United States. The Singapore spaceport appears to be lagging while the site in the UAE appears more substantial. The economics are that the UAE site is closer to potential customers and is less difficult to enter than the United States with its restrictions on foreign travelers. What is more critical here is recognition that U.S. state spaceports are competing clearly in an international market for a limited roster of potential flight partners. Virginia Galactic is rumored to be interested in both locations especially Singapore but is deferring any immediate plans to build facilities – this reflects the fact that development of SpaceShipTwo has been delayed by an accident during development that resulted in three deaths. The Explorer vehicle was not part of the Ansari X-Prize competition; in fact, the Ansari family is invested in the project after helping sponsor the X-Prize. What this does is further heighten the competition between space tourism vendors and states who wish to service them as spaceports. Even in Europe, there is interest in moving into the spaceport business in support of space tourism in the form of Spaceport Sweden. 28 Even more troubling from a state perspective is the fact that suborbital flight as presently conceived is a dead end in that those flights do not get you to orbit in the end. Reaching orbit remains a much more difficult feat given the realities and physics of space launch. A RLV has to overcome weight issues relative to applicable lift capacity. Those weight issues in the end led to the X-33 cancelation; NASA evaluations were either negative or inconclusive whether the weight issue inherent in a single stage to orbit vehicle could be overcome. Making it two stage to orbit is one option but using a lift plane to be the first stage runs into weight and safety questions including re-entry. If reaching orbit was easy; then it would be done already commercially. Presently, all commercially viable space industries operate on the assumption that you do not have to bring the payload back to earth safely. Once the payload’s useful life is exhausted, you either lift it higher into a parking orbit or you allow it either to slowly descend into the atmosphere to be destroyed or you eject it out of orbit in a controlled crash as it were. The result is a major problem with space debris but that is strictly an international level issue; spaceports are becoming increasingly attractive for a number of states as symbols of technological progress and potential economic growth. Space remains glamorous which draws attention but the economics remain much more daunting than the rhetoric would lead one to understand. There is likely to be a continuing market for suborbital tourism but whether that will grow sufficiently in the United States to justify expanded state investment in spaceports is unclear. The original state spaceports, California, Florida, Virginia and Alaska, arose out of the perceived need for more accessible launch facilities for ELVs. The initial focus was upon small launch vehicles, a market that has not met expectations. The first three also have the potential for conducting human spaceflight in the form of RLVs while Alaska’s future is more problematic since it launches government payloads which are more a function of their present political clout than any economic incentive. However, having a useful facility regardless of who funded it originally gives a state an asset that can be exploited as Alaska remains a player. The newer spaceports such as Spaceport America and the Oklahoma Spaceport also have economic potential since they have launch vendors already on board but in the former case, international competition may reduce the economic impact as Virgin Galactic opens up other launch sites closer to its customer base. Other spaceports such as Spaceport Sheboygan have potential as economic incubators fostering industries related to space activities. Launching vehicles will likely remain a lesser priority. There exists no easy road to success for state spaceports because as was clear a decade ago; too much relies on others to develop the technologies that will facilitate reliable and cheaper space launch whether human spaceflight or payloads of applications. The legislative obstacles to state spaceports have been significantly reduced in impact but the spaceports still operate in an environment controlled by the federal government because ultimately that is what international law and practice demand. Private individuals and ventures all enter space with consent of a national government. Other governments remain reluctant to change that pattern since they, as the United States does, remain very much aware of the military potential of space launch regardless of its ostensible peaceful purpose</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The Final Report of the President's Commission on the Future of the US Aerospace Industry came out with some very strong recommendations. And it did so at a time when the country is re-evaluating its commitment to the further exploration and development of space, in the aftermath of the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia. It is not necessary to repeat here all of the recommendations of the Commission. But instead it is worthwhile to pick out those aspects that derive directly from the ASCENT work, and of which NASA and other government agencies associated with the development of space, need to be aware. The country has already lost its leadership in space. US industry has only 40% of global launches today, and the ASCENT Study indicates that unless there is a shift in focus and priorities, then the figure will be down to 25% twenty years from now. There are ramifications both in employment and in the education of our future generations. Even the financially stretched Russian industry is doing better in terms of market share, and is already taking the initiative in the early development of the new commercial opportunities represented by public space travel. The Europeans are gearing up to use the Russian Soyuz system capabilities for their own purposes from the European launch facilities at Kourou. It seems clear that the Chinese will not be far behind, with imminent launches of their first Shenzhou crews. The message for the US government is therefore no less than a need to seek to bring about a reversal of the relative decline of the US as a space power. One part of doing this is to remove some of the impediments for foreign customers to fly their payloads on US launch vehicles. Another way is by taking steps to encourage those infrastructure-and regulatory- developments that will facilitate the growth of a domestic space tourism industry. In this context one must include both sub-orbital and orbital developments and facilities, although the ASCENT Study focused on the latter. The States seem so far to be way ahead of the Federal government in this regard. Many States are exploring the possibilities of having spaceports within their territories to help in their employment and other needs. The Federal government should play its part in facilitating these first steps as the spaceports are being established. The commercial development of space, and its next logical step of space tourism, is the most American of endeavors: it is a way to make money out of people being free and having fun. Of course, down the road, there are other benefits for the nation, and even the world. But at least the ASCENT Study makes abundantly clear that the US cannot expect to rank itself amongst the world's most thriving civilizations if it does not continue on the road that it set for itself at the start of the space age. The more entrepreneurial parts of the commercial sector have seized the message already, and soon we shall see the first sub-orbital space tourists follow in Alan Shepard's footsteps. The Federal government must also play its part. NASA can be directed to work with these new realities. The Aerospace Commission identifies public space travel as an important new sector &quot;??.that holds the potential for increasing launch demand and improvements in space launch reliability and reusability?.?? and would ultimately support a robust space transportation industry with &quot;airline-like operations&quot;?..?&quot; Perhaps the best way for this redirection of NASA to take effect would be in terms of budgetary resource re-allocation. As was discussed earlier, there is no justification for significant expenditures to be taking place on ideas and concepts that have no likelihood of taking place within the next twenty years. The ASCENT Study provides the guidance for this necessary resource reallocation, as discussed earlier in the paper. By the same token, there is a need to actively support initiatives to bring about the new industry of space tourism. At the very least, NASA needs to create a small Office of Public Space Travel to facilitate the needs of the emerging sector, and to coordinate those needs with the Administration's other long-term plans. A good example of an early role for such an office would be an involvement in the OSP architecture design discussions to find ways to ensure that the resulting OSP vehicle design can play a useful part in the future of orbital space tourism. This can be the way in which the US takes back the lead from the Russians in this area, and/or prevents the Chinese from taking this initiative of providing trips for American space tourists. The ASCENT Study makes it very clear what the implications will be if the US does not develop an RLV that can eventually be used for public space travel purposes. The OSP is the best shot we have at this for the short term. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Following the first successful flight of an airplane in 1903, the focus of the aviation industry was on research and development of aircraft technology, not on the development of airfields. A rudimentary set of airfields was established during World War I, but the significant development of airfields in the United States was driven by commerce, such as the need for airmail flights to have refueling and mail drop off sites in various locations. The aviation industry began growing rapidly in the late 1920’s, which then drove the need for improved infrastructure and regulatory frameworks, including licensing. As passenger travel became more commonplace and high capacity aircraft emerged (such as the Boeing 747), the construction of larger airports became a requirement as well as the expansion and improvement of existing airports. This was expensive and required a great deal of government support. Some key dates and events in the development of the airport infrastructure in the United States are presented below in Table 5-1. It is important to note that the overall development of the airport system in the United States was largely reactive, rather than proactive. This was particularly true in the technical and legal regimes. Similarly, spaceport development will likely be driven by the development of the space vehicle industry; however, the additional challenge of integrating spacecraft traffic and infrastructure requirements with that of existing air traffic and infrastructure exists. This will be particularly important for the development of PTP transportation, and unlike the history of airport development, the development and integration of spaceports may require proactive initiatives with regard to legal and technical challenges. The costs of developing the infrastructure to support a growing space industry, particularly that of a PTP suborbital industry, may also have some parallels to early airport development. With respect to demand and public safety, additional construction and improvement of the airport infrastructure was required as the aviation industry evolved. Such improvements were quite expensive and therefore required government support, such as the U.S. Airport and Airway Development Act. Similarly, spaceport construction and infrastructure costs are high, and such ventures often require support from the government. Many spaceports are already supported at least in part by public funding. A selection of spaceports currently under development for suborbital space tourism, their estimated development costs, and sources of funding are shown in Table 5-2 below: As the example of Spaceport America has shown recently, garnering public support and funds can be a challenge (Medina, 2008). Development of a network of spaceports, or integration into the existing airport system, will be an expensive and challenging endeavor. Some savings may be made by using existing facilities, such as decommissioned military bases, and their runways, or by using existing rocket range facilities. Europe in particular, has large numbers of long runways left over from the cold war which would be capable of supporting some suborbital concepts. It may be viable to develop a purpose built spaceport without public funding, especially if it is designed for tourism purposes other than PTP transportation. This is the case with the joint ventures creating the tourism infrastructure for Spaceport Sweden in Kiruna (Spaceport Sweden, 2008).</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Spaceflight operations in the first two eras are transformed over time through incremental technology development steps to make spaceflight safer, more responsive and cost-effective. As a result, in the third era, space travel is transformed from an occasional occurrence to a routine and frequently-used mode of mass public space transportation using a variety of spaceports around the world, as illustrated in Figure 22. This transformation is reminiscent of the growth of the global commercial air transportation system that emerged and grew through the second half of the twentieth century. </span><br />

<strong>DOT makes it predictable and puts a finite limit on the number of affs</strong><br />
<strong>(Free Dictionary ND)</strong><br />
<strong>The Free Dictionary</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, </span><strong>No Date</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, &quot;Transportation Department&quot;, accessed July 27, 2012, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Transportation+Department" rel="nofollow">http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Transportation+Department</a></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) establishes overall transportation policy for the United States. Under the DOT umbrella are 11 administrations whose jurisdictions include highway planning, development, and construction; urban mass transit; railroads; aviation; and the safety of ports, highways, and oil and gas pipelines. Decisions made by the department in conjunction with appropriate state and local officials can significantly affect other programs such as land planning, energy conservation, scarce resource utilization, and technological change. The DOT was established by Congress in 1966 (49 U.S.C.A. § 102) &quot;to assure the coordinated, effective administration of the transportation programs of the Federal Government&quot; and to develop &quot;national transportation policies and programs conducive to the provision of fast, safe, efficient, and convenient transportation at the lowest cost consistent therewith.&quot; The department became operational in April 1967 with elements transferred from eight other major departments and agencies. As of 2003, it consists of the office of the secretary and 11 operating administrations whose heads report directly to the secretary and have highly decentralized authority. Office of the Secretary of Transportation The DOT is administered by the secretary of transportation, who is the principal adviser to the president in all matters relating to federal transportation programs. The secretary administers the department with the assistance of a deputy secretary of transportation, an associate deputy secretary, the assistant secretaries, a general counsel, the inspector general, and several directors and chairpersons. Federal Aviation Administration The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), formerly the Federal Aviation Agency, was established by the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C.A. § 106) and became a component of the DOT in 1967. The FAA is charged with regulating air commerce in ways that best promote its development and safety and fulfill the requirements of national defense; controlling the use of the navigable airspace of the United States by regulating both civil and military operations in that airspace in the interest of safety and efficiency; promoting, encouraging, and developing civil Aeronautics; and consolidating research and development with respect to air navigation facilities. The FAA is responsible for installing and operating air navigation facilities; developing and operating a common system of air traffic control and navigation for both civil and military aircraft; and developing and implementing programs and regulations to control aircraft noise, sonic booms, and other environmental effects of civil aviation. In addition, the FAA operates a network of airport traffic control towers, air route traffic control centers, and flight service stations. It develops air traffic rules and regulations and allocates the use of the airspace. It also provides for the security control of air traffic to meet national defense requirements. The FAA is responsible for the location, construction or installation, maintenance, operation, and quality assurance of federal visual and electronic aids to air navigation. The agency operates and maintains voice/data communications equipment, radar facilities, computer systems, and visual display equipment at flight service stations, airport traffic control towers, and air route traffic control centers. The agency maintains a national plan of airport requirements, administers a grant program for the development of public use airports to assure and improve safety and to meet current and future airport capacity needs, evaluates the environmental impacts of airport development, and administers an airport noise compatibility program with the goal of reducing noncompatible uses around airports. It also develops standards and technical guidance on airport planning, design, safety, and operations and provides grants to assist public agencies in airport system and master planning and airport development and improvement. The FAA provides a system for registering aircraft and recording documents that affect title or interest in the aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, appliances, and spare parts. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and the International Aviation Facilities Act (49 U.S.C.A. § 1151), the agency promotes aviation safety and civil aviation abroad by exchanging aeronautical information with foreign aviation authorities; certifying foreign repair stations, air personnel, and mechanics; negotiating bilateral airworthiness agreements to facilitate the import and export of aircraft and components; and providing technical assistance and training in all areas of the agency's expertise. One important FAA function is the regulation and promotion of the U.S. commercial space transportation industry. It licenses the private-sector launching of space payloads on expendable launch vehicles and commercial space launch facilities. The FAA also sets insurance requirements for the protection of persons and property and ensures that space transportation activities comply with U.S. domestic and foreign policy.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Developing spaceport infrastructure, like any other kind of transportation infrastructure—highways, railroads, airports, etc.—has an obvious near-term economic impact on the region where the infrastructure is located and the industries involved in developing it. As this report indicates, the economic benefits of expanding and enhancing the capabilities of existing and emerging commercial spaceports can have an economic benefit on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars for the communities where these facilities are located, should these improvements be funded. Such development can provide an immediate economic boost for areas that are often rural and/or depressed</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The Transportation Sector Lesson 1– The Transportation Sector, provides an introduction to a variety of components that constitute the transportation sector. The first of task of this lesson is to define the terms “transportation” and “transportation engineering”. Once a working definition of these terms has been established, the lesson then invites the students to navigate the history of the transportation through the various transportation modes while following the evolution of technology and it application throughout the transportation sector. Modes of Transportation [1][2][3][4][5] In defining what transportation is and how the transportation sector has evolved into what it is today, from what it was centuries ago, students will not only gain a greater appreciation for the importance of transportation is our society but also understand that the evolution of the transportation sector is continuous. Throughout this lesson, it is imperative to underscore the fact that this generation of engineers and scientists are responsible for continuing the evolution of the transportation sector as limitations of current systems and technologies, as well as new challenges and societal problems will need to be address in order to maintain and increase the world’s standard of living. The Evolution of Transportation – the Motor Car Having a solid grasp of what transportation is, its history and the our responsibility to its future, Lesson 1 also introduces how transportation projects get from being a concept to what is built to get persons from Point A to Point B. This process is referred to as the transportation process. In illustrating this process, five stages were identified and used as points of departure to facilitate a fundamental understanding of the transportation process. These five stages included 1) Problem Identification, 2) Project Development, 3) Construction/Implementation, 4) Operation, and 5) Maintenance. In guiding students through these various stages of the transportation process, it is the goal that students walk away with a few key realizations. These realization include 1) that they are already are a part of the transportation process by way of being able to identify problems within the transportation sector and 2) as they navigate through the transportation system they are a part of its operation and 3) as a transportation engineer they are further involved with the process at most, if not at all, stages. The transportation process modules seek to underscore these realizations through formal instruction as well as through guided interaction with the students.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Although different definitions of “infrastructure” exist, this report focuses on two types that claim a significant amount of federal resources: transportation and water. Those types of infrastructure share the economic characteristics of being relatively capital intensive and producing services under public management that facilitate private economic activity. They are typically the types examined by studies that attempt to calculate the payoff, in terms of benefits to the U.S. economy, of the public sector’s funding of infrastructure. For the purposes of CBO’s analysis, “transportation infrastructure” includes the systems and facilities that support the following types of activities: Vehicular transportation: highways, roads, bridges, and tunnels; Mass transit: subways, buses, and commuter rail; Rail transport: primarily the intercity passenger service provided by Amtrak; Civil aviation: airport terminals, runways, and taxiways, and facilities and navigational equipment for air traffic control; and Water transportation: waterways, ports, vessels, and navigational systems. The category “water infrastructure” includes facilities that provide the following: Water resources: containment systems, such as dams, levees, reservoirs, and watersheds; and sources of fresh water such as lakes and rivers; and Water utilities: supply systems for distributing potable water, and wastewater and sewage treatment systems and plants. Consistent with CBO’s previous reports on public spending for transportation and water infrastructure, this update excludes spending that is associated with such infrastructure but does not contribute directly to the provision of infrastructure facilities or certain strictly defined infrastructure services. Examples of excluded spending are federal outlays for homeland security (which are especially pertinent to aviation), law enforcement and military functions (such as those carried out by the Coast Guard), and cleanup operations (such as those conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers following Hurricane Katrina in 2005).</span><br />

 <strong>A. Investment is capital spending on infrastructure’s physical capital</strong><br />
<strong>CBO, 9</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> – Congressional Budget Office (“Subsidizing Infrastructure Investment with Tax-Preferred Bonds”, October, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/106xx/doc10667/10-26-taxpreferredbonds.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/106xx/doc10667/10-26-taxpreferredbonds.pdf</a></span>)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In this analysis, investment in infrastructure is defined as capital spending on transportation, utilities (for example, water and power supply), environmental projects, and schools. 1 In addition, because they account for a significant share of the tax-exempt debt issued, health care facilities and hospitals are treated as infrastructure in this study, although they might not be classified as such for many other types of analyses. Capital spending under this study’s definition consists of investment in physical capital, such as structures and facilities, rather than intangible capital, which is formed by spending on educational programs or on research and development.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Only direct investments constitute capital spending</strong><br />
<strong>Gramlich 98</strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">– former professor of economics at the University of Michigan and a former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Edward, Before the President's Commission to Study Capital Budgeting, Washington, D.C., 3/6/98, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3431:http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/1998/19980306.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/1998/19980306.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/1998/19980306.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3431 -->)//EM</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Apart from politics, how in principle should capital spending be defined? In fact the types of spending in the federal budget that really qualify as capital spending are few and far between. The spending should result in tangible physical equipment. Military spending on construction and long-lived durable goods would qualify. Military spending on consumables, ammunition and so forth, would not. Domestic spending on direct construction would qualify. But grants to state and local governments, even those nominally for capital purchases, would not. These grants do not directly result in capital equipment purchases because the recipient government is perfectly free not to spend the grants on capital equipment, and a host of econometric studies over the years have shown that recipient governments do not spend all their capital grants on equipment. So-called human investment programs would not qualify either, both because the spending cannot be assured and because it is not clear whether this supposed human investment really does raise a person's market output. Entitlement spending definitely would not count.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">When all is said and done, a relatively small amount of federal spending will be validly classified as capital spending. But there will be major headaches involved in identifying this small amount of spending.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">¶4 The legal question to be resolved by the court is whether the word &quot;should&quot;13 in the May 18 order connotes futurity or may be deemed a ruling in praesenti.14 The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of grammar;15 it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, &quot;and the same hereby is&quot;, (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2) constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the trial judge's intent must be garnered from the four corners of the entire record.16[CONTINUES – TO FOOTNOTE]13 &quot;Should&quot; not only is used as a &quot;present indicative&quot; synonymous with ought but also is the past tense of &quot;shall&quot; with various shades of meaning not always easy to analyze. See 57 C.J. Shall § 9, Judgments § 121 (1932). O. JESPERSEN, GROWTH AND STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (1984); St. Louis &amp; S.F.R. Co. v. Brown, 45 Okl. 143, 144 P. 1075, 1080-81 (1914). For a more detailed explanation, see the Partridge quotation infra note 15. Certain contexts mandate a construction of the term &quot;should&quot; as more than merely indicating preference or desirability. Brown, supra at 1080-81 (jury instructions stating that jurors &quot;should&quot; reduce the amount of damages in proportion to the amount of contributory negligence of the plaintiff was held to imply an obligation and to be more than advisory); Carrigan v. California Horse Racing Board, 60 Wash. App. 79, 802 P.2d 813 (1990) (one of the Rules of Appellate Procedure requiring that a party &quot;should devote a section of the brief to the request for the fee or expenses&quot; was interpreted to mean that a party is under an obligation to include the requested segment); State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215 (Mo. 1958) (&quot;should&quot; would mean the same as &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;must&quot; when used in an instruction to the jury which tells the triers they &quot;should disregard false testimony&quot;). 14 In praesenti means literally &quot;at the present time.&quot; BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 792 (6th Ed. 1990).

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions, each topic contains certain key elements, although they have slightly different functions from comparable elements of value-oriented propositions. 1. An agent doing the acting ---“The United States” in “The United States should adopt a policy of free trade.” Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of value, the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. The verb should—the first part of a verb phrase that urges action. 3. An action verb to follow should in the should-verb combination. For example, should adopt here means to put a program or policy into action though governmental means. 4. A specification of directions or a limitation of the action desired. The phrase free trade, for example, gives direction and limits to the topic, which would, for example, eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs, discussing diplomatic recognition, or discussing interstate commerce. Propositions of policy deal with future action. Nothing has yet occurred. The entire debate is about whether something ought to occur. What you agree to do, then, when you accept the affirmative side in such a debate is to offer sufficient and compelling reasons for an audience to perform the future action that you propose. </span><br />

 <strong>World is teetering on the brink of protectionism – current policies will either fast forward trade or cause a protectionist relapse</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">WHEN the financial crisis hit, the G20, grouping together countries that produce more than 85% of the world's GDP, made all the right noises about trade. World leaders were determined not to repeat the mistakes of the 1930s, when protectionism led to economic disaster; and their apparent success in ensuring that global markets stayed open has been a rare glimmer of light in the economic gloom. Yet even this optimism may be misplaced. As a report from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) warns this week, the barriers are creeping back up. On the face of it, all seems well. The G20 continues to preach the virtues of free trade each time it meets, most recently in Los Cabos in Mexico. Despite the deep suspicions between them, trade between the two emerging giants, China and India, is booming (see article). Russia, the one jumbo emerging market that is not yet a member of the WTO, will join by July 23rd, after 19 years of accession talks; if the recent experience of China and Vietnam is any guide, foreign investment in Russia will jump as the market opens. Regional agreements are proliferating, too. In 2010 a trade deal covering close to 30% of the world's population—the China-ASEAN Free-Trade Area—was struck. The European Union, itself the biggest free-trade area in terms of value, made side deals with Colombia and Peru earlier this month. Bigger EU deals, with India, Japan and perhaps America, are in the pipeline. And there is no doubt that trade has the potential to flourish in the years ahead. In a new long-run forecast published this week, HSBC predicts that world trade will grow by close to 90% over the next 15 years—advancing modestly at first, because of the euro crisis, then vigorously. In addition to top-down number-crunching, HSBC also looked at expectations from the bottom up. Views it gathered from thousands of small firms involved in imports and exports support the optimistic outlook. A watchdog barks But the WTO is worried. It detects a steady rise in barriers, despite the promises at G20 summits. The new restrictions range from higher tariffs to costly import licences and customs controls. Individual examples can seem trivial—new minimum prices for backpacks and prams in Argentina, for example, or new tariffs on lawn-mower-blades in South Africa—but the cumulative impact is significant. An increasingly popular method nowadays is to strangle traders not with high tariffs, which are easy to spot, but with red tape, which is not. Governments often justify these steps as short-term remedies for particular problems. Subsidies for a hard-hit export sector, say, seem to make sense as a response to the global downturn. But barriers are easier to put in place than to remove, so the share of trade held back by protectionist measures tends to grow over time. The WTO's director-general, Pascal Lamy, also detects longer-run strategic decisions to distort markets in order to promote national industries. Nor is the proliferation of regional trade agreements an entirely good thing. They have flourished, in part, because of the failure of the multilateral Doha trade round, which was launched back in 2001 and is going nowhere slowly. Regional deals can divert trade rather than create it. There are too many regional deals: Britain is a member of over 30. Although they do lower some barriers, most do nothing to tackle the highest tariffs. And each deal tends to enshrine the preferences of its largest member, making it harder to bring regional blocks together within a cohesive set of global trade rules. Russia's entry into the WTO, at long last, is welcome, but its motives are uncertain. Hopgg4es that the WTO will make it soften its protectionist policies seem naive, given that President Vladimir Putin is already trying to change the club's rules. Mr Putin wants to protect Russian industries from external competition, including by increasing subsidies to farmers. The WTO should resist that, and keep sounding the alarm at signs of G20 backsliding. But Mr Lamy's outfit can do little about the biggest looming threat to free trade, which comes from the crisis in the euro zone. Until now the European Union's single market, though far from perfect, has been a shining example of a sustained and determined effort to bring trade barriers down and of the benefits that brings. The current crisis, if it leads to the break-up of the euro, could bring about a catastrophic break-up of the single market—repeating the mistakes of the 1930s after all. If ever there was a time to remember the dangers of protectionism, it is now.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Canadian companies hoping to bid on the crumbling road and bridge system in the U.S. may find themselves behind yet another Buy America law prohibiting them from bidding on any government-funded construction project if it has the smallest amount of federal funding. U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from the steel-producing state of Ohio, convinced the Senate to endorse a new Buy America regulation as part of a sweeping transportation funding bill called “Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st century Act,” or MAP-21. Brown’s amendment, which was accepted by the Senate in March, would prohibit state governments from contracting outside the country if any part of the project receives U.S. government funding. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives are now in complex negotiations to finalize the law, which is also known as the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill. “The proposed MAP Act includes provisions that represent a significant departure from existing ‘Buy America’ preferences,” Amgad Shehata, chair of the Washington-based Canadian American Business Council, said in a letter to the Senate and the House conferees this week. “Specifically, if at least one contract for a project receives any federal funding under this act, then all contracts for a project, regardless of their funding source, would be subject to Buy America preferences” he said. Canada and the U.S. have long butted heads on various Buy America laws dating as far back as the 1933. The various Buy America provisions try to create U.S. jobs through restrictions on imported construction materials, mostly steel and iron. Canada thought it bought some peace in February 2010 when the two governments agreed on reciprocal bidding in each other’s countries on infrastructure projects such as bridges and roads following President Barack Obama’s US$787-billion economic stimulus bill.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Forget about Iraq, the Middle East or searching for a new White House puppy. President Barack Obama's first key decision will be whether to support a &quot;Buy American&quot; clause. It is strongly supported by his Democratic Party and labor unions, but U.S. allies say it would trigger a trade war like the one that led to the Great Depression. Which way will Obama go? Will he risk antagonizing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the AFL-CIO, whose support he badly needs to pass his almost $900 billion economic stimulus package? Or will he heed the calls from the European Union, Canada, Brazil and other U.S. trade partners, as well as key Republicans in Congress? Or, to put it more bluntly, will Obama conclude that he has little choice but to govern with the solid support of the Democratic majority in Congress or will he risk sacrificing some Democratic votes in exchange for a small minority of Republicans in hopes of building a bipartisan, centrist, legislative base? The &quot;Buy American&quot; clause, included in the administration's stimulus package that the House passed last week, calls for ensuring that funds for infrastructure projects such as highways and bridges be only used to buy U.S.-made steel, iron and other materials. A Senate version of the bill further demands that the stimulus package's funds for infrastructure projects be used exclusively to purchase U.S.-made manufactured goods, such as shovels or cranes. &quot;It's basic common sense,&quot; AFL-CIO policy director Thea Lee explained to me. &quot;American taxpayers will spend close to $1 billion to stimulate the U.S. economy and create U.S. jobs. To the largest extent possible, within our international obligations, we should try to use those dollars to buy American products.&quot; Supporters of the bill reject claims that the &quot;Buy American&quot; clause would violate the spirit -- if not the letter -- of U.S. international trade commitments. &quot;There are waivers and exceptions built into our trade obligations that allow us to give a preference to American goods to a certain level,&quot; Lee said. &quot;There is no reason why not to take advantage of provisions that we have negotiated into these trade agreements.&quot; Leading U.S. trade partners see it differently. Passage of the &quot;Buy American&quot; clause would lead to &quot;a rush of protectionist actions&quot; that could &quot;create a downward spiral like the world experienced in the 1930s,&quot; Canadian Ambassador Michael Wilson said in a letter to congressional leaders earlier this week. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told reporters that &quot;protectionism at this moment will aggravate the crisis.&quot; Trade experts say that Brazil would be among the most hurt by the &quot;Buy American&quot; clause because it exports steel to the United States and -- unlike Canada, Mexico, Chile or Peru -- does not have a free trade agreement with Washington that would exempt it from many of the measure's provisions. Pro-business groups note that U.S. exports fell by nearly 25 percent in December, and that other countries are suffering similar drops in trade. &quot;In that context, any U.S. moves that are seen as protectionist could really give a moral sanction to governments around the world to raise trade barriers themselves,&quot; says John Murphy, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Asked by ABC News about his position on the &quot;Buy American&quot; provision, Obama said Tuesday that he wants to avoid measures that would &quot;signal protectionism,&quot; adding that there is &quot;a potential source of trade wars that we can't afford at a time when trade is sinking all across the globe.&quot; While critics of the &quot;Buy America&quot; clause cheered Obama's words -- it was the president's first indication of where he's leaning since Vice President Joe Biden had made comments that appeared to back the measure last week -- they caution that the White House may back a watered-down version of the bill that could still be perceived by U.S. trade partners as protectionist. My opinion: Your statement was right on the mark, Mr. President! What's important is not only the letter of the law, but the signal it sends to the rest of the world. If it gives U.S. trade partners an excuse to pass their own &quot;Buy national&quot; laws, U.S. exports will plummet even more and more U.S. jobs will be lost than this provision would help save. Now, please make sure that &quot;Buy American&quot; doesn't turn into &quot;Bye, America.&quot;</span><br />

<strong>These trade conflicts culminate in global nuclear war and nuclear terrorism</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire the United States and other nations to spew forth protectionist legislation like the notorious Smoot-Hawley bill. Introduced at the start of the Great Depression, it triggered a series of tit-for-tat economic responses, which many commentators believe helped turn a serious economic downturn into a prolonged and devastating global disaster, But if history is any guide, those lessons will have been long forgotten during the next collapse. Eventually, fed by a mood of desperation and growing public anger, restrictions on trade, finance, investment, and immigration will almost certainly intensify. Authorities and ordinary citizens will likely scrutinize the cross-border movement of Americans and outsiders alike, and lawmakers may even call for a general crackdown on nonessential travel. Meanwhile, many nations will make transporting or sending funds to other countries exceedingly difficult. As desperate officials try to limit the fallout from decades of ill-conceived, corrupt, and reckless policies, they will introduce controls on foreign exchange, foreign individuals and companies seeking to acquire certain American infrastructure assets, or trying to buy property and other assets on the (heap thanks to a rapidly depreciating dollar, will be stymied by limits on investment by noncitizens. Those efforts will cause spasms to ripple across economies and markets, disrupting global payment, settlement, and clearing mechanisms. All of this will, of course, continue to undermine business confidence and consumer spending. In a world of lockouts and lockdowns, any link that transmits systemic financial pressures across markets through arbitrage or portfolio-based risk management, or that allows diseases to be easily spread from one country to the next by tourists and wildlife, or that otherwise facilitates unwelcome exchanges of any kind will be viewed with suspicion and dealt with accordingly. The rise in isolationism and protectionism will bring about ever more heated arguments and dangerous confrontations over shared sources of oil, gas, and other key commodities as well as factors of production that must, out of necessity, be acquired from less-than-friendly nations. Whether involving raw materials used in strategic industries or basic necessities such as food, water, and energy, efforts to secure adequate supplies will take increasing precedence in a world where demand seems constantly out of kilter with supply. Disputes over the misuse, overuse, and pollution of the environment and natural resources will become more commonplace. Around the world, such tensions will give rise to full-scale military encounters, often with minimal provocation. In some instances, economic conditions will serve as a convenient pretext for conflicts that stem from cultural and religious differences. Alternatively, nations may look to divert attention away from domestic problems by channeling frustration and populist sentiment toward other countries and cultures. Enabled by cheap technology and the waning threat of American retribution, terrorist groups will likely boost the frequency and scale of their horrifying attacks, bringing the threat of random violence to a whole new level. Turbulent conditions will encourage aggressive saber rattling and interdictions by rogue nations running amok. Age-old clashes will also take on a new, more healed sense of urgency. China will likely assume an increasingly belligerent posture toward Taiwan, while Iran may embark on overt colonization of its neighbors in the Mideast. Israel, for its part, may look to draw a dwindling list of allies from around the world into a growing number of conflicts. Some observers, like John Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, have even speculated that an &quot;intense confrontation&quot; between the United States and China is &quot;inevitable&quot; at some point. More than a few disputes will turn out to be almost wholly ideological. Growing cultural and religious differences will be transformed from wars of words to battles soaked in blood. Long-simmering resentments could also degenerate quickly, spurring the basest of human instincts and triggering genocidal acts. Terrorists employing biological or nuclear weapons will vie with conventional forces using jets, cruise missiles, and bunker-busting bombs to cause widespread destruction. Many will interpret stepped-up conflicts between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.</span><br />

 <strong>Reform will pass—less forceful Obama and motivated GOP</strong><br />

As senators gathered Wednesday for the first hearing on the proposed sweeping changes in immigration law, they said the president’s decision to give members of both parties room to maneuver on the delicate politics of immigration was a strategic choice that could pay off as negotiations continued. “He’s walking a tightrope here, trying to allow Congress on a bipartisan basis to come up with a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the Senate,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. “He encouraged us, told us he doesn’t want this to drag on forever, and if we can’t get it done he’ll play more forceful role.” Mr. Durbin, a member of a bipartisan group of eight senators working on an immigration bill, added, “The reason he’s on this tightrope is the Republicans don’t want to make it appear that they are bending to the president on this issue.” Influential Republicans praised Mr. Obama as well. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the party’s vice-presidential nominee last year, said the president’s tone on immigration was measured and constructive. “I thought on immigration he used the right words and the right tone, which tells me he actually doesn’t want to politicize this, which is conducive to getting something done,” Mr. Ryan said. Given their losses in the Congressional elections in November, Republicans in both the House and Senate have demonstrated a new openness to immigration changes that could lead to legal residency for millions who have entered the country illegally. At the same time, polls have shown that the president’s involvement in the debate decreases Republican support. White House officials said the president was just as aggressive on immigration as he was on firearms, though his appeal for changes in gun laws was one of the emotional peaks of the night. Cecilia Muñoz, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said immigration was “an issue on which we expect an outcome and we expect it soon.” The president, who most recently laid out his own immigration principles in a January speech in Las Vegas, told Congress on Tuesday night that “the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform.” It was a refrain he repeated several times to applause. Mr. Obama proceeded to highlight what he believed are the three goals of any immigration deal — ensuring that the borders are secure, creating a meaningful path to citizenship, and overhauling the system to deal with legal immigration. But when talking about immigration, he seemed to lack the emotional resonance, not to mention the forceful call to action, that he exhibited when discussing gun control, where he exhorted the country to remember that all victims of gun violence “deserve a vote.” Which may have been exactly the point. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, began his remarks at Wednesday’s hearing by thanking the president for his State of the Union comments on immigration. “His remarks last night on immigration were just right,” Mr. Schumer said. “He importuned us to act, he stated how important it was to get this done for the future of America, but at the same time he did not make it a wedge issue. He made it clear that we had to act in a bipartisan way and gave us, in our little group, the space to come up with a bipartisan proposal, which we know is really our only hope.” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, and a member of the bipartisan group, said he had “no complaints — actually I thought it was good for the process.” “If he were to be seen as leading the effort, it likely wouldn’t be that helpful,” Mr. Flake said. “But to say that he’ll sign the bill we put on his desk, that’s helpful.” The hearing focused largely on border security and enforcement, with an entire panel devoted to just one witness — Secretary Janet Napolitano of the Department of Homeland Security. Ms. Napolitano said that border security was often used as an excuse to prevent meaningful changes.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">President Barack Obama said all the right things Sunday about immigration reform. The president told NBC’s Meet the Press that he is serious about getting Congress to overhaul the laws governing immigrants. He even declared that he will introduce an immigration bill this year. This newspaper welcomes that announcement. Texans particularly understand the unique challenges that an outdated immigration system presents. Even though the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S. has subsided in the last few years, the many holes in the system leave families, schools, businesses and law enforcement struggling. And those are just some of the constituents challenged by flawed immigration laws. The president’s words to NBC’s David Gregory are only that — words. What will really matter is whether he puts his muscle into the task this year. We suggest that Obama start by looking at the example of former President George W. Bush. Back in 2006 and 2007, the Republican and his administration constantly worked Capitol Hill to pass a comprehensive plan. They failed, largely because Senate Republicans balked. But the opposition didn’t stop the Bush White House from fully engaging Congress, including recalcitrant Republicans. Obama may have a similar problem with his own party. The dirty little secret in the 2006 and 2007 immigration battles was that some Democrats were content to let Senate Republicans kill the effort. Labor-friendly Democrats didn’t want a bill, either. And they may not want one this year. That reluctance is a major reason the president needs to invest in this fight. He must figure out how to bring enough Democrats along, while also reaching out to Republicans. In short, the nation doesn’t need a repeat of the process through which the 2010 health care legislation was passed. Very few Republicans bought into the president’s plan, leaving the Affordable Care Act open to partisan sniping throughout last year’s election. If the nation is going to create a saner immigration system, both parties need to support substantial parts of an answer. The new system must include a guest worker program for future immigrants and a way for illegal immigrants already living here to legalize their status over time. Some House Republicans will object to one or both of those reforms, so Speaker John Boehner must be persuasive about the need for a wholesale change. But the leadership that matters most will come from the White House. The president has staked out the right position. Now he needs to present a bill and fight this year for a comprehensive solution. Nothing but action will count.</span><br />

<strong>Key to Latin America stability</strong><br />
<strong>Gittelson 09</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">(Robert, Citation: 23 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics &amp; Pub. Pol'y 115 2009 THE CENTRISTS AGAINST THE IDEOLOGUES: WHAT ARE THE FALSEHOODS THAT DIVIDE AMERICANS ON THE ISSUE OF COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In the alternative, should we fail to pass CIR, and instead opt to deport or force attrition on these millions of economic refugees through an enforcement-only approach to our current undocumented immigrant difficulties, what would be the net result? Forgetting for now the devastating effect on our own economy, and the worldwide reproach and loss of moral authority that we would frankly deserve should we act so callously and thoughtlessly, there is another important political imperative to our passing CIR that affects our national security, and the security and political stability of our neighbors in our hemisphere. That is the very real threat of communism and/or socialism. First of all, the primary reason why millions of undocumented economic refugees migrated to the United States is because the economies of their home countries were unable to support them. They escaped extreme poverty and oppression, and risked literally everything they had, including their lives and their freedom, to come to this country to try to work hard and support themselves and their families. Deporting our illegal immigrant population back to primarily Latin America would boost the communist and socialist movements in that part of our hemisphere, and if the anti-immigrationists only understood that fact, they might rethink their &quot;line in the sand&quot; position on what they insist on calling 'amnesty. Communism thrives where hope is lost. The economies of Latin American nations are struggling to barely reach a level of meager subsistence for the population that has remained at home; Mexico, for example, has already lost 14% of their able-bodied workers to U.S. migration.3&quot; Without the billions of dollars in remissions from these nations' expatriates working in the United States that go back to help support their remaining family members, the economies of many of these countries, most of whom are in fact our allies, would certainly collapse, or at least deteriorate to dangerously unstable levels. The addition of millions of unemployed and frustrated deported people who would go to the end of the theoretical unemployment lines of these already devastated economies would surely cause massive unrest and anti-American sentiment. The issue of Comprehensive Immigration Reform is not simply a domestic issue. In our modern global economy, everything that we do, as the leaders of that global economy, affects the entire world, and most especially our region of the world. If we were to naively initiate actions that would lead to the destabilization of the Mexican and many Central and South American governments, while at the same time causing serious harm to our own economy (but I digress ... ), it would most assuredly lead to disastrous economic and political consequences. By the way, I'm not simply theorizing here. In point of fact, over the past few years, eight countries in Latin America have elected leftist leaders. Just last year, Guatemala swore in their first leftist president in more than fifty years, Alvaro Colom.3&quot; He joins a growing list. Additional countries besides Guatemala, Venezuela,32 and Nicaragua33 that have sworn in extreme left wing leaders in Latin America recently include Brazil,34 Argentina,3 5 Bolivia,36 Ecuador,37 and Uruguay.3s This phenomenon is not simply a coincidence; it is a trend. The political infrastructure of Mexico is under extreme pressure from the left.39 Do we really want a leftist movement on our southern border? If our political enemies such as the communists Chavez in Venezuela and Ortega in Nicaragua are calling the shots in Latin America, what kind of cooperation can we expect in our battle to secure our southern border? </span><br />

<strong>Extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Manwaring ‘5</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Max G., Retired U.S. Army colonel and an Adjunct Professor of International Politics at Dickinson College, venezuela’s hugo chávez, bolivarian socialism, and asymmetric warfare, October 2005, pg. PUB628.pdf)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">President Chavez also understands that the process leading to state failure is the most dangerous long-term security challenge facing the global community today. The argument in general is that failing and failed state status is the breeding ground for instability, criminality, insurgency, regional conflict, and terrorism. These conditions breed massive humanitarian disasters and major refugee flows. They can host “evil” networks of all kinds, whether they involve criminal business enterprise, narco-trafficking, or some form of ideological crusade such as Bolivarianismo. More specifically, these conditions spawn all kinds of things people in general do not like such as murder, kidnapping, corruption, intimidation, and destruction of infrastructure. These means of coercion and persuasion can further spawn human rights violations, torture, poverty, starvation, disease, the recruitment and use of child soldiers, trafficking in women and body parts, trafficking and proliferation of conventional weapons systems and weapons of mass destruction (WMD), genocide, ethnic cleansing, warlordism, and criminal anarchy. At the same time, these actions are usually unconfined and spill-over into regional syndromes of poverty, destabilization, and conflict.55 Peru’s Sendero Luminoso calls violent and destructive activities that facilitate the processes of state failure “armed propaganda.” Drug cartels operating throughout the Andean Ridge of South America and elsewhere call these activities “business incentives.” Hugo Chavez considers these actions to be steps that must be taken to bring about the revolutionary political conditions necessary to establish Latin American Socialism for the 21st Century.56 Thus, in addition to helping to provide wider latitude to further their tactical and operational objectives, State and non-state actors’ strategic efforts are aimed at progressively lessening a targeted regime’s credibility and capability in terms of its ability and willingness to govern and develop its national territory and society. Chavez’s intent is to focus his primary attack politically and psychologically on selected Latin American governments’ ability and right to govern. In that context, he understands that popular perceptions of corruption, disenfranchisement, poverty, and lack of upward mobility limit the right and the ability of a given regime to conduct the business of the State. Until a given populace generally perceives that its government is dealing with these and other basic issues of political, economic, and social injustice fairly and effectively, instability and the threat of subverting or destroying such a government are real.57 But, failing and failed States simply do not go away. Virtually anyone can take advantage of such an unstable situation. The tendency is that the best motivated and best armed organization on the scene will control that instability. As a consequence, failing and failed States become dysfunctional states, rogue states, criminal states, narco-States, or new people’s democracies. In connection with the creation of new people’s democracies, one can rest assured that Hugo Chavez and his Bolivarian populist allies will be available to provide money, arms, and leadership at any given opportunity. And, of course, the longer dysfunctional, rogue, criminal, and narco-States and people’s democracies persist, the more they and their associated problems endanger global security, peace, and prosperity.58 </span><br />

 <strong>Obama’s in the lead but Romney could still come through</strong><br />
<strong>Doms 9/28</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Colin, “Pollster Map Shows Possible Path For Romney Victory” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/28/pollster-romney-map_n_1924487.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/28/pollster-romney-map_n_1924487.html</a></span> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">But although the current Pollster estimate shows Obama with a commanding lead over Romney, it also shows a possible path to victory for Romney that now includes a handful of states. According to The Huffington Post map, Romney would have to focus his attention on some classic swing states while attempting to get additional support in the Midwest. The map relies on the newly introduced Pollster model, which uses historical voting data as one guideline in assessing the presidential match-up. The model serves as a snapshot of the election if it were held today, and therefore, the map is likely to change in the next five weeks. The estimate also accounts for random error in the individual polls. Additionally, the model combines national and statewide polling, and draws on geographic patterns in past elections to determine the current standing of the two candidates in individual states. It considers “house effects” of different polling firms, adjusting for Republican- and Democratic-leaning pollsters whose results are consistently on one side or the other. Initially, Romney’s battle seems uphill: If the election were held today, Obama would win 332 electoral votes, with Romney garnering 191. North Carolina’s 15 votes are currently for the taking, according to the model, but would not swing the outcome of the election. If Romney could shave 3 or 4 points off of Obama’s lead nationally, however, the electoral map might shift, showing the closest “Lean Obama” states, Nevada, Colorado, Florida, Virginia and New Hampshire voting Republican. In that case, Romney would win his lean states, and North Carolina slides easily to his side. Unfortunately for Romney, that map is a losing map. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Mitt Romney’s comment that Russia is America’s “No. 1 geopolitical foe,” a red-meat line for Republicans, is also attracting some attention in Moscow. Alexey Pushkov, chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, said in a recent interview that Russian leaders have noted Romney’s comments with concern, and are watching with interest as neoconservative and “realist” advisers maneuver for influence within the campaign. “We don’t think that for us Romney will be an easy partner,” said Pushkov, an ally of President Vladimir Putin. “We think that Romney will be, on the rhetorical side, a replay of the Bush administration.” He also noted Romney’s statements that the United States should assert its dominance in the 21st century. “If he is serious about this, I’m afraid he may choose the neocon-type people…In the first year of his presidency, we may have a full-scale crisis,” he said. Romney, in an interview with CNN in March, called Russia &quot;without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe, they fight for every cause for the world's worst actors. The idea that [Obama] has more flexibility in mind for Russia is very, very troubling indeed.&quot; Pushkov said Russian leaders have noticed that Romney has among his foreign policy advisers several foreign policy figures often described as neoconservatives, such as Robert Kagan. “We don’t find it very positive,” he said. Pushkov said that the “reset” in U.S.-Russia relations that Obama has portrayed as a signature foreign policy accomplishment “is stuck, basically. It needs another reset.” Nevertheless, though the U.S. and Russia are at odds on issues such as Syria and missile defense, Obama would be “acceptable” as a partner for Russia in a second term, Pushkov said. Obama and Putin showed in their recent meeting in Mexico that “they don’t want a personal conflict,” he said. </span><br />

<strong>Nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Allison 10/31</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Graham, Director – Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard’s Kennedy School, and Former Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Robert D.

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">That central point is that Russia matters a great deal to a U.S. government seeking to defend and advance its national interests. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s decision to return next year as president makes it all the more critical for Washington to manage its relationship with Russia through coherent, realistic policies. No one denies that Russia is a dangerous, difficult, often disappointing state to do business with. We should not overlook its many human rights and legal failures. Nonetheless, Russia is a player whose choices affect our vital interests in nuclear security and energy. It is key to supplying 100,000 U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan and preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Ten realities require U.S. policymakers to advance our nation’s interests by engaging and working with Moscow. First, Russia remains the only nation that can erase the United States from the map in 30 minutes. As every president since John F. Kennedy has recognized, Russia’s cooperation is critical to averting nuclear war. Second, Russia is our most consequential partner in preventing nuclear terrorism. Through a combination of more than $11 billion in U.S. aid, provided through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, and impressive Russian professionalism, two decades after the collapse of the “evil empire,” not one nuclear weapon has been found loose. Third, Russia plays an essential role in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile-delivery systems. As Washington seeks to stop Iran’s drive toward nuclear weapons, Russian choices to sell or withhold sensitive technologies are the difference between failure and the possibility of success. Fourth, Russian support in sharing intelligence and cooperating in operations remains essential to the U.S. war to destroy Al Qaeda and combat other transnational terrorist groups. Fifth, Russia provides a vital supply line to 100,000 U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan. As U.S. relations with Pakistan have deteriorated, the Russian lifeline has grown ever more important and now accounts for half all daily deliveries. Sixth, Russia is the world’s largest oil producer and second largest gas producer. Over the past decade, Russia has added more oil and gas exports to world energy markets than any other nation. Most major energy transport routes from Eurasia start in Russia or cross its nine time zones. As citizens of a country that imports two of every three of the 20 million barrels of oil that fuel U.S. cars daily, Americans feel Russia’s impact at our gas pumps. Seventh, Moscow is an important player in today’s international system. It is no accident that Russia is one of the five veto-wielding, permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, as well as a member of the G-8 and G-20. A Moscow more closely aligned with U.S. goals would be significant in the balance of power to shape an environment in which China can emerge as a global power without overturning the existing order. Eighth, Russia is the largest country on Earth by land area, abutting China on the East, Poland in the West and the United States across the Arctic. This territory provides transit corridors for supplies to global markets whose stability is vital to the U.S. economy. Ninth, Russia’s brainpower is reflected in the fact that it has won more Nobel Prizes for science than all of Asia, places first in most math competitions and dominates the world chess masters list. The only way U.S. astronauts can now travel to and from the International Space Station is to hitch a ride on Russian rockets. The co-founder of the most advanced digital company in the world, Google, is Russian-born Sergei Brin. Tenth, Russia’s potential as a spoiler is difficult to exaggerate. Consider what a Russian president intent on frustrating U.S. international objectives could do — from stopping the supply flow to Afghanistan to selling S-300 air defense missiles to Tehran to joining China in preventing U.N. Security Council</span><br />

<strong>Rogovaya 12</strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">(Rogovaya, “Oil Price Changes: Everyone Wants Stability” July/August, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oilandgaseurasia.com/articles/p/164/article/1875/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oilandgaseurasia.com/articles/p/164/article/1875/</a></span> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">According to the current base forecast for the Eurozone prepared by Oxford Economics, within the next two years oil prices will continue to drift lower, but not beyond the bounds of the “green” corridor for the world economy – $80-100 per barrel. This forecast coincides with the expectations of the World Bank (see Fig. 4). Meanwhile, S&amp;P analysts presented three scenarios for the energy market in June. In the base scenario, oil will remain at $100 per barrel. S&amp;P calculates that the likelihood of a stressful scenario in which the price of oil drops below $60 per barrel (the bottom in 2009) is 1:3. Analysts believe that given today’s state of economic and geopolitical affairs, strong political will would be needed to force the price of oil below $70-80 (the current level of effective production). So far, that will is nowhere to be seen. Recent events have shown that nobody is interested in the Eurozone breaking apart. And nobody wants a war in the Persian Gulf. Furthermore, nobody today intends to force the production of less valuable oil. At least that is what OPEC leaders promised during the recent summit. “Stability on the market should be at the center of our attention,” General Secretary Abdalla El-Badri said. Even Saudi Arabia, which consistently violates OPEC discipline in over-producing its quotas, announced at the beginning of July that it would review its margins to determine a higher price for Saudi supplies ordered on August contracts. Analysts noted that the average price of oil supplied to Europe and Asia had jumped (by $0.85 and $0.66 per barrel respectively), a fact which could be seen as proof that the collective members of the cartel will not let prices fall under $100 per barrel.</span><br />

<strong>Saudis are terrified of a change in US oil dependence, they will flood the market</strong><br />
<strong>Mouawad 9</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Jad, “Saudi Blasts American Energy Policy” 9/25/9, New York Times, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/saudi-blasts-american-energy-policy/" rel="nofollow">http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/saudi-blasts-american-energy-policy/</a></span> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The question of American “energy independence” clearly rankles officials in Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil, who seem increasingly puzzled by the energy policy of the United States, the world’s biggest oil consumer. In a short and strongly-worded essay in Foreign Policy magazine, Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former ambassador to the United States and a nephew to King Abdullah, said that for American politicians, invoking energy independence “is now as essential as baby-kissing,” and accuses them of “demagoguery.” All the talk about energy independence, Mr. al-Faisal said, is “political posturing at its worst — a concept that is unrealistic, misguided, and ultimately harmful to energy-producing and consuming countries alike.” There is no technology on the horizon that can completely replace oil as the fuel for the United States’ massive manufacturing, transportation, and military needs; any future, no matter how wishful, will include a mix of renewable and nonrenewable fuels. Considering this, efforts spent proselytizing about energy independence should instead focus on acknowledging energy interdependence. Like it or not, the fates of the United States and Saudi Arabia are connected and will remain so for decades to come. Relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia date back to the 1930s when American geologists first struck oil in the kingdom. While American companies built the Saudi oil industry, Americans have never shaken off their suspicions and mistrust of the kingdom since the Arab oil embargo of 1973. It’s not the first time a Saudi official has criticized American energy policy, or its growing reliance on renewable fuels. Many of Prince Turki’s arguments recycle Saudi Arabia’s position that for the past 30 years, the oil-rich kingdom has acted in a responsible manner to keep oil markets well supplied. Prince Turki correctly points at the steps taken by Saudi Arabia in recent years to increase its production to make up for lost production in Iraq or elsewhere in times of crisis, and invest close to $100 billion in new capacity over the past five years. On the other hand, he points out that four countries — Iran, Iraq, Nigeria and Venezuela — failed to live up to expectations that they would raise their production over the past decade for a variety of reasons, including “a U.S. invasion” in the case of Iraq. The Saudis have genuine reasons to fear the effects of the Obama administration’s energy policy and its commitment to reducing oil consumption, as well as efforts to reduce carbon emissions. As Prince Turki points out himself, Saudi Arabia holds 25 percent of the world’s known oil reserves and would like to keep selling oil for several more decades. As such, the Saudis know that any attempt to reduce gasoline consumption is a threat to the future of the Saudi economy. It’s an old refrain: in his most famous remark, the former Saudi oil minister, Sheik Yamani, once said that the stone age didn’t end because the world ran out of stones, and the oil age will not end because the world runs out of oil. It will end when something replaces it. The trend has already started. Oil demand in the United States has peaked — instead of rising as it has since the dawn of the age of oil more than a century ago, the nation’s oil consumption has begun its long decline. The question is: how fast will the transition take? </span><br />

<strong>Oil key to Russian economy and must be around 120 a barrel, at minimum 90</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Oil prices slipped another notch on Thursday, putting pressure on producers, not least Russia, where the US$-denominated RTS index was down by 1.4 per cent around noon, Moscow time. It was hardly an auspicious backdrop for the St Petersburg Economic Forum, Russia’s premier business conference, which is hosted personally by president Vladimir Putin. But what to do? Russia is even more dependent on oil than it was 12 years ago when Putin first took power. So it’s not surprising that with Brent crude down 0.7 per cent at $92 a barrel, investors are jittery. As Putin well knows, a slowing world economy means lower oil prices and lower oil prices mean that Russia falls dangerously short of balancing its budget – which for 2012, needs crude at around $120 a barrel. Investors, including those interested in Russia, were disappointed with the US Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to extend “Operation Twist” to support a slowing US economic recovery, but refrain from a more aggressive plan to ease monetary policy. The latest Chinese PMI numbers from HSBC only deepened the gloom. Oil is now 27 per cent down on its March high of $126 a barrel. The RTS has fallen by almost exactly the same amount, trading on Thursday 24.4 per cent lower than its March high, with the rouble 14 per cent weaker against the US dollar at Rbs32.95. As Neil Buckley writes in Thursday’s FT special report on Russia, the economy has some strengths: foreign debts of banks and other borrowers, which played havoc in 2008, are much lower than four years ago; public debt is under 10 per cent of GDP; foreign exchange reserves are at $500bn; and last year’s current account surplus hit 5 per cent of GDP. Economic growth is chugging along, with the IMF forecasting 4 per cent increase in GDP for 2012, after 4.3 per cent in both 2010 and 2011. What’s not to like, especially in this uncertain world? Finance minister Sergei Storchak could be forgiven for talking up plans by the Brics countries to create an anti-crisis fund of their own – as well as contributing to the IMF’s coffers. “The issue of currency swaps, or maybe at some point a joint anti-crisis fund, should be viewed from this perspective,” Storchak was quoted by Reuters as saying. “It will be a parallel mechanism in addition to the IMF.” But that’s not the whole story. The global slowdown is hurting Russia already. And another shock from the eurozone would hurt even more. As Buckley says, Sberbank forecasts that a disorderly Greek exit from the eurozone would put Russia into recession next year to the tune of -2.1 per cent. The effects of lower oil prices are immediate. Non-oil budget deficit has grown from under 5 per cent before 2008 to more than 10 per cent this year, if oil stays at $90 a barrel. And that’s before paying for Putin’s election promises. As Buckley writes, the economy can only be restructured with long-term reforms of the kind that Putin has repeatedly promised – such as liberalising and stimulating small business – but never really delivered. </span><br />

<strong>Russian economic collapse leads to civil war and escalates into major power wars</strong><br />
<strong>David 99</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Steven Professor of Politics Science at Johns Hopkins, Jan/Feb 1999, Foreign Affairs, Lexis MGE) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">If internal war does strike Russia, economic deterioration will be a prime cause. From 1989 to the present, the GDP has fallen by 50 percent. In a society where, ten years ago, unemployment scarcely existed, it reached 9.5 percent in 1997 with many economists declaring the true figure to be much higher. Twenty-two percent of Russians live below the official poverty line (earning less than $ 70 a month). Modern Russia can neither collect taxes (it gathers only half the revenue it is due) nor significantly cut spending. Reformers tout privatization as the country's cure-all, but in a land without well-defined property rights or contract law and where subsidies remain a way of life, the prospects for transition to an American-style capitalist economy look remote at best. As the massive devaluation of the ruble and the current political crisis show, Russia's condition is even worse than most analysts feared. If conditions get worse, even the stoic Russian people will soon run out of patience. A future conflict would quickly draw in Russia's military. In the Soviet days civilian rule kept the powerful armed forces in check. But with the Communist Party out of office, what little civilian control remains relies on an exceedingly fragile foundation -- personal friendships between government leaders and military commanders. Meanwhile, the morale of Russian soldiers has fallen to a dangerous low. Drastic cuts in spending mean inadequate pay, housing, and medical care. A new emphasis on domestic missions has created an ideological split between the old and new guard in the military leadership, increasing the risk that disgruntled generals may enter the political fray and feeding the resentment of soldiers who dislike being used as a national police force. Newly enhanced ties between military units and local authorities pose another danger. Soldiers grow ever more dependent on local governments for housing, food, and wages. Draftees serve closer to home, and new laws have increased local control over the armed forces. Were a conflict to emerge between a regional power and Moscow, it is not at all clear which side the military would support. Divining the military's allegiance is crucial, however, since the structure of the Russian Federation makes it virtually certain that regional conflicts will continue to erupt. Russia's 89 republics, krais, and oblasts grow ever more independent in a system that does little to keep them together. As the central government finds itself unable to force its will beyond Moscow (if even that far), power devolves to the periphery. With the economy collapsing, republics feel less and less incentive to pay taxes to Moscow when they receive so little in return. Three-quarters of them already have their own constitutions, nearly all of which make some claim to sovereignty. Strong ethnic bonds promoted by shortsighted Soviet policies may motivate non-Russians to secede from the Federation. Chechnya's successful revolt against Russian control inspired similar movements for autonomy and independence throughout the country. If these rebellions spread and Moscow responds with force, civil war is likely. Should Russia succumb to internal war, the consequences for the United States and Europe will be severe. A major power like Russia -- even though in decline -- does not suffer civil war quietly or alone. An embattled Russian Federation might provoke opportunistic attacks from enemies such as China. Massive flows of refugees would pour into central and western Europe. Armed struggles in Russia could easily spill into its neighbors. Damage from the fighting, particularly attacks on nuclear plants, would poison the environment of much of Europe and Asia. Within Russia, the consequences would be even worse. Just as the sheer brutality of the last Russian civil war laid the basis for the privations of Soviet communism, a second civil war might produce another horrific regime. Most alarming is the real possibility that the violent disintegration of Russia could lead to loss of control over its nuclear arsenal. No nuclear state has ever fallen victim to civil war, but even without a clear precedent the grim consequences can be foreseen. Russia retains some 20,000 nuclear weapons and the raw material for tens of thousands more, in scores of sites scattered throughout the country. So far, the government has managed to prevent the loss of any weapons or much material. If war erupts, however, Moscow's already weak grip on nuclear sites will slacken, making weapons and supplies available to a wide range of anti-American groups and states. Such dispersal of nuclear weapons represents the greatest physical threat America now faces. And it is hard to think of anything that would increase this threat more than the chaos that would follow a Russian civil war.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">An asteroid strike could devastate the nation. But the proverbial one in a million chance is actually pretty close to the mark. We know enough of previous strikes to estimate a major impact every 20 million years or so. And it has been quite a while since the last one, so sometime in the next ten million years is a reasonable estimate; within the next 10 years, that's one in a million. Although the impact would be very high, the probability is very low. So risk - the product of these two factors - is also low; the nation spends a couple million dollars a year researching this threat and collecting preliminary data. Damaging hurricanes are much more frequent - we can certainly expect another one in the next decade. Although a probability of 1.0, or 100%, is certainly high, it is reasonable for planning purposes. The impact though would be local - think Katrina - and so the risk to the nation as a whole is modest. Resources addressing this threat are generally multifunctional - weather satellites, meteorological centers, response teams, local building codes, etc.- so there is not an exact figure for funds dedicated to this threat, but some billions of dollars a year is probably the right order of magnitude. A comprehensive Russian nuclear strike lies somewhere between these extremes. It is possible to argue that it is even less likely that an asteroid strike. An asteroid strike will actually happen, sooner or later, while a Russian nuclear strike will probably never happen. But &quot;probably&quot; is the operative word. The real probability of this event is the central question. To give some perspective, what would motivate President Obama to order a comprehensive nuclear strike against Russia? Take a situation where the most senior leaders in the US government debate a set of circumstances and come to the conclusion that such a nuclear strike is the best of a bad group of options, and so recommends it to the President, and he says, &quot;OK, let's go.&quot; He gives a launch order to the military and they actually carry it out, knowing full well that a retaliatory strike will doubtless follow. And, even lacking a retaliatory strike, the Nuclear Winter effects of a broad nuclear strike will probably devastate the entire world - the chickens would come home to roost. A comprehensive attack on Russia would turn out to be a comprehensive attack on the entire world, including the United States itself. What circumstances could actually evoke such an action? If this seems utterly far fetched, consider that Russia spends several hundred billion rubles a year defending against such a threat. The same question, of course, applies to Russia. What set of circumstances could conceivably motivate the senior Russian leadership to conclude that they should launch a comprehensive strike against the United States, recognizing both retaliatory and Nuclear Winter considerations? How could a Russian leader conceivably come to the conclusion that such an action was in his nation's best interest, or even in his own personal best interest? At the height of the Cold War when the Soviet Union was seeking military domination of Europe, and perhaps even the world, there could have been some sort of a warped rationality in such a decision, but that time is long gone. Consider also France and Germany, historic enemies who have warred against each other numerous times. France is now a nuclear power, and Germany has no such weapons. Theoretically, some circumstances could arise in which a French leadership would conclude that their best option would be to launch a nuclear strike against Germany. And how much effort does the German government put into protecting against this eventuality? Zero. And the reason is simple: there are so many hundreds, thousands, of positive interconnections between the two nations that such an eventuality has become totally unthinkable - certainly not worth spending real national assets on. Russia's relationship with the West in general, and the United States in particular, is not up to the level of interconnectedness that now exists between France and Germany, but it is moving in that direction. With the United States there are even a number of efforts, sponsored by Nunn-Lugar legislation, which specifically address the nuclear balance. Certainly devoting more assets to broadening these interconnections is a much more rational approach than continuing to put large sums on both sides into totally nonproductive weapon systems. The relationship is not straightforward as Russia is becoming increasingly autocratic. Its legitimacy is ultimately based on economic performance, but is energized by stoking nationalism. The leadership is involved in a continuous balancing act. On the one hand it is formally committed to ties with the democratic West, observance of human rights and the rule of law. But these ideals work to undermine the position of the top elite. So they are balanced with a continuing focus on the unique role of Russia, on the slights suffered from the West, on the historically validated need for a strong leader. This balancing act can work reasonable well while economic conditions are positive; now, thanks to the high market price for energy, the Russian economy does reasonably well. But waiting in the wings are a number of fundamentally serious problems. The economy is inherently unstable with its heavy dependence on energy exports. Health problems, including widespread alcoholism, undermine the capabilities of the work force and the confidence of the people in their government. Although nationalist appeals are almost exclusively aimed at Russians, the demographic tide is running against this base of legitimacy. The number of Russians continues to fall drastically, while the Muslim population steadily climbs; by 2020 they will probably be a fifth of the population and may well outnumber Russians by the middle of the century. An influx of illegal immigrants, mainly Muslims, only exacerbates this problem. Moscow still pays only scant attention to environmental issues. Extensive wildfires in 2010 gave visibility to the challenge, which global warming may well intensify. Generally it has been clear that neglecting environmental considerations can give a decided boost to a developing economy, but it comes at longer term costs that can bring development to a screeching halt. In particular, it worsens public health, which is already very poor in Russia. As is true globally, the internet makes alternate information widely available, providing Russians with alternative views on real conditions within Russia and globally. In particular, everyday Russians learn more and more about how the elite are concentrating wealth into their own hands. The Russian international position depends on both its economic performance and the willingness of the West to accept Russian transgressions against accepted legal and human rights standards and international business norms. The patience of the West is wearing thin on these issues and foreign direct investment – something that could help drive a real economic expansion – has dropped drastically. The challenge for the leadership is that basing legitimacy on economic performance is a constant struggle, while deflecting attention from internal repression with references to Russia's special mission, the need for &quot;managed democracy,&quot; and the imperative to stand up to pressure from the West.</span><br />

<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 5pt;"> U.S. Rep. Chris Murphy, a candidate for the U.S. Senate, is urging the leadership of two legislative committees crafting the next federal highway bill to strengthen requirements mandating American-made components on transportation projects. Murphy, D-5, sent a letter signed by 47 of his colleagues to the chairs of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is chaired by John Mica, a Republican congressman from central Florida, while California Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, is chairwoman of Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Existing Buy American requirements mandate that all steel, iron and manufactured goods used to construct federal highway projects are produced in the U.S. And although Boxer is one of the committee leaders whose opinion Murphy is trying to sway, his letter is openly critical of how her home state used a loophole in the requirements for federal road and bridge projects. “Currently, state and local governments can split infrastructure projects into separate contracts, complying with Buy America and receiving federal dollars for one portion, and using other sources for the non-Buy America compliant remainder of the project,” Murphy said. “The State of California used this strategy for its new Bay Bridge, sending hundreds of millions of dollars to China for work that should have been done by Americans.”</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The world economy has already experienced both &quot;Quantitative Easing I (QE-I)&quot; and &quot;Quantitative Easing II (QE-II)&quot; operations by the US Federal Reserve Board (Fed). However, these operations did not seem to have done the US real economy much good. Much of the excess liquidity generated went overseas, driving up exchange rates and asset prices elsewhere. If the US had some form of capital control, so that the excess liquidity had to be kept and used within the US, it might perhaps have driven up some US asset prices and led to some additional domestic investment. However, that has not been the case. At this point, only an expansion of real aggregate demand can serve as an effective signal for a change in expectations. However, it does not appear likely that the US Congress will authorize a fiscal expansion, even though that is exactly what is needed. There is ample excess capacity in the US economy, especially in the construction sector and the building materials sector. What the US government should undertake is an expansion of capital expenditures focused on public infrastructure on the one hand and a reduction in recurrent expenditures on the other. It should be supporting growth and imposing austerity at the same time. How can this be done, especially with a Congress that is unwilling to authorize any increase in expenditures, whether capital or recurrent? One possibility is for the Fed, in its next round of bond buying, to purchase new long-term bonds, issued by the individual states and earmarked for public infrastructure in the respective states. For example, the Fed can offer to purchase a total of $600 billion worth of new state bonds from the individual states, roughly in proportion to the population of each state, with the proviso that the proceeds must be used for infrastructural projects - either new construction or maintenance and upgrading of existing infrastructure - and cannot be used to pay for the recurrent expenditures of the state (e.g., salaries of the state government employees) per se. These infrastructural projects may include roads, highways, railroads, airports, seaports, bridges, dams, and even hospitals and schools, etc. This will increase aggregate demand, GDP, and employment in every state, and will be utilizing basically the excess capacity in the construction sector and the building materials sector and hence are unlikely to be inflationary. Moreover, such investments will turn out to be socially productive, given the current deteriorated state of US public infrastructure, by enhancing the rates of return of past, present and future private investment. In addition, these expenditures on infrastructural projects will not increase the federal budget deficit; on the contrary, because of the GDP and employment that they will create in every state, they may actually help to reduce the federal as well as state budget deficits. Of course, the individual states will have to pay the interest on the bonds and eventually repay the principal. However, the long-term rate of interest is at a record low and state revenues will benefit directly from the increased GDP and employment in the states. In addition, the states can take a long period, say 30 years, to repay the bonds, during which time the state economies will have recovered sufficiently. I believe all 50 states will support such a bond purchase plan. (In fact, a similar plan can be used for Greece, so that while Greece needs to reduce its recurrent government expenditures, it can still undertake some capital projects so as to maintain some economic growth and prevent unemployment from becoming too high.) </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Many Americans might be surprised to hear that this state of affairs leaves China's top leaders concerned that the United States is falling too far behind, simply because its political system has such a hard time bringing about rational, long-term policy decisions. These leaders know that the fates of the United States and China are joined at the hip . With over $1 trillion in U.S. Treasury holdings, the Chinese government has a vested interest in the future performance of the United States. A country eating its seed corn by not investing enough in public infrastructure and instead relying on the inherent &quot;wisdom&quot; of private investors is a cause for concern. At the same time, the Chinese feel that they cannot in good conscience invest in more Treasury paper. What’s the point, they ask, in funding a defense budget the United States could not otherwise afford — or bankrolling cash-flow deficits in the Social Security accounts of the baby boom generation? Given all that, China's leaders must be pondering a truly revolutionary thought: How about using their dollar-denominated funds to capitalize an Infrastructure Bank for the United States (IBUS), as well as underwriting many of its upcoming investment projects? At first glance, such a step would seem a heretical move for China's still-communist leaders. However, today’s alliances are no longer so much a matter of ideology, but of cash-flow recycling and balance sheet optimization. While the investment needs within China remain big, the country’s leaders do have a plan in place to fund them for decades. Whatever happens at home, they also have to make rational use of all the U.S. dollars they earn from exports to the United States. What nobler, more rational and long-term-oriented purpose than to fund the IBUS? China, after all, is a rapidly aging nation, with lots of financing needs to support its large population in old age. How better to meet those needs than by investing in a demographically young nation now (the United States) — and then waiting for the returns on that investment to flow back to China over time? Not even the Chinese military could be opposed to this plan. While it might superficially be seen as a self-defeating, if not traitorous, act to strengthen one's primary opponent, those generals are business savvy these days. While the generals in China, as well as the leaders of the Chinese Community Party, may well be ready to underwrite the IBUS, U.S. politicians can be counted upon to go apoplectic if such a proposal were ever to come to pass. Still, it might turn out that China's plan for a truly stunning foreign mission to rebuild U.S. infrastructure will come to pass one way or another. In the end, it will be an amazing moment in the annals of global capitalism when China — presumably the developing country, but really an old, mature power thinking about the global system and its own needs in a very long-term manner — will come to the aid of that upstart, the United States. While being presumed to be a mature industrial democracy, the United States really is a youngish country — and one that still has to contend with its errant ways. But “Uncle Wen,” his colleagues and successors have a clear and comforting message for Washington and the entire United States: “Don't worry, America. From our own history, we know about losing one's path and how painful it can be for a country and its entire population — and also the world. “We Chinese,” Premier Wen Jiabao says when he is daydreaming, “are here to help. Let's hope you Americans are enlightened enough to accept our assistance. “Otherwise, you Americans will be in for a serious detour, one that will not only shortchange the future prospects of many Americans, but of the entire world economy. Let's hope that outcome can be avoided.”</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">When Democrats announced a moratorium on earmarks and a promise to pass meaningful reform in the aftermath of their election victaory I was cautiously optimistic and praised that announcement. The question then, as I wrote here on H.E., was whether they would follow through on their promises to voters and enact real reforms for the fiscal 2008 appropriations process. Well the results are in and the Democratic majority has failed the test badly. Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee David Obey announced yesterday that the House will keep all of its earmarks secret through the initial passage of the appropriations bills, adding them in only at the last minute in conference committees, where they will not be subject to public scrutiny, debate, or floor amendment. Conference committees are supposed to be for reconciling differences between House and Senate versions of legislation. Earmarks conjured out of nowhere in conference have long been identified as one of the most abusive earmarking practices. By the time a bill emerges from conference the more contentious points have usually been settled, often after a long drawn out process, and the bills are likely to be enacted. It is often a scramble against time to meet the end of the fiscal year or the expiration of a continuing resolution. Adding earmarks at that stage virtually guarantees that indefensible projects will be funded because they will escape any meaningful public review or congressional debate. Adding earmarks in conference reports is also a violation of the standing rules of both the House and Senate. The relevant House rule (rule XXII, paragraph 9) says: “Moreover, a conference report may not include matter not committed to the conference committee by either House.” The relevant Senate rule (rule XXVIII, paragraph 2) says: “Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not committed to them by either House, nor shall they strike from the bill matter agreed to by both Houses.” When these rules were broken by Republican majorities, Democrats correctly called foul. In fact, last year the Democrats denounced the Republican earmark reform bill for its failure to definitively end the practice. The Democrat alternative last year, an amendment sponsored by Rahm Emanuel (D.-Ill.), caucus chair and architect of the new majority, would have prohibited “the inclusion of earmarks and other provisions in conference reports without the language having first been in either the House or Senate legislation’s original language.” Not only are Democrats now refusing to specifically prohibit the practice, but Chairman Obey is using the conference committee method to block transparency of all House earmarks. Far from setting a new standard of openness and ethics, the Democrats, are now setting a new low for public accountability with respect to earmarking, disregarding their campaign promises as well as the rules of the Congress. Organizations like Americans for Prosperity are most effective when we can point to outrageous earmarks to get the public engaged and energized, as our success in bringing together thousands of activists for limited government on the Ending Earmarks Express tour last year demonstrated. By keeping the entire earmark process a secret until the last minute, the new House process will make it impossible for activists, groups and ordinary citizens to weigh in against even the most egregious wastes of their tax dollars until it’s too late. </span><br />

NEPA laid out fairly bare-boned &quot;action-forcing&quot; provisions for meeting its goals. n45 For major federal actions significantly affecting the environment, NEPA requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS). The EIS provides a description of the proposed project, the existing environment, and an analysis of the anticipated beneficial and adverse environmental effects of the proposed project and all reasonable alternatives. One of these alternatives is required to be a &quot;no-build&quot; alternative.

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Since 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) has required federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions and provide the public a meaningful opportunity to participate in agency decision making. The proper application of NEPA ensures that agencies make well-informed decisions that are supported by a robust consideration of the environmental effects of both the proposed action and alternatives to that action, the cumulative effects of the proposed action and its alternatives, and concerns raised by the public. The past eight years have witnessed an assault on NEPA that has eroded the application of the law to the point where major federal actions with significant environmental effects are taken without any environmental analysis. First, some agencies have improperly shifted the application of NEPA to later stages of decision making. CEQ regulations state that agencies should integrate the NEPA process at the earliest time possible; the regulations also expressly state that the adoption of “formal plans” is major federal action subject to NEPA. However, agencies have not heeded this mandate, with one agency (the Forest Service) going as far as seeking to exempt planning documents entirely from NEPA analysis. By misconstruing NEPA to mean that an agency does not have to conduct a NEPA analysis until narrow, site-specific actions are taken, agencies have effectively exempted themselves from NEPA’s provisions at the decision stage. Moreover, some agencies fail to apply NEPA until after they have entered binding contracts that create a financial incentive for the agency to go forward with an action regardless of its environmental impacts. Second, agencies have improperly expanded the use of categorical exclusions (CEs) to exempt categories of activities that may have significant environmental effects from environmental review. A categorical exclusion is “a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment”, and therefore do not require preparation of environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. CEs are approved through an agency’s NEPA implementing procedures or, in one case, through legislation. If extraordinary circumstances exist that may cause the proposed action to have a significant effect on the environment, that action cannot be categorically excluded from NEPA analysis. When used appropriately, CEs can save agencies time and resources, and avoid duplicative analysis for actions that will not have a significant effect on the environment. However, when there are substantive questions about whether an action’s impacts are significant, the public deserves the opportunity to be part of the process for evaluating potential impacts. Over the past eight years, agencies and Congress have expanded the approval and application of CEs. No longer are CEs applied to only discrete actions that do not have a significant environmental effect; instead, CEs have been expanded to include broad categories of actions that should receive a detailed look by the agencies and the public because these actions may have significant direct or cumulative impacts on the environment. Also, some agencies have failed to provide for extraordinary circumstances that would limit the application of CEs to environmentally insignificant actions. Thus, potentially significant actions are approved with minimal to no environmental review or public input. Reinforcing CEQ’s Leadership Role in the CE Process On September 19, 2006, CEQ published draft guidance designed to aid agencies in the establishment, revision, and use of CEs. This guidance has not been finalized. The next Administration should issue final guidance that will reinforce CEQ’s leadership role in the CE process and reflect the changes suggested in comments submitted jointly by over 100 local and national environmental organizations.1 Specifically, the final guidance should, inter alia, (1) require agencies to consult with CEQ early in the drafting of the proposed CE and at minimum before the proposed CE is published in the Federal Register, (2) require agencies to provide CEQ with a comprehensive administrative record supporting the new or revised CE, (3) require that agencies make information supporting CEs available to the public, and (4) instruct agencies to avoid establishing CEs for activities likely to generate public opposition regarding effects on the human environment. Responsible Official: CEQ Chair Review of CEs that raise significant concerns The next Administration should carefully review the CEs that raise significant concerns, and retract those that include actions that may individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the environment, thus requiring environmental review.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">A distinguishing feature of any society is its prevailing assumptions about its relationship to the Earth. The history of cultures--especially of religions--reveals a great number of cosmologies, the perceived relationships of people to their planetary environment. Today the survival of living species may depend first, upon the degree to which mankind's concept of its environmental situation corresponds to biophysical realities and second, upon what humans value, and how these values are expressed in relation to these realities. Archeology has recorded the failure of societies that have misconceived the requirements for environmental sustainability. During the earlier centuries of human history the impact of society on its environment was relatively light and local. If an environment, for whatever reason, became unsustainable, people could often move on to new lands, often displacing or destroying the original inhabitants. When degradation of the environment was slow or scarcely perceptible, the consequences of its decline often were not felt until they were irreversible. Where human numbers were small relative to space, migration permitted impaired environments to recover, at least partially. But many areas of the Earth have never recovered from the degradation of centuries-long misuse, and still more are headed toward impoverishment. In a world filled with people and settlements, the option of migration is increasingly unavailable. Recognition of narrowing environmental options has led in recent decades to conservation practices assisted by the growth of science, to the comparative measurement of environmental change, and to forecasts of the probable consequences of present trends. The conservation of natural resources movement has had a paradoxical effect upon human perceptions of environmental realities. While the conservation movement contributed both to the emergence of applied ecology and public environmental concern, many conservationists rejected environmentalism (often called preservationism) as uneconomical, unrealistic and anti-social. Economy and efficiency in the wise use of resources has been the essence of &quot;conservation,&quot; which sees the environment as infinitely manageable--capable of sustained productivity under the guidance of experts knowledgeable of science. In this respect, conservationism [*236] is fundamentally consistent with the Western worldview, especially that which prevailed during the era of U.S. Progressivism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n82" rel="nofollow">n82</a></span> Environmentalism emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century from a convergence of changing perceptions of the human condition in fields as diverse as ecology, public health, demography, climatology, cosmology, and ethics. When its true dimensions, assumptions, and expectations are understood, environmentalism is, as Robert Nisbet observed, revolutionary. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n83" rel="nofollow">n83</a></span> Its effect upon human society is comparable to the changed views of reality inherent in the Copernican cosmic revolution in the seventeenth century and the Darwinian evolution revolution in the nineteenth century. To some, this conclusion may seem to be an exaggerated estimate of the influence of environmentalism and its future prospects. Following initial successes of environmental protection efforts, there has been in many countries (including the United States) an anti-government reaction that has sometimes been violent. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n84" rel="nofollow">n84</a></span> It is doubtful that in the long run the &quot;green backlash&quot; will prevail. Its angry proponents are chiefly natural resources industries, land developers and speculators, libertarians, and their allies in public office. Still the counter-intuitive behavior of social systems makes any forecast of the future uncertain. Nevertheless there are ascertainable, measurable trends in today's world that strongly suggest the impending negative impact of powerful coercive environmental events upon human society in the twenty-first century. Adherence to principles like those expressed in NEPA may become more a matter of necessity than of voluntary choice. The way in which people and their governments respond to the prospect of these coercions will shape the future of the world. The timing of effective response is equally important. The longer the delay, the more [*237] difficult the task and the greater the possibility of irremediable damage. Because the future of the world in the twenty-first century cannot be foreseen, we can only conjecture the true location of NEPA on the trajectory of history. I offer the following assessment of the significance of NEPA, fully realizing that, at least in the short run, the world is capable of unpredictable turns. NEPA is most fully understood as a national policy for henceforward into the future. &quot;Environment&quot; may be understood as a surrogate term for a concept more comprehensive than is usually appreciated. Our language tends to lag behind new insights. Among our most persistent and pervasive misconceptions is the artificial dichotomy of economy/ecology. Their true relationship might be suggested by the time-space concept in physics. The concepts of ecology and economy are not the same--they are distinguishable, but, paradoxically, also inseparable.<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n85" rel="nofollow">n85</a></span> In mundane reality there are obvious conflicts within and between the &quot;domains&quot; of economy and the environment. Yet both these aspects of our world are in actuality inextricable--separable by cultural convention and for analytic purposes. In reality they should have a common inclusive name. Achievement of a national policy for the environment requires awareness of the ecology/economy interrelationship, of the direction toward which the world appears to be moving, and a growth of consensus on the kind of future that is desirable and sustainable. A national policy for the future of the environment cannot be achieved in isolation from other major societal issues. Issues of population, material growth, property rights and obligations, and basic social equities involve choices which many people would prefer not to make. But the world today is not a &quot;new age of Aquarius,&quot; free from ultimate accountability to nature, if not to humanity. Regardless of what we may deny or resist, our society will in one way or another be compelled to accommodate its behaviors [*238] to the inexorable workings of the world. But apocalypse need not be a preordained outcome for a society that marshals and moves its moral, material, intellectual, and organizational capabilities toward attainment of a preferred and sustainable future. IX. AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE The National Environmental Policy Act may be seen as a charter and agenda to guide this nation toward rational strategies for coping with the critical environmental problems that are present and growing. The United States has the material and intellectual capabilities for setting a non-hegemonic example for the world. Whether it can generate a collective moral purpose to do so remains uncertain. As individuals, there is little that people can do to reverse destructive socio-ecological trends. Voluntary local initiatives may help where there is a sense of community purpose. But our fundamental environmental problems transcend manmade boundaries and require solutions commensurate with the problems, which are increasingly seen to be transnational, even global. The 1968 Biosphere Conference and the 1972 and 1992 U.N. conferences on the environment testify to an international recognition of mankind's environmental predicament. Yet in a world governed by nations, national action is necessary, not only for each nation, but for international cooperation. Action on any major social issue requires a credible collective purpose, catalytic leadership, and popular receptivity. There is strong evidence that the last of these--public support for environmental action--already exists. A goal-directed agenda is necessary to focus and activate social effort, for without such a codification of purpose, there can be no concerted action. Translation of social purpose into action is a function of leadership. To cope with the environmental predicament of mankind, leadership must be national and participatory, involving all sectors of society, but with an indispensable responsibility in government which is the affirmingand coordinative institution for nationwide and international effort. For the United States, NEPA provides a comprehensive agenda for the environmental future. NEPA creates a foundation for a unifying national effort and legitimizes its goals and principles as [*239] national policy. Beyond NEPA, specific, targeted action programs are needed to achieve its intent. NEPA may be regarded, in effect, as a constitution for the environment--principles to guide the nation toward an enhanced quality of life and an enduring environmental future.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The world is heading for an &quot;ecological credit crunch&quot; far worse than the current financial crisis because humans are over-using the natural resources of the planet, an international study warns today. The Living Planet report calculates that humans are using 30% more resources than the Earth can replenish each year, which is leading to deforestation, degraded soils, polluted air and water, and dramatic declines in numbers of fish and other species. As a result, we are running up an ecological debt of $4tr (£2.5tr) to $4.5tr every year - double the estimated losses made by the world's financial institutions as a result of the credit crisis - say the report's authors, led by the conservation group WWF, formerly the World Wildlife Fund. The figure is based on a UN report which calculated the economic value of services provided by ecosystems destroyed annually, such as diminished rainfall for crops or reduced flood protection. The problem is also getting worse as populations and consumption keep growing faster than technology finds new ways of expanding what can be produced from the natural world. This had led the report to predict that by 2030, if nothing changes, [hu]mankind would need two planets to sustain its lifestyle. &quot;The recent downturn in the global economy is a stark reminder of the consequences of living beyond our means,&quot; says James Leape, WWF International's director general. &quot;But the possibility of financial recession pales in comparison to the looming ecological credit crunch.&quot; The report continues: &quot;We have only one planet. Its capacity to support a thriving diversity of species, humans included, is large but fundamentally limited. When human demand on this capacity exceeds what is available - when we surpass ecological limits - we erode the health of the Earth's living systems. Ultimately this loss threatens human well-being.&quot; Speaking yesterday in London, the report's authors also called for politicians to mount a huge international response in line with the multibillion-dollar rescue plan for the economy. &quot;They now need to turn their collective action to a far more pressing concern and that's the survival of all life on planet Earth,&quot; said Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the president of WWF International.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Yet another criticism of the NEPA review process is that it impedes the development of consensus support for solutions to environmental problems. In fact, there is no necessary conflict between the decision-making process established by NEPA and the formation of consensus around particular projects or programs. Properly conducted, the NEPA process can be instrumental in achieving lasting solutions with broad public support. Those who insist on seeing conflict between NEPA and consensus building argue, in effect, for rolling back the most valuable aspects of the NEPA process for no good reason. According to some critics, conflict between NEPA and so-called “collaborative” decision-making processes is inevitable. Collaborative decision-making is typically understood as an iterative process of consultation among government officials and stakeholder representatives designed to develop a consensus solution for a particular natural resource problem. Expressing a representative viewpoint, Douglas MacDonald, Secretary of Transportation for the State of Washington, recently opined that the NEPA process “creates a context for discussion and problem-solving that maximizes the polarization of opinion, the staking out of positions, and the exclusion of iteration and compromise in problem solving.” 49 To like effect, the Deputy Chief of the Forest Service has commented: The requirement that alternatives to proposed actions and their effects be documented in an environmental impact statement and environmental assessment prior to a decision does not facilitate a collaborative process between agencies or with other interests. ... Documenting and circulating ... alternatives in a draft and final document for public comment fosters an assumption that the decision maker has a range of options to choose from and various interests can weigh in and comment on the alternatives they support. There is no incentive built into the NEPA process to work toward a single solution that accommodates multiple interests. 50 The Forest Service’s new forest planning regulations reflect this viewpoint, calling the traditional approach of developing and evaluating alternatives in the planning process “divisive.” 51 Under the new regulations, forest plans will be developed through a “collaborative” process that “encourage[s] people to work together to understand each other and find common solutions.” 52 Significantly, environmental analysis will apparently play little if any role in that endeavor; the planning regulations state that Forest Service will not provide “indepth social, economic, or ecological analysis” for options that are discussed in the collaborative process, 53 and the Service separately proposed to exempt forest planning from NEPA analysis altogether. 54 There is unquestionably a serious tension between the NEPA process and the type of “collaborative” approach advanced by the Forest Service. As discussed, NEPA is based on the principles that information on environmental impacts is important in making rational choices among options and that the public should have broad access to the decision-making process. The Forest Service’s approach ignores both principles, threatening to recreate the kind of narrow, environmentally-insensitive decision-making that prevailed prior to NEPA’s enactment. By essentially eliminating environmental analysis, the Forest Service’s approach leaves agency personnel and other participants in the planning process effectively blind to the potential effects of a proposed management approach. The agency’s refusal to identify and evaluate alternatives, in particular, will preclude meaningful evaluation of the potential environmental benefits and tradeoffs offered by different management approaches. Furthermore, the Forest Service’s substitution of a vague “collaborative” process for the clearly-defined rights of public involvement under NEPA threatens to limit, and possibly bias, public engagement in the planning process. The Forest Service will itself choose the participants in its collaborative process; it may either deliberately or instinctively select citizens and groups that it views as likely to agree with its views, and exclude those that it anticipates will make reaching “consensus” difficult. Thus, the representativeness and fairness of the agency’s collaborative process will frequently be open to question. Citizens outside the collaborative process, meanwhile, will be denied all the procedural rights afforded by NEPA, including the opportunity to participate in scoping sessions, to receive information on the environmental impacts of the agency’s proposed action, to propose alternative approaches, and to offer comments on the accuracy of the agency’s environmental analysis. Ultimately, the Forest Service’s approach appears to be based on the notion that by embracing a philosophy of “collaboration,” and controlling the range of viewpoints involved in planning, the agency can magically make disputes over management of forest lands disappear. In reality, management of federal lands, like most government actions affecting the environment, inevitably raises conflicts among different values and interests. NEPA is based on the sound premise that these types of conflicts are best resolved through an inclusive, analytically rigorous process, not an artificially-constrained search for consensus. There are other approaches to “collaborative” decision-making that do allow federal agencies to engage the public broadly in their planning processes without undercutting environmental reviews. There is no necessary conflict between a well-managed NEPA process and an effort to arrive at a conclusion supported by broad public consensus. The scoping process that agencies undertake before beginning preparation of an EIS is explicitly intended to be a collaborative process, albeit an open one, drawing together agency planners, concerned citizens, tribes and other affected governments to define the key environmental issues and alternative approaches that should be studied by the agency. Agencies can continue that cooperative approach throughout the EIS process, consulting with the public and with other affected interests to build consensus on a preferred alternative, on mitigation measures, and on issues arising during scientific studies in the course of preparing the EIS. Concurrent with or subsequent to the NEPA process, agencies can employ alternative dispute resolution, negotiated rule-making, or other techniques in an attempt to arrive at a conclusion with broad public support. 55 Such dispute resolution efforts are actually more likely to succeed once disputed issues have been thoroughly aired and narrowed through the NEPA review process. The recent success in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington State, described earlier, illustrates the potential for NEPA to help generate solutions with broad public support. In that case, environmentalists, timber companies, local citizens and the Forest Service used the NEPA process as the springboard for negotiating a new management approach for the national forest that reconciled timber harvesting with ecological goals. A local resident involved in the process concluded: “We were able to get timber out in an environmentally responsible way, and we succeeded in avoiding appeals that plague controversial timber sales.” 56</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Since 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) has required federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions and provide the public a meaningful opportunity to participate in agency decision making. The proper application of NEPA ensures that agencies make well-informed decisions that are supported by a robust consideration of the environmental effects of both the proposed action and alternatives to that action, the cumulative effects of the proposed action and its alternatives, and concerns raised by the public. The past eight years have witnessed an assault on NEPA that has eroded the application of the law to the point where major federal actions with significant environmental effects are taken without any environmental analysis. First, some agencies have improperly shifted the application of NEPA to later stages of decision making. CEQ regulations state that agencies should integrate the NEPA process at the earliest time possible; the regulations also expressly state that the adoption of “formal plans” is major federal action subject to NEPA. However, agencies have not heeded this mandate, with one agency (the Forest Service) going as far as seeking to exempt planning documents entirely from NEPA analysis. By misconstruing NEPA to mean that an agency does not have to conduct a NEPA analysis until narrow, site-specific actions are taken, agencies have effectively exempted themselves from NEPA’s provisions at the decision stage. Moreover, some agencies fail to apply NEPA until after they have entered binding contracts that create a financial incentive for the agency to go forward with an action regardless of its environmental impacts. Second, agencies have improperly expanded the use of categorical exclusions (CEs) to exempt categories of activities that may have significant environmental effects from environmental review. A categorical exclusion is “a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment”, and therefore do not require preparation of environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. CEs are approved through an agency’s NEPA implementing procedures or, in one case, through legislation. If extraordinary circumstances exist that may cause the proposed action to have a significant effect on the environment, that action cannot be categorically excluded from NEPA analysis. When used appropriately, CEs can save agencies time and resources, and avoid duplicative analysis for actions that will not have a significant effect on the environment. However, when there are substantive questions about whether an action’s impacts are significant, the public deserves the opportunity to be part of the process for evaluating potential impacts. Over the past eight years, agencies and Congress have expanded the approval and application of CEs. No longer are CEs applied to only discrete actions that do not have a significant environmental effect; instead, CEs have been expanded to include broad categories of actions that should receive a detailed look by the agencies and the public because these actions may have significant direct or cumulative impacts on the environment. Also, some agencies have failed to provide for extraordinary circumstances that would limit the application of CEs to environmentally insignificant actions. Thus, potentially significant actions are approved with minimal to no environmental review or public input. Reinforcing CEQ’s Leadership Role in the CE Process On September 19, 2006, CEQ published draft guidance designed to aid agencies in the establishment, revision, and use of CEs. This guidance has not been finalized. The next Administration should issue final guidance that will reinforce CEQ’s leadership role in the CE process and reflect the changes suggested in comments submitted jointly by over 100 local and national environmental organizations.1 Specifically, the final guidance should, inter alia, (1) require agencies to consult with CEQ early in the drafting of the proposed CE and at minimum before the proposed CE is published in the Federal Register, (2) require agencies to provide CEQ with a comprehensive administrative record supporting the new or revised CE, (3) require that agencies make information supporting CEs available to the public, and (4) instruct agencies to avoid establishing CEs for activities likely to generate public opposition regarding effects on the human environment. Responsible Official: CEQ Chair Review of CEs that raise significant concerns The next Administration should carefully review the CEs that raise significant concerns, and retract those that include actions that may individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the environment, thus requiring environmental review.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">A distinguishing feature of any society is its prevailing assumptions about its relationship to the Earth. The history of cultures--especially of religions--reveals a great number of cosmologies, the perceived relationships of people to their planetary environment. Today the survival of living species may depend first, upon the degree to which mankind's concept of its environmental situation corresponds to biophysical realities and second, upon what humans value, and how these values are expressed in relation to these realities. Archeology has recorded the failure of societies that have misconceived the requirements for environmental sustainability. During the earlier centuries of human history the impact of society on its environment was relatively light and local. If an environment, for whatever reason, became unsustainable, people could often move on to new lands, often displacing or destroying the original inhabitants. When degradation of the environment was slow or scarcely perceptible, the consequences of its decline often were not felt until they were irreversible. Where human numbers were small relative to space, migration permitted impaired environments to recover, at least partially. But many areas of the Earth have never recovered from the degradation of centuries-long misuse, and still more are headed toward impoverishment. In a world filled with people and settlements, the option of migration is increasingly unavailable. Recognition of narrowing environmental options has led in recent decades to conservation practices assisted by the growth of science, to the comparative measurement of environmental change, and to forecasts of the probable consequences of present trends. The conservation of natural resources movement has had a paradoxical effect upon human perceptions of environmental realities. While the conservation movement contributed both to the emergence of applied ecology and public environmental concern, many conservationists rejected environmentalism (often called preservationism) as uneconomical, unrealistic and anti-social. Economy and efficiency in the wise use of resources has been the essence of &quot;conservation,&quot; which sees the environment as infinitely manageable--capable of sustained productivity under the guidance of experts knowledgeable of science. In this respect, conservationism [*236] is fundamentally consistent with the Western worldview, especially that which prevailed during the era of U.S. Progressivism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n82" rel="nofollow">n82</a></span> Environmentalism emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century from a convergence of changing perceptions of the human condition in fields as diverse as ecology, public health, demography, climatology, cosmology, and ethics. When its true dimensions, assumptions, and expectations are understood, environmentalism is, as Robert Nisbet observed, revolutionary. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n83" rel="nofollow">n83</a></span> Its effect upon human society is comparable to the changed views of reality inherent in the Copernican cosmic revolution in the seventeenth century and the Darwinian evolution revolution in the nineteenth century. To some, this conclusion may seem to be an exaggerated estimate of the influence of environmentalism and its future prospects. Following initial successes of environmental protection efforts, there has been in many countries (including the United States) an anti-government reaction that has sometimes been violent. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n84" rel="nofollow">n84</a></span> It is doubtful that in the long run the &quot;green backlash&quot; will prevail. Its angry proponents are chiefly natural resources industries, land developers and speculators, libertarians, and their allies in public office. Still the counter-intuitive behavior of social systems makes any forecast of the future uncertain. Nevertheless there are ascertainable, measurable trends in today's world that strongly suggest the impending negative impact of powerful coercive environmental events upon human society in the twenty-first century. Adherence to principles like those expressed in NEPA may become more a matter of necessity than of voluntary choice. The way in which people and their governments respond to the prospect of these coercions will shape the future of the world. The timing of effective response is equally important. The longer the delay, the more [*237] difficult the task and the greater the possibility of irremediable damage. Because the future of the world in the twenty-first century cannot be foreseen, we can only conjecture the true location of NEPA on the trajectory of history. I offer the following assessment of the significance of NEPA, fully realizing that, at least in the short run, the world is capable of unpredictable turns. NEPA is most fully understood as a national policy for henceforward into the future. &quot;Environment&quot; may be understood as a surrogate term for a concept more comprehensive than is usually appreciated. Our language tends to lag behind new insights. Among our most persistent and pervasive misconceptions is the artificial dichotomy of economy/ecology. Their true relationship might be suggested by the time-space concept in physics. The concepts of ecology and economy are not the same--they are distinguishable, but, paradoxically, also inseparable.<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n85" rel="nofollow">n85</a></span> In mundane reality there are obvious conflicts within and between the &quot;domains&quot; of economy and the environment. Yet both these aspects of our world are in actuality inextricable--separable by cultural convention and for analytic purposes. In reality they should have a common inclusive name. Achievement of a national policy for the environment requires awareness of the ecology/economy interrelationship, of the direction toward which the world appears to be moving, and a growth of consensus on the kind of future that is desirable and sustainable. A national policy for the future of the environment cannot be achieved in isolation from other major societal issues. Issues of population, material growth, property rights and obligations, and basic social equities involve choices which many people would prefer not to make. But the world today is not a &quot;new age of Aquarius,&quot; free from ultimate accountability to nature, if not to humanity. Regardless of what we may deny or resist, our society will in one way or another be compelled to accommodate its behaviors [*238] to the inexorable workings of the world. But apocalypse need not be a preordained outcome for a society that marshals and moves its moral, material, intellectual, and organizational capabilities toward attainment of a preferred and sustainable future. IX. AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE The National Environmental Policy Act may be seen as a charter and agenda to guide this nation toward rational strategies for coping with the critical environmental problems that are present and growing. The United States has the material and intellectual capabilities for setting a non-hegemonic example for the world. Whether it can generate a collective moral purpose to do so remains uncertain. As individuals, there is little that people can do to reverse destructive socio-ecological trends. Voluntary local initiatives may help where there is a sense of community purpose. But our fundamental environmental problems transcend manmade boundaries and require solutions commensurate with the problems, which are increasingly seen to be transnational, even global. The 1968 Biosphere Conference and the 1972 and 1992 U.N. conferences on the environment testify to an international recognition of mankind's environmental predicament. Yet in a world governed by nations, national action is necessary, not only for each nation, but for international cooperation. Action on any major social issue requires a credible collective purpose, catalytic leadership, and popular receptivity. There is strong evidence that the last of these--public support for environmental action--already exists. A goal-directed agenda is necessary to focus and activate social effort, for without such a codification of purpose, there can be no concerted action. Translation of social purpose into action is a function of leadership. To cope with the environmental predicament of mankind, leadership must be national and participatory, involving all sectors of society, but with an indispensable responsibility in government which is the affirmingand coordinative institution for nationwide and international effort. For the United States, NEPA provides a comprehensive agenda for the environmental future. NEPA creates a foundation for a unifying national effort and legitimizes its goals and principles as [*239] national policy. Beyond NEPA, specific, targeted action programs are needed to achieve its intent. NEPA may be regarded, in effect, as a constitution for the environment--principles to guide the nation toward an enhanced quality of life and an enduring environmental future.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The world is heading for an &quot;ecological credit crunch&quot; far worse than the current financial crisis because humans are over-using the natural resources of the planet, an international study warns today. The Living Planet report calculates that humans are using 30% more resources than the Earth can replenish each year, which is leading to deforestation, degraded soils, polluted air and water, and dramatic declines in numbers of fish and other species. As a result, we are running up an ecological debt of $4tr (£2.5tr) to $4.5tr every year - double the estimated losses made by the world's financial institutions as a result of the credit crisis - say the report's authors, led by the conservation group WWF, formerly the World Wildlife Fund. The figure is based on a UN report which calculated the economic value of services provided by ecosystems destroyed annually, such as diminished rainfall for crops or reduced flood protection. The problem is also getting worse as populations and consumption keep growing faster than technology finds new ways of expanding what can be produced from the natural world. This had led the report to predict that by 2030, if nothing changes, [hu]mankind would need two planets to sustain its lifestyle. &quot;The recent downturn in the global economy is a stark reminder of the consequences of living beyond our means,&quot; says James Leape, WWF International's director general. &quot;But the possibility of financial recession pales in comparison to the looming ecological credit crunch.&quot; The report continues: &quot;We have only one planet. Its capacity to support a thriving diversity of species, humans included, is large but fundamentally limited. When human demand on this capacity exceeds what is available - when we surpass ecological limits - we erode the health of the Earth's living systems. Ultimately this loss threatens human well-being.&quot; Speaking yesterday in London, the report's authors also called for politicians to mount a huge international response in line with the multibillion-dollar rescue plan for the economy. &quot;They now need to turn their collective action to a far more pressing concern and that's the survival of all life on planet Earth,&quot; said Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the president of WWF International.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In many cases minority and low-income communities are disparately impacted by government actions because the communities do not have a voice in the decision-making process, and the communities lack the influence or political power of special interest groups that may support the government action. Broad and flexible public participation provisions, like those in NEPA, empower communities and provide them with a voice in the decisionmaking process. Broad and flexible public participation provisions also improve the government's decision-making process by enabling it to solicit information vital to that process. 36 Without such provisions, the federal government may reach decisions that disparately impact minority and low-income communities because the government fails to obtain input from the impacted communities. Arguably, the communities are the most important group of experts. Local individuals, who will be most directly affected by a government action, can provide unique information about the impacts of the proposed action that the government may be unable to obtain elsewhere. 37 This additional information enables the government to identify additional alternatives to the proposed action. As a result, it is more likely that the government can reach a decision that achieves its goal without disparately impacting minority or lowincome communities. 38</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The environmental protection apparatus in the United States does not provide equal protection for all communities. The environmental justice movement emerged in response to environmental inequities, threats to public health, unequal protection, differential enforcement, and disparate treatment received by the poor and people of color. The movement redefined environmental protection as a basic right. It also emphasized pollution prevention, waste minimization, and cleaner production techniques as strategies for achieving environmental justice for all Americans without regard to race, color, national origin, or income. The poisoning of African Americans in Louisiana's &quot;Cancer Alley,&quot; Native Americans on reservations, and Mexicans in the border towns all have their roots in the same economic system, a system characterized by economic exploitation, racial oppression, and devaluation of human life and the natural environment. Both race and class factors place low-income and people-of-color communities at spe-cial risk. Although environmental and civil rights laws have been on the books for more than 3 decades, all communities have not received the same benefits from their application, implementation, and enforcement. Unequal political power arrangements also have allowed poisons of the rich to be offered as short-term economic remedies for poverty. There is little or no corre-lation between proximity of industrial plants in communities of color and the employment opportunities of nearby residents. Having industrial facilities in one's community does not automatically translate into jobs for nearby residents. Many industrial plants are located at the fence line with the communities. Some are so close that local residents could walk to work. More often than not, communities of color are stuck with the pollution and poverty, while other people commute in for the industrial jobs. Similarly, tax breaks and corporate welfare programs have produced few new jobs by polluting firms. However, state-sponsored pollution and lax enforcement have allowed many communities of color and poor communities to become the dumping grounds. Louisiana is the poster child for corporate welfare. The state is mired in both poverty and pollution. It is no wonder that Louisiana's petrochemical corridor, the 85-mile stretch along the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge to New Orleans dubbed &quot;Cancer Alley,&quot; has become a hotbed for environmental justice activity. The environmental justice movement has set out clear goals of eliminating unequal enforcement of environmental, civil rights, and public health laws; differ-ential exposure of some populations to harmful chemicals, pesticides, and other toxins in the home, school, neighborhood, and workplace; faulty assumptions in calculating, assessing, and managing risks; discriminatory zoning and land use practices; and exclusionary policies and practices that limit some individuals and groups from participation in decision making. Many of these problems could be eliminated if existing environmental, health, housing, and civil rights laws were vigorously enforced in a nondiscriminatory way. The call for environmental and economic justice does not stop at the U.S. borders but extends to communities and nations that are threatened by the export of hazardous wastes, toxic products, and &quot;dirty&quot; industries. Much of the world does not get to share in the benefits of the United States' high standard of living. From energy consumption to the production and export of tobacco, pesticides, and other chemicals, more and more of the world's peoples are sharing the health and envi-ronmental burden of America's wasteful throwaway culture. Hazardous wastes and &quot;dirty&quot; industries have followed the path of least resistance. Poor people and poor nations are given a false choice of &quot;no jobs and no development&quot; versus &quot;risky, low-paying jobs and pollution.&quot; Industries and governments (including the military) have often exploited the economic vulnerability of poor communities, poor states, poor nations, and poor regions for their unsound and &quot;risky&quot; operations. Environmental justice leaders are demanding that no community or nation, rich or poor, urban or suburban, Black or White, be allowed to become a &quot;sacrifice zone&quot; or dumping grounds. They are also pressing governments to live up to their mandate of protecting public health and the environment.</span><br />

The country need not be named to be indicated as the ground on which the figures of speech appear. “Across the nation”, declared Tony Blair; “you, the people, who are our true heroes”, complimented Mandela, holding up the mirror of representation; Disraeli wanted to “live in the eye of the country”. Which country? Which people? Which nation? No specification is necessary: the nation is this nation, ‘our’ nation. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">This deixis can do its business unobtrusively, running up the flag so discreetly that it is unnoticed even by speaker or writer. The nation does not need to be mentioned, let alone named. Pierre Achard (1993) analyzed a sentence in a British newspaper: “Government pressure has forced colleges to increase dramatically the number of students. He comments that the frame of the text is the nation, without being designated as such: “Britain is the universe of the ongoing discourse”, although “the term ‘we’ is not used, and no external point relative to this universe is designated” (p. 82). Rae and Drury (1993), in an analysis of the way the phrase ‘the economy’ is used in newspapers, point out that there is an implied national frame and an implies ‘we’: the economy is ‘our’ economy. Deixis is being accomplished without the vulgar business of pointing. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The Guardian began its report of John Major’s European piece of flagwaving with the words: “The Prime Minister slipped into Bristol unannounced yesterday to give the first big speech of the Tories’ European election campaign” (24 May 1994). The sentence rhetorically sets the scene for the main story to follow. The very first word, which rhetorically draws no attention to itself, sets a scene for the scene-setting. It slips into the sentence unannounced: The Prime Minister. This is not any prime minister: it is the prime minister of ‘our country’ (the country). However, the phrase of ‘our country’ is omitted; it is unnecessary. The definite article accomplishes the deixis, indicating Britain as the centre of reader’s and writer’s (‘our’) shared universe. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">This form of deixis, in flagging the homeland, helps to make the homeland homely. Utterances are not merely produced by contexts, but they also renew those contracts (Heritage, 1984; Linell, 1990; Nofsinger, 1991). For example the ‘home’ is more than a mere physical place. To use the well-known proverb, a house is not a home. Particular forms of conduct and discourse are necessary to translate the house into the home, making it ‘homey’ and marking it as a place for homely living (Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton, 1981; Dittmar, 1992). Because the members of the home speak in a relaxed, ‘homely’ way, when at home, the home is renewed as the homely place: being ‘at home’, thus, is a way of home-making. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">It is the same for talk within the homeland. One might describe the deictic use of the definite article as ‘homeland-making’, for it is the equivalant of a homely, home-making way of speaking. Consider the utterance ‘it’s in the kitchen’, spoken within a house by one member of the household to another. The speaker might know that, within the neighbourhood, there are hundreds of other kitchens. There is only one kitchen – the kitchen – in this context. The universe has shrunken the boundaries of the home; here, other kitchens have to be marked, specifically indicated as ‘other’: ‘my brother’s kitchen’ or ‘the kitchen on the cover of the magazine’ are not ‘the kitchen’, (or ‘the living-room’ or ‘the stairs’) not only assumes the boundary of the home as the context of the utterance, but it also helps to renew this homely context. The phrase ‘the prime minister’ operates similarly. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">There is a parallel between the language of home and homeland. The French philosopher Gaston Bachelard, in his Politics of Space, suggested that our childhood home is ‘our first universe, a real cosmos in every sense of the word.” Thereafter, all inhabited space “bears the essence of the notion of home” (1969, pp. 4-5). The national space most notably bears this trace, being imagined as homely space, cosy within its borders, secure against the dangerous outside world. And ‘we’ the nation within the homeland can so easily imagine ‘ourselves’ as some sort of family. If the national home is to be homely, then ‘we’ must make it so. ‘We’ cannot do this by constant, conscious endeavor. To be at home, ‘we’ must routinely and unconsciously use the homeland-making language. ‘We’ must daily inhabit the environment of this language. Small, unnoticed words of deixis are important in this respect. They help to shut the national door on the outside world. ‘The’ shuts the door more tightly than ‘this.’ Just as ‘we’ implies ‘them’, so ‘this country’ implies a contrastive ‘those countries’. When Major was claiming that ‘this’ was still the best country in the world, we was comparing ‘this’ with those foreign countries in which he could not bear to pass a weekend. Blair’s ‘this country’ was being mentioned in relation to the rest of Europe from which it might be isolated or left behind. Bush and Clinton, in ‘this, the world’s greatest counry’, were implicitly evoking a comparison with all those lesser countries. But the nation – with the president or the economy or, even, the weather – makes no such comparison. What is ‘ours’ is presented as if it were the objective world; the is so concrete, so objective, so uncontroversial. In all these respects the phrasing differs from the patriotic waving of the flag. The homeland is made both present and unnoticeable by being presented as the context. When the homeland-making phrases are used with regularity, ‘we’ are unmindfully reminded who ‘we’ are and where ‘we’ are. ‘We’ are identified without even being mentioned. In this way, national identity is a routine way of talking and listening; it is a form of life, which habitually closes the front door, and seals the borders. </span><br />
<br />
<strong>b. Nationalism closes our mental and emotional borders to the foreign Other – results in a siege mentality of destruction and war</strong><br />
<strong>Billig 1995 –</strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">prof of social sciences at U of Loughborough. (Michael, “Banal Nationalism.” Sage publications. p. 80-82) CMR *Italics in original* </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Nationalists live in an international world, and their ideology is itself an international ideology. Without constant observation of the world of other nation, nationalists would be unable to claim that their nations meet the universal codes of nationhood. Nor would they have ready access to stereotyped judgments about foreigners. Even the most extreme and unbanal of nationalists do not shut out the outside world from consciousness, but often show an obsessive concern with the lives and outlooks of foreigners. Hitler’s Table-Talk is filled with speculations about the characters of different nations. One illustrative example, taken from 1942, can be given. Martin Bormann had apparently lent his Fuhrer a book entitled Juan in America, itself an indicative action. Hitler opines lengthily, while his admirers listen: </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The British swallow everything they are told … [Americans] have the brains of a hen … the German Reich has two hundred and seventy opera houses – a standard of cultural existence of which they have no conception … Spaniards and Americans simply cannot understand each other … the Americans live like sows. (1988, pp. 604-5)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">And so on. Hitler speaks a continuing stream of stereotypes, as he surveys the rest of the world from his camp at Rastenburg. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Social psychologists frequently assume that narrow, bigoted thinking is characterized by the use of stereotypes. If the imagining of foreignness is an integral part of the theoretical consciousness of nationalism, then foreignness is not an undifferentiated sense of ‘Otherness’ (McDonald, 1993). Obsessively fine distinctions can be made between different grounds of foreigners. Indeed, debates and controversies can arise about how similar or how different various groups of foreigners are to ‘us.’ In one of the earliest studies of stereotyping, Katz and Braly (1935) showed the extend to which white, American college students used conventional labels to characterize different ethnic and national groups: Jews were mercenary, Turks were cruel, Germans efficient, etc. Later studies have indicated a decline in respondents’ willingness to use such generalizing stereotypes (Gilbert, 1951; Karlins et al., 1969). The stereotypes of other nations tend not to be uniformly scornful. Some foreigners are presumed to be more meritorious than others. Thus, Katz and Brly found that some foreign national types, such as the Germans, were praised in ways which others, especially non-European nations, were not. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Stereotypes are shared, cultural descriptions of social groups. Even respondents, who might themselves claim to be skeptical about the truths of the stereotypes, recognize a culturally shared scale of valuations (Devine, 1989). Some foreigners are identified as being stereotyped as more admirable, and more like ‘us’ than others. (Hagendoorn, 1993a; Hagendoorn and Hraba, 1987; Hagendoorn and Kleinpenning, 1991). Inglehart (1991), examining the national attitudes of members of European nations, found that, with the exception of Italians, members of all nations rated their own nation as the must trustworthy. However, not all foreigners were rated equally untrustworthy. Members of small, non-Mediterranean European nations, such as Danes, Swiss and Dutch, tended to be rated more trustworthy, even by Mediterranean respondents. In short, it is commonplace that stereotyped distinctions are made between different sorts of foreigners.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Public opinion polls suggest that there is nothing static in the stereotyped judgements. Foreign stocks can rise and fall, in accord with the movements of political crises. The favourable stereotypes of Germans, which Katz and Braly (1935) found, declined as the United States prepared to enter the Second World War (Harding et al., 954). Most dramatic was the change in American judgments of the Russians, who, in 1945, switched from being heroic allies to bitterest rivals (Yatani and Bramel, 1989). With the collapse of Soviet communism, the American public has been presented with new enemies – whether Libyans, Iraqis or Arabs in general. With prolonged conflicts, a ‘siege mentality’ can develop, in which stereotypes become rigid, and the enemy is demonized with regular ferocity (Bar-Tal, 1989, 1990; Silverstein and Flamenbaum, 1989(. Sudden crises can produce quickly sharpened stereotypes, as, for eample, the emergency of ‘the ARgie’ in the British media during the Falklands War (Harris, 1985). The quickly summoned stereotype will build upon older cultural myths, although there might be some initial uncertainty how these should be combined. One member of the British war cabinet was reported as wondering whether the Argentinians would actually go to war, given their half-Italian and half-Spanish ancestry. “There’s no precedent”, he said, because “if the Spanish half is uppermost, they’ll fight, if the Italian, they won’t” (quoted in Young, 1993, p. 278). </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Stereotypes are often means of distinguishing ‘them’ from ‘us’, thereby contributing to ‘our’ claims of a unique identity. In the eighteenth century, Britain developed many of its modern symbols of nationhood in conscious contradictions to French styles of nation-making (Cannadine, 1983; Colley, 1992). English writers debated whether there should be an English Academy, but the idea was rejected as being too French (Haugen, 1966a). The first recorded cartoon, depicting John Bull as an ‘Englishman’, also shows a Frenchman, as thin and meager as Bull is fat and generous (Surel, 1989). In this case, the iconographic stereotype of ‘us’ was created in contrastive differentiation from the stereotype of ‘them’. The point is not merely a historical one, but there is an implicit contrast in the stereotyped judgment of ‘them’ (McCauly et al., 1980; Stangor and Ford, 1992). Typically, people ascribe more stereotypic traits to outgroups than to ingroups; ‘we’ often assume ‘ourselves’ as the standard, or the unmarked normality, against which ‘their’ deviations appear notable (Quattrone, 1986). If ‘they, the French’ are stereotyped as ‘emotional’, it is with implicit reference to ‘our’ presumed, non-emotional standards. Or conversely another group might be stereotyped as ‘cold’, whereas ‘we’ will be neither ‘cold’ (too cold) nor ‘emotional’ (too emotional). </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">There is always the possibility of projection, as Kristeva realized in her descriptions of ‘foreignness’. ‘We’ can claim that ‘they’ possess the qualities, which ‘we’ deny in ‘ourselves’. In Western democracies, ‘our’ tolerance is much praised by ‘ourselves’. Journalists and politicians, especially when arguing for immigration restrictions, cite ‘our’ tolerance, and ‘their’ intolerance, as a reason for excluding ‘them’, the foreigners (Barker, 1981; Van Dijk, 1991, 1992, 1993). The rhetoric denies ‘our’ prejudice and in condenses an argumentative structure, which attributes intolerance to ‘them’; ‘our’ tolerance is threatened by ‘their’ presence; ‘they’ are either intolerant or cause intolerance; thus, ‘we’ seek to exclude ‘them’, not because ‘we’ are intolerant but, quite the reverse, because ‘we’ are tolerant (Billig, 1991; Wetherell and Potter, 1992). In conditions of the ‘siege mentality’, it is always the ‘other’ who breaks faith, acts dishonestly and starts aggressive spirals: ‘our’ actions are justified by circumstance, but ‘theirs’ are said to reflect a deficiency of character, indeed the very deficiencies which ‘we’ deny in ‘ourselves (Pettigrew, 1979; Rothbard and Hallmark, 1988). </span><br />

<strong>We must not cede our agency to the all-powerful, righteous state. This traps us in the cycle of in-activism, never allowing us to kritik or confront the state that dominates us, and the other.</strong><br />
<strong>Shaffer 2007</strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">(Butler teaches at the Southwestern University School of Law. B.S., Law, 1958, University of Nebraska, Lincoln; B.A., Political Science, 1959, and J.D., 1961, University of Chicago; Member, Colorado and Nebraska State Bars. “Identifying With the State” June 29th 2007. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/shaffer/shaffer159.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lewrockwell.com/shaffer/shaffer159.html</a></span>)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">One of the deadliest practices we engage in is that of identifying ourselves with a collective entity. Whether it be the state, a nationality, our race or gender, or any other abstraction, we introduce division – hence, conflict – into our lives as we separate ourselves from those who identify with other groupings. If one observes the state of our world today, this is the pattern that underlies our deadly and destructive social behavior. This mindset was no better articulated than when George W. Bush declared “you’re either with us, or against us.” Through years of careful conditioning, we learn to think of ourselves in terms of agencies and/or abstractions external to our independent being. Or, to express the point more clearly, we have learned to internalize these external forces; to conform our thinking and behavior to the purposes and interests of such entities. We adorn ourselves with flags, mouth shibboleths, and decorate our cars with bumper-stickers, in order to communicate to others our sense of “who we are.” In such ways does our being become indistinguishable from our chosen collective. In this way are institutions born. We discover a particular form of organization through which we are able to cooperate with others for our mutual benefit. Over time, the advantages derived from this system have a sufficient consistency to lead us to the conclusion that our well-being is dependent upon it. Those who manage the organization find it in their self-interests to propagate this belief so that we will become dependent upon its permanency. Like a sculptor working with clay, institutions take over the direction of our minds, twisting, squeezing, and pounding upon them until we have embraced a mindset conducive to their interests. Once this has been accomplished, we find it easy to subvert our will and sense of purpose to the collective. The organization ceases being a mere tool of mutual convenience, and becomes an end in itself. Our lives become “institutionalized,” and we regard it as fanciful to imagine ourselves living in any other way than as constituent parts of a machine that transcends our individual sense. Once we identify ourselves with the state, that collective entity does more than represent who we are; it is who we are. To the politicized mind, the idea that “we are the government” has real meaning, not in the sense of being able to control such an agency, but in the psychological sense. The successes and failures of the state become the subject’s successes and failures; insults or other attacks upon their abstract sense of being – such as the burning of “their” flag – become assaults upon their very personhood. Shortcomings on the part of the state become our failures of character. This is why so many Americans who have belatedly come to criticize the war against Iraq are inclined to treat it as only a “mistake” or the product of “mismanagement,” not as a moral wrong. Our egos can more easily admit to the making of a mistake than to moral transgressions. Such an attitude also helps to explain why, as Milton Mayer wrote in his revealing post-World War II book, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amazon.com/They-Thought-Were-Free-Germans/dp/0226511928/lewrockwell/" rel="nofollow">They Thought They Were Free</a></span>, most Germans were unable to admit that the Nazi regime had been tyrannical.It is this dynamic that makes it easy for political officials to generate wars, a process that reinforces the sense of identity and attachment people have for “their” state. It also helps to explain why most Americans – though tiring of the war against Iraq – refuse to condemn government leaders for the lies, forgeries, and deceit employed to get the war started: to acknowledge the dishonesty of the system through which they identify themselves is to admit to the dishonest base of their being. The truthfulness of the state’s rationale for war is irrelevant to most of its subjects. It is sufficient that they believe the abstraction with which their lives are intertwined will be benefited in some way by war. Against whom and upon what claim does not matter – except as a factor in assessing the likelihood of success. That most Americans have pipped nary a squeak of protest over Bush administration plans to attack Iran – with nuclear weapons if deemed useful to its ends – reflects the point I am making. Bush could undertake a full-fledged war against Lapland, and most Americans would trot out their flags and bumper-stickers of approval. The “rightness” or “wrongness” of any form of collective behavior becomes interpreted by the standard of whose actions are being considered. During World War II, for example, Japanese kamikaze pilots were regarded as crazed fanatics for crashing their planes into American battleships. At the same time, American war movies (see, e.g., <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amazon.com/Flying-Tigers-John-Wayne/dp/0782011276/lewrockwell/" rel="nofollow">Flying Tigers</a></span>) extolled the heroism of American pilots who did the same thing. One sees this same double-standard in responding to “conspiracy theories.” “Do you think a conspiracy was behind the 9/11 attacks?” It certainly seems so to me, unless one is prepared to treat the disappearance of the World Trade Center buildings as the consequence of a couple pilots having bad navigational experiences! The question that should be asked is: whose conspiracy was it? To those whose identities coincide with the state, such a question is easily answered: others conspire, we do not. It is not the symbiotic relationship between war and the expansion of state power, nor the realization of corporate benefits that could not be obtained in a free market, that mobilize the machinery of war. Without most of us standing behind “our” system, and cheering on “our” troops, and defending “our” leaders, none of this would be possible. What would be your likely response if your neighbor prevailed upon you to join him in a violent attack upon a local convenience store, on the grounds that it hired “illegal aliens?” Your sense of identity would not be implicated in his efforts, and you would likely dismiss him as a lunatic. Only when our ego-identities become wrapped up with some institutional abstraction – such as the state – can we be persuaded to invest our lives and the lives of our children in the collectivemadness of state action. We do not have such attitudes toward organizations with which we have more transitory relationships. If we find an accounting error in our bank statement, we would not find satisfaction in the proposition “the First National Bank, right or wrong.” Neither would we be inclined to wear a T-shirt that read “Disneyland: love it or leave it.” One of the many adverse consequences of identifying with and attaching ourselves to collective abstractions is our loss of control over not only the meaning and direction in our lives, but of the manner in which we can be efficacious in our efforts to pursue the purposes that have become central to us. We become dependent upon the performance of “our” group; “our” reputation rises or falls on the basis of what institutional leaders do or fail to do. If “our” nation-state loses respect in the world – such as by the use of torture or killing innocent people - we consider ourselves no longer respectable, and scurry to find plausible excuses to redeem our egos. When these expectations are not met, we go in search of new leaders or organizational reforms we believe will restore our sense of purpose and pride that we have allowed abstract entities to personify for us. As the costs and failures of the state become increasingly evident, there is a growing tendency to blame this system. But to do so is to continue playing the same game into which we have allowed ourselves to become conditioned. One of the practices employed by the state to get us to mobilize our “dark side” energies in opposition to the endless recycling of enemies it has chosen for us, is that of psychological projection. Whether we care to acknowledge it or not – and most of us do not – each of us has an unconscious capacity for attitudes or conduct that our conscious minds reject. We fear that, sufficiently provoked, we might engage in violence– even deadly – against others; or that inducements might cause us to become dishonest. We might harbor racist or other bigoted sentiments, or consider ourselves lazy or irresponsible. Though we are unlikely to act upon such inner fears, their presence within us can generate discomforting self-directed feelings of guilt, anger, or unworthiness that we would like to eliminate. The most common way in which humanity has tried to bring about such an exorcism is by subconsciously projecting these traits onto others (i.e., “scapegoats”)and punishing them for what are really our own shortcomings. The state has trainedus to behave this way, in order that we may be counted upon to invest our lives, resources, and other energiesinpursuitof the enemydu jour. It is somewhat ironic, therefore, that most of us resort to the same practice in our criticism of political systems. After years of mouthing the high-school civics class mantra about the necessity for government – and the bigger the government the better – we begin to experience the unexpected consequences of politicization. Tax burdens continue to escalate; or the state takes our home to make way for a proposed shopping center; or ever-more details of our lives are micromanaged by ever-burgeoning state bureaucracies. Having grown weary of the costs – including the loss of control over our lives – we blame the state for what has befallen us. We condemn the Bush administration for the parade of lies that precipitated the war against Iraq, rather than indicting ourselves for ever believing anything the state tells us. We fault the politicians for the skyrocketing costs of governmental programs, conveniently ignoring our insistence upon this or that benefit whose costs we would prefer having others pay. The statists have helped us accept a world view that conflates our incompetence to manage our own lives with their omniscience to manage the lives of billions of people – along with the planet upon which we live! – and we are now experiencing the costs generated by our own gullibility. We have acted like country bumpkins at the state fair with the egg money who, having been fleeced by a bunch of carnival sharpies, look everywhere for someone to blame other than ourselves. We have been euchred out of our very lives because of our eagerness to believe that benefits can be enjoyed without incurring costs; that the freedom to control one’s life can be separated from the responsibilities for one’s actions; and that two plus two does not have to add up to four if a sizeable public opinion can be amassed against the proposition. By identifying ourselves with any abstraction (such as the state) we give up the integrated life, the sense of wholeness that can be found only within each of us. While the state has manipulated, cajoled, and threatened us to identify ourselves with it, the responsibility for our acceding to its pressures lies within each of us. The statists have – as was their vicious purpose – simply taken over the territory we have abandoned. Our politico-centric pain and suffering has been brought about by our having allowed external forces to move in and occupy the vacuum we created at the center of our being. The only way out of our dilemma involves a retracing of the route that brought us to where we are.We require nothing so much right now as the development of a sense of “who we are” that transcends our institutionalized identities, and returns us– without division and conflict –to a centered, self-directed integrity in our lives.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>The power of the state commands all and claims legitimacy for all within its domain. The power of the sovereign robs us of our agency and makes true change impossible, because all political discussion is then understood post a preexisting state centered structure we automatically must follow. Voting Negative is key, we must present a challenge to this imposed discursive pre-condition and an intensive rethinking of how we engage in such political dialogue is needed.</strong><br />
<strong>W</strong><strong>adiwel</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">in</span><strong>02</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Dinesh Joesph, “Cows and Sovereignty: Biopower and Animal Life” Borderlands E-Journal Vol.1 #2)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">But such a political program has far reaching consequences, both for Western sovereignty, and the way that the business of politics is conducted. The living population of the earth has inherited a vision of sovereign power, which has spread cancerously into even the most seemingly inaccessible aspects of everyday life. This vision commands all, claims legitimacy for all, and determines the conduct of living for all within its domain. Politics ‘as we know it’ is caught inextricably in the web of sovereign power, in such a way that it seems that modern political debate cannot help but circulate around the same, routine issues: &quot;What is the appropriate legislative response?&quot;; &quot;Is it within the State’s powers to intervene in this particular conflict?&quot;; &quot;How can we ensure the citizen’s rights are maintained in the face of the state?&quot;. To challenge such an encompassing and peremptory political discourse — where every question implies the sovereign absolutely, and every decision made refers to life itself — would require the most intensive rethinking of the way in which territory, governance and economy are imagined. In this sense, whilst Agamben’s analysis of bare life, and Foucault’s theory of bio-power, provide a means by which to assess the condition of non-human life with respect to sovereign power, the political project must reach beyond these terms, and embrace an intertwining of the human and the non-human: an intersection which may be found in the animal life shared by both entities.</span><br />

 <strong>Text: The Department of Defense should double its investment in C-17 Globemaster III aircraft for the United States Air Force.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>C-17 program expansion solves and improves US airlift best—it’s linear</strong><br />
<strong>Air Force Air Mobility Command, 11</strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">[12/29/2011, “C-17 GLOBEMASTER III,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=86" rel="nofollow">http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=86</a>] JD</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The C-17 Globemaster III is the newest, most flexible cargo aircraft to enter the airlift force. The C-17 is capable of rapid strategic delivery of troops and all types of cargo to main operating bases or directly to forward bases in the deployment area. The aircraft can perform tactical airlift and airdrop missions and can transport litters and ambulatory patients during aeromedical evacuations when required. The inherent flexibility and performance of the C-17 force improve the ability of the total airlift system to fulfill the worldwide air mobility requirements of the United States. The ultimate measure of airlift effectiveness is the ability to rapidly project and sustain an effective combat force close to a potential battle area. Threats to U.S. interests have changed in recent years, and the size and weight of U.S.-mechanized firepower and equipment have grown in response to improved capabilities of potential adversaries. This trend has significantly increased air mobility requirements, particularly in the area of large or heavy outsize cargo. As a result, newer and more flexible airlift aircraft are needed to meet potential armed contingencies, peacekeeping or humanitarian missions worldwide. The C-17 is capable of meeting today's demanding airlift missions. Features Reliability and maintainability are two outstanding benefits of the C-17 system. Current operational requirements impose demanding reliability and maintainability. These requirements include an aircraft mission completion success probability rate of 92 percent, only 20 aircraft maintenance man-hours per flying hour, and full and partial mission availability rates of 74.7 and 82.5 percent, respectively. The Boeing warranty assures these figures will be met. The C-17 measures 174 feet long (53 meters) with a wingspan of 169 feet, 10 inches (51.75 meters). The aircraft is powered by four, fully reversible, Federal Aviation Administration-certified F117-PW-100 engines (the military designation for the commercial Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2040), currently used on the Boeing 757. Each engine is rated at 40,440 pounds of thrust. The thrust reversers direct the flow of air upward and forward to avoid ingestion of dust and debris. Maximum use has been made of commercial off-the-shelf equipment, including Air Force-standardized avionics. The aircraft is operated by a crew of three (pilot, co-pilot and loadmaster), reducing manpower requirements, risk exposure and long-term operating costs. Cargo is loaded onto the C-17 through a large aft door that accommodates military vehicles and palletized cargo. The C-17 can carry virtually all of the Army's air-transportable equipment. Maximum payload capacity of the C-17 is 170,900 pounds (77,519 kilograms), and its maximum gross takeoff weight is 585,000 pounds (265,352 kilograms). With a payload of 169,000 pounds (76,657 kilograms) and an initial cruise altitude of 28,000 feet (8,534 meters), the C-17 has an unrefueled range of approximately 2,400 nautical miles. Its cruise speed is approximately 450 knots (.74 Mach). The C-17 is designed to airdrop 102 paratroopers and equipment. The design of the aircraft allows it to operate through small, austere airfields. The C-17 can take off and land on runways as short as 3,500 feet (1,064 meters) and only 90 feet wide (27.4 meters). Even on such narrow runways, the C-17 can turn around using a three-point star turn and its backing capability. Background The C-17 made its maiden flight on Sept. 15, 1991, and the first production model was delivered to Charleston Air Force Base, now known as Joint Base Charleston, S.C., on June 14, 1993. The first squadron of C-17s, the 17th Airlift Squadron, was declared operationally ready Jan. 17, 1995. The Air Force originally programmed to buy 120 C-17s.Current budget plans increased the total number to 223 aircraft. The C-17 is operated by Air Mobility Command at Travis AFB, Calif.; Dover AFB, Del.; Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash.; Joint Base Charleston, S.C., and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J. The Air National Guard flies C-17s from the 172d Airlift Wing, Jackson, Miss., and the 105th Airlift Wing, Stewart ANGB, N.Y. Additionally, Air Force Materiel Command operates two C-17s at Edwards AFB, Calif., and Pacific Air Forces operates aircraft at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii. The Air Force Reserve Command operates aircraft at March Air Reserve Base, Calif., and Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio. Air Education and Training Command has 17 aircraft at Altus AFB, Okla.

<strong>Airlift is key to the Unified Command Plan—that’s the policy that underlies greater U.S. military strategy and war prevention</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The U.S. military has taken a number of other steps to improve its ability to send large forces across great distances. Munitions, support equipment, and combat equipment are prepositioned around the world, ashore and afloat. For example, the equivalent of 3 1/3 divisions’ (10 brigades’) worth of army and marine equipment was prepositioned at key spots in Asia, Europe, and the Persian Gulf during the 1990s. Perhaps 5 brigades of this equipment were employed in March 2003. In a crisis, troops fly to designated airfield-port combinations to marry up with this equipment. Since 1991 the United States has built a fleet of 20 large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off military transport ships, to facilitate the movement of military matériel. Each ship can carry nearly 1,000 military vehicles and can off load this equipment at austere ports, if necessary. 46 These ships were extensively employed in the mobilization for the war to topple the Iraqi Ba’ath regime. Similarly, the United States has modernized its fleet of long-range airlift aircraft; 90 C17s of 180 on order have been delivered. 47 These aircraft are capable of carrying tank-sized cargo into relatively mediocre airfields. They in turn are supported by a fleet of aerial tankers. Finally, it is easy to forget that since World War II the U.S. Marine Corps has specialized in putting large ground and air forces ashore against opposition. The Marine Corps alone has as many personnel as the combined land and air forces of the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Navy operates almost 40 special purpose combat ships for amphibious operations, roughly the same number of major surface combatants as the entire Royal Navy. 48 Finally, all this capability is tied together by a seldom-mentioned Cold War legacy: the Unified Command Plan through which the U.S. military organizes the entire world for war. The U.S. military divides the world into both functional and regional commands. In most cases, the regional command elements are based in the theaters in which they would fight. PACOM is based in Hawaii and oversees U.S. forces in the Pacific. EUCOM, based in Europe, manages U.S. forces committed to NATO. CENTCOM oversees the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, but does so formally from Florida. Also in Florida, SOUTHCOM oversees Central and South America. These commands are each led by a four-star commander in chief (formerly referred to as a “CinC,” pronounced “sink,” they are now called “combatant commanders”). These are large multifunction military headquarters, to which are often attached significant operational forces. They engage in military diplomacy among the countries in their command and arrange joint exercises. They integrate the products of U.S. command of space, with the permissive conditions of command of the air and sea, to develop responsive war plans that can generate significant combat power in the far corners of the world on relatively short notice. That the geographical commands were barely touched by the passing of the Cold War is mute testimony to the quiet consensus among the foreign and security policy elite that emerged soon after the passing of the Soviet Union: The United States would hold on to its accidental hegemony. 49</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">A realistic assessment of the costs, risks, feasibility, and public acceptance suggests that CCS is not likely to enable us to use coal-fired power plants while mitigating climate change. Why, then, do U.S. legislators, industries, and advocacy organizations continue to package CCS as a solution? The reason is that coal is a high stakes political issues. Coal and utility companies have the resources to craft and disseminate their &quot;clean coal&quot; story. Many politicians are aligned with the story because it makes it easy to postpone difficult economic decisions.

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Responses from West Coast Ports West Coast ports tend to perceive the expansion of the Panama Canal as a threat to their hinterland market share, particularly for the Midwest. It is uncertain to what extent the cargo handled by the West Coast is divertible to other maritime ranges, with some putting this figure in the vicinity of 25% of the intermodal cargo 21 . Still, Pacific Asia remains the fundamental market of the West Coast. A response from major West Coast ports, particularly in light of the financial crisis, has been to extend existing terminal facilities, placing them in a situation of excess capacity. The pressure for West Coast ports is leaning more towards having effective long distance rail connections particularly since between 50% and 70% of the cargo they handle is considered as discretionary. In the Fall of 2009, six major American West Coast ports (Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Oakland, Long Beach and Los Angeles) along with the two western rail carriers, BNSF and UP, established a joint arrangement dubbed the “U.S. West Coast Collaboration”. The main objective is to try to rectify three issues that are perceived to be a disadvantage for West Coast ports: 1. Marketing. Identify and communicate the advantages of shipping through the U.S. West Coast with port users (ocean carriers and freight forwarders). 2. Image. Improve the some of the negative image that West Coast ports may have through accurate information. This particularly stems from the 2005 west coast port strike as well as various environmental schemes adopted by port authorities (e.g. Los Angeles / Long Beach). 3. Lobbying. Common advocacy at the Federal level for investment in West Coast gateway intermodal infrastructure and promoting a strong National Goods Movement Strategy. In doing so, the emphasis of the collaboration is on the value proposition of shipping Asian cargo through West Coast ports, particularly over the all-water route: Maritime Service. Shortest transit times, most frequency and flexibility, deep water berths, low average dwell time. Rail Network. Several rail routes, daily train departures, on-dock/near dock rail, and a coverage of the entire United States. Cost Efficiency. Price competitive, fuel efficient, reduced carrying cost, supply chain predictability and flexibility. Reliability. Little to no variability in service, no congestion, consistent rail service and labor stability. Responsibility. Environmental stewardship, partners in a green supply chain, supporting and increasing community benefits. Several of these value proposition statements need to be comparatively assessed, particularly in light of the increased fees at Los Angeles / Long Beach and the labor issues most West Coast ports continue to face 22 . In all cases, a greater emphasis will be placed on hinterland access regimes as a strategy to improve the cost, quality and reliability of the West Coast as well as to secure traffic outside their fundamental hinterlands. Canada’s gateways and corridors initiative can be perceived as a strategy to improve the competitiveness of the Canadian West Coast (Vancouver and Prince Rupert) without impairing in a noticeable manner the market share of the East Coast. Canadian East Coast ports, Montreal and Halifax, are dominantly linked to the transatlantic market, with the all-water route through the Panama Canal offering limited growth opportunities. As cost, time and reliability factors vary significantly according to the concerned supply chains, many market niches remain based upon how individual ports will respond. Therefore, the North American lattice of transport chain is likely to become even more complex after the expansion of the Panama Canal. Responses from Railways A wide variety of responses is also to be expected from North American railways, depending on their respective market orientation. The dichotomy between the western and eastern rail systems is much less prevalent than for ports, with the Canadian operators in an ambivalent position (less so for Canadian Pacific that is more oriented towards western Canada). At start, the rail system of the West Coast is more oriented towards international trade and has been improved in such a fashion. All West Coast ports have on-dock and near-dock rail facilities that are designed to improve the inland movement of intermodal cargo, which are well suited to handle the expected growth in transloading. The pacific trade is an important source of revenue for western railways (Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Union Pacific, Canadian National, Canadian Pacific) that were able to use the advantages of large double stacked unit trains to push rail economies of scale to levels unseen before and make intermodal a profit center. They thus have important stakes in the continuation and ongoing growth of this transport sequence and the business model it implies. The current trend, particularly the spectacular growth of the all-water route, underlines that this model is being challenged.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">This study argues that the federal program needs to be rethought. The federal transportation program is notoriously politicized, failing to make the best use of existing funds and failing to focus on the most important national transportation goals. Every serious study in recent years has concluded that America is under-investing in highway infrastructure; indeed, we are not even investing enough to maintain its current mediocre performance and condition, let alone enough to produce major improvements. But rather than simply putting larger sums of money into a seriously flawed process, the better course is to rethink and refocus the federal role, in order to spend more on core federal purposes and less on peripheral concerns. Some reauthorizations have brought big changes to the federal transportation program. This one should as well, not by moving further away from a user-fee funded system designed to improve mobility, but by moving back toward it. While the federal government may have an interest in a wide range of transportation issues and concerns, direct federal involvement is both unwise and inappropriate in many of these areas. The facilitation of inter-state travel and commerce and international trade are clearly federal responsibilities, so a larger emphasis on inter-state and international transportation should be at the core of a rethought federal role. The Interstate highway system was laid out more than 60 years ago, and begun 50 years ago. Increasing portions of it are reaching the end of their design life and need complete reconstruction. Most urban Interstates need major additions to eliminate bottlenecks and reduce congestion, and as the lifeblood of goods movement, many inter-city Interstates need more lanes to handle projected growth in truck traffic.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Q: What is the biggest problem your Interstate 2.0 proposal is intended to solve? A: Our Interstate 2.0 proposal is intended to meet the well-documented need to increase investment significantly in our country’s most important highways, without an increase in the federal gas tax. Highways are the lifeblood of goods movement, with trucks handling 62% of all freight ton-miles and 92% of all freight by value. Rail will continue to grow, especially intermodal, but nearly all projections show that rail’s share of all goods movement is unlikely to increase over the next several decades. Hence, it’s vital to expand and modernize the key highway corridors that deliver the goods—especially the Interstates. Yet neither the current House bill not the U.S. Department of Transportation’s draft Strategic Plan would significantly increase highway capacity. Likewise, urban freeway congestion costs Americans more than $100 billion a year in wasted time and fuel and reduced productivity. Adding networks of priced express lanes to urban Interstates, and rebuilding interchange bottlenecks, would bring significant congestion relief to our urban areas. Q. Why doesn’t your proposal go all the way, completely devolving the federal highway and transit program to the states and metro areas? A: Facilitating interstate commerce is one of the basic provisions of the Constitution, for good reason. Under the Articles of Confederation, states were erecting tariff barriers to interstate trade, which is why the commerce clause was put into the Constitution, creating one of the world’s largest free-trade areas. A seamless nationwide system of super-highways made sense in 1956 and makes even more sense in 2010. Interstate 2.0 could foster this idea by, for example, removing the current patchwork of truck size and weight standards that undercut trucking productivity and needlessly increase fuel use in freight hauling. And by linking all significant ports and international airports to the system, the revamped Interstate system would reduce congestion and facilitate continued growth of international trade.</span><br />

Report: RESTORING TRUST IN THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND Reason Foundation August 2010 Policy Study 386 PG 22-23</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Our proposed refocusing of the federal transportation program would mean a change in federal spending that would increase spending on Interstate 2.0 by close to $10 billion per year. That increase would take a big load off the needs most states currently list. But, those increases in Interstate spending would mean a corresponding decrease in federal funding for other current state highway spending. Hence, states would be faced with the challenge of rethinking the remainder of their transportation programs, deciding if all current programs were worth retaining at their own taxpayers’ and tollpayers’ expense. At the same time, ending the current dominance of state transportation planning by the need to maximize the federal dollars they “win” from Congress would allow states to plan based on actual needs and performance rather than meeting the goals or whims of Congress and the FHWA. Since some of these programs exist because they have been mandated as a condition of receiving federal funds, it is not clear that states would wish to retain them all. As the GAO assessment points out, these numerous federal requirements include mandates for safety belt usage, minimum drinking age and maximum blood-alcohol levels, Davis-Bacon labor requirements, Buy America requirements, various affirmative action mandates and transportation planning requirements. A recent GAO report found that many state DOTs avoid using federal funds when they can, so as to avoid project delays or the extra costs associated with meeting federal requirements.51 In a GAO survey, 39 out of 51 state DOTs reported that within the last 10 years federal requirements had influenced their decision not to use federal funds for projects eligible for federal aid. In some respects, our proposed change resembles earlier proposals for devolution of federal transportation funding and programs to the state level, as debated in the 1990s. Recently, the Government Accountability Office did a new assessment of hypothetical devolution of essentially the entire federal program (except for safety, research and highways on federal lands) to the states.52 As part of that assessment, the GAO estimated how much each state would have to increase its per-gallon fuel tax in order to replace all its federal funding for highways (in a situation where the federal gas tax would have been close to zero). The GAO found that 30 states could do this with an increase smaller than the current federal tax rate (i.e., in those 30 states, there would be a net decrease of 1 to 6 cents per gallon in total gas taxes). Ten states would have to increase their gas taxes to a level higher than the current total gas tax rate, but by less than 5 cents.gal. Another five would need a net increase of less than 15 cents/gal. Only Alaska and DC would need larger increases, but those two will likely always require special treatment. But our proposed reform is different from what the GAO modeled. The GAO’s was a zero-sum scenario, leaving total highway and transit spending unchanged, whereas ours calls for shifting the bulk of federal highway investment to Interstate 2.0, with a net increase in Interstate investment of $9.5 billion per year.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The National Science Foundation (NSF) has announced that it has reached an agreement with a Russian company to charter a diesel icebreaker, ending weeks of speculation about whether the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) would be without an icebreaker for the 2011-12 summer field season. NSF signed a one-year contract, with an option for additional years, with the Murmansk Shipping Co. to use the Canadian-built icebreaker, Vladimir Ignatyuk, according to an NSF press release issued on Aug. 25. Built in 1983, Ignatyuk currently provides icebreaking service to other national Antarctic programs including India. Photo Credit: Murmansk Shipping Co. Icebreaker Vladimir Ignatyuk The USAP requires the services of an icebreaker each year to cut a channel through the annual sea ice that fronts its largest research base at McMurdo Station on Ross Island. The channel allows fuel and cargo vessels, escorted by the icebreaker, to reach the station’s ice pier. The 5-million-gallon fuel resupply is particularly critical to support the science missions based out of McMurdo and South Pole stations, which include everything from glaciology and geology to biology and astrophysics. For decades, U.S. Coast Guard icebreakers supported the USAP. However, in recent years, the Coast Guard’s two heavy icebreakers, the Polar Sea and Polar Star , have been largely inoperable. The Coast Guard plans to decommission the Polar Sea in September, while the Polar Star is undergoing an extensive refit with hopes of going back to sea by 2014. For the past several years, the NSF had contracted with the Swedish government for the icebreaker Oden , which also doubles as a research vessel. But the Swedish government decided that the Oden was needed at home after two harsh winters disrupted shipping lanes in the region, according to an Aug. 18 news article in the journal Science. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">While most of these assertions are standard tropes of U.S. science policy, a number of these statements are particularly associated with the National Science Foundation (NSF), a major financial and institutional player in the NNI. The NSF is the federal agency with the explicit mission to support the U.S. basic (fundamental) research enterprise, primarily at academic institutions. The claims in the blurb above echo both the rhetorical and operational strategies that have become hallmarks of the NSF since its founding in 1950. The NSF's leadership role in the NNI2 can be understood through the prism of the discursive, political, and material strategies that the Foundation has developed during its evolution from a bit player in the federal science system to an agency with a $5.9 billion budget that funds approximately 20% of all federally supported basic research at U.S. universities. The policies and practices of the NSF were indelibly shaped by the political and historical contours of the Cold War, which enabled the development of a discursive and operational strategy that links support for basic scientific research to national well-being. As the Cold War ended, this strategy shifted its focus more squarely on global economic competition, which had become a pressing concern by the mid-1970s. Additionally, the NSF developed a strategy of building its constituency through expanding its grant base, supporting academic facilities and the construction of research centers, and leading and working within multi-agency [End Page 175] federal initiatives. These strategies helped ensure the perpetuation of the Foundation and the maintenance of Congressional appropriations throughout an era of changing political priorities.</span><br />

 <strong>The affirmative’s appeals to national security are really appeals to defend US wealth—threats are constructed by the ruling class to justify conservative action—this locks the proletariat in poverty and prevents emancipation, also is a reason they’re liars</strong><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">We are often and rightly told that security is intimately associated with the rise of the modem state. But we also need to note that it is equally intimately bound up with the rise of bourgeois property rights and a liberal order-building, and in later chapters we will see the extent of this intimacy. In this way liberalism's conception of security was intimately connected to its vision of political subjectivity centred 1 on the self-contained and property-owning individual. The reason liberty is wrapped in the concept of security, then, is because security is simultaneously wrapped in the question of property, giving us a triad of concepts which are usually run so close together that they are almost conflated ('liberty, security, property'), a triad found in Smith, j Blackstone, Paine, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man, and in various other formulations elsewhere.' Thus as liberalism generated a new conception of 'the economy' as its founding political act, a conception which integrated the wealth of nations, the world market and the labour of the population, its notion of liberty necessitated a particular vision of security: the ideological guarantee of the egoism of the independent and self-interested pursuit of property. It is for this reason Marx calls security 'the supreme concept of bourgeois society'.' Marx spotted that as the concept of bourgeois society, security plays a double role: The progress of social wealth,' says Storch 'begets this useful class of society . . . which performs the most wearisome, the vilest, the most disgusting functions, which, in a word takes on its shoulders all that is disagreeable and servile in life, and procures thus for other classes leisure, serenity of mind and conventional' (c'est bon, ca) 'dignity of character'. Storch then asks himself what the actual advantage is of this capitalist civilization, with its misery and its degradation of the masses, as compared with barbarism. He can find only one answer: security! One side of this double role, then, is that security is the ideological justification for 'civilisation' (that is, capitalism) as opposed to 'barbarism' (that is, non-capitalist modes of production); hence Locke's need to move from the 'state of nature' to the state of civil society. The other side is that security is what the bourgeois class demand once it has exploited, demoralised and degraded the bulk of humanity. For all the talk of 'laissez faire', the 'natural' phenomena of labour, wages and profit have to be policed and secured. Thus security entails the concept of police, guaranteeing as well as presupposing that society exists to secure the conservation of a particular kind of subjectivity (known as 'persons') and the rights and property associated with this subjectivity.&quot; The non-liberal and non-capitalist may be 'tolerated' - that other classically liberal concept which also functions as a regulatory power - but they will also be heavily policed ... for 'security reasons'? The new form of economic reason to which liberalism gave birth also gave new content to the idea of reason of state and thus a new rationale for state action: the 'free economy'. In other words, if security is the supreme concept of bourgeois society it is equally the supreme concept of liberal ideology. On this view, we should read liberalism less as a philosophy of liberty and more as a technique of security, as Mitchell Dean puts it, 89 a strategy of governance in which security is deployed as liberty. This technique will eventually underpin the exercises of liberal power carried out in the name of security in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and so will become central to the argument in this book, because as a technique it becomes central to a liberal vision of state power. The origins of this lie in liberalism’s fraught relationship to absolutism and police science (cameralism), but they also bring us forward to liberalism’s fraught relationship to fascism and, in a sense, to its fraught relationship to its own vision of the rule of law. The fraught nature of this relationship lies in the way that seventeenth century liberal accounts of prerogative would morph into twentieth century accounts of emergency. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 5pt;">We live, equally immersed, and to a deeper degree, in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging &quot;structural' violence, of a kind that destroys human life with a breathtaking ruthlessness. Former Massachusetts prison official and writer, Dr. James Gilligan observes; By &quot;structural violence&quot; I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted by those who are above them. Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) are a function of the class structure; and that structure is itself a product of society's collective human choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting &quot;structural&quot; with &quot;behavioral violence&quot; by which I mean the non-natural deaths and injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide, suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on. --(Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New York: Vintage, 1996), 192.) This form of violence, not covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected media, is invisible to us and because of its invisibility, all the more insidious. How dangerous is it--really? Gilligan notes: [E]very fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths; and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews over a six-year period. This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world.</span><br />

<strong>And traditional visions of transport economy through the plan’s elitist lens engenders the same problems and upholds capitalism – the alternative would reempower those who are ignored</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Many more quite similar examples can probably be found throughout Europe, and they would all illustrate the deeply contested ways and means through which transport infrastructures are being planned and developed, and how they all lead to a clash between diametrically opposed mobility interests that inevitably generate winning and losing groups. The conflicting character of transport planning is remarkably absent in the sustainable transport discourse. The harmonious and conflict-avoiding vocabulary of the sustainability agenda is unable to cope with material processes that shape and transform infrastructural networks. Yet, sustainable development and sustainable transport are policy concepts which are currently widely accepted at international, national and local policy levels. It has generated a new optimism among transport planners, since it seems to provide them with a fresh theoretical platform from which to launch new pragmatic planning measures, backed up by a broad, almost globally constructed political consensus about the necessity of its implementation. At the same time, however, it is not difficult to observe the remarkable discrepancy between, on the one hand, the legitimacy of sustainable transport concepts and, on the other hand, the poor theoretical elaboration of these concepts. There are, so to speak, as many definitions of 'sustainability' as there are authors publishing on the topic (see, for instance, Franks, 1996; Basiago, 1995; Naess, 1995). Moreover, in spite of the vast sustainability literature, the main academic disciplines which contribute to the theorization of 'sustainable transport' actually fall back upon pre-existing conceptual frameworks which, in general, do not require transport analyses to be revisited. Neo-classical economists, spatial planners and ecologists alike struggle to insert updated versions of their respective established doctrines into the hegemonic sustainability discourse in the hope that, by putting their doctrines high on the sustainability agenda, they will finally gain wide acceptance in the transport field under the politically and scientifically safe umbrella of 'sustainability'. Neo-classical economists (see, for example, Proost &amp; De Borger, 1997) insist on the sustainable character of implementing 'correct' pricing policies which truly reflect demand and supply in a free transport market, unhindered by State interference. Spatial planners (for instance, Breheny, 1992) stress the necessity of 'compact' spatial development so as to reduce transport demand and to facilitate supply. Ecologists (see, for instance, Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, 1994) maintain that current motorized traffic volumes have to be brought down in order not to exceed 'environmental thresholds'.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In this paper, I seek to critically investigate the underlying assumptions of the sustainable transport debate and of the main academic disciplines that fuel the debate. The overall argument is that the orthodox sustainable transport vision actually leads to the further empowerment of technocratic and elitist groups in society while simultaneously contributing to the further disempowerment of those marginalized social groups who were already bearing the burden of the environmental problems resulting from a troubled transport system. Scalar redefinitions of the transport problem play a prominent role in the twin processes of empowerment and disempowerment. The sustainability discourse is characterized by a frightening silence when it comes to the sharp socio-political conflicts which are at the heart of every single transport decision, be it the construction of an urban by-pass or parking restrictions in shopping mall-like town centres. The sustainable transport debate, in its frenetic attempt to seek and maintain a vague and shaky consensus on basic transport issues, ignores and silences the deeply contested ways through which the transport system is continuously shaped and transformed, and which inevitably results in a variety of winning and losing interest groups. The alleged 'general interest' of sustainability is actually highly socially fragmented. Furthermore, it will be argued that the contributions of transport economy and spatial planning to the sustainable transport discourse rest upon questionable philosophical assumptions which undermine the effectiveness of proposed planning measures. Consequently, transport problems are bound both to remain and to get worse and, again, the brunt of the burden will be shifted to the disempowered segments of society. Only the re-empowerment of the disempowered through the creation of more democratic decision-making procedures in the transport field can effectively induce a breakthrough in the downward spiral of deteriorating transport conditions.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Capitalism is based around oil consumption—causes nuclear resource wars and global warming—and peak oil makes collapse inevitable.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The tightening oil situation has prompted the rapid on the ground growth of U.S. energy imperialism, beyond the continuing Iraq and Afghan wars. The security of Saudi Arabia remains an overriding focus. Washington’s plans for a massive expansion of investment and production in Saudi Arabia, which according to the U.S. Department of Energy needs to double its oil output by 2030, depends on the feudal kingdom remaining in place. Meanwhile, there is rising social tension, emanating from the vastly unequal distribution of the country’s oil revenues. Ninety percent of private sector jobs go to foreigners. The sexes are entirely segregated. The repressive structure of the society conceals massive popular resentment. Any destabilization of the society would likely prompt U.S. military intervention. As James Howard Kunstler has written in The Long Emergency, “a desperate superpower might feel it has no choice except to attempt to control the largest remaining oil fields on the planet at any cost”—particularly if faced by growing rivalry from other states.35 The United States has sought to counter the possibility of an energy alliance between Russia, China, Iran, and Central Asian oil states by expanding its military bases in Afghanistan and Central Asia, notably its Manas air base in Kyrgyzstan on the border of oil-rich Kazakhstan. Threats of U.S. “preemptive” military intervention directed at Iran meanwhile have been continuous, based on its alleged attempts to acquire nuclear weapons through the aggressive pursuit of nuclear energy, and its “interference” in Iraq. Iran’s pursuit of nuclear power, as a 2007 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has confirmed, is due to an oil export decline rate of 10–12 percent, arising from the growth of domestic energy demand plus a high rate of oil field depletion and a lack of investment growth in expanded capacity. This led to Iran’s recent inability to meet its OPEC oil export quota. The current trend points to the likelihood of Iranian petroleum exports falling to zero by 2014–15. From the standpoint of Western energy and national security analysts, Iran’s government and its national oil corporation have adopted the monopolistic policy of underinvesting in oil, deliberating slowing its production in expectation of continually rising prices, thereby holding back on the lifeblood of the world economy.36 During the last few years the U.S. military has dramatically increased its bases and operations in Africa, particularly in the Gulf of Guinea. The United States expects to get 20 percent of its oil imports from Africa by 2010, and 25 percent by 2015. The U.S. military set up a separate Africa Command in 2007 to govern all U.S. military operations in Africa (outside Egypt). Washington sees itself as in direct competition with Beijing over African oil—a competition that it perceives not simply in economic but also military-strategic terms.37 U.S. ruling interests also have increased their threats directed at Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and other Latin American states, accusing them of “resource nationalism” and presenting them as dangers to U.S. national security. Washington has made one attempt after another to unseat Venezuela’s democratically elected president Hugo Chávez and to overthrow Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution, with the clear object of regime change. This has included stepping up its massive military intervention in Colombia and backing the Colombian military and its intrusions into neighboring countries. In 2006 the U.S. Southern Command conducted an internal study, declaring that Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and conceivably even Mexico (which was then facing elections with a possible populist outcome) offered serious dangers to U.S. energy security. “Pending any favorable changes to the investment climate,” it declared, “the prospects for long-term energy production in Venezuela, Ecuador and Mexico are currently at risk.” The military threat was obvious.38 All of this is in accord with the history of capitalism, and the response of declining hegemons to global forces largely outside their control. The new energy imperialism of the United States is already leading to expanding wars, which could become truly global, as Washington attempts to safeguard the existing capitalist economy and to stave off its own hegemonic decline. As Simmons has warned, “If we don’t create a solution to the enormous potential gap between our inherent demand for energy and the availability of energy we will have the nastiest and last war we’ll ever fight. I mean a literal war.”39 In January 2008 Carlos Pascual, vice president of the Brookings Institution and former director of the Bush administration’s Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization, released an analysis of “The Geopolitics of Energy” that highlighted U.S. capitalism’s de facto dependence on oil production in “Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Nigeria, and Kazakhstan”—all posing major security threats. “Due to commercial disputes, local instability, or ideology, Russia, Venezuela, Iran, Nigeria and Iraq are not investing in new long-term production capacity.” This then was both an economic and a military problem for Washington.40 Especially disturbing in this new phase of energy imperialism is the lack of resistance from populations within central capitalist countries themselves. Thus left-liberal publications in the wealthy nations often play on the prejudices of their readers (who are buffeted by rising gasoline prices), encouraging them to support oil imperialism designed to safeguard Western capitalism. David Litvin, writing on “Oil, Gas and Imperialism” in 2006 for the Guardian in London, claimed that “the inevitability of modern energy imperialism needs to be recognized.” Threats from Russia, OPEC, Venezuela, and Bolivia were highlighted. The United States invaded Iraq, we were told, partly for “oil security.” Clearly sympathizing with that form of energy imperialism that “involves consumer states launching political or military” interventions “to secure supplies,” Litvin concluded: “Energy imperialism is here to stay, and efforts should [therefore] focus on making it a more benign force.”41 Likewise Joshua Kurlantzick, a contributing writer for Mother Jones,wrote a piece entitled “Put a Tyrant in Your Tank” for the May–June 2008 issue of that magazine which attributed oil supply problems to national oil companies, and argued—referring to the Baker Institute report on “The Changing Role of National Oil Companies”—that oil would be better safeguarded if placed in the hands of multinational oil companies as of old. The latter, readers were told, “may cozy up to nasty regimes...but they are at least obligated to respond to public criticism.” Kurlantzick presented repeated criticisms of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela for his “resource nationalism,” going so far as to compare Venezuela to Burma and Russia, as “authoritarian and corrupt,” citing a study from the neoconservative, largely U.S. government-funded, Freedom House. The Mother Jones article also gave credence to the 2006 internal study conducted by the Pentagon’s Southern Command, pinpointing the national security dangers to the United States of resource nationalism in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Other petrostates that were subjected to sharp criticism were Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, and Libya. Chinese state oil corporations were targeted for their aggressiveness in pursuing oil around the world and for their lack of environmental concerns. U.S. energy imperialism was thus seen as justified even by the putatively progressive Mother Jones—with hope and confidence being placed mainly in big oil and the Pentagon.42 Planetary Conflagration? The supreme irony of the peak oil crisis of course is that the world is rapidly proceeding down the path of climate change from the burning of fossil fuels, threatening within a matter of decades human civilization and life on the planet. Unless carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption of such fuels are drastically reduced, a global catastrophe awaits. For environmentalists peak oil is therefore not a tragedy in itself since the crucial challenge facing humanity at present is weaning the world from excessive dependence on fossil fuels. The breaking of the solar energy budget that hydrocarbons allowed has generated a biospheric rift, which if not rapidly addressed will close off the future.43 Yet, heavy levels of fossil fuel, and particularly petroleum, consumption are built into the structure of the present world capitalist economy. The immediate response of the system to the end of easy oil has been therefore to turn to a new energy imperialism—a strategy of maximum extraction by any means possible: with the object of placating what Rachel Carson once called “the gods of profit and production.”44 This, however, presents the threat of multiple global conflagrations: global warming, peak oil, rapidly rising world hunger (resulting in part from growing biofuel production), and nuclear war—all in order to secure a system geared to growing inequality.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">An endorsement of politics within a new collective organization is practicable – any other politics MUST BE REJECTED as slavery </span><br />
<strong>Badiou ‘9</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Alain, Prof. @ European Graduate School, Former chair of Philosophy @ École Normale Supérieure, The Meaning of Sarkozy, pgs. 97-103)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">I would like to situate the Sarkozy episode, which is not an impressive page in French history, in a broader horizon. Let us picture a kind of Hegelian fresco of recent world history - by which I do not, like our journalists, mean the triad Mitterrand-Chirac-Sarkozy, but rather the development of the politics of working-class and popular emancipation over nearly two centuries. Since the French Revolution and its gradually universal echo, since the most radically egalitarian developments of that revolution, the decrees of Robespierre's Committee of Public Safety on the 'maximum' and Babeuf's theorizations, we know (when I say 'we', I mean humanity in the abstract, and the knowledge in question is universally available on the paths of emancipation) that communism is the right hypothesis. Indeed, there is no other, or at least I am not aware of one. All those who abandon this hypothesis immediately resign themselves to the market economy, to parliamentary democracy - the form of state suited to capitalism – and to the inevitable and 'natural' character of the most monstrous inequalities. What do we mean by 'communism'? As Marx argued in the 1844 Manuscripts, communism is an idea regarding the destiny of the human species. This use of the word must be completely distinguished from the meaning of the adjective 'communist' that is so worn-out today, in such expressions as 'communist parties', 'communist states' or 'communist world' - never mind that 'communist state' is an oxymoron, to which the obscure coinage 'socialist state' has wisely been preferred. Even if, as we shall see, these uses of the word belong to a time when the hypothesis was still coming-to-be. In its generic sense, 'communist' means first of all, in a negative sense - as we can read in its canonical text The Communist Manifesto - that the logic of classes, of the fundamental subordination of people who actually work for a dominant class, can be overcome. This arrangement, which has been that of history ever since antiquity, is not inevitable. Consequently, the oligarchic power of those who possess wealth and organize its circulation, crystallized in the might of states, is not inescapable. The communist hypothesis is that a different collective organization is practicable, one that will eliminate the inequality of wealth and even the division of labour: every individual will be a 'multi-purpose worker', and in particular people will circulate between manual and intellectual work, as well as between town and country. The private appropriation of monstrous fortunes and their transmission by inheritance will disappear. The existence of a coercive state separate from civil society, with its military and police, will no longer seem a self-evident necessity. There will be, Marx tells us - and he saw this point as his major contribution - after a brief sequence of 'proletarian dictatorship' charged with destroying the remains of the old world, a long sequence of reorganization on the basis of a 'free association' of producers and creators, which will make possible a 'withering away' of the state. 'Communism' as such only denotes this very general set of intellectual representations. This set is the horizon of any initiative, however local and limited in time it may be, that breaks with the order of established opinions - the necessity of inequalities and the state instrument for protecting these - and composes a fragment of a politics of emancipation. In other words, communism is what Kant called an 'Idea', with a regulatory function, rather than a programme. It is absurd to characterize communist principles in the sense I have defined them here as utopian, as is so often done. They are intellectual patterns, always actualized in a different fashion, that serve to produce lines of demarcation between different forms of politics. By and large, a particular political sequence is either compatible with these principles or opposed to them, in which case it is reactionary. 'Communism', in this sense, is a heuristic hypothesis that is very frequently used in political argument, even if the word itself does not appear. If it is still true, as Sartre said, that 'every anti-communist is a swine', it is because any political sequence that, in its principles or lack of them, stands in formal contradiction with the communist hypothesis in its generic sense, has to be judged as opposed to the emancipation of the whole of humanity, and thus to the properly human destiny of humanity. Whoever does not illuminate the coming-to-be of humanity with the communist hypothesis - whatever words they use, as such words matter little - reduces humanity, as far as its collective becoming is concerned, to animality. As we know, the contemporary - that is, the capitalist name of this animality - is 'competition'. The war dictated by self-interest, and nothing more. As a pure Idea of equality, the communist hypothesis has no doubt existed in a practical state since the beginnings of the existence of the state. As soon as mass action opposes state coercion in the name of egalitarian justice, we have the appearance of rudiments or fragments of the communist hypothesis. This is why, in a pamphlet titled De l'ideologie, which I wrote in collaboration with the late lamented Francois Balmes and was published in 1976, we proposed to identity 'communist invariants.'2 Popular revolts, such as that of the slaves led by Spartacus, or that of the German peasants led by Thomas Munzer, are examples of this practical existence of communist invariants. However, in the explicit form that it was given by certain thinkers and activists of the French Revolution, the communist hypothesis inaugurates political modernity. It was this that laid low the mental structures of the ancien regime, yet without being tied to those 'democratic' political forms that the bourgeoisie would make the instrument for its own pursuit of power. This point is essential: from the beginning, the communist hypothesis in no way coincided with the 'democratic' hypothesis that would lead to present-day parliamentarism. It subsumes a different history and different events. What seems important and creative when illuminated by the communist hypothesis is different in kind from what bourgeois-democratic historiography selects. That is indeed why Marx, giving materialist foundations to the first effective great sequence of the modern politics of emancipation, both took over the word 'communism' and distanced himself from any kind of democratic 'politicism' by maintaining, after the lesson of the Paris Commune, that the bourgeois state, no matter how democratic, must be destroyed. Well, I leave it to you to judge what is important or not, to judge the points whose consequences you choose to assume against the horizon of the communist hypothesis. Once again, it is the right hypothesis, and we can appeal to its principles, whatever the declensions or variations that these undergo in different contexts. Sartre said in an interview, which I paraphrase: If the communist hypothesis is not right, if it is not practicable, well, that means that humanity is not a thing in itself, not very different from ants or termites. What did he mean by that? If competition, the 'free market', the sum of little pleasures, and the walls that protect you from the desire of the weak, are the alpha and omega of all collective and private existence, then the human animal is not worth a cent. And it is this worthlessness to which Bush with his aggressive conservatism and crusader spirit, Blair the Pious with his militarist rhetoric, and Sarkozy with his 'work, family, country' discipline, want to reduce the existence of the immense majority of living individuals. And the 'Left' is still worse, simply juxtaposing to this vacant violence a vague spirit of charity. To morbid competition, the pasteboard victories of daddy's boys and girls, the ridiculous supermen of unleashed finance, the coked-up heroes of the planetary stock exchange, this Left can only oppose the same actors with a bit of social politeness, a little walnut oil in the wheels, crumbs of holy wafer for the disinherited - in other words, borrowing from Nietzsche, the bloodless figure of the 'last man’. To put an end once and for all to May '68 means agreeing that our only choice is between the hereditary nihilism of finance and social piety. It not only means accepting that communism collapsed in the Soviet Union, not only acknowledging that the Parti Communiste Francais has been wretchedly defeated, but also and above all it means abandoning the hypothesis that May '68 was a militant invention precisely aware of the failure of state 'communism'. And thus that May '68, and still more so the five years that followed, inaugurated a new sequence for the genuine communist hypothesis, one that always keeps its distance from the state. Certainly, no one could say where all this might lead, but we knew in any case that what was at stake was the rebirth of this hypothesis. If the thing that Sarkozy is the name of succeeds in imposing the necessity of abandoning any idea of a rebirth of this kind, if human society is a collection of individuals pursuing their self-interest, if this is the eternal reality, then it is certain that the philosopher can and must abandon the human animal to its sad destiny. But we shall not let a triumphant Sarkozy dictate the meaning of our existence, or the tasks of philosophy. For what we are witnessing in no way imposes such a renunciation of the communist hypothesis, but simply a consideration of the moment at which we find ourselves in the history of this hypothesis.</span><br />

 <strong>The aff acts out of a fear of extinction, ignoring the fact that action disrupts the natural flow of the Dao. The alternative is an embrace of Taoist inaction – that makes true disaster impossible</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">This example came to my mind when I began to ponder what the Taoists of ancient China would say about the ecological problems of the late twentieth century. If, so to speak, planet Earth is drifting precariously in the direction of presumable disaster, what would be the action that Chuang Chou and his contemporaries would have us take? In other words, would &quot;Taoism,&quot; in that sense, provide a solution to the apparent moral dilemma that faces our planet in our own day and age, and if so, what form might that solution take? As some of the other presenters gathered here seem already to have suggested, it is commonly believed by some hopeful minds that Taoism provides a pretty solution to the presumed problems of the planet. But more careful thought suggests that Taoism might not offer happy solutions to the problems of the modern world. What if, for instance, the issue in the foregoing example was not a human baby floating in a river, but rather the species of the whooping crane, its continuance threatened by the encroachment of human civilization. If Chuang Chou were sitting by watching earth's species threatened with extinction, what would he really do, and why? The answer, I fear, is not certain to fill our hearts with sanguine certainty of the future of the cranes, or with sanguine happiness that Chuang Chou shares our desire to preserve them. In fact, the only logical answer to this latter-day challenge to Taoist values would seem to be that Chuang Chou would, as it were, watch the whooping cranes float down the river on their way to apparent extinction, and would do nothing whatsoever to interfere with the natural operations of the world. The only logical answer to this situation is that the Taoist sees no action to be required, for he trusts that the world is already operating as it is supposed to be operating, and all human activity — no matter how well-intentioned — can add nothing of value to such operation, and can logically only interfere with the course of nature as it is already unfolding. Just as Chuang-tzu would not dive into a river to save a floating baby, he would not take deliberate action to save the world from apparent destruction. It is, in fact, on this basis that one can, in fact, distinguish classical Taoists from classical Confucians: like modern Westerners, the Confucians generally assume that the world inherently tends toward chaos and requires the redemptive activity of human society, individually and collectively. But Taoists, as a rule, do not share the Confucian (or Western) fear of the natural processes of life, and consequently do not fear the extinction of the whooping cranes, nor do Taoists enjoin deliberate action to save the cranes, or even Earth as a whole, from extinction. In fact, according to what I shall refer, for the moment, as Taoist moral reasoning, it is, in fact, morally objectionable for humans to presume that they are correct in their judgment of what constitutes an impending ecological danger, or that corrective action is called for to prevent an apparent natural catastrophe. On the basis on the texts of classical Taoism, I contend that the only possible Taoist position is that humans who foresee impending ecological disaster should, as it were, sit down and shut up, and let the universe work. While it is also true that those who lead an authentically Taoist life are unlikely to contribute in substantial ways to any ecological degradation of the planet, that fact alone does not justify the conclusion that Taoist principles can justify remedial action to correct the effects of less-insightful humans of past and present. The Taoist answer to ecological problems, I shall argue, is always to be found in going contrary to the Confucians, who assume humans to have a special wisdom that is nowhere else found among the living things of the world: whereas a Confucian, like Mencius, would feel morally compelled to jump up and dive into the river of life's events to save a threatened species of tall, noisy birds, a Taoist, like Chuang-tzu, would feel morally compelled to refrain from doing so. In what follows, I will attempt to explain the moral reasoning that would compel Chuang Chou to watch the cranes on their apparent way to extinction, taking no action, despite the disquiet that such a prospect might produce within his heart/mind. The fundamental principle involved is that humans are not the all-knowing beings that we usually take ourselves to be, and that the activities that humans have taken with the intention to govern or improve the world have almost always proven, in the final analysis, to have been misguided and unjustified, and to have actually done more harm than good. The ultimate Taoist principle, I propose, is that there is a reality beyond the comprehension or control of human thought or activity, and that humans of the modern secular age need to beware the arrogant assumption that we are, in Western terms, the &quot;God&quot; of planet earth. The Taoist position, I shall argue, is that planet earth has no &quot;God,&quot; and needs none, not even — or more correctly said, especially not — ourselves.</span></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">If we leave aside such self-serving emotional baggage, and simply analyze the texts of classical Taoism as we have received them, I find there little support for the modern predilection for salvific human action, and no support at all for the modern ideal of heroic human action. The Nei-yeh unconcerned with such matters: its concern is with the internal correction of the biospiritual condition of the individual. The Chuang-tzu seems to laugh at the very conceit that humans can fully appreciate what is going on around us. And the Tao te ching seems to say something much more disturbing and uncomfortable to the modern mind: the Tao te ching seems to argue quite persistently that humans can not and ought not intervene in the world, because there is a greater than us at work in the world. This quiet but insistent teaching of the Tao te ching has generally been ignored or denied by modern interpreters, because it says something that the post-Enlightenment mind cannot imagine as conceivably being true: that is, that there is a real and active force at work in the world that is greater than that of human beings, however wise. The Tao te ching, in fact, contrasts the effectiveness of that power to the misguided, self-defeating human belief in the supreme efficacy of their own interventional action. The Tao te ching asserts that the natural reality it calls the Tao is a perfect and ineluctable force for the fulfillment of life. Far from needing humans to complete its activity, that &quot;Tao&quot; is, despite appearances, the most powerful force that exists, and it inevitably leads all situations to a healthy fulfillment — provided human beings not interfere with it.11 It is this assumption of a benign and wholly trustworthy natural order — seldom perceptible in the Chuang-tzu — that provides a potential basis for a non-humanistic religious morality. From this perspective, Confucians — and modern liberals — wrongly fear that life will end in chaos without the redemptive activity of humanity: in truth, because of the beneficent activity of the natural force called the Tao, the Tao te ching teaches that we can rest assured that life will proceed harmoniously, except for the deleterious effects of misguided human activity. Human activity (wei) thus is not — indeed, cannot be — redemptive at all, but precisely the opposite. For that reason, our moral responsibility is to refrain from such activity, to desist from misguided interference in the inherently trustworthy tendencies of Heaven-and-Earth.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Stuart Jeffries Why Marxism is on the rise again The Guardian, Wednesday 4 July 2012 15.00 EDT Marxism 2012, University College and Friends Meeting House, London, 5-9 July.

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Class conflict once seemed so straightforward. Marx and Engels wrote in the second best-selling book of all time, The Communist Manifesto: &quot;What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.&quot; (The best-selling book of all time, incidentally, is the Bible – it only feels like it's 50 Shades of Grey.) Today, 164 years after Marx and Engels wrote about grave-diggers, the truth is almost the exact opposite. The proletariat, far from burying capitalism, are keeping it on life support. Overworked, underpaid workers ostensibly liberated by the largest socialist revolution in history (China's) are driven to the brink of suicide to keep those in the west playing with their iPads. Chinese money bankrolls an otherwise bankrupt America. The irony is scarcely wasted on leading Marxist thinkers. &quot;The domination of capitalism globally depends today on the existence of a Chinese Communist party that gives de-localised capitalist enterprises cheap labour to lower prices and deprive workers of the rights of self-organisation,&quot; says Jacques Rancière, the French marxist thinker and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII. &quot;Happily, it is possible to hope for a world less absurd and more just than today's.&quot; That hope, perhaps, explains another improbable truth of our economically catastrophic times – the revival in interest in Marx and Marxist thought. Sales of Das Kapital, Marx's masterpiece of political economy, have soared ever since 2008, as have those of The Communist Manifesto and the Grundrisse (or, to give it its English title, Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy). Their sales rose as British workers bailed out the banks to keep the degraded system going and the snouts of the rich firmly in their troughs while the rest of us struggle in debt, job insecurity or worse. There's even a Chinese theatre director called He Nian who capitalised on Das Kapital's renaissance to create an all-singing, all-dancing musical. And in perhaps the most lovely reversal of the luxuriantly bearded revolutionary theorist's fortunes, Karl Marx was recently chosen from a list of 10 contenders to appear on a new issue of MasterCard by customers of German bank Sparkasse in Chemnitz. In communist East Germany from 1953 to 1990, Chemnitz was known as Karl Marx Stadt. Clearly, more than two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the former East Germany hasn't airbrushed its Marxist past. In 2008, Reuters reports, a survey of east Germans found 52% believed the free-market economy was &quot;unsuitable&quot; and 43% said they wanted socialism back. Karl Marx may be dead and buried in Highgate cemetery, but he's alive and well among credit-hungry Germans. Would Marx have appreciated the irony of his image being deployed on a card to get Germans deeper in debt? You'd think. Later this week in London, several thousand people will attend Marxism 2012, a five-day festival organised by the Socialist Workers' Party. It's an annual event, but what strikes organiser Joseph Choonara is how, in recent years, many more of its attendees are young. &quot;The revival of interest in Marxism, especially for young people comes because it provides tools for analysing capitalism, and especially capitalist crises such as the one we're in now,&quot; Choonara says. There has been a glut of books trumpeting Marxism's relevance. English literature professor Terry Eagleton last year published a book called Why Marx Was Right. French Maoist philosopher Alain Badiou published a little red book called The Communist Hypothesis with a red star on the cover (very Mao, very now) in which he rallied the faithful to usher in the third era of the communist idea (the previous two having gone from the establishment of the French Republic in 1792 to the massacre of the Paris communards in 1871, and from 1917 to the collapse of Mao's Cultural Revolution in 1976). Isn't this all a delusion? Aren't Marx's venerable ideas as useful to us as the hand loom would be to shoring up Apple's reputation for innovation? Isn't the dream of socialist revolution and communist society an irrelevance in 2012? After all, I suggest to Rancière, the bourgeoisie has failed to produce its own gravediggers. Rancière refuses to be downbeat: &quot;The bourgeoisie has learned to make the exploited pay for its crisis and to use them to disarm its adversaries. But we must not reverse the idea of historical necessity and conclude that the current situation is eternal. The gravediggers are still here, in the form of workers in precarious conditions like the over-exploited workers of factories in the far east. And today's popular movements – Greece or elsewhere – also indicate that there's a new will not to let our governments and our bankers inflict their crisis on the people.&quot;</span><br />

<strong>The focus on the primacy of discourse ruptures this. Post-structuralist criticism makes lack of objectivity natural – but there are objective truths, like the oppression of workers globally – and you prevent real, radical change from occurring.</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Mas'ud </span><strong><u>Zavarzadeh,</u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Department of English, Syracuse University, editor of Transformation: Marxist Boundary Work in Theory, Economics, Politics and Culture—a biquarterly published by the not-for-profit Maisonneuve Press, College Literature Vol 21 Issue 3, </span><strong><u>1994</u></strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, “The Stupidity That Consumption is Just as Productive as Production: In the Shopping Mall of the Post-Al Left” Questia</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The unsurpassable objectivity which is not open to rhetorical interpretation and constitutes the decided foundation of critique is the &quot;outside&quot; that Marx calls the &quot;Working Day&quot; (Capital 1: 340-416). ([France] willfully misrecognizes my notion of objectivity by confusing my discussion of identity politics and objectivity.) The working day is not what it seems: its reality, like the reality of all capitalist practices, is an alienated reality--there is a contradiction between its appearance and its essence. It &quot;appears&quot; as if the worker, during the working day, receives wages that are equal compensation for his labor. This mystification originates in the fact that the capitalist pays not for &quot;labor&quot; but for &quot;labor power&quot;: when labor power is put to use it produces more than it is paid for. The &quot;working day&quot; is the site of the unfolding of this fundamental contradiction: it is a divided day, divided into &quot;necessary labor&quot;--the part in which the worker produces value equivalent to his wages--and the &quot;other,&quot; the part of &quot;surplus labor&quot;--a part in which the worker works for free and produces &quot;surplus value.&quot; The second part of the working day is the source of profit and accumulation of capital. &quot;Surplus labor&quot; is the OBJECTIVE FACT of capitalist relations of production: without &quot;surplus labor&quot; there will be no profit, and without profit there will be no accumulation of capital, and without accumulation of capital there will be no capitalism. The goal of bourgeois economics is to conceal this part of the working day, and it should therefore be no surprise that, as a protector of ruling class interests in the academy, [Hill], with a studied casualness, places &quot;surplus value&quot; in the adjacency of &quot;radical bible-studies&quot; and quietly turns it into a rather boring matter of interest perhaps only to the dogmatic. To be more concise: &quot;surplus labor&quot; is that objective, unsurpassable &quot;outside&quot; that cannot be made part of the economies of the &quot;inside&quot; without capitalism itself being transformed into socialism. Revolutionary critique is grounded in this truth--objectivity--since all social institutions and practices of capitalism are founded upon the objectivity of surplus labor. The role of a revolutionary pedagogy of critique is to produce class consciousness so as to assist in organizing people into a new vanguard party that aims at abolishing this FACT of the capitalist system and transforming capitalism into a communist society. As I have argued in my &quot;Postality&quot; [Transformation 1], (post)structuralist theory, through the concept of &quot;representation,&quot; makes all such facts an effect of interpretation and turns them into &quot;undecidable&quot; processes. The boom in ludic theory and Rhetoric Studies in the bourgeois academy is caused by the service it renders the ruling class: it makes the OBJECTIVE reality of the extraction of surplus labor a subjective one--not a decided fact but a matter of &quot;interpretation.&quot; In doing so, it &quot;deconstructs&quot; (see the writings of such bourgeois readers as Gayatri Spivak, Cornel West, and Donna Haraway) the labor theory of value, displaces production with consumption, and resituates the citizen from the revolutionary cell to the ludic shopping mall of [France]. Now that I have indicated the objective grounds of &quot;critique,&quot; I want to go back to the erasure of critique by dialogue in the post-al left and examine the reasons why these nine texts locate my critique-al writings and pedagogy in the space of violence, Stalinism, and demagoguery. Violence, in the post-al left, is a refusal to &quot;talk.&quot; &quot;To whom is Zavarzadeh speaking?&quot; asks [ Williams], who regards my practices to he demagogical, and [ Bernard-Donals] finds as a mark of violence in my texts that &quot;The interlocutor really is absent&quot; from them. What is obscured in this representation of the non-dialogical is, of course, the violence of the dialogical. I leave aside here the violence with which these advocates of non-violent conversations attack me in their texts, and cartoon. My concern is with the practices by which the post-al left, through dialogue, naturalizes (and eroticizes) the violence that keeps capitalist democracy in power. What is violent? Subjecting people to the daily terrorism of layoffs in order to maintain high rates of profit for the owners of the means of production or redirecting this violence (which gives annual bonuses, in addition to multi-million-dollar salaries, benefits, and stock options, to the CEOs of the very corporations that are laying off thousands of workers) against the ruling class in order to end class societies? What is violent? Keeping millions of people in poverty, hunger, starvation, and homelessness, and deprived of basic health care, at a time when the forces of production have reached a level that can, in fact, provide for the needs of all people, or trying to overthrow this system? What is violent? Placing in office, under the alibi of &quot;free elections,&quot; postfascists (Italy) and allies of the ruling class (Major, Clinton, Kohl, Yeltsin) or struggling to end this farce? What is violent? Reinforcing these practices by &quot;talking&quot; about them in a &quot;reasonable&quot; fashion (that is, within the rules of the game established by the ruling class for limited reform from &quot;within&quot;) or marking the violence of conversation and its complicity with the status quo, thereby breaking the frame that represents &quot;dialogue&quot; as participation, when in fact it is merely a formal strategy for legitimating the established order? Any society in which the labor of many is the source of wealth for the few--all class societies--is a society of violence, and no amount of &quot;talking&quot; is going to change that objective fact. &quot;Dialogue&quot; and &quot;conversation&quot; are aimed at arriv-ing at a consensus by which this violence is made more tolerable, justifiable, and naturalized. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">What the postmodern Marxist's reading of The Full Monty demonstrates is that in their desire to get rid of &quot;capitalocentrism&quot; - the alleged obsession of Marxists with seeing &quot;capitalism&quot; everywhere - they end up reconfiguring and consolidating capitalism back in. In their unreflective romanticizing of reform, and in their haughty contempt for revolutionary thinking and politics, J.K-.Gibson-Graham's style of postmodern/post-Marxism delivers what boils down to good old-fashioned liberalism: a mild, state-administered &quot;economic justice&quot; platform centered around individual private liberties, neatly packaged in postmodern gift wrapping. The bottom line is this: When one looks closely at what postmodern/post-Marxist theory actually offers, and after it is done &quot;representing capitalism through the lens of overdetermination,&quot;49 all one can strategize about is how to make capitalism more &quot;user friendly.&quot; Gone is the project of getting rid of it. Strangely enough, postmodern/ post-Marxists do not regard these positions as a surrender of the Marxist project at all, but rather, as the exact fulfillment of that commitment.50 From Radical Democracy to Revolutionary Democracy Let me finish by addressing the &quot;vision thing&quot; in Marxist theory, and by putting forward some minimal suggestions for how to proceed. The problem with the Left in this country is not Marx's theorizing of capital, it is the Left's profound poverty of vision. Simply put, we cannot think &quot;Revolution&quot; anymore because we cannot think &quot;Capitalism&quot; anymore. What passes for &quot;radical democracy&quot; nowadays is so timid and so willing to declare and settle for quick victories that one has to wonder sometimes where exactly it is that the radicalism in radical democracy lies. And to make matters worse, we are living in a period in which the Left itself is the one in charge of convincing us that the &quot;Revolution&quot; is not only politically unfeasible, but also epistemologically impossible. To paraphrase Marx's famous eleventh thesis on Feuerbach, postmodern Marxists have interpreted the world for too long - the point is to change it. Do we need reform? Of course we do, but to construct reform as a &quot;sufficient&quot; condition for social change is to engage not in the politics of empowerment but in the practice of a politics of surrender with delusions of grandeur. Furthermore, in a post-structuralist epistemological framework in which structural and systemic explanations are forbidden, all we are left with is a blurred capacity to prioritize what is to be done. In short, in the postmodern Marxist world, it is impossible to structurally explain how the top 1 percent of the world population has more wealth than the bottom 92 percent. To do that would require the admission that there is something called capitalism with a logic to it. Recall that in the postmodern Marxist world, the political importance of &quot;any relationship... [is determined by] how we wish to think of the complex interaction&quot;; it is not based on institutional or systemic mechanisms of how inequality gets generated and reproduced.51 And given the postmodern Marxists' insistence on defining capitalism from the get-go as having &quot;no essential or coherent identity,&quot;52 it is no surprise that such academics are totally irrelevant to real people's struggles against globalization, the IMF, the WTO, and NAFTA. It's the case of the chicken coming home to roost. It is time to stop the politics of surrender and denial. It is time to stop pretending that if we repeat things over and over again for long enough (this is called &quot;performative&quot; in postmodern parlance), things will eventually change. The fact is that the Left has been getting crushed for quite some time now. The fact is that it is going to take more than a cadre of postmodern intellectuals and a new definition of capitalism to establish a just economic and political system. And attempts to co-opt and hijack Marxism for some reformist agenda is not going to do it either.</span><br />

<strong>Impacts – Capitalism causes war, oppression</strong><br />
<strong>Brown, 5.</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Professor of Economics and Research Scientist at the University of Michigan (Charles Brown, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/pen-l/2005w15/msg00062.htm" rel="nofollow">http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/pen-l/2005w15/msg00062.htm</a></span>) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The capitalist class owns the factories, the banks, and transportation-the means of production and distribution. Workers sell their ability to work in order to acquire the necessities of life. Capitalists buy the workers' labor, but only pay them back a portion of the wealth they create. Because the capitalists own the means of production, they are able to keep the surplus wealth created by workers above and beyond the cost of paying worker's wages and other costs of production. This surplus is called &quot;profit&quot; and consists of unpaid labor that the capitalists appropriate and use to achieve ever-greater profits. These profits are turned into capital which capitalists use to further exploit the producers of all wealth-the working class. Capitalists are compelled by competition to seek to maximize profits. The capitalist class as a whole can do that only by extracting a greater surplus from the unpaid labor of workers by increasing exploitation. Under capitalism, economic development happens only if it is profitable to the individual capitalists, not for any social need or good. The profit drive is inherent in capitalism, and underlies or exacerbates all major social ills of our times. With the rapid advance of technology and productivity, new forms of capitalist ownership have developed to maximize profit. The working people of our country confront serious, chronic problems because of capitalism. These chronic problems become part of the objective conditions that confront each new generation of working people. The threat of nuclear war, which can destroy all humanity, grows with the spread of nuclear weapons, space-based weaponry, and a military doctrine that justifies their use in preemptive wars and wars without end. Ever since the end of World War II, the U.S. has been constantly involved in aggressive military actions big and small. These wars have cost millions of lives and casualties, huge material losses, as well as trillions of U.S. taxpayer dollars. Threats to the environment continue to spiral, threatening all life on our planet. Millions of workers are unemployed or insecure in their jobs, even during economic upswings and periods of &quot;recovery&quot; from recessions. Most workers experience long years of stagnant real wages, while health and education costs soar. Many workers are forced to work second and third jobs to make ends meet. Most workers now average four different occupations during their lifetime, being involuntarily moved from job to job and career to career. Often, retirement-age workers are forced to continue working just to provide health care for themselves. With capitalist globalization, jobs move as capitalists export factories and even entire industries to other countries. Millions of people continuously live below the poverty level; many suffer homelessness and hunger. Public and private programs to alleviate poverty and hunger do not reach everyone, and are inadequate even for those they do reach. Racism remains the most potent weapon to divide working people. Institutionalized racism provides billions in extra profits for the capitalists every year due to the unequal pay racially oppressed workers receive for work of comparable value. All workers receive lower wages when racism succeeds in dividing and disorganizing them. In every aspect of economic and social life, African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian a nd Pacific Islanders, Arabs and Middle Eastern peoples, and other nationally and racially oppressed people experience conditions inferior to that of whites. Racist violence and the poison of racist ideas victimize all people of color no matter which economic class they belong to. The attempts to suppress and undercount the vote of the African American and other racially oppressed people are part of racism in the electoral process. Racism permeates the police, judicial and prison systems, perpetuating unequal sentencing, racial profiling, discriminatory enforcement, and police brutality. The democratic, civil and human rights of all working people are continually under attack. These attacks range from increasingly difficult procedures for union recognition and attempts to prevent full union participation in elections, to the absence of the right to strike for many public workers. They range from undercounting minority communities in the census to making it difficult for working people to run for office because of the domination of corporate campaign funding and the high cost of advertising. These attacks also include growing censorship and domination of the media by the ultra-right; growing restrictions and surveillance of activist social movements and the Left; open denial of basic rights to immigrants; and, violations of the Geneva Conventions up to and including torture for prisoners. These abuses all serve to maintain the grip of the capitalists on government power. They use this power to ensure the economic and political dominance of their class. Women still face a considerable differential in wages for work of equal or comparable value. They also confront barriers to promotion, physical and sexual abuse, continuing unequal workload in home and family life, and male supremacist ideology perpetuating unequal and often unsafe conditions. The constant attacks on social welfare programs severely impact single women, single mothers, nationally and racially oppressed women, and all working class women. The reproductive rights of all women are continually under attack ideologically and politically. Violence against women in the home and in society at large remains a shameful fact of life in the U.S.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Some, however, have suggested that the historical era of the Enlightenment was unique, and that epistemological pluralism would, in the modem world, create little danger of internecine warfare. 139 This optimism overlooks one of the fundamental differences between rational and antirational epistemologies: because the latter rest on faith rather than reason, they are likely to be impervious to persuasion and resistant to compromise.14 0 Moreover, without the skeptical cast of mind fostered by Enlightenment epistemology, antirational epistemologies-especially religion, with its extrahuman source of authorityare likely to be conducive to particularly deep conviction. Deep conviction, in turn, is a breeding ground for exactly the religious wars of previous centuries: In Abrams v. United States, Justice Holmes argued that a logical result of deep conviction is intolerance. As Dean Bollinger has added, failing to attempt to silence what one believes to be false might be seen as a sign of weak conviction.... To the zealous adherent, intolerance and persecution become, in a sense, the measure of her commitment to her religious beliefs. 141 Even in the United States, where religion has largely been domesticated (as Michael Perry puts it), 142 we have not been spared all of the violence associated with pre-Enlightenment religious wars. Although, as Perry points out, &quot;[w]e are not the former Yugoslavia or India,&quot; 143 the Branch Davidians, the World Trade Center bombers, the abortion clinic killings, and the growth of various organizations- on the left and the right, not all of them religious-that use irrational arguments to reject and resist the authority of government, by violence if necessary, should give us pause before abandoning the fruits of the Enlightenment. 44 Indeed, as one historian has pointed out: If we have now entered an era in which those on the right have been joined by some on the left in assailing reason as faulty because it does not correspond to the essential and incontestable truths they have come to know emotionally, or by virtue of their membership in particular groups, the prospects for deliberative democracy are bleak indeed .... If truth resides in difference and emotion, then war rather than persuasion is the only possible consequence of speaking such a truth to power. 145</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Atkinson's main argument seems to be that the strength of postmodernism is that it ‘comes as something of a shock’ (2002, p. 78) [14] and reveals sub-texts and textual silences (ibid.). Well, so does Marxism on both counts. The difference is that with the former, after our shock, there is not much else to do, except at the local level. One of the great strengths of Marxism is that allows us to move beyond appearances and to look beneath the surface and to move forward. It allows us to transgress Derrida’s ‘ordeal of the undecidable’, Lather’s ‘praxis of not being so sure’, and Baxter’s ‘paralysis of practice’. Marx’s Labour Theory of Value (LTV), for example, explains most concisely why capitalism is objectively a system of exploitation, whether the exploited realise it or not, or indeed, whether they believe it to be an issue of importance for them or not. The LTV also provides a solution to this exploitation. It thus provides dialectical praxis – the authentic union of theory and practice. According to the LTV, the interests of capitalists and workers are diametrically opposed, since a benefit to the former (profits) is a cost to the latter (Hickey, 2002, p. 168). Marx argued that workers' labour is embodied in goods that they produce. The finished products are appropriated (taken away) by the capitalists and eventually sold at a profit. However, the worker is paid only a fraction of the value s/he creates in productive labour; the wage does not represent the total value s/he creates. We appear to be paid for every single second we work. However, underneath this appearance, this fetishism, the working day (like under serfdom) is split in two: into socially necessary labour (and the wage represents this) and surplus labour, labour that is not reflected in the wage. This is the basis of surplus value, out of which comes the capitalist's profit. While the value of the raw materials and of the depreciating machinery is simply passed on to the commodity in production, labour power is a peculiar, indeed unique commodity, in that it creates new value. ‘The magical quality of labour-power's ... value for ... capital is therefore critical’ (Rikowski, 2001, p. 11). ‘[L]abour-power creates more value (profit) in its consumption than it possesses itself, and than it costs’ (Marx, 1966, p. 351). Unlike, for example, the value of a given commodity, which can only be realised in the market as itself, labour creates a new value, a value greater than itself, a value which previously did not exist. It is for this reason that labour power is so important for the capitalist, in the quest for capital accumulation. It is in the interest of the capitalist or capitalists (nowadays, capitalists may, of course, consist of a number of shareholders, for example, rather than outright owners of businesses) to maximise profits and this entails (in order to create the greatest amount of new value) keeping workers' wages as low are as 'acceptable' in any given country or historical period, without provoking effective strikes or other forms of resistance. Therefore, the capitalist mode of production is, in essence, a system of exploitation of one class (the working class) by another (the capitalist class) Whereas class conflict is endemic to, and ineradicable and perpetual within the capitalist system, it does not always or even typically take the form of open conflict or expressed hostility (Hickey, 2002, p. 168). Fortunately for the working class, however, capitalism is prone to cyclical instability and subject to periodic political and economic crises. At these moments, the possibility exists for socialist revolution. Revolution can only come about when the working class, in addition to being a ‘classin- itself’ (an objective fact because of the shared exploitation inherent as a result of the LTV) becomes ‘a class-for-itself’ (Marx, 1977, p. 341). By this, Marx meant a class with a subjective awareness of its social class position, that is to say, a class with ‘class consciousness’ - including its awareness of its exploitation and its transcendence of ‘false consciousness’. Marx argued that, if the working class has become a ‘class-for-itself’, it has the potential to seize control of the means of production, the economy and take political power. Seizure of the economy would constitute such a socialist revolution (Hill and Cole, 2001, p. 147). This, of course, is not an easy option, but it is the working class that is most likely to be at the forefront of such a revolution. As Michael Slott has put it with great clarity: Marxists have understood perfectly well that there are many obstacles to the working class becoming a universal agent for socialism. At the same time, Marxists have argued that, because of the particular interests, collective power, and creative capacities that are generated by workers’ structural position in society, the working class is more likely to be at the core of any movement of social transformation (2002, p. 419) [15]. For Marx, socialism (a stage before communism, when the state would wither away and we would live communally) was a world system in which 'we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all' (Marx and Engels, 1977, p. 53). Such a society would be democratic (as such, socialism as envisaged by Marx should be distanced from the undemocratic regimes of the former Soviet bloc) and classless and the means of production would be in the hands of the many, not the few. Goods and services would be produced for need and not for profit [16]. Postmodernists and poststructuralists are clearly capable of asking questions, but, by their own acknowledgement, they have no answers. As Glenn Rikowski has put it, this leads one to ask; just what is the postmodernist attitude to explanation? Truly political strategies require explanation (of what went wrong, why the analysis and/or tactics failed etc.) so that improvements can be made. Do postmodernists have a notion of improvement (of society, of political strategies)? If they do, then they need explanation. I don't think they are interested in either, and hence can't have a political strategy for human betterment (cited in Cole, 2001, p. 77).</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In fact, normative legal thought is so much in a hurry that it will tell you what to do even though there is not the slightest chance that you might actually be in a position to do it. For instance, when was the last time you were in a position to put the difference principle n31 into effect, or to restructure [*179] the doctrinal corpus of the first amendment? &quot;In the future, we should. . . .&quot; When was the last time you were in a position to rule whether judges should become pragmatists, efficiency purveyors, civic republicans, or Hercules surrogates? Normative legal thought doesn't seem overly concerned with such worldly questions about the character and the effectiveness of its own discourse. It just goes along and proposes, recommends, prescribes, solves, and resolves. Yet despite its obvious desire to have worldly effects, worldly consequences, normative legal thought remains seemingly unconcerned that for all practical purposes, its only consumers are legal academics and perhaps a few law students -- persons who are virtually never in a position to put any of its wonderful normative advice into effect.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">For these legal thinkers, it will seem especially urgent to ask once again: What should be done? How should we live? What should the law be? These are the hard questions. These are the momentous questions. [*805] And they are the wrong ones. They are wrong because it is these very normative questions that reprieve legal thinkers from recognizing the extent to which the cherished &quot;ideals&quot; of legal academic thought are implicated in the reproduction and maintenance of precisely those ugly &quot;realities&quot; of legal practice the academy so routinely condemns. It is these normative questions that allow legal thinkers to shield themselves from the recognition that their work product consists largely of the reproduction of rhetorical structures by which human beings can be coerced into achieving ends of dubious social origin and implication. It is these very normative questions that allow legal academics to continue to address (rather lamely) bureaucratic power structures as if they were rational, morally competent, individual humanist subjects. It is these very normative questions that allow legal thinkers to assume blithely that -- in a world ruled by HMOs, personnel policies, standard operating procedures, performance requirements, standard work incentives, and productivity monitoring -- they somehow have escaped the bureaucratic power games. It is these normative questions that enable them to represent themselves as whole and intact, as self-directing individual liberal humanist subjects at once rational, morally competent, and in control of their own situations, the captain of their own ships, the Hercules of their own empires, the author of their own texts. It isn't so. n5 And if it isn't so, it would seem advisable to make some adjustments in the agenda and practice of legal thought. That is what I will be trying to do here. Much of what follows will no doubt seem threatening or nihilistic to many readers. In part that is because this article puts in question the very coherence, meaningfulness, and integrity of the kinds of normative disputes and discussion that almost all of us in the legal academy practice.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">But what is the cash value of all this priest-talk in the law reviews, in the classrooms of at least the &quot;better&quot; schools, and in the opinions of at least some judges? Are normativos better than other people? Are we better off for engaging in normative talk, either as speakers or listeners? Pierre Schlag, for example, has described normativity as a zero -- as a vacuous, self-referential system of talk, all [*954] form and no substance, meaning nothing, and about itself. n82 This description may be too generous. Normativity may be more than a harmless tic prevalent only in certain circles. 1. Permission to Ignore Suffering The history of organized religion shows that intense immersion in at least certain types of normative system is no guarantee against cruelty, intolerance or superstition. n83 In modern times, social scientists have tried to find a correlation between religious belief and altruistic behavior. In most studies, the correlation is nonexistent or negative. In one study, seminary students were observed as they walked past a well-dressed man lying moaning on the sidewalk. n84 Most ignored the man, even though they had just heard a sermon about the Good Samaritan. The proportion who stopped to offer aid was lower than that of passersby in general. The researchers, commenting on this and other studies of religion and helping behavior, hypothesized that religious people feel less need to act because of a sense that they are &quot;chosen&quot; people. n85 I believe this anesthetizing effect extends beyond religion. We confront a starving beggar and immediately translate the concrete duty we feel into a normative (i.e., abstract) question. And once we see the beggar's demand in general, systemic terms, it is easy for us to pass him by without rendering aid. n86 Someone else, perhaps society (with my tax dollars), will take care of that problem. Normativity thus enables us to ignore and smooth over the rough edges of our world, to tune out or redefine what would otherwise make a claim on us. In the legal system, the clearest [*955] examples of this are found in cases where the Supreme Court has been faced with subsistence claims.</span><br />

<strong>The alternative: reject the affirmative’s normative thought.</strong><br />
<strong>What’s required is genuine questioning with a focus on individual agency – normative legal thought decks this, though – pain and death DA to the perm</strong><br />
<strong>SCHLAG,</strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">PROFESSOR OF LAW@ UNIV. COLORADO,</span> <strong>1990</strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">(PIERRE, STANFORD LAW REVIEW, NOVEMBER, PAGE LEXIS)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">All of this can seem very funny. That's because it is very funny. It is also deadly serious. It is deadly serious, because all this normative legal thought, as Robert Cover explained, takes place in a field of pain and death. n56 And in a very real sense Cover was right. Yet as it takes place, normative legal thought is playing language games -- utterly oblivious to the character of the language games it plays, and thus, utterly uninterested in considering its own rhetorical and political contributions (or lack thereof) to the field of pain and death. To be sure, normative legal thinkers are often genuinely concerned with reducing the pain and the death. However, the problem is not what normative legal thinkers do with normative legal thought, but what normative legal thought does with normative legal thinkers. What is missing in normative legal thought is any serious questioning, let alone tracing, of the relations that the practice, the rhetoric, the routine of normative legal thought have (or do not have) to the field of pain and death. And there is a reason for that: Normative legal thought misunderstands its own situation. Typically, normative legal thought understands itself to be outside the field of pain and death and in charge of organizing and policing that field. It is as if the action of normnative legal thought could be separated from the background field of pain and death. This theatrical distinction is what allows normative legal thought its own self-important, self-righteous, self-image -- its congratulatory sense of its own accomplishments and effectiveness. All this self-congratulation works very nicely so long as normative legal [*188] thought continues to imagine itself as outside the field of pain and death and as having effects within that field. n57 Yet it is doubtful this image can be maintained. It is not so much the case that normative legal thought has effects on the field of pain and death -- at least not in the direct, originary way it imagines. Rather, it is more the case that normative legal thought is the pattern, is the operation of the bureaucratic distribution and the institutional allocation of the pain and the death. n58 And apart from the leftover ego-centered rationalist rhetoric of the eighteenth century (and our routine), there is nothing at this point to suggest that we, as legal thinkers, are in control of normative legal thought. The problem for us, as legal thinkers, is that the normative appeal of normative legal thought systematically turns us away from recognizing that normative legal thought is grounded on an utterly unbelievable re-presentation of the field it claims to describe and regulate. The problem for us is that normative legal thought, rather than assisting in the understanding of present political and moral situations, stands in the way. It systematically reinscribes its own aesthetic -- its own fantastic understanding of the political and moral scene. n59Until normative legal thought begins to deal with its own paradoxical postmodern rhetorical situation, it will remain something of an irresponsible enterprise. In its rhetorical structure, it will continue to populate the legal academic world with individual humanist subjects who think themselves empowered Cartesian egos, but who are largely the manipulated constructions of bureaucratic practices -- academic and otherwise.</span><br />

 <strong>Collapse solves extinction – now key</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Humanity and the Earth are faced with an enormous conundrum -- sufficient climate policies enjoy political support only in times of rapid economic growth. Yet this growth is the primary factor driving greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental ills. The growth machine has pushed the planet well beyond its ecological carrying capacity, and unless constrained, can only lead to human extinction and an end to complex life. With every economic downturn, like the one now looming in the United States, it becomes more difficult and less likely that policy sufficient to ensure global ecological sustainability will be embraced. This essay explores the possibility that from a biocentric viewpoint of needs for long-term global ecological, economic and social sustainability; it would be better for the economic collapse to come now rather than later. Economic growth is a deadly disease upon the Earth, with capitalism as its most virulent strain. Throw-away consumption and explosive population growth are made possible by using up fossil fuels and destroying ecosystems. Holiday shopping numbers are covered by media in the same breath as Arctic ice melt, ignoring their deep connection. Exponential economic growth destroys ecosystems and pushes the biosphere closer to failure. Humanity has proven itself unwilling and unable to address climate change and other environmental threats with necessary haste and ambition. Action on coal, forests, population, renewable energy and emission reductions could be taken now at net benefit to the economy. Yet, the losers -- primarily fossil fuel industries and their bought oligarchy -- successfully resist futures not dependent upon their deadly products. Perpetual economic growth, and necessary climate and other ecological policies, are fundamentally incompatible. Global ecological sustainability depends critically upon establishing a steady state economy, whereby production is right-sized to not diminish natural capital. Whole industries like coal and natural forest logging will be eliminated even as new opportunities emerge in solar energy and environmental restoration. This critical transition to both economic and ecological sustainability is simply not happening on any scale. The challenge is how to carry out necessary environmental policies even as economic growth ends and consumption plunges. The natural response is going to be liquidation of even more life-giving ecosystems, and jettisoning of climate policies, to vainly try to maintain high growth and personal consumption. We know that humanity must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% over coming decades. How will this and other necessary climate mitigation strategies be maintained during years of economic downturns, resource wars, reasonable demands for equitable consumption, and frankly, the weather being more pleasant in some places? If efforts to reduce emissions and move to a steady state economy fail; the collapse of ecological, economic and social systems is assured. Bright greens take the continued existence of a habitable Earth with viable, sustainable populations of all species including humans as the ultimate truth and the meaning of life. Whether this is possible in a time of economic collapse is crucially dependent upon whether enough ecosystems and resources remain post collapse to allow humanity to recover and reconstitute sustainable, relocalized societies. It may be better for the Earth and humanity's future that economic collapse comes sooner rather than later, while more ecosystems and opportunities to return to nature's fold exist. Economic collapse will be deeply wrenching -- part Great Depression, part African famine. There will be starvation and civil strife, and a long period of suffering and turmoil. Many will be killed as balance returns to the Earth. Most people have forgotten how to grow food and that their identity is more than what they own. Yet there is some justice, in that those who have lived most lightly upon the land will have an easier time of it, even as those super-consumers living in massive cities finally learn where their food comes from and that ecology is the meaning of life. Economic collapse now means humanity and the Earth ultimately survive to prosper again. Human suffering -- already the norm for many, but hitting the currently materially affluent -- is inevitable given the degree to which the planet's carrying capacity has been exceeded. We are a couple decades at most away from societal strife of a much greater magnitude as the Earth's biosphere fails. Humanity can take the bitter medicine now, and recover while emerging better for it; or our total collapse can be a final, fatal death swoon. A successful revolutionary response to imminent global ecosystem collapse would focus upon bringing down the Earth's industrial economy now. As society continues to fail miserably to implement necessary changes to allow creation to continue, maybe the best strategy to achieve global ecological sustainability is economic sabotage to hasten the day. It is more fragile than it looks. </span><br />

Sustainability will require enormous reductions in the volume of rich world production and consumption. Yet </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="underline">its supreme goal is economic growth</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, i.e., to increase the levels of production and consumption and GDP, constantly, rapidly and </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="underline">without</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> any </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="underline">limit</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="underline">That</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> the </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="underline">absurdity</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> of this </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="underline">is never recognised</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> in conventional economic and political circles defies understanding. If we in rich countries average 3% economic growth to 2070 and by then all the world’s people had risen to the &quot;living standards’ we would have by then, the total world economic output would be 60 times as great as the present grossly unsustainable level. If this limits to growth analysis is at all valid the implications for the problem of global peace and conflict and security are clear and savage. If we all remain determined to increase our living standards, our level of production and consumption, </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="underline">in a world where resources are</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> already </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="underline">scarce</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">, where only a few have affluent living standards but another 8 billion will be wanting them too, and which we the rich are determined to get richer without any limit, then </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;" class="underline">nothing is more guaranteed than that there will be increasing levels of conflict</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> and violence.

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">In contrast to the cold war era, today’s conflicts are less about ideologies and seizing the reins of state than about the struggle to control or plunder resources—capturing sites rich in minerals, timber, and other valuable commodities or controlling points through which they pass on the way to markets. Paul Collier, director of the Development Research Group at the World Bank, has been one of the earliest to argue that greed and the availability of “lootable” natural resource wealth are key factors.9 Although some of today’s conflicts have their roots in long-standing grievances, there is a self-sustaining vicious cycle at work in which the spoils of resource exploitation fund war, and war provides the means and conditions that allow continued illegitimate access to these resources. The conflict in the Sudan provides a telling example: Oil exports have permitted the central government to carry on with the war against southern rebels. To keep paying for the war, the government must expand oil production, but this requires exploiting oil deposits deeper and deeper in rebel-held territory. To control oil-rich areas in southern Sudan, government forces are conducting a scorched earth campaign at terrible human cost. Oil finances the war; the war provides access to oil.10</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Globalization, the worldwide movement toward economic, financial, trade, and communications integration, has impacted public health significantly. Technology and economic interdependence allow diseases to spread globally at rapid speeds. Experts believe that the increase in international travel and commerce, including the increasingly global nature of food handling, processing, and sales contribute to the spread of emerging infectious diseases.47 Increased global trade has also brought more and more people into contact with zoonosis -diseases that originated in animals before jumping to humans. For example, in 2003, the monkeypox virus entered the U.S. through imported Gambian giant rats sold in the nation’s under-regulated exotic pet trade. The rats infected pet prairie dogs, which passed the virus along to humans.48 International smuggling of birds, brought into the U.S. without undergoing inspection and/or quarantine, is of particular concern to public health experts who worry that it may be a pathway for the H5N1 “bird flu” virus to enter the country.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">It is a considerable comfort and undoubtedly a key to our survival that, so far, the main lines of defense against this threat have not depended on explicit policies or organized efforts. In the long course of evolution, the human body has developed physical barriers and a biochemical immune system whose sophistication and effectiveness exceed anything we could design or as yet even fully understand. But evolution is a sword that cuts both ways: New diseases emerge, while old diseases mutate and adapt. Throughout history, there have been epidemics during which human immunity has broken down on an epic scale. An infectious agent believed to have been the plague bacterium killed an estimated 20 million people over a four-year period in the fourteenth century, including nearly one-quarter of Western Europe's population at the time. Since its recognized appearance in 1981, some 20 variations of the HIV virus have infected an estimated 29.4 million worldwide, with 1.5 million people currently dying of AIDS each year. Malaria, tuberculosis, and cholera - once thought to be under control - are now making a comeback. As we enter the twenty-first century, changing conditions have enhanced the potential for widespread contagion. The rapid growth rate of the total world population, the unprecedented freedom of movement across international borders, and scientific advances that expand the capability for the deliberate manipulation of pathogens are all cause for worry that the problem might be greater in the future than it has ever been in the past. The threat of infectious pathogens is not just an issue of public health, but a fundamental security problem for the species as a whole. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Global inequality between richest and poorest countries and between richest and poorest people has been increasing significantly over the past 200 years (Jolly, 2006)]. There has been an enormous divergence of growth rates between rich and poor countries in the last decades with only the East Asian ‘Tigers’ sustaining an increase in that time (L. Taylor, 2006). Even in the richest country, the US, there is increasing disparity and poverty (Center For American Progress, 2007). Despite many years of poverty alleviation programs by international institutions and the international development industry, over the past two decades income inequality has increased in almost all countries, with only marginal income increases of the poorest earners (International Monetary Fund, 2007) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b) (L. Taylor, 2006). Approximately 1.1 billion people, most of them in rural areas and dependent on agriculture, grazing, and hunting, earned less than one dollar a day of income in 2001 (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b). In 2006 the “two dollars a day” working poor decreased worldwide to 47 %, from 55 % in 1996. But 1.4 billion workers and their families were living below the “two dollars a day” poverty line, while 507 million workers and their families earned less than one dollar a day. An estimated 20 % of the worlds youth, more than 200 million persons, live on less than one dollar a day, while approximately half survive on less than two dollars a day. Indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities are disproportionally represented among the worlds poorest (United Nations, 2007a). Looking at a broader measure, the distribution of household wealth is even more concentrated than the world distribution of income, or the distribution of wealth within almost every country. Based on data for the year 2000, within country the top 10 % of wealth holders typically own approximately 50 % of the wealth, while for the world as a whole the share of the top 10 % was 85 %. The US and Canada, with only 6 % of the global population held 34 % of the world’s wealth, Europe 30 %, and the rich Asia Pacific group of countries, 24 %. The remaining 12 % was shared by Africa, Central and South America, China, India and other Asia Pacific countries. Of the top global 1 % of wealth holders, 39 % were found in North America, 26 % in Europe and 32 % in the rich Asia Pacific countries (Davies et al., 2008). Low levels of wealth relative to income, such as are found in Africa, Latin America, and the low income Asia Pacific countries, are particularly troublesome, as it means lower levels of socio economic security, and access to fewer financial opportunities and resources (Davies et al., 2008). Moreover, the deregulation of global financial markets has resulted in significantly lower taxation on capital, whereas the tax share of labor income has been rising steadily for years, increasing disparity still more (United Nations, 2007a). This concentration of wealth in those who own and control financial, labor, property, and natural resources, continues to rise, leading to a concentration of power in the hands of an unaccountable few.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation, as shown by the thousands of cases of social and communal violence that occurs daily in the nation.  Every year, some 20,000 people are killed by others, and additional 20,000 folks kill themselves. Add to this the nonlethal violence that Americans daily inflict on each other, and we begin to see the tracings of a nation immersed in a fever of violence.  But, as remarkable, and harrowing as this level and degree of violence is, it is, by far, not the most violent features of living in the midst of the American empire.  We live, equally immersed, and to a deeper degree, in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging &quot;structural' violence, of a kind that destroys human life with a breathtaking ruthlessness. Former Massachusetts prison official and writer Dr. James Gilligan observes: By &quot;structural violence&quot; I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted by those who are above them. Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) are a function of the class structure; and that structure is itself a product of society's collective human choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society. … every fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths; and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews over a six-year period. This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world. --(Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New York: Vintage, 1996), 192.)  This form of violence, not covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected media, is invisible to us and because of its invisibility, all the more insidious. How dangerous is it--really? Gilligan notes:  [E]very fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths; and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews over a six-year period. This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world. [Gilligan, p. 196]  Worse still, in a thoroughly capitalist society, much of that violence became internalized, turned back on the Self, because, in a society based on the priority of wealth, those who own nothing are taught to loathe themselves, as if something is inherently wrong with themselves, instead of the social order that promotes this self-loathing. This intense self-hatred was often manifested in familial violence as when the husband beats the wife, the wife smacks the son, and the kids fight each other.  This vicious, circular, and invisible violence, unacknowledged by the corporate media, uncriticized in substandard educational systems, and un- understood by the very folks who suffer in its grips, feeds on the spectacular and more common forms of violence that the system makes damn sure -that we can recognize and must react to it.  This fatal and systematic violence may be called The War on the Poor.  It is found in every country, submerged beneath the sands of history, buried, yet ever present, as omnipotent as death. In the struggles over the commons in Europe, when the peasants struggled and lost their battles for their commonal lands (a precursor to similar struggles throughout Africa and the Americas), this violence was sanctified, by church and crown, as the 'Divine Right of Kings' to the spoils of class battle. Scholars Frances Fox-Piven and Richard A Cloward wrote, in The New Class War (Pantheon, 1982/1985):  They did not lose because landowners were immune to burning and preaching and rioting. They lost because the usurpations of owners were regularly defended by the legal authority and the armed force of the state. It was the state that imposed increased taxes or enforced the payment of increased rents, and evicted or jailed those who could not pay the resulting debts. It was the state that made lawful the appropriation by landowners of the forests, streams, and commons, and imposed terrifying penalties on those who persisted in claiming the old rights to these resources. It was the state that freed serfs or emancipated sharecroppers only to leave them landless. (52)  The &quot;Law&quot;, then, was a tool of the powerful to protect their interests, then, as now. It was a weapon against the poor and impoverished, then, as now.  It punished retail violence, while turning a blind eye to the wholesale violence daily done by their class masters.  The law was, and is, a tool of state power, utilized to protect the status quo, no matter how oppressive that status was, or is.  Systems are essentially ways of doing things that have concretized into tradition, and custom, without regard to the rightness of those ways. No system that causes this kind of harm to people should be allowed to remain, based solely upon its time in existence. Systems must serve life, or be discarded as a threat and a danger to life.  Such systems must pass away, so that their great and terrible violence passes away with them.</span><br />

<strong>Growth kills cultural diversity and genetic diversity – extinction</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Many cultures, traditions, languages (R. G. Gordon, Jr., 2005) (UNESCO), and ethnic groups (Survival International, 2007) are increasingly threatened with extinction due to the spread of western style development, facilitated by convenient, inexpensive transportation, the penetration of international mass media, and religious proselytizing, (Survival International, 2007) (Latouche, 1996). Loss of cultures is also arising from environmental causes – for example habitat loss in the Amazon river basin, and from the inundation of coastal regions such as Bangladesh, or the Pacific Island States. There is even evidence of the loss of human genetic diversity over the last millennium (Töpf, Gilbert, Fleischer, &amp; Hoelzel, 2007). Diminishing human diversity and the loss of other models of being and knowledge, is eliminating potential opportunities for learning, for different life, and for the answers we may need to solve our crises and to ensure human survival. </span><br />

 <strong>Carriers fail and kill leadership – 3 reasons</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The threat of potential adversary long-range weapon systems does not spell the end for surface-combatant warships, the aircraft carrier, or the amphibious expeditionary MAGTF. All remain viable and important fighting components of the Fleet. However, naval warfare has passed the aforementioned point of inflection in Fleet and expeditionary force development. As in the mid-to-late 1930s, a balanced approach toward risk and adaptability remain the two cardinal principles of force planning. 2 With deeply constrained naval shipbuilding budgets unfolding, the nation and Navy today cannot afford to repeat the example of pre-World War II naval planners, who designed the Iowa - and later Montana -class battleships to fight and win the next Jutland- or Trafalgar-like fleet-to-fleet battle when technology and naval warfare already had evolved well beyond that point. Once the centerpiece of the Fleet, by 1942 those ships were a supporting asset to the range and striking power of the fast carrier and naval aviation. Now the large, legacy supercarrier finds itself at a similar technology-driven inflection point. Even with aerial refueling, the carrier and its strike aviation are outranged and can be overpowered by the combination of long-range surveillance and targeting, antiship ballistic and cruise missiles, and other air, sea, and submarine strike capabilities. The Fleet’s significant progress and improvements in layered defenses erode and mitigate some of those threats, but cannot overcome them all. As difficult as it is to acknowledge, the role of large carrier force and embarked naval aviation has come full circle; it is back to a supporting role in the surface battle force. The new naval point of inflection creates both dilemmas and opportunities for the Navy and Marine Corps team. It is time to reconsider the capability investment, total cost, and construction of an all- Ford -class carrier force, and instead embrace the development of a carrier mix—a few large legacy 100,000-ton nuclear-powered Nimitz - or newer Ford -class carriers coupled with the development of a new, smaller short take-off/vertical landing (STOVL) strike carrier (CVSS). </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">China is also strengthening its ability to attack US aircraft carriers at long distances using anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBM). Since the mid-90s, China has modernized its submarine force, deployed anti-ship cruise missiles on its ships, and introduced modern Russian fighter-bombers equipped with anti-ship missiles.37 However, all of these weapon systems are constrained by their limited range and limited ability to penetrate the protection afforded by the anti-submarine warfare and anti-air warfare capacities of US carrier strike groups.38 In contrast, ASBMs have the potential to destroy US carriers before they even enter the theater of operations around Taiwan – a potential “game-changer” in a military conflict.39 Based on a survey of Chinese technical and doctrinal publications, a number of US non-profit and government institutions claim that China has had significant success in its pursuit of an ASBM capacity. Although there has been no official acknowledgment by Chinese authorities, nor any known test of ASBM assets, an initial capacity is estimated to be available in 2010.40 The Chinese ASBM capacity is based on the existing DF-21 class of medium-range ballistic missiles with a range of 1,500–2,000 km.41 The first anti-ship variant of this missile will likely have a comparable range, while future models may use “boost-glide trajectory” capabilities to allow ranges of 3,000–8,000 km by 2020.42 Targeting data for ASBM launches could be provided by over-the-horizon (OTH) radar systems and different types of satellites. China already operates an OTH radar with a range of up to 3,000 km, allowing it to monitor ship movements in a wide arc between Japan and the Philippines.43 China is also developing satellites that can detect carriers using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or by tracking their electronic emissions.44 Once an ASBM is launched against the approximate position of an aircraft carrier, an onboard SAR system would provide mid-course guidance from an altitude of around 80 km to the missile’s maneuverable reentry vehicle (MARV).45 In order to specifically target and destroy key carrier infrastructure, including “carrier-borne planes, the control tower and other easily damaged and vital positions,”46 terminal guidance to the conventional warheads would be provided by a combination of millimeter wave radar and infrared seekers.47 The consequences of this development are significant. ASBMs offer an unprecedented and relatively low cost surgical strike capability against aircraft carriers, to which there are only limited and risky countermeasures available. Because of the precision of ASBM warheads, it is not necessary to sink an aircraft carrier to achieve a “mission kill,” allowing China to strike at carriers while avoiding the risk of escalation that would most certainly incorporate the sinking of an aircraft carrier and the resulting deaths of up to 5,000 US sailors.48 Additionally, ASBM systems appear to be both effective and highly cost-efficient: assuming a relatively low success rate of 25%, only 4 ASBMs, costing between 40 and 80 million USD in total, would suffice to disable a US aircraft carrier. 49 Countermeasures to ASBMs are either limited in their effectiveness or bear risks of escalation. Direct defense is hard to achieve, given the extremely high speed of ASBMs and the ability to use mid-course maneuvers to change the trajectory. A further disadvantage for a ship defending against an ASBM attack is the limited number of ABM missiles carried onboard. So far, only 75 SM-3 ABMs, to be carried by 18 destroyers and cruisers, have been ordered for the US Navy.50 If a carrier is augmented with two ships carrying six SM-3 each, only 12 ASBMs could currently be defended against in a best-case scenario, as reloading at sea is not possible.51 While defense against ASBMs in flight is difficult, preemptive attacks against the launch platforms and C4ISR infrastructure are risky alternatives. To destroy the mobile launchers, which could be stationed throughout much of Eastern China, or the supporting radar systems, air strikes might be necessary against targets over 1,000 km inland. However, executing such attacks against the depth of the Chinese mainland would be a difficult and highly escalatory option. When Chinese ASBMs become effective to a range of 2,000 km, US carriers might have to operate at distances far from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, such that carrier-based fighters such as the F/A-18 or the future Joint Strike Fighter could hardly enter the fight.52 Using ballistic missiles against US naazval and land-based air power, China can substantially reduce the volume of air power available to the US to deter or repel Chinese military action against Taiwan. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review acknowledges the threat posed inter alia by Chinese ballistic missiles and has suggested an increased reliance on submarine-based weapons, development of armed naval UAVs and new cruise missiles for long-range strikes, as well as strengthened active and passive defenses for overseas US air bases.53 However, until the US has fielded these and other effective countermeasures to the Chinese ballistic missile threat, China’s anti-access strategy may be successful in deterring US intervention in a military conflict over Taiwan. </span><br />

<strong>Extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Cheong, Senior Writer @ the Strait Times, 2k</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Ching, Senior Writer at the Strait Times, “No one gains in a war over Taiwan,” June 25th, Lexis)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -horror of horrors -raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China, 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilization.</span><br />

<strong>Costs DA – Chinese are aware we’re dependent on a carrier strategy, forces us to spend massive amounts to protect against their missiles, externally destroys our Navy.</strong><br />
<strong>Grady 11</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (Franz-Stefan, “Aircraft Carriers and Chinese Missiles: Time to Rethink the U.S. Naval Doctrine” January 21, 2011, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ewi.info/aircraft-carriers-and-chinese-missiles-time-rethink-us-naval-doctrine" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewi.info/aircraft-carriers-and-chinese-missiles-time-rethink-us-naval-doctrine</a> MGE)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">The technology that the Chinese have developed and are employing in their DF-21 D missile system has increased their probability of being able to employ a salvo of missiles to be able to hit a maneuvering target. Dorsett consented that the U.S. Navy underestimated the capacity of the Chinese military to develop a land-based anti-ship ballistic missile that could penetrate the layered defense of an aircraft carrier group. The sinking of a single carrier will cost the lives of thousands of young Americans, not to mention the symbolism of such a disaster amidst talks of American decline and cuts in defense spending. For students of warfare, this development is nothing new. The Chinese military eventually developed countermeasures to deter the most formidable threat (i.e., the aircraft carrier) in a future crisis over Taiwan. It is a classic example of a cost imposing strategy--a strategy in which the adversary is incentivized to spend substantially more money and resources on defense than the attacker spends on offense. It works like this. The Chinese military essentially is exploiting the strict adherence of the United States to a naval doctrine based on the carrier by indirectly imposing costs, i.e., costs that the United States Navy is imposing on itself to retain supremacy. Whether a missile like the DF-21 D can penetrate carrier defenses (over which there is some controversy) misses a key point: The mere presence of anti-ship missiles imposes a heavy cost on U.S. Navy offensive capabilities as well as on its budget. Aircraft carriers will be in service at least until 2050 and constitute the main U.S. instrument with which to project global power. In a sense, its defense is tantamount to defending U.S. global hegemony. They are as much of a political symbol of U.S. dominance as they are an actual means used to project American power around the world. Scrapping the carrier fleet is therefore out of the question. Hence, the U.S. Navy is forced to deploy an enormous defensive perimeter built around the carrier. Today, each aircraft carrier group fields 24-long range fighter interceptors supported by four early warning radar aircraft, four jamming aircraft, four tanker aircraft, between two and four Ticonderoga (CG-47) or Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) destroyers, cruisers, a SSN-688 class submarine as an underwater escort, and 16 planes scanning the area for enemy submarine threats to counter anti-ship missiles. Out of 90 aircrafts, only 34 remain for actual offensive capabilities--not a very cost efficient way of doing business. With the ongoing advancement of missile technology, it will become increasingly more expensive and difficult to destroy any missiles before they are launched. For example, the cost of modernizing 84 Aegis cruisers and destroyers to counter missiles such as the DF-21 D will be about $10 billion according to Congressional testimonies. China and Russia are developing jointly an improved missile system with an increased range of 200 km, making it impossible to destroy the missile before it is launched in both the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Taiwan (the two main hotspots for a future naval confrontation involving carriers) because of the inability of current U.S. defense systems to react in time. In the future, defending a carrier group will lead to an increase in marginal costs in terms of launching air strikes, a decrease of operational mobility due to over-cautious protection, and a diversion of resources from offensive to defensive capabilities. China and Iran certainly anticipate rapid countermeasures and currently are trying to diversify their weapons portfolio. Even if the United States succeeds in countering the DF-21 D, however, its adversaries already will have succeeded in imposing tremendous extra costs on the United States Navy and scored a victory of sorts. How can the United States Navy reduce extra costs? One idea would be that a reduction in size of the aircraft carrier battle groups as well as outsourcing certain duties (i.e., air strikes) to submarines and cruise missiles would reduce the exposure of carriers. For example, the capacity of 34 combat aircrafts available for sorties in an aircraft carrier strike force certainly could be matched by an Ohio class Trident nuclear submarine and its 154 cruise missiles. A doctrinal shift away from the aircraft carrier also would potentially discourage U.S. competitors to continue working on single carrier counter measures such as anti-ship missiles and split their resources to build adequate cruise missile defenses, for example. The institutional focus and infrastructural outlays devoted to maintaining the elaborate Great Wall protecting America's carrier fleet is ultimately an ill-fated extension of an encrusted Maginot Line. The United States as the dominant power must apply various strategies and weapons systems to retain its global standing whereas China as the ostensibly weaker player only has to channel its resources towards very specific objectives, deterring U.S. naval forces in East Asia. What these different strategies imply for the overall strategic situations remains to be seen. However one thing is certain: for the U.S. to continue defending the aircraft carrier is not only detrimental in terms of monetary and other resources but will also allow other nations to catch up faster with U.S. military might.</span><br />

<strong>Carriers cause asymmetric attacks</strong><br />
<strong>Patch 10</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (John, Commander US Navy, “Fortress at Sea?

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Conventional threats notwithstanding, carriers are also vulnerable to unconventional or asymmetric threats. 5 These potentially include terrorism, sabotage, infiltration, denial and subterfuge (information operations [IO], including cyber and psychological operations), interdiction, and homeport or logistics hub attacks, among others. While many admirals discount such threats outright, again, one need only recall the shock and confusion following the 9/11 attacks. One reason these threats make military leaders uncomfortable is that they are vague and indiscriminate. Another is that few weapons in the Carrier Strike Group arsenal can directly address them. Indeed, the strike group's inherent capabilities are usually irrelevant against asymmetric threats. Finally, since an unconventional adversary may seek any of these means-and perhaps yet unknown methods-to achieve a mission kill (i.e., not necessarily a catastrophic kill), leaders often swear off as impractical the vouchsafing of every potential carrier vulnerability. Just as operational art demands a rigorous assessment of adversary center of gravity and critical vulnerabilities, one cannot assume away the enemy's ability to do the same. The 2006 Israeli experience in Lebanon is a recent example of a hybrid conflict, wherein an unconventional enemy knew its opponent well, exploited technology to defeat its armor, directed a sophisticated IO campaign to manage perceptions, and threatened the homeland with incessant rocket and missile barrages. Gone are the days when the most serious unconventional threats were ignorant, lightly armed fanatics conducting improvised attacks on hardened targets. As such, it is a relatively simple task with readily available information to evaluate the carrier as a system, with critical elements of varying dependency, many of which could degrade mission capability if assailed. Admittedly, adversaries require global reach and significant capability to threaten some elements over the longer-term, but a creative opponent could still seriously limit a carrier's effectiveness, at least temporarily. Any neophyte can generate a basic list of forward-deployed military unit vulnerability: communications, logistics/lines of communication, crew readiness/morale, mobility, etc. Because the CSG cannot protect everything, the aggressor has the advantage in target selection and surprise. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">A nuclear attack by terrorists will be much more critical than Hiroshima and Nagazaki, even if -- and this is far from certain -- the weapons used are less harmful than those used then, Japan, at the time, with no knowledge of nuclear technology, had no choice but to capitulate. Today, the technology is a secret for nobody. So far, except for the two bombs dropped on Japan, nuclear weapons have been used only to threaten. Now we are at a stage where they can be detonated. This completely changes the rules of the game. We have reached a point where anticipatory measures can determine the course of events. Allegations of a terrorist connection can be used to justify anticipatory measures, including the invasion of a sovereign state like Iraq. As it turned out, these allegations, as well as the allegation that Saddam was harbouring WMD, proved to be unfounded. What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? Even if it fails, it would further exacerbate the negative features of the new and frightening world in which we are now living. Societies would close in on themselves, police measures would be stepped up at the expense of human rights, tensions between civilisations and religions would rise and ethnic conflicts would proliferate. It would also speed up the arms race and develop the awareness that a different type of world order is imperative if humankind is to survive. But the still more critical scenario is if the attack succeeds. This could lead to a third world war, from which no one will emerge victorious. Unlike a conventional war which ends when one side triumphs over another, this war will be without winners and losers. When nuclear pollution infects the whole planet, we will all be losers.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Hyperbole about nanoweapons can have dangerous consequences if it seizes high-level politicians. It is particularly problematic, however, if military goals of potential opponents are presented incorrectly. This was the case in an overview book, written by an author from the US Department of Defense, on the Chinese armed forces. Under the headline ‘‘Nanotechnology Weapons’’ he stated that a Chinese general advertised asymmetric attacks against the USA with ‘‘ant robots’’ which would be pre-deployed covertly. When looking up the original article (interestingly, the English translation was published by the same US author), however, it turns out that it gave a report to a Chinese audience about a study from the US RAND corporation on military micro robots in which such systems were mainly discussed for missions by US armed forces against their opponents [6, Section 3.4, 16]. Nevertheless, military planners in China and elsewhere will be impressed by US investment in military nanotechnology. Whenever a new system will have been made ready in the USA and shown its military utility, competitors and potential opponents will develop similar systems. There will be exports and proliferation, many not limited by export controls. Action– reaction cycles will occur in deployment, but also already at the stages of research and development</span><br />

The decline of international trade will undermine a powerful source of common interest. Further, artificial intelligence will displace skilled as well as unskilled labor. A world system based on wage labor, transnational capitalism and global markets will necessarily give way. We imagine that a golden age is possible, but we don't know how to organize one. As global capitalism retreats, it will leave behind a world dominated by politics, and possibly feudal concentrations of wealth and power. Economic insecurity, and fears for the material and moral future of humankind may lead to the rise of demagogic and intemperate national leaders. With almost two hundred sovereign nations, each struggling to create a new economic and social order, perhaps the most predictable outcome is chaos: shifting alignments, displaced populations, power struggles, ethnic conflicts inflamed by demagogues, class conflicts, land disputes, etc. Small and underdeveloped nations will be more than ever dependent on the major powers for access to technology, and more than ever vulnerable to sophisticated forms of control or subversion, or to outright domination. Competition among the leading technological powers for the political loyalty of clients might imply reversion to some form of nationalistic imperialism. Competition for control of newly-exploitable resources on Earth and in space may generate dissension and hostility even between democracies, erstwhile friends and allies, while providing an overt rationale for deploying competitive military forces. If nuclear weapons remain limited in number, advanced nanotechnology could facilitate extensive civil defense construction, and provide active defense and counterforce weapons, undermining the nuclear &quot;balance of terror&quot; and creating the appearance of a possibility of victory in a war between major powers. From a purely military perspective, in the absence of a &quot;balance of terror,&quot; a confrontation between more or less equally advanced terrestrial nanotechnology powers could be unstable to preemption — in both of the traditional senses: Arms race instability. A large imbalance in deployed hardware could allow one side to strike with impunity, and even a few-to-one imbalance could be enough to provide assurance of victory. If military production is based on a self-replicating capital base with a short generation time, the danger of falling behind on an exponential curve, or the opportunity to trump, would create unprecedentedly strong pressures to initiate or join and to maintain or gain the lead in a quantitative arms race. Unprecedentedly large masses of military hardware could be produced in an unprecedentedly short time. First strike instability. Even if two sides are evenly matched, high levels of deployed armaments may be militarily unstable, in that a surprise attack could perhaps decimate the opposing force before it could respond. This is especially likely in co-occupied environments, i.e. space, the oceans, and along land lines of confrontation. Forces based in protected areas may remain survivable, but serious competitors would not cede vast stretches of &quot;no man's land&quot; to enemy control in advance of a fight, and whoever strikes first in the co-occupied environments may gain an irreversible advantage. The greater the density of interpenetrating forces, the shorter the strike time. Thus a crisis becomes progressively less stable as a buildup proceeds. A perfect balance of technical and material resources is unrealistic in any case, which leads to a new type of strategic instability: Early advantage instability. If one has an early lead in a replicator-based crisis arms buildup, the fact that a competitor may have somewhat faster replicators or superior weaponry, or may have access to a larger primary resource base, provides another strong stimulus to an early first strike. Moreover, it is unlikely that one actually knows the performance of an enemy's weapons or production base, particularly after a long peace. Thus, a runaway nanotechnic arms race may be a race to nowhere; there may be no further island of stable military balance out there, even if we could manage to avoid war along the way. </span><br />

Since 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) has required federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions and provide the public a meaningful opportunity to participate in agency decision making. The proper application of NEPA ensures that agencies make well-informed decisions that are supported by a robust consideration of the environmental effects of both the proposed action and alternatives to that action, the cumulative effects of the proposed action and its alternatives, and concerns raised by the public. The past eight years have witnessed an assault on NEPA that has eroded the application of the law to the point where major federal actions with significant environmental effects are taken without any environmental analysis. First, some agencies have improperly shifted the application of NEPA to later stages of decision making. CEQ regulations state that agencies should integrate the NEPA process at the earliest time possible; the regulations also expressly state that the adoption of “formal plans” is major federal action subject to NEPA. However, agencies have not heeded this mandate, with one agency (the Forest Service) going as far as seeking to exempt planning documents entirely from NEPA analysis. By misconstruing NEPA to mean that an agency does not have to conduct a NEPA analysis until narrow, site-specific actions are taken, agencies have effectively exempted themselves from NEPA’s provisions at the decision stage. Moreover, some agencies fail to apply NEPA until after they have entered binding contracts that create a financial incentive for the agency to go forward with an action regardless of its environmental impacts. Second, agencies have improperly expanded the use of categorical exclusions (CEs) to exempt categories of activities that may have significant environmental effects from environmental review. A categorical exclusion is “a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment”, and therefore do not require preparation of environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. CEs are approved through an agency’s NEPA implementing procedures or, in one case, through legislation. If extraordinary circumstances exist that may cause the proposed action to have a significant effect on the environment, that action cannot be categorically excluded from NEPA analysis. When used appropriately, CEs can save agencies time and resources, and avoid duplicative analysis for actions that will not have a significant effect on the environment. However, when there are substantive questions about whether an action’s impacts are significant, the public deserves the opportunity to be part of the process for evaluating potential impacts. Over the past eight years, agencies and Congress have expanded the approval and application of CEs. No longer are CEs applied to only discrete actions that do not have a significant environmental effect; instead, CEs have been expanded to include broad categories of actions that should receive a detailed look by the agencies and the public because these actions may have significant direct or cumulative impacts on the environment. Also, some agencies have failed to provide for extraordinary circumstances that would limit the application of CEs to environmentally insignificant actions. Thus, potentially significant actions are approved with minimal to no environmental review or public input. Reinforcing CEQ’s Leadership Role in the CE Process On September 19, 2006, CEQ published draft guidance designed to aid agencies in the establishment, revision, and use of CEs. This guidance has not been finalized. The next Administration should issue final guidance that will reinforce CEQ’s leadership role in the CE process and reflect the changes suggested in comments submitted jointly by over 100 local and national environmental organizations.1 Specifically, the final guidance should, inter alia, (1) require agencies to consult with CEQ early in the drafting of the proposed CE and at minimum before the proposed CE is published in the Federal Register, (2) require agencies to provide CEQ with a comprehensive administrative record supporting the new or revised CE, (3) require that agencies make information supporting CEs available to the public, and (4) instruct agencies to avoid establishing CEs for activities likely to generate public opposition regarding effects on the human environment. Responsible Official: CEQ Chair Review of CEs that raise significant concerns The next Administration should carefully review the CEs that raise significant concerns, and retract those that include actions that may individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the environment, thus requiring environmental review. </span><br />

A distinguishing feature of any society is its prevailing assumptions about its relationship to the Earth. The history of cultures--especially of religions--reveals a great number of cosmologies, the perceived relationships of people to their planetary environment. Today the survival of living species may depend first, upon the degree to which mankind's concept of its environmental situation corresponds to biophysical realities and second, upon what humans value, and how these values are expressed in relation to these realities. Archeology has recorded the failure of societies that have misconceived the requirements for environmental sustainability. During the earlier centuries of human history the impact of society on its environment was relatively light and local. If an environment, for whatever reason, became unsustainable, people could often move on to new lands, often displacing or destroying the original inhabitants. When degradation of the environment was slow or scarcely perceptible, the consequences of its decline often were not felt until they were irreversible. Where human numbers were small relative to space, migration permitted impaired environments to recover, at least partially. But many areas of the Earth have never recovered from the degradation of centuries-long misuse, and still more are headed toward impoverishment. In a world filled with people and settlements, the option of migration is increasingly unavailable. Recognition of narrowing environmental options has led in recent decades to conservation practices assisted by the growth of science, to the comparative measurement of environmental change, and to forecasts of the probable consequences of present trends. The conservation of natural resources movement has had a paradoxical effect upon human perceptions of environmental realities. While the conservation movement contributed both to the emergence of applied ecology and public environmental concern, many conservationists rejected environmentalism (often called preservationism) as uneconomical, unrealistic and anti-social. Economy and efficiency in the wise use of resources has been the essence of &quot;conservation,&quot; which sees the environment as infinitely manageable--capable of sustained productivity under the guidance of experts knowledgeable of science. In this respect, conservationism [*236] is fundamentally consistent with the Western worldview, especially that which prevailed during the era of U.S. Progressivism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n82" rel="nofollow">n82</a></span> Environmentalism emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century from a convergence of changing perceptions of the human condition in fields as diverse as ecology, public health, demography, climatology, cosmology, and ethics. When its true dimensions, assumptions, and expectations are understood, environmentalism is, as Robert Nisbet observed, revolutionary. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n83" rel="nofollow">n83</a></span> Its effect upon human society is comparable to the changed views of reality inherent in the Copernican cosmic revolution in the seventeenth century and the Darwinian evolution revolution in the nineteenth century. To some, this conclusion may seem to be an exaggerated estimate of the influence of environmentalism and its future prospects. Following initial successes of environmental protection efforts, there has been in many countries (including the United States) an anti-government reaction that has sometimes been violent. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n84" rel="nofollow">n84</a></span> It is doubtful that in the long run the &quot;green backlash&quot; will prevail. Its angry proponents are chiefly natural resources industries, land developers and speculators, libertarians, and their allies in public office. Still the counter-intuitive behavior of social systems makes any forecast of the future uncertain. Nevertheless there are ascertainable, measurable trends in today's world that strongly suggest the impending negative impact of powerful coercive environmental events upon human society in the twenty-first century. Adherence to principles like those expressed in NEPA may become more a matter of necessity than of voluntary choice. The way in which people and their governments respond to the prospect of these coercions will shape the future of the world. The timing of effective response is equally important. The longer the delay, the more [*237] difficult the task and the greater the possibility of irremediable damage. Because the future of the world in the twenty-first century cannot be foreseen, we can only conjecture the true location of NEPA on the trajectory of history. I offer the following assessment of the significance of NEPA, fully realizing that, at least in the short run, the world is capable of unpredictable turns. NEPA is most fully understood as a national policy for henceforward into the future. &quot;Environment&quot; may be understood as a surrogate term for a concept more comprehensive than is usually appreciated. Our language tends to lag behind new insights. Among our most persistent and pervasive misconceptions is the artificial dichotomy of economy/ecology. Their true relationship might be suggested by the time-space concept in physics. The concepts of ecology and economy are not the same--they are distinguishable, but, paradoxically, also inseparable.<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1266374593287&amp;returnToKey=20_T8580560845&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.808858.1203594548#n85" rel="nofollow">n85</a></span> In mundane reality there are obvious conflicts within and between the &quot;domains&quot; of economy and the environment. Yet both these aspects of our world are in actuality inextricable--separable by cultural convention and for analytic purposes. In reality they should have a common inclusive name. Achievement of a national policy for the environment requires awareness of the ecology/economy interrelationship, of the direction toward which the world appears to be moving, and a growth of consensus on the kind of future that is desirable and sustainable. A national policy for the future of the environment cannot be achieved in isolation from other major societal issues. Issues of population, material growth, property rights and obligations, and basic social equities involve choices which many people would prefer not to make. But the world today is not a &quot;new age of Aquarius,&quot; free from ultimate accountability to nature, if not to humanity. Regardless of what we may deny or resist, our society will in one way or another be compelled to accommodate its behaviors [*238] to the inexorable workings of the world. But apocalypse need not be a preordained outcome for a society that marshals and moves its moral, material, intellectual, and organizational capabilities toward attainment of a preferred and sustainable future. IX. AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE The National Environmental Policy Act may be seen as a charter and agenda to guide this nation toward rational strategies for coping with the critical environmental problems that are present and growing. The United States has the material and intellectual capabilities for setting a non-hegemonic example for the world. Whether it can generate a collective moral purpose to do so remains uncertain. As individuals, there is little that people can do to reverse destructive socio-ecological trends. Voluntary local initiatives may help where there is a sense of community purpose. But our fundamental environmental problems transcend manmade boundaries and require solutions commensurate with the problems, which are increasingly seen to be transnational, even global. The 1968 Biosphere Conference and the 1972 and 1992 U.N. conferences on the environment testify to an international recognition of mankind's environmental predicament. Yet in a world governed by nations, national action is necessary, not only for each nation, but for international cooperation. Action on any major social issue requires a credible collective purpose, catalytic leadership, and popular receptivity. There is strong evidence that the last of these--public support for environmental action--already exists. A goal-directed agenda is necessary to focus and activate social effort, for without such a codification of purpose, there can be no concerted action. Translation of social purpose into action is a function of leadership. To cope with the environmental predicament of mankind, leadership must be national and participatory, involving all sectors of society, but with an indispensable responsibility in government which is the affirmingand coordinative institution for nationwide and international effort. For the United States, NEPA provides a comprehensive agenda for the environmental future. NEPA creates a foundation for a unifying national effort and legitimizes its goals and principles as [*239] national policy. Beyond NEPA, specific, targeted action programs are needed to achieve its intent. NEPA may be regarded, in effect, as a constitution for the environment--principles to guide the nation toward an enhanced quality of life and an enduring environmental future. </span><br />

Julien, The Guardian, World is facing a natural resources crisis worse than financial crunch, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/29/climatechange-endangeredhabitats" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/29/climatechange-endangeredhabitats</a></span> <strong>we do not endorse gendered language</strong><br />
The world is heading for an &quot;ecological credit crunch&quot; far worse than the current financial crisis because humans are over-using the natural resources of the planet, an international study warns today. The Living Planet report calculates that humans are using 30% more resources than the Earth can replenish each year, which is leading to deforestation, degraded soils, polluted air and water, and dramatic declines in numbers of fish and other species. As a result, we are running up an ecological debt of $4tr (£2.5tr) to $4.5tr every year - double the estimated losses made by the world's financial institutions as a result of the credit crisis - say the report's authors, led by the conservation group WWF, formerly the World Wildlife Fund. The figure is based on a UN report which calculated the economic value of services provided by ecosystems destroyed annually, such as diminished rainfall for crops or reduced flood protection. The problem is also getting worse as populations and consumption keep growing faster than technology finds new ways of expanding what can be produced from the natural world. This had led the report to predict that by 2030, if nothing changes, [hu]mankind would need two planets to sustain its lifestyle. &quot;The recent downturn in the global economy is a stark reminder of the consequences of living beyond our means,&quot; says James Leape, WWF International's director general. &quot;But the possibility of financial recession pales in comparison to the looming ecological credit crunch.&quot; The report continues: &quot;We have only one planet. Its capacity to support a thriving diversity of species, humans included, is large but fundamentally limited. When human demand on this capacity exceeds what is available - when we surpass ecological limits - we erode the health of the Earth's living systems. Ultimately this loss threatens human well-being.&quot; Speaking yesterday in London, the report's authors also called for politicians to mount a huge international response in line with the multibillion-dollar rescue plan for the economy. &quot;They now need to turn their collective action to a far more pressing concern and that's the survival of all life on planet Earth,&quot; said Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the president of WWF International. </span><br />
