Contention 1: Immobility
Investment decisions for transportation infrastructure have systematically removed disabled populations from society by denying them of their mobility
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">AAPD, 2012</span>(The American Association of People With Disabilities, “Equity in Transportation for People with Disabilities”, May 23, http://www.infrastructureusa.org/equity-in-transportation-for-people-with-disabilities/)
Transportation and mobility…very uneven progress.

These transportation systems were designed without consideration of people with disabilities’ perspective. Fixed-routes and times are regulated to allow society to exist free from contact with these individuals
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Langan, 2001</span>(Celeste, Associate Professor of English at the University of California Berkeley, “Mobility Disability”, Public Culture, Vol. 13 No. 3, Fall, Project Muse)
To think about mobility…the mass-transit dependent.

This systematic exclusion of people with disabilities from transportation thought forms what Ranciere calls the police order. The police order distributes roles in society and excludes people from participation while claiming “everyone is included”
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Biesta 10</span> (Gert, @ the Stirling Institute of Education, “A New Logic of Emancipation: The Methodology of Jacques Ranciere,” Educational Theory, 60.1, TH)
Subjectification—and this is the second point…any other speaking being.

The police order defines people with disabilities as “flawed bodies” that must be eliminated
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hughes</span>, 200<span style="font-size: 12pt;">2</span>(Bill, Professor of Social Policy at the University Glasgow, Disability Studies, p. 60-62)
The dominant framework for understanding…into a politics of genocide.

This conception of disabled bodies as flawed causes the police to exercise the power of life and death at the level of nation-states by depicting every war as a “war for survival”
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Elden, 2002</span>(Stuart, Professor of Politics at the University Warwick, Boundary 2, 29.2)
The reverse side is the….causing so many men to be killed.

These threatening depictions of the inevitable future crush civil society watchdogs- the resulting culture of fear makes public deliberation impossible
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kurasawa ‘4</span>, (Fuyuki, Assistant Prof. of Sociology @ York University, Cautionary Tales, Constellations Vol. 11, No. 4, Blackwell Synergy)
Independently of the contractualist…precautionary principle and global justice.

Infusing equality into the decision-making process is key to combat global destruction
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stannard 2006</span>(Matt, Department of Communication and Journalism, University of Wyoming, Spring 2006 Faculty Senate Speaker Series Speech, April 18, http://theunderview.blogspot.com/2006/04/deliberation-democracy-and-debate.html)
The complicity and interdependence…one way to resist this colonization

Disability activism is critical to rupturing the police order—only attending to those who remain uncounted can destabilize hierarchy
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">O ‘Rourke, 2008</span> (Michael, lecturer in the School of Psychotherapy at Independent Colleges, Dublin, Ireland, “Rancière and Crip Theory”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://ranciere.blogspot.com/2008/02/rancire-and-crip-theory.html]]</span>)
Crip Theory’s emphases on…another of Crip Theory’s lessons.

Thus,
Plan: the United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure accessibility investment.

Contention 2: Imagination
Our plan is an act of fiat—it’s an expression of imagination that envisions an alternative future
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Snider 8</span> (Alfred, Edwin W. Lawrence Professor of Forensics at the University of Vermont, “The Code of the Debater: Introduction to Policy Debating” published 2008, p.199) RF
Fiat: The assumption…imagine that it exists.


<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Transportation spaces are imagined in a way that assume everyone is mobile—only imagining transportation spaces as fluid can change the way we operate on space</span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Koch</span>, 200<span style="font-size: 12pt;">8</span>(Tom, Adjunct Professor of Medical Ethics at the University of British Columbia, “Spaced Out in the City: the Wrinkled World of Transit for Those With Limited Mobility”, Disability Studies Quarterly, Vol. 28 No. 2, Spring, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/94/94]]</span>)
Making my way slowly…goal in transit planning.

Imagining a world with more accessible transportation infrastructure is an act of dissensus. Dissensus opposes the police order and breaks down the consensual policymaking that maintains it. Only imagination in the context of spatial reorientation can challenge this distribution of the sensible—there are no root causes. Continued experimentation and verification of imagination is key—imagination smuggles equality into the police order and destabilizes hierarchy
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tanke 11</span> (Joseph J, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Hawaii-Manoa, “JACQUES RANCIÈRE: AN INTRODUCTION”, published 2011, pg. 149-162) RF
One can argue that the hallmark…instill in us the desire for equality.

Finally, our plan text is not a proscription for change, but an inscription of equality within this debate round. Our role as intellectuals is not to provide proscriptive solutions, but to offer analyses that reveal the problems with hegemonic institutions and practices and enable their transformation. Our presentation of this criticism in this debate is both an introduction of our analysis as a useful starting point for discussing the failures of the police order and an attempt to shift the way we, as a community of intellectuals, engage policy debates
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Foucault 80 </span>(Michel, “Questions of Method,” in “The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality,” (1991), by Michel Foucault, Graham Burchell, and Colin Gordon, p. 82-85)
You’re quite right to pose the problem of….not when reformers have realized their ideas.

These threatening depictions of the inevitable future create unquestioned faith in political leaders. Faith-based politics apply preemption to civil society, sectioning off and containing potential dissent.

Thus,
Raymond and I position ourselves in solidarity towards a future with better transportation infrastructure accessibility.

Capitalism and transport are intrinsically related – free mobility exists in the acts of consumption of the privileged class while immobility corresponds with the coerced and restricted movements of the oppressed.
