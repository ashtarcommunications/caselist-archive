=Disclosure info= 
I won't be formally disclosing this year except at tournaments that require it and when I run an argument I feel must be disclosed to be theoretically legitimate (plans/pics). If you would like me to disclose before my round with you email me- [[mailto:sreddy13@brophybroncos.org|sreddy13@brophybroncos.org]] or come find me-I'll try to post where I'm hanging around at on here. I may or may not be willing to disclose depending on the situation, and I ask that you return the favor if I do agree. If I tell you I'm not willing to disclose it's nothing personal; rather, I am making a strategic decision. Also I have a preference that is against community norms so read this: **I prefer full text disclosure because I may not have access to all the resources you do, and you may not have access to all the resources I do. (for clarification that means I don't have partial text cites on me and won't give you my full text for your partial). I will delete all of your files after the round, and I expect the same for my files. If you don't have a computer I'll return your paper copy after the round.** At tournaments that require disclosure, I'll disclose according the the guidelines of the tournament.

peace and oneluv
