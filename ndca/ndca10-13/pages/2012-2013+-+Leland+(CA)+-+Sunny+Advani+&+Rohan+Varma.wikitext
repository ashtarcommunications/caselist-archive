<span class="1cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Levy 7 </span></span><span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">[Janet Ellen, The American Thinker. “The Threat of Bioweapons,” http://www.americanthinker.com/2007/06/the_threat_of_bioweapons.html] BW
Immediately following 9-11, an anthrax attack originating from letters containing anthrax spores infected 22 people, killing five. After almost six years, the case has not been solved. Intelligence analysts and academics report that North Korea has developed anthrax, plague, and botulism toxin and conducted extensive research on smallpox, typhoid and cholera. A world-renowned bioweapons expert has confirmed that Syria has weapons grade smallpox resistant to all current vaccines developed under the cover of legitimate veterinary research on camelpox, a very closely related virus. The researcher further reports that Syria is suspected of testing the pathogen on prison populations and possibly in the Sudan. Although there are close to 50 organisms that could be used offensively, rogue nations have concentrated their bioweapons development efforts on smallpox, anthrax, plague, botulinum, tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers. With the exception of smallpox, which is exclusively a human host disease, all of the other pathogens lend themselves to animal testing as they are zoonotic, or can be transmitted to humans by other species</span>. <span class="1underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Biological weapons are</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">among the most dangerous in the world today and can be engineered and disseminated to</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">achieve a more deadly result than a nuclear attack</span></span>. <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">Whereas the explosion of a nuclear bomb would cause massive death in a specific location</span>, <span class="1underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a biological attack</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">with smallpox</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">could infect multitudes of people across the globe</span></span>. <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">With incubation periods of up to 17 days, human disseminators could unwittingly cause widespread exposure before diagnosable symptoms indicate an infection and appropriate quarantine procedures are in place. <span class="1underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 2.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 2.0pt;">Unlike any other type of weapon,</span></span></span><span class="1underline"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">bioweapons</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">such as smallpox</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">can replicate and infect a chain of people</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">over an indeterminate amount of time from a single undetectable point of release</span></span><span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">. According to science writer and author of The Hot Zone, Richard Preston, "<span class="1underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 2.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 2.0pt;">If you took</span></span></span><span class="1underline"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a gram of smallpox,</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">which is highly contagious and lethal, and</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">for which there's no vaccine available globally</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">now, and released it in the air and created about a hundred cases, the chances are excellent that</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the virus would go global in six weeks as people moved</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">from city to city......the death toll could easily hit the hundreds of millions.....</span><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">in scale, that's like a nuclear war</span></span><span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">."[1] More so than chemical and nuclear research, bioweapons development programs lend themselves to stealth development. They are difficult to detect, can be conducted alongside legimate research on countermeasures, sheltered in animal research facilities within sophisticated pharmaceutical corporations, disguised as part of routine medical university studies, or be a component of dual use technology development. Detection is primarily through available intelligence information and location-specific biosensors that test for the presence of pathogens. Biological weapons have many appealing qualities for warfare and their effects can be engineered and customized from a boutique of possibilities. <span class="1underline"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size: 2.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 2.0pt;">Offensive</span></span></span><span class="1underline"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">pathogens are inexpensive</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">compared to conventional weapons and</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">small quantities can produce disproportionate damage.</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">They have unlimited lethal potential as</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">carriers</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">and can</span> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">continue to infect</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">more people over time</span>. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Bioweapons are easy to dispense through a variety of delivery systems </span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 2.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">f</span><span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">rom a missile, an aerosol or a food product</span></span><span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">. They can be placed into a state of dormancy to be activated at a later stage allowing for ease of storage.</span> <span class="1underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Pathogens are not immediately detectable</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">or identifiable </span><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">due to</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">varying </span><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">incubation periods</span> <span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">and can be rapidly deployed, activated and impossible to trace</span></span><span style="font-size: 2.0pt;">. The technology to develop biological agents is widely available for legitimate purposes and large quantities can be developed within days. Bioweapons can be tailored for specific situations from a variety of desired characteristics, including pathogenicity or disease-producing capacity, incubation period, virulence and transmissibility. Pathogenicity is relative to the quantity of a particular agent that is necessary to cause disease. The incubation period is critical for determining the timing of the desired period between exposure and the onset of illness. Virulence determines how debilitating and lethal the disease will manifest in the target population. Transmissibility defines the ease in which the disease is able to spread. </span>
