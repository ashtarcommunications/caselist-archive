<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">**Thus we advocate: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure accessibility investment.** </span>

====**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">And contention 2 is solvency--</span>**==== 
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Vote aff to endorse inclusion and reject the exclusionary status quo – bringing abelism into policy debates is an ethical imperative. What we say here is the litmus test for subjugation across the globe.</span>**

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">Many designers are now beginning to acknowledge</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">the social model of disability... </span>but rather as unique individuals who have a lot to offer to society.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 11pt;">UD applied to transit </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 11pt;">is an inclusionary strategy that seeks to redress .... </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Thus, although they are a form of inclusive design, they are not UD solutions to micro-level transit accessibility.</span>


**<span class="tagChar">As the privileged, we have a moral duty to prevent injustices from befalling the marginalized—it is impossible for us to disengage from a system riddled with inequalities, and we must try to fix it as much as possible</span>**

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">There is</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">a horror which has remained almost invisible:.......</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;"> if only because the alternative would seem to be even greater social stresses than those that already exist.</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">And the prior question is whether the plan on its-face affirms a worthy ethical principle. To void this obligation in the name of future consequences fails to establish any coherent moral framework and makes decisions impossible.</span>**

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Ethical approaches that do not attend to the ways in which warfare and military practices are woven into the very fabric of life .......These approaches also leave unquestioned tendencies to suspend or distort moral judgement in the face of what appears to be the inevitability of war and militarism.</span>
