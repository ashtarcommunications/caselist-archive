The military intervention in Afghanistan has become one of the longest-lasting war efforts in US history. It does not look like a coincidence that particularly deadly attacks are being carried out by the Taleban, while the repeated threats of an “all out attack” on Kandahar underlines the Sisyphean nature of NATO’s efforts. These circumstances do not bode well for the success of the recently convened “Peace Jirgah”, and yet the idea deserves close scrutiny and should not be dismissed, out of hand, as yet another failed attempt by The Afghan Government - with the support of its allies – to embark upon a political path instead of relying mainly on a military venture which shows no signs of imminent success. My first memory of an Afghan Jirgah dates back to the years of World War II, when, as a child, I was living in Kabul with my parents: the British had issued strong demands that Afghanistan deport all Axis citizens, and close their Diplomatic Missions. A “Loya Jirgah” was convened and, after many days of debate, declared – to our great relief – that this would contravene Afghanistan’s laws of hospitality. A fundamentally important decision had been taken which would guarantee Afghanistan’s neutrality until the Soviet invasion of 1979. The Jirgah has traditionally been an institute of primary importance in the Pathan tribal areas of Pakistan and the Pashtun areas of Afghanistan. Although, traditionally, it gathered only Pashtun tribal elders, in modern times it has been extended also to include representatives of all the other areas. It can be argued, as, indeed it has been argued, that this form of representation is much more suited to the Afghan political reality than a western-style Parliament, no matter how correct the electoral process. Afghanistan, as Pakistan’s North-West, is basically a tribal society, and peaceful coexistence among the tribes cannot be guaranteed by political processes which do not take this reality into account. With the passage of time, the term “democracy” has acquired a rather dogmatic aspect, and is associated with certain particular rituals which have evolved, in the course of centuries, in some western societies, and which have then been applied, with success, also outside Europe and North America. An analysis, even a superficial one, of local interpretations of democracy would be completely out of context in an attempt to examine the Afghan situation, which is of grave and understandable concern, but serious thought ought to be given on how it would be possible to reconcile the need for stability in such a volatile and strategically important area with social and political realities which long predate the current insurgency, and all this without further eroding basic liberties. It is, of course, probable that the Jirgah called by president Karzai will not have immediate, appreciable repercussions in the desired direction, mainly because, rightly or wrongly, the President no longer has the massive backing of the Afghan people, not even in his own tribal area. At the same time, his support among the leading international actors in Afghanistan has also sensibly declined. These circumstances, unfortunately, lend credibility to the accusations that this Jirgah is rigged and that it has been packed with Karzai supporters, thereby depriving it of the dignity essential to its success. A future scenario could, however, be envisaged in which enhanced local autonomy would allow the application of “our” democratic rules in Towns and Provinces ready freely to choose such a solution (Herat comes to mind), while others could choose more traditional methods of local rule. The central Government, instead, with a role more of guidance and coordination rather than dominance or rule, would be more in tune with the traditions of the land. This arrangement has worked in the past, and could be an indication – with the necessary variations – of a way forward. The calling of Jirgahs, and their composition and competencies should not be left to the arbitrary will of the Head of State, but rather be regulated in a new, bold and imaginative attempt to reconcile respected and valid Afghan traditions to the country’s aspirations to be part of the modern family of nations. Of course, the principal obstacle to any durable, credible negotiated settlement remains the massive and bellicose foreign military presence, whose support of the government is distasteful to many strata of Afghan opinion. The possibility of solutions along the lines suggested by the Jirgah would be greatly enhanced if agreements in that sense would coincide with a publicized, credible and accepted timetable for the withdrawal of the bulk of foreign troops. As things stand, there are few alternative suitable solutions, and recourse to the Jirgah as a convincing instrument of negotiation should not be discarded. </span><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><strong>Status quo Negotiations lead to instability – focused on regional interests</strong><br />
<strong>Amritage and Berger 11/12</strong> 2010 [Richard L and Samuel R. “U.S. Strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan” PDF p.27-8]<br />
Under the assumption that many Afghan insurgent leaders are motivated less by extreme ideologies than by political goals or personal grievances, the Karzai government is pursuing what it calls a reconciliation dialogue with top Taliban commanders in an attempt to end the civil conflict without military force. Facing a sometimes strained relationship with Washington and uncertain support from within his own Pashtun constituency, President Karzai may also see reconciliation as the best means to salvage his political fortunes. This Task Force is concerned that “reconciliation” is not being pursued in a way that builds greater Afghan unity. Negotiations have already exposed rifts in the Kabul government. Afghan minorities and women’s groups will be especially concerned about any deal that would return extremists to positions of authority. A poorly managed negotiation process would also create divisions between Kabul and Washington and among the NATO allies. Whatever its prospects, the reconciliation process will be watched closely by Afghanistan’s neighbors, all of whom feel that they will be profoundly affected by developments in Kabul. Pakistan already appears to be using its ties to Afghan Taliban leaders to shape the process and reduce Indian influence. In return, India and other regional players are particularly sensitive to Pakistani power plays. All of Afghanistan’s neighbors may already be hedging their bets in anticipation of a return to Afghan civil war. Renewed competition for influence in Afghanistan has the potential to rip the country apart, despite the fact that each state in the region would benefit far more from a period of peace and stability. Afghans would again suffer the most, with millions of refugees streaming across the borders into Pakistan, Iran, and elsewhere. Pakistan and the Central Asian Republics, already fragile, would be especially threatened by the turmoil of a renewed proxy war in Afghanistan. Moreover, the world would suffer if Afghanistan’s internal conflict permits a return of al-Qaeda and other international terrorists.</span><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><br />
<strong>A clear and unequivocal strategy with a permanent, minimal troop presence is key – alternative is losing the war and surrendering a safe haven.</strong><br />

Success in Afghanistan is beginning to come in the first muddy trickles after a long drought.</span><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;">Small groups of Taliban fighters -- sometimes a dozen with a leader -- are approaching local Afghan government officials, asking what kind of deal they might get. &quot;First, they want to be taken off any list, so they are not targeted,&quot; explains a NATO official in Afghanistan. &quot;Second, they want protection from the insurgency. Third, some kind of economic opportunity.&quot; In counterinsurgency doctrine, this is known as &quot;reintegration.&quot; The official admits it is &quot;spotty&quot; in Afghanistan but spreading in all regions. &quot;It is happening in small numbers -- drip, drip, drip. It has not yet changed the battle space. . . . It is not a tipping point, at this point.&quot; The goal is to push these numbers much higher, with more insurgents driven to negotiation and exhaustion, so they &quot;put down their weapons and go home.&quot; Many Americans ask: What would victory look like in Afghanistan? It would look like this -- except more of it. Eighteen months ago, Afghan insurgents had the morale that comes from momentum. But the surge in NATO operations, particularly Special Operations, has started to change the psychological battlefield. Special Forces now go after eight to 10 major objectives each night -- perhaps three-quarters of these raids result in the death or capture of an insurgent leader. Two Taliban shadow governors -- a key position in the leadership structure -- were killed in the last week. Such roles are quickly refilled, but replacements tend to be less seasoned and more frightened. &quot;We hear a lot of chatter,&quot; says the official, &quot;from networks inside of Afghanistan.&quot; Some fighters don't feel &quot;a moment of peace. They can't sleep. They keep moving all the time. They can't plan attacks because they are planning to survive.&quot; And this is opening up a &quot;real rift&quot; with Taliban &quot;bosses leading from the relative comfort of Pakistan.&quot; While some units are well supplied, others are &quot;not supplied, not paid, but told to keep fighting.&quot; ad_icon Reintegration of low- and mid-level fighters is based on their concern for survival. Reconciliation between the Afghan government and higher-level Taliban leaders is a political matter, gaining much recent attention. President Hamid Karzai has convened a &quot;high peace council,&quot; open to Taliban overtures but insisting on certain conditions: repudiating al-Qaeda, laying down arms, accepting the Afghan constitution. The most ideological of Taliban leaders will never reconcile. Others may calculate, as many Sunni leaders eventually did in Iraq, that their rejectionism is undermining their long-term political influence. In a national settlement, some kind of power-sharing arrangement is probably inevitable. But sharing power in a united government is very different from the concession of Taliban control over any portion of Afghanistan's territory. This would incite ethnic conflict and re-create the conditions that led to the Sept. 11 attacks. It is the definition of American defeat. Political reconciliation is the objective. But it is conceivable only if momentum toward reintegration continues and gathers -- and this, in large part, is a military task. Many have argued that an acceptable outcome in Afghanistan will not be achieved by military force alone. True. But an acceptable outcome is enabled by military pressure. That pressure is being undermined by a Taliban argument. President Obama's July 2011 deadline for the beginning of American troop withdrawals from Afghanistan is being used, according to the NATO official, as &quot;an opportunity for propaganda.&quot; &quot;They are trying to convince Afghans that we are out in July. They are saying we will be gone, telling people, 'We will remember our friends, and remember our enemies.' &quot; There are two ways to combat this claim. The first is to build up the Afghan army and police, so that an eventual American drawdown will not leave a void. &quot;This is one area,&quot; says my source, &quot;where the enemy has misjudged. They said that our training goals for the army and police were too ambitious. But we are meeting our growth numbers, and the quality of the force is taking off.&quot; The task remains &quot;very challenging,&quot; but, with enough partnership and patience, it is achievable. The second response is to make clear that America is not abandoning Afghanistan in July. The message should be, according to the official, &quot;As conditions exist, there will be a responsible drawdown.&quot; It is America's commander in chief who has created a destructive ambiguity on this point. And only he can remove it. </span><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><strong>There is a moral obligation to maintain a CT presence – collapse would devolve into a civil war and loss of human rights.</strong><br />

Undoubtedly the most severely affected victims of failure in Afghanistan, however, would be the Afghans themselves. Whether or not the Taliban ultimately emerged victorious, what is almost certain is that the country would be plunged into a renewed state of civil war, with numerous competing factions, each with outside countries supporting them, vying for power and with Afghan civilians caught in the middle. Were this to happen, the worthy and necessary effort to advance human rights and the rule of law in the region would have utterly failed. Such an outcome would be unacceptable, firstly because it is preventable, and secondly because, when the US, the UK and their allies intervened in Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power, they assumed the responsibility of putting something better in its place. It has been said of the conflict in Afghanistan that it is a futile and even neo-imperialistic endeavour to impose foreign values and ideas upon a people who neither need nor want them. This culturally relativist prognosis has at its heart the essentially racist assumption that the same basic human rights that Westerners take for granted, such as freedom of expression, freedom from exploitation, the right to education, sexual equality and the right to choose the form of government under which one wishes to live, are somehow not appropriate for Afghans. This assumption is not only a grave insult to Afghans, it is also false. As has been elaborated upon in Chapter II of this report, an overwhelming majority of Afghans, fully 90 per cent, believe that for all its failings, the current government is the best hope for the country’s future, whereas just six per cent wish to see a return to Taliban rule.114 Consistent with the Constitution of Afghanistan, the current government is committed to a society in which “Freedom of expression is inviolable”; citizens “have the right to form political parties”; “Torture of human beings is prohibited”; and “The citizens of Afghanistan - whether man or woman - have equal rights before the law”.115 This is to be starkly contrasted with the Taliban who, to take a recent example, sliced off the nose and ears of a 19-year old girl and left her to die for “shaming” her husband by running away on account of the torture and abuse she suffered at his hands and the hands of his family. It was the husband himself who carried the punishment out.116 It is certainly the case that many in the West, whilst not denying that Afghans are entitled to the same rights and freedoms as other peoples, nonetheless oppose foreign intervention in Afghanistan on the grounds that it is not facilitating the advancement of these rights and is in fact making matters worse. Those who adhere to this point of view should ask themselves what the likely consequences of withdrawal from Afghanistan before such time as the government can defend the rights of Afghans on its own would be. In addition to the 140,000 NATO and US soldiers on the ground, foreign assistance is developing the Afghan National Army and other security services to levels far beyond what the government, with an annual GDP of just $23 billion, could possibly sustain on its own.117 Just as happened following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, the likely fate of the Afghan government if left to fight the Taliban and the warlords unassisted would be collapse. Whether under the Taliban, who adhere to an interpretation of Sharia law medieval in its barbarity, or under the capricious and self-interested rule of the warlords, those human rights and freedoms which many Afghans are starting to enjoy would disappear and the vital infrastructure development currently underway would likewise cease. Afghans themselves clearly recognise the necessity of the international presence to support the government until such time as it can stand on its own. According to opinion polls, some 60 per cent of Afghans support the NATO presence, the same number that have actually supported an increase in the number of international forces in the country in the form of the recent US and NATO troop surge.118 If given the choice, the Afghan people - like all people everywhere - will support any effort that offers them and their families security and economic opportunities, and which respects their basic human rights. The effort to create such an environment in Afghanistan is not a forlorn hope or even an arrogant exercise in neo-imperialism but a worthy and workable enterprise that can yield genuine results. If we have a care for human rights in Afghanistan, and if we wish for it to succeed and not become another rabidly anti-Western autocracy, then it is imperative that the international community remains in the country until such time as the Afghan government can provide the necessary levels of security and development to succeed without external support.</span><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><strong>Losing Afghanistan leads to Taliban takeover of Pakistan risking nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Grant, 2010</strong> [Succeeding in Afghanistan by George Grant <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://henryjacksonsociety.org/cms/harriercollectionitems/Succeeding%20in%20Afghanistan.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://henryjacksonsociety.org/cms/harriercollectionitems/Succeeding%20in%20Afghanistan.pdf</a>]<br />
In addition to increasing the risk to Western national security, failure in Afghanistan would also generate the possibility of widespread regional instability. The country likely to be most severely affected would be neighbouring, nuclear-armed Pakistan, and this is the principal reason why the government in Islamabad has finally started to take the threat posed by the Taliban seriously. Not only would the Pakistan-Taliban be rejuvenated psychologically, the material and logistical assistance that they would receive from across the border could seriously enhance the threat they pose to the Pakistani government. For all the focus on Afghanistan, the threat posed to Pakistan by insurgents is not one to be underestimated. It is worth recalling the events of April 2009, when a resurgent Taliban advanced to within just 60 miles of Islamabad, prompting very real concerns of a Taliban takeover of the country and its nuclear arsenal.110 It is also worth recalling that what precipitated this resurgence was the capitulation of the Pakistani government in the Swat Valley, granting carte blanche to the Taliban to exercise administrative and judicial control, thus placing even more territory in the hands of the Taliban, having already lost control of most of its tribal agencies bordering Afghanistan. To cede control of Afghanistan to the Taliban, even in just those regions bordering Pakistan, could result in a rejuvenation of the insurgency across the border which would, in the worst case scenario, pose an existential threat to Pakistan, and the seemingly fantastical but nonetheless real possibility of its nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of the Taliban.The consequences of this scenario would be dire indeed. The absolutely unacceptable prospect of the Taliban gaining control of a nuclear arsenal would surely precipitate a massive incursion by Western countries or by India, with the potential to throw not only Pakistan, but the entire region into massive conflict. This is, however, the worst-case scenario and one that is unlikely to come to pass, though it is by no means impossible. More likely is that Pakistan would be able to withstand a renewed insurgency, but the fallout in terms of civilian deaths, displacement and further instability would nonetheless be severe.</span><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><strong>13000 troops is enough</strong><br />
<strong>Long</strong>, Professor at Columbia University, <strong>2010</strong> [ Austin, “Small is Beautiful: The Counterterrorism Option in Afghanistan” ]<br />
The JAF based task force would likely need to operate principally in the heartland of the Haqqani network (Khost, Paktia, and Paktika provinces) as this would be where al Qaeda’s principal ally in the east could best protect its members (who are not generally Pashtun). For similar reasons, the KAF based task force would principally operate against targets in Kandahar, the home of the Quetta Shura Taliban, and some of the surrounding provinces such as Helmand and Oruzgan. Both task forces would nonetheless be capable of acting against targets elsewhere in the Pashtun regions. In addition to these two task forces, a counterterrorism option would retain the three Army Special Forces battalions and other elements that appear to be assigned to Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan (CJSOTF-A).15 This provides roughly 54 Special Forces Operational Detachment Alphas (ODAs), the basic unit of Army Special Forces. While the task forces would focus purely on direct action, ODAs would partner with local forces to collect intelligence and secure specific areas.16 Additionally, these ODAs would provide crucial support to critical Afghan allies and reassure them that the United States is not going to entirely abandon them. CJSOTF-A should, in addition, have a dedicated helicopter battalion for its own lift. This reassurance and support of local allies is a crucial and underappreciated part of a counterterrorism option, though such support to local allies could also be part of a counterinsurgency campaign. Indeed, the recently launched Community Defense Initiative (CDI) seeks to use Special Forces troops to build effective tribal militias to fight the Taliban and other militants. With 54 ODAs, the United States could potentially support local allies in roughly 50 Afghan districts, assuming one ODA per district with a few deployed in other roles.18 Logistics might prevent this upper limit from being reached but at a minimum several dozen districts could be supported by CJSOTF-A’sODAs. These local allies would inmany cases be fromnon-Pashtun groups (Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras), which would limit their ability to be effective in Pashtun areas but would likely include at least a few other tribes that see more benefit working with the Afghan government and the United States than against them. The non-Pashtun groups were the critical allies of the United States in 2001 and remain staunchly against the Taliban and other militants. The Tajiks of the Panjshir Valley, for example, are probably even more anti-Taliban than the United States and have made the province one of the most secure in the country.19 With U.S. support, these groups will be able to prevent the expansion of militants outside Pashtun areas. Local allies in Pashtun areas will not only help contain militants but will also enable collection of intelligence to support the task force operations. One example is the Shinwari tribe in Nangarhar province, which has never valued the Taliban. Shinwari militias are reported to be working with Special Forces in the Achin district of Nangarhar.20 The Afghan Border Police commander on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border at Spin Boldak, General Abdul Razziq, also derives substantial revenue from cross-border trade and will likely continue to fight the Taliban to maintain this revenue, making him a probable local partner.21 Another potential ally is the Alokozai tribe in the Arghandab district of Kandahar province, which has a history of resisting the Taliban.22 Supporting local allies does not mean abandoning the Afghan government any more than supporting local allies in the Awakening movement in Iraq’s Anbar province meant abandoning the Iraq government. However, it does pose risks, as local allies interests may not always align with those of the central government.23 Balancing the two will require deftness which will be discussed later. In addition to the two task forces and CJSOTF-A, a few more ‘‘enablers’’ would be required. First, this posture would need additional special operations personnel focused on intelligence collection, along with a substantial complement of intelligence community personnel to collect both human and signals intelligence.24 Second, it would require a significant complement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) including Predators, Reapers, and other specialized types along with their support personnel, equivalent to perhaps three squadrons. Third, an AC-130 gunship squadron for air support would be needed, along with combat search and rescue teams from Air Force Special Operations Command. Clearly, ‘‘small’’ is a relative term. This special operations posture alone would be roughly five battalions of ground forces, eight aviation squadrons/ battalions, and a few odds and ends plus higher headquarters. This would be approximately 5,000 U.S. and Coalition troops.25 In addition, a conventional force component would be needed to serve as a quick reaction force, to provide security for the bases, and to protect convoys. A reasonable estimate for this force would be a brigade or regimental combat team, giving a battalion to each base with the higher headquarters at Bagram. This would add about another 3,500 troops.26 In addition, about 500 U.S. personnel would remain as advisers and liaisons to Afghan security forces, particularly the Afghan National Army where they would be attached at brigade and corps level. Additional air support besides the UAVs and AC-130s would also be needed. Two squadrons of fighter-bombers (F-15E, A-10, etc.) likely would be sufficient, adding another 2,000 personnel or so.27 Finally, this posture would require additional staff, logistics, and support personnel (medical for instance), some but not all of which could be contractors, adding another 2,000 military personnel.28 This would be a total force of about 13,000 military personnel and some supporting intelligence community personnel and contractors. This is a high-end estimate and the counterterrorism option could potentially be done with fewer troops. Some military personnel with Afghanistan experience believe this mission could be undertaken with half this number of troops but the posture described above errs on the side of caution.29 This is small compared to the current posture in Afghanistan, smaller still than the forces implied in General McChrystal’s report, and tiny compared to the peak number of forces in Iraq. On the other hand, it is vastly larger than any other counterterrorism deployment. Holding aside for a moment whether this is a sufficient force to prevent al Qaeda’s return to Afghanistan, how would the United States get to this posture? It would not do so overnight and the way it transitions will have consequences. First, the Obama administration should embrace the expansion of Afghan security forces, especially the Afghan National Army (ANA), called for in General McChrystal’s initial assessment. This includes accelerating the growth of the ANA to 134,000 by October 2010 from its August 2009 level of 92,000 as well as pushing to rapidly expand the Afghan National Police (ANP).30 Though the quality of Afghan forces will likely be low and the goals may not be met, some increase in total force levels should be possible and will enable the U.S. transition to a counterterrorism posture.31 Second, the President has directed an increase in force levels beginning this year. A counterterrorism strategy would have these additional forces concentrate on achieving the expansion of the Afghan security forces that Gen. McChrystal has called for. 2010 will be a time of feverish arming and training of Afghan forces while Coalition forces hold the line. President Obama has already directed that beginning in early 2011, the United States will begin to draw down its conventional forces as Afghan forces stand up. By the time of the 2012 presidential election or soon thereafter, the United States would shift fully to the posture described above (essentially a 20-24 month drawdown).</span><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><strong>Afghanistan is the ONLY staging point for al Qaeda to launch a large-scale attack</strong><br />
<strong>Arkedis 9</strong> (Jim Arkedis is the director of the National Security Project at the Progressive Policy Institute.

OCTOBER 23, 2009, “Why Al Qaeda Wants a Safe Haven”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/23/got_safe_haven" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/23/got_safe_haven</a> | Suo)</span><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;">As deliberations about the Obama administration's strategic direction in Afghanistan unfold, the White House is weighing whether al Qaeda, in fact, needs an Afghan safe haven -- an expanse of land under the protection of the Taliban -- to reconstitute its capability to attack the United States. Many noted scholars doubt it. In a recent Washington Post op-ed, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass bluntly stated, &quot;Al Qaeda does not require Afghan real estate to constitute a regional or global threat.&quot; He's wrong. Although the group has been significantly weakened since late 2001, the only chance al Qaeda has of rebuilding its capability to conduct a large-scale terrorist operation against the United States is under the Taliban's umbrella of protection. Objections like Haass's are rooted in the following arguments: that terrorists don't need physical space because they can plot online; that the London and Madrid bombings prove deadly attacks can be planned in restrictive, Western, urban locations under the noses of local security services; and that denying terrorists one safe haven will simply compel them to move to another lawless region. I spent five years as a counterterrorism analyst for the Pentagon and rigorously studied plots from Madrid to London to 9/11. The above arguments may have merit in a piecemeal or abstract sense, but fall apart in the specific case of what we all dread: a large-scale, al Qaeda operation aimed at the United States. It is certainly true, for example, that terrorist groups can accomplish much online. Individuals can maintain contact with groups via chat rooms, money can be transferred over the Web (if done with extreme caution), and plotters can download items like instruction manuals for bomb-making, photographs of potential targets, and even blueprints for particular buildings. But all the e-mail accounts, chat rooms, and social media available will never account for the human touch. There is simply no substitute for the trust and confidence built by physically meeting, jointly conceiving, and then training together for a large-scale, complex operation on the other side of the world. As the 9/11 plot developed, mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed (KSM) put the future operatives through a series of training courses along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Courses included physical fitness, firearms, close combat, Western culture, and English language. The 9/11 Commission report notes the extreme physical and mental demands KSM put on the participants -- even if the operation didn't require extensive firearms usage, KSM would have wanted the operatives to be proficient under intense pressure, should the need arise. Juxtapose that with an online learning environment. While you can no doubt learn some amazing things from online courses, it is far preferable to have a dedicated professor physically present to supervise students and monitor their progress. Or think of it another way: You wouldn't want the U.S. Marine Corps to send recruits into battle without training under a drill instructor, would you? KSM was somewhere between a professor and sergeant. Second, critics argue that the Madrid bombings of 2004 (which killed 191) as well those in London a year later (which killed 56) were largely -- though not entirely -- conceived, prepared, and executed within their respective countries, thus obviating the need for a safe haven. True enough. However, unlike 9/11 (which killed nearly 3,000), those plots' successes were possible due to their simple concept and small scale. In both cities, the playbook was essentially the same: Four to eight individuals had to find a safe house, download bomb-making instructions, purchase explosive agents, assemble the devices, and deliver charges to the attack points. Without trivializing the tragic loss of life in the European attacks, building those explosive devices was akin to conducting a difficult high-school chemistry experiment. On that scale, 9/11 was like constructing a nuclear warhead. In every sense, it was a grander vision, involving 20 highly skilled operatives infiltrating the U.S. homeland, who conducted a series of hijackings and targeted four national landmarks with enough know-how, preparation, and contingency plans to be success. In one instance, KSM taught the 9/11 operatives to shoot a rifle from the back of a moving motorcycle, just in case. You can't do that in someone's bedroom -- you need space, time, and the ability to work without worrying that the cops are listening in. In other words, as a plot grows in number of operatives, scale of target, distance from base, and logistical complexity, so does the need for space to reduce the chances of being discovered and disrupted. The final argument is that denying al Qaeda a safe haven is an exercise in futility: Drive Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan and he'd relocate to some place like Sudan, southern Algeria, Somalia, or other swaths of ungoverned territory. However, this logic makes two faulty assumptions: that al Qaeda is mobile, and that the group's international affiliates would automatically roll out the red carpet for the jihadi refugees. Neither is true. Bin Laden and his senior and mid level cadre are well-known to intelligence services the world over. Any attempt to travel, let alone cross an international border (save Afghanistan-Pakistan) would fall somewhere between &quot;utterly unthinkable&quot; and &quot;highly risky.&quot; Moving would further require massive reorientation of al Qaeda's financial operations and smuggling networks. Nor would bin Laden's senior leaders be automatically welcomed abroad in areas their regional partners control. Though al Qaeda has established &quot;franchise affiliates&quot; in places like North Africa and Southeast Asia, relationships between al Qaeda's leadership and its regional nodes are extraordinarily complex. Groups like the North African affiliate &quot;al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb&quot; (AQIM) are happy to co-opt the al Qaeda &quot;brand&quot; for recruiting and financial reasons, but they don't necessarily share the al Qaeda senior leadership's ideological goals. AQIM is much more focused on attacking the Algerian government or foreign entities within the country, having not displayed much capability or desire for grandiose international operations. And last, recruits come to North Africa more often through independent networks in Europe, not camps along the Durand Line. Think of the relationship like the one you have your in-laws: You might share a name, but you probably don't want them coming to visit for three full weeks. Regional leaders aren't terribly loyal to senior leadership, either. Take Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the deceased leader of the group's Iraq affiliate. He was summoned to bin Laden's side numerous times in an attempt to exert control as the Iraqi commander's tactics grew more grotesque and questionable. Zarqawi declined, not wanting to risk travel or accept instruction from bin Laden. In the end, a safe haven along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border is as good as it gets for al Qaeda's chances to launch a large-scale attack against the United States. Certainly, smaller, less complex attacks could be planned without &quot;Afghan real estate,&quot; but any such plot's death toll and long-term effect on American society will be far more limited. Unfortunately, that's a risk President Barack Obama has to accept -- no amount of intelligence or counterterrorism operations can provide 100 percent security. But to avoid the Big One, the U.S. president's best bet is to deny al Qaeda the only physical space it can access.</span><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><br />
<strong>Removing troops destroys Al-Qaeda – increases local pressure and support</strong><br />
<strong>Dorronsoro 9</strong> (DR. Gilles November 17, “U.S. STRATEGY IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN; COMMITTEE: HOUSE ARMED SERVICES; SUBCOMMITTEE: OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS”, lexis)<br />
The International Coalition's main objective in Afghanistan is to protect its members from another attack on their own soil. Yet in fighting to eliminate the Taliban, with which it has no direct conflict of interest, the Coalition has been diverted from fighting al-Qaeda, its main enemy. What should have been essentially a policing operation, albeit on a large scale, became a major counterinsurgency war, the primary mistake being fighting the Taliban as if they were an arm of al-Qaeda. The United States expends far more blood and treasure fighting the Taliban than it does fighting al-Qaeda. The implicit idea that crushing the Taliban altogether is necessary to defeat al-Qaeda is dangerously mistaken. The Afghan war does not make the United States safer. On the contrary, the war is not an answer to the al-Qaeda threat, and it does not diminish the risk of another attack on Western countries. The relationship between fighting local insurgents and a potential Coalition fight against al-Qaeda is very much disconnected from the war in Afghanistan. Coalition strikes against al-Qaeda are not connected to the war in Afghanistan, and cooperation with Pakistan is a much more important determinant of the success or failure of such operations. The continuing war in Afghanistan, in fact, is a major asset for al-Qaeda, which is not engaged there. Indeed, no important al-Qaeda members have been killed recently in Afghanistan, and its fighters stay in Pakistan. The Coalition could continue to do exactly what it is doing now against al-Qaeda without waging the distracting war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. That is why the Coalition must disconnect these two strategic issues. The Coalition presence in Afghanistan is not actually helping in the fight against al-Qaeda and is, in fact, protecting its sanctuary in Pakistan from local tribal backlash and from the Pakistani army and intelligence agencies. Without the war in Afghanistan, al- Qaeda would be under much more pressure from Pakistani and local forces. The Coalition presence in Afghanistan is the major element driving hitherto limited cohesiveness between the very different insurgencies in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In addition, the war is an impediment to constructing a clear and efficient policy regarding Iran, because it would put the United States in a vulnerable position should Iran decide to support the Taliban. The Coalition's best rationale for fighting the Taliban is to deny al-Qaeda the opportunity to create new operational bases in Afghan cities. The Coalition's strategy should start from that clearly defined interest. A more cautious strategy in Afghanistan, aimed at securing the urban centers in the Pashtun belt and Afghanizing the war, would allow the Coalition to fulfill its main objectives. It would deny al-Qaeda access to cities, a key point considering al-Qaeda's operating methods. Second, it would deny the Afghan war of its local appeal, making it more difficult for al-Qaeda to recruit volunteers. Third, the enormous resources devoted to this war could be directed toward what is known to be central to Coalition success: human intelligence and a focus on Pakistan. A defensive approach in the South and East of Afghanistan has no negative impact on operations against al-Qaeda, and would allow the Coalition to invest more resources into fighting its primarily enemy directly</span><span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;"><strong>Don’t evaluate their turns – new studies show the root cause of terrorism is foreign occupation.</strong><br />
<strong>Pape , 10/18</strong> 2010 [Robert, “It's the Occupation, Stupid” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/18/it_s_the_occupation_stupid" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/18/it_s_the_occupation_stupid</a>]<br />
There's just one problem: We now know that this narrative is not true. New research provides strong evidence that suicide terrorism such as that of 9/11 is particularly sensitive to foreign military occupation, and not Islamic fundamentalism or any ideology independent of this crucial circumstance. Although this pattern began to emerge in the 1980s and 1990s, a wealth of new data presents a powerful picture. More than 95 percent of all suicide attacks are in response to foreign occupation, according to extensive research that we conducted at the University of Chicago's Project on Security and Terrorism, where we examined every one of the over 2,200 suicide attacks across the world from 1980 to the present day. As the United States has occupied Afghanistan and Iraq, which have a combined population of about 60 million, total suicide attacks worldwide have risen dramatically -- from about 300 from 1980 to 2003, to 1,800 from 2004 to 2009. Further, over 90 percent of suicide attacks worldwide are now anti-American. The vast majority of suicide terrorists hail from the local region threatened by foreign troops, which is why 90 percent of suicide attackers in Afghanistan are Afghans. Israelis have their own narrative about terrorism, which holds that Arab fanatics seek to destroy the Jewish state because of what it is, not what it does. But since Israel withdrew its army from Lebanon in May 2000, there has not been a single Lebanese suicide attack. Similarly, since Israel withdrew from Gaza and large parts of the West Bank, Palestinian suicide attacks are down over 90 percent. Some have disputed the causal link between foreign occupation and suicide terrorism, pointing out that some occupations by foreign powers have not resulted in suicide bombings -- for example, critics often cite post-World War II Japan and Germany. Our research provides sufficient evidence to address these criticisms by outlining the two factors that determine the likelihood of suicide terrorism being employed against an occupying force. The first factor is social distance between the occupier and occupied. The wider the social distance, the more the occupied community may fear losing its way of life.Â Although other differences may matter, research shows that resistance to occupations is especially likely to escalate to suicide terrorism when there is a difference between the predominant religion of the occupier and the predominant religion of the occupied. Religious difference matters not because some religions are predisposed to suicide attacks. Indeed, there are religious differences even in purely secular suicide attack campaigns, such as the LTTE (Hindu) against the Sinhalese (Buddhists). Rather, religious difference matters because it enables terrorist leaders to claim that the occupier is motivated by a religious agenda that can scare both secular and religious members of a local community -- this is why Osama bin Laden never misses an opportunity to describe U.S. occupiers as &quot;crusaders&quot; motivated by a Christian agenda to convert Muslims, steal their resources, and change the local population's way of life. The second factor is prior rebellion.Â Suicide terrorism is typically a strategy of last resort, often used by weak actors when other, non-suicidal methods of resistance to occupation fail. This is why we see suicide attack campaigns so often evolve from ordinary terrorist or guerrilla campaigns, as in the cases of Israel and Palestine, the Kurdish rebellion in Turkey, or the LTTE in Sri Lanka. One of the most important findings from our research is that empowering local groups can reduce suicide terrorism. In Iraq, the surge's success was not the result of increased U.S. military control of Anbar province, but the empowerment of Sunni tribes, commonly called the Anbar Awakening, which enabled Iraqis to provide for their own security. On the other hand, taking power away from local groups can escalate suicide terrorism. In Afghanistan, U.S. and Western forces began to exert more control over the country's Pashtun regions starting in early 2006, and suicide attacks dramatically escalated from this point on. The research suggests that U.S. interests would be better served through a policy of offshore balancing. Some scholars have taken issue with this approach, arguing that keeping boots on the ground in South Asia is essential for U.S. national security. Proponents of this strategy fail to realize how U.S. ground forces often inadvertently produce more anti-American terrorists than they kill. In 2000, before the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, there were 20 suicide attacks around the world, and only one (against the USS Cole) was directed against Americans. In the last 12 months, by comparison, 300 suicide attacks have occurred, and over 270 were anti-American. We simply must face the reality that, no matter how well-intentioned, the current war on terror is not serving U.S. interests. The United States has been great in large part because it respects understanding and discussion of important ideas and concepts, and because it is free to change course. Intelligent decisions require putting all the facts before us and considering new approaches. The first step is recognizing that occupations in the Muslim world don't make Americans any safer -- in fact, they are at the heart of the problem.</span><br />

 <strong>Doesn’t turn case – withdrawal based on troops on ground</strong><br />
<strong>Hindustan Times 11/6</strong> (11/6/10, &quot;US drawdown in Afghanistan won't hinge on US politics: Gates&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/US-drawdown-in-Afghanistan-won-t-hinge-on-US-politics-Gates/Article1-622975.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.hindustantimes.com/US-drawdown-in-Afghanistan-won-t-hinge-on-US-politics-Gates/Article1-622975.aspx</a>]<br />
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the pace of <u>a planned US troop drawdown in Afghanistan</u> next year would be based <u>mainly on conditions on the battlefield rather than &quot;domestic politics&quot; in the United States</u>. Republican lawmakers, who won control of the House of Representatives in US legislative elections on Tuesday, have made clear that they oppose a July 2011 target date for the start of a gradual withdrawal from Afghanistan, warning they will press their case when the new Congress convenes in January. Speaking to reporters aboard his plane before landing in Melbourne for annual security talks with Australia, Gates said the effect of the mid-term elections on the withdrawal plan &quot;remains to be seen.&quot; &quot;Partly I think things will depend on our assessment next spring and early summer of how we're doing. I think that will have the biggest impact on the president's decisions in terms of the pacing&quot; of a troop drawdown, Gates said on Saturday. &quot;The administration had always stressed that <u>any reduction in troop levels would be determined by conditions on the ground</u>,&quot; he said. He added, &quot;It will be based more on that than domestic politics.&quot;<br />

During the War of 1812,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 9pt;"> Federalist critics of President James Madison forced the resignation of his secretary of war, and, decades later, the House passed a resolution censuring President James Polk for unconstitutionally beginning a war with Mexico. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Changes in technology also make it easier for <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Congress to micromanage military decisions</span> if it chooses to do so</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 9pt;">. “In the 19th century, simply to send a command and find out what happened in the battle took weeks,” says Professor Issacharoff. “So neither Congress nor the president could micromanage</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">.

It could pass resolutions opposing the war effort over Republican opposition, as Democrats have proposed to do.

<span style="mso-add-space: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">While legislators try to leash a president by tinkering with a weapon, they are ignoring a sufficient leash -- the Constitution. They are derelict in their sworn duty to uphold it. Regarding the most momentous thing government does, make war, <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">constitutional system of checks and balances is broken</span>. </span></strong>Congress can</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 9pt;">, however, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">put the Constitution's bridle back on the presidency. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Congress can end unfettered executive war-making</span> by <em>deciding</em> to. </span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 9pt;">That might not require, but would be facilitated by, enacting the Constitutional War Powers Resolution. Introduced last week by Rep. <span style="color: black;">Walter B. Jones</span>, a North Carolina Republican, it technically amends but essentially would supplant the existing War Powers Resolution, which has been a nullity ever since it was passed in 1973 over President Richard Nixon's veto. Jones's measure is designed to ensure that deciding to go to war is, as the Founders insisted it be, a &quot;collective judgment.&quot; </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">It would prohibit presidents from initiating military actions except to repel or retaliate for sudden attacks on America or American troops abroad, or to protect and evacuate U.S. citizens abroad</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 9pt;">. It would provide for expedited judicial review to enforce compliance with the resolution and would permit the use of federal funds only for military actions taken in compliance with the resolution. It reflects conclusions reached by the <span style="color: black;">War Powers Initiative</span> of the <span style="color: black;">Constitution Project</span>. That nonpartisan organization's 2005 study notes that Congress's appropriation power augments the requirement of advance authorization by Congress before the nation goes to war</span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">.

When Congress authorized the president &quot;to use all necessary and appropriate force&quot; against those complicit in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Congress <em>refused</em> to adopt administration language authorizing force &quot;to deter and preempt any future&quot; terrorism or aggression. The wonder is that the administration bothered to seek this language. The administration's &quot;presidentialists&quot; -- including the president -- believe presidents are constitutionally emancipated from all restraints regarding core executive functions, particularly those concerning defense and waging war. Clearly they think the rejected language would have added nothing to the president's inherent powers. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Congress's powers were most dramatically abandoned and ignored</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 9pt;"> regarding Korea. Although President Harry S. Truman came from a Congress controlled by his party and friends, he never sought congressional authorization to send troops into massive and sustained conflict. Instead, he asserted broad authority to &quot;execute&quot; treaties such as the U.N. Charter. For today's Democrats, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">resistance to unilateral presidential war-making reflects</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> not principled constitutionalism but <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">petulance about the</span> current <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">president</span></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 9pt;">.

it - the very real horror of war.<br />
<br />
<strong>War creates an unescapable addiction that controls every part of society in order to continue the conflict. This quest inevitably leads to human destruction</strong><br />
<strong>Hedges, 2002</strong> [Christopher “War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning” Kindle Edition Locations 41-70]<br />
I learned early on that war forms its own culture. The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug, one I ingested for many years. It is peddled by mythmakers-historians, war correspondents, filmmakers, novelists, and the state-all of whom endow it with qualities it often does possess: excitement, exoticism, power, chances to rise above our small stations in life, and a bizarre and fantastic universe that has a grotesque and dark beauty. It dominates culture, distorts memory, corrupts language, and infects everything around it, even humor, which becomes preoccupied with the grim perversities of smut and death. Fundamental questions about the meaning, or meaninglessness, of our place on the planet are laid bare when we watch those around us sink to the lowest depths. War exposes the capacity for evil that lurks not far below the surface within all of us. And this is why for many war is so hard to discuss once it is over. The enduring attraction of war is this: Even with its destruction and carnage it can give us what we long for in life. It can give us purpose, meaning, a reason for living. Only when we are in the midst of conflict does the shallowness and vapidness of much of our lives become apparent. Trivia dominates our conversations and increasingly our airwaves. And war is an enticing elixir. It gives us resolve, a cause. It allows us to be noble. And those who have the least meaning in their lives, the impoverished refugees in Gaza, the disenfranchised North African immigrants in France, even the legions of young who live in the splendid indolence and safety of the industrialized world, are all susceptible to war's appeal. Those who make war do so for many reasons, although many of these motives are never acknowledged publicly. The Palestinian uprising was not just about throwing the Israelis out of Gaza and the West Bank, but also about crushing the urban elite, the shop owners and businessmen, in East Jerusalem and Gaza City. The &quot;strikes&quot; organized by the sbabab, the young men who fueled the uprising from the refugee camps, hurt the Palestinian community far more than they hurt the Israelis. In Bosnia it was the same, the anger turned against a Communist hierarchy that kept for itself the privileges and perks of power even as power slipped from their hands in the decaying state. There is little that angers the disenfranchised more than those who fail to exercise power yet reap powerful rewards. Despots can be understood, even tolerated, but parasites rarely last long. War is a crusade. President George W Bush is not shy about warning other nations that they stand with the United States in the war on terrorism or will be counted with those that defy us. This too is a jihad. Yet we Americans find ourselves in the dangerous position of going to war not against a state but against a phantom. The jihad we have embarked upon is targeting an elusive and protean enemy. The battle we have begun is never-ending. But it may be too late to wind back the heady rhetoric. We have embarked on a campaign as quixotic as the one mounted to destroy us. &quot;We go forward,&quot; President Bush assures us, &quot;to defend freedom and all that is good and just in the world.&quot; The patriotic bunting and American flags that proliferated in the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were our support for the war mounted against the &quot;axis of evil.&quot; Elected officials, celebrities and news anchors lined up to be counted. On Friday, September 14, three days after the attacks, Congress granted the President the right to &quot;use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks.&quot; The resolution was passed unanimously by the Senate. There was in the House only one dissenting vote, from Barbara J. Lee, a Democrat from California, who warned that military action could not guarantee the safety of the country and that &quot;as we act, let us not become the evil we deplore.&quot; When we ingest the anodyne of war we feel what those we strive to destroy feel, including the Islamic fundamentalists who are painted as alien, barbaric, and uncivilized. It is the same narcotic. I partook of it for many years. And like every recovering addict there is a part of me that remains nostalgic for war's simplicity and high, even as I cope with the scars it has left behind, mourn the deaths of those I worked with, and struggle with the bestiality I would have been better off not witnessing. There is a part of me-maybe it is a part of many of us-that decided at certain moments that I would rather die like this than go back to the routine of life. The chance to exist for an intense and overpowering moment, even if it meant certain oblivion, seemed worth it in the midst of war-and very stupid once the war ended.<br />
<br />
<strong>The alternative is to connect to empathy rather than go to war – we have an individual responsibility to reject war’s myth and accept that our enemies have morals.</strong><br />
<strong>Hedges, 2002</strong> [Christopher “War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning” Kindle Edition Locations 175-98]<br />
Before conflicts begin, the first people silenced-often with violence-are not the nationalist leaders of the opposing ethnic or religious group, who are useful in that they serve to dump gasoline on the evolving conflict. Those voices within the ethnic group or the nation that question the state's lust and need for war are targeted. These dissidents are the most dangerous. They give us an alternative language, one that refuses to define the other as &quot;barbarian&quot; or &quot;evil,&quot; one that recognizes the humanity of the enemy, one that does not condone violence as a form of communication. Such voices are rarely heeded. And until we learn once again to speak in our own voice and reject that handed to us by the state in times of war, we flirt with our own destruction. And yet, despite all this, I am not a pacifist. I respect and admire the qualities of professional soldiers. Without the determination and leadership of soldiers like General Wesley K. Clark we might not have intervened in Kosovo or Bosnia. It was, in the end, a general, Ulysses S. Grant who saved the union. Even as I detest the pestilence that is war and fear its deadly addiction, even as I see it lead states and groups towards self-immolation, even as I concede that it is war that has left millions of dead and maimed across the planet, I, like most reporters in Sarajevo and Kosovo, desperately hoped for armed intervention. The poison that is war does not free us from the ethics of responsibility. There are times when we must take this poison-just as a person with cancer accepts chemotherapy to live. We can not succumb to despair. Force is and I suspect always will be part of the human condition. There are times when the force wielded by one immoral faction must be countered by a faction that, while never moral, is perhaps less immoral. We in the industrialized world bear responsibility for the world's genocides because we had the power to intervene and did not. We stood by and watched the slaughter in Chechnya, Sri Lanka, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Rwanda where a million people died. The blood of the victims of Srebrenica-a designated U.N. safe area in Bosnia-is on our hands. The generation before mine watched, with much the same passivity, the genocides of Germany, Poland, Hungary, Greece, and the Ukraine. These slaughters were, as in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's book Chronicle of a Death Foretold, often announced in advance.&quot; Hutu radio broadcasts from Kigali called on the Interahamwe in Rwanda to carry out genocide. The U.N. Belgian detachment, however, like the Dutch peacekeepers in Srebrenica, stood by and watched. The radio in Kigali was never shut down. The rampages began. There was never any secret about Milosevic's plans for a greater Serbia or his intent to use force and ethnic cleansing to create it. I wrote this book not to dissuade us from war but to understand it. It is especially important that we, who wield such massive force across the globe, see within ourselves the seeds of our own obliteration. We must guard against the myth of war and the drug of war that can, together, render us as blind and callous as some of those we battle. We were humbled in Vietnam, purged, for a while, of a dangerous hubris, offered in our understanding and reflection about the war, a moment of grace. We became a better country. But once again the message is slipping away from us, even as we confront the possibility of devastating biological or nuclear terrorist attacks in Washington or New York. If the humility we gained from our defeat in Vietnam is not the engine that drives our response to future terrorist strikes, even those that are cataclysmic, we are lost. The only antidote to ward off self-destruction and the indiscriminate use of force is humility and, ultimately, compassion. Reinhold Niebuhr aptly reminded us that we must all act and then ask for forgiveness. This book is not a call for inaction. It is a call for repentance.<br />

 <strong>Language is key – it shapes the belief system that makes heroism possible</strong><br />
<strong>Creed</strong>, Dissertation for doctorate of philosophy ; Master of Education and Bachelor of Arts, <strong>2009</strong> [Pamela M. “Myth, Memory and Militarism: The Evolution of an American War Narrative” PDF] <br />
Myth, public memory and militarism begin with language and are grounded in perceived categories of reality that constitute belief systems. In the statement above, President Bush explicitly invokes the glory and romanticism in military myths of warfare on March 13, 2008, four days before the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. In direct contrast to the reconstitution of the myth of the romanticism of war were the four days of emotional testimonies from veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars at the National Labor College near Washington, DC, March 13 – 16, 2008. Five years before, on March 20, 2003, the United States invaded a sovereign nation and launched the powerful – and deadly – Shock and Awe air assault. Many of the former soldiers offering solemn testimonies of brutalities both witnessed and committed since the two wars began revealed the personal grappling of intense and difficult questions they experienced as they journeyed not only through the physical landscape of war, but through the interior emotional landscape of personal transformation. For many of these young Americans a belief system rooted in a tacit acceptance of mythological constructs anchored in public memory that forms a powerful part of American collective conscious was shattered. They are now engaged in the critically reflective act of challenging the categories of the old belief system and of creating new ones. The dynamic process underpinning shifts in personal and/or group understandings of perceived categories of reality can be illustrated though an analysis of speech acts, story-lines, and positions. This study uses positioning theory and narrative analysis to attempt to capture moments of change as individuals begin to challenge a hegemonic state narrative that is anchored in a specific storyline, which is in turn supported by mythical concepts of national identity, character and purpose. Through positioning theory and narrative analysis, I explore this dynamic change within a context of myths that constitute a dominant characterization of American identity and too often, our (mis)perception of others.<br />

<strong>It is possible – warmongering can be replaced with empathy</strong><br />
<strong>Creed,</strong> Dissertation for doctorate of philosophy ; Master of Education and Bachelor of Arts, <strong>2009</strong> [Pamela M. “Myth, Memory and Militarism: The Evolution of an American War Narrative” PDF] <br />
The horror in experiencing death and perversions during war exposes the lowest depths of “evil” to which humans are capable. But despite this, war can provide a purpose for living because it provides an opportunity to resolve to fight for something: the oppressed, the disenfranchised, and in this case, the innocently murdered victims of 9.11, their families, and perhaps most evident in this study - the innocent, wounded, humiliated ‘homeland’. President Bush called on Americans to defend freedom and their homeland and many, filled with feelings of patriotism fueled by anger, fear or humiliation and a need to avenge a sense of damaged national pride, rose to the occasion. An enemy was identified and positioned as alien and barbaric while Americans were positioned as innocent victims; the character roles were easily established. The plot unfolded in the narrative, based on the ‘antecedent condition’ (Cobb, 2007b) that the terrorists were evil and hated us. A binary construct system of us/them fell right into place (Cobb, 2007). And so we went to war. But, while Hedges (2002) reminds us of the psychological and emotive forces that compel us to violence, he also gives us reason to hope. If war (and violence) can provide meaning and purpose, then alternatives to violence exist. Human beings are capable of finding meaning and purpose through love, connection and empathy. The ‘aggressive structures of society’ can transform and create positive channels of energy in place of violent ones. The third analysis of this study will draw from the research discussed in the literature review to explore that transformation and the underlying antecedents for it. Hedges also reminds us that one member of Congress voted against giving President Bush unlimited force. She stated: “…as we act, let us not become the evil we deplore” (as cited in Hedges, 2002). Many of the soldiers I interviewed came to fear that we did. It is my hope that many Americans will also engage in individual and collective critical reflection by asking themselves: Have we?<br />

<strong>View the ballot as a decision between status quo war narratives and the entrance of empathy into foreign policy – this is necessary to begin transformation of the policy praxis.</strong><br />

The final theoretical aspect of the relationship explored in this study is agency. Ultimately, my original goal was to contribute to our understanding of the dynamic process of moving a country toward accepting and supporting war. I begin by examining the construction of an official narrative in response to a national traumatizing event – a crisis. Secondly, the narrative must be ‘taken up’ – or accepted as legitimate both morally and in terms of the policy it generates. This involves a dynamic process of individuals locating the categories of reality presented in the narrative within preexisting categories of self – or national identity. The positions and storyline must be coherent to be accepted; it must ‘feel right’. The cultural power of myth and public memory, rather than reflective critical thinking – or questioning - is critical to this process. Finally, the categories of reality created by the dominant narrative are either accepted or eventually deconstructed, falling apart as personal experience reveals the limits of the narrative’s legitimacy. To explore the aspect of agency in this dynamicexperience and make independent judgments both cognitively and emotionally. This is not necessarily a linear process and often two or all of the aspects are present at once; they argue, however, that at any given moment one aspect dominates and will determine attitudes and hence, behavior. The iterational aspect probably dominates the vast majority of the time for all of us. This space offers actors stability and coherence, which provides boundaries for a sense of reality and identity. We need this space and rely on it to give order to our lives. At certain times, however, especially in moments of crisis, a coherent pattern of categories of reality begin to conflict with personal experiences. In these moments actors have a choice: they can reject the doubts that their experiences reveal and remain attached to the coherence of existing beliefs, or they can begin to reflectively examine the ‘fit’ between experience and beliefs. Once in this space repositioning and transformation can occur.<br />

<strong>The aff is possible after the alternative – embracing empathy opens the space for rejecting war</strong><br />
<strong>Poe, 2008</strong> [Danielle “Replacing Just War Theory with an Ethics of Sexual Difference” Hypatia, Volume 23, Number 2, Spring 2008, pp. 33-47 (Article) Published by Indiana University Press, Project Muse] <br />
In conclusion, just war theory fails because it not only has an overly narrow conception of war but also of war’s costs, which have a negative impact on the very possibility of cooperative relationships between people. Just war theory cannot adequately think through the toll that war takes on what Jane Addams called, “sensitiveness to human life.” Instead of trying to sort just wars from unjust wars, Addams argued for abolition of war, an argument I have pursued here. Bar On provides a viable alternative to war through her concrete recommendations about acting with empathy, recommendations that Irigaray’s emphasis on sexual difference helps foster. An ethics of sexual difference as an alternative to war makes several assumptions about what it means to be human. First, this ethics assumes that humans are at least two. While the differences between humans extend beyond sexual difference and even sexual difference extends beyond male and female, every human is both limited by and connected to others by sex. Second, this ethics assumes that genuinely new relationships between humans are possible. Humans can find new ways to live together by cultivating sexual difference. An ethics of sexual difference demands patience and conscious attention to one’s connections and limits. While some people may reject an ethics of sexual difference because it cannot guarantee results and the successes that it can achieve requires sustained action and sacrifice, the same can be said of war. Wars have never settled conflict nor established anything but a negative peace; they do not establish positive peace. Establishing justice is always an ongoing project, what an ethics of sexual difference offers is a method for establishing justice that treats all means to justice and peace as ends as well. An ethics of sexual difference has meaning in each relationship and each activity, in turn those relationships and activities pave the way to further action.<br />

 <strong>The concept of a “Just war” creates a justification for the destruction of society. Even if they justify changing the strategy in Afghanistan the continuation of the war is on balance destructive.</strong><br />
<strong>Poe, 2008</strong> [Danielle “Replacing Just War Theory with an Ethics of Sexual Difference” Hypatia, Volume 23, Number 2, Spring 2008, pp. 33-47 (Article) Published by Indiana University Press, Project Muse]<br />
The just war tradition has been developing for centuries and is generally traced back to Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas. From the time of its development, just war theory has been used to assess whether or not military force ought to be used. In the Global Studies Encyclopedia, J. C. Kunkel argues that just war theory operates under the principle of double effect: “Under double effect an action that has two contrasting effects, one good and the other evil, may be permissible under certain conditions provided that only the good end is intended” (2003, 313). Thus, the context for just war is one in which the evil effects of war are acknowledged, but if a specific set of conditions is met and the evil is not intended, then war becomes permissible. For Kunkel, proponents of just war theory operate under larger ethical systems, such as deontology, which states that humans have moral duties to obey. One discovers these moral duties by asking whether a particular action can be universalized. For instance, killing human beings cannot be universalized without falling into absurdity. Also, neglecting to preserve one’s life cannot be universalized without falling into absurdity. These two examples lead to the conclusions that a person both has a duty not to kill human beings and a duty to preserve her life. These two duties, however, may come into conflict when in order to defend herself and to preserve her own life, a person uses lethal force against another human being. When a person uses lethal force to defend her life, the conflict is an exemplary case of the principle of double effect because the action produces a good effect, preserving one’s life, and an evil effect, killing a human being. The action via which one both defends to preserve one’s life and kills another is, however, morally permissible, under the principle of double effect if the good effect is intended and is not directly produced by the bad effect (313). Just war theory takes the principle of double effect and applies it to largescale conflicts. In this case, a nation or group can act in a way that is normally excluded from ethical action. Under most conditions, it is not acceptable to kill human beings. According to just war theory, there are times in which a group or nation is morally free to act in such a way that the evil effects of war are the unfortunate by-product of seeking a good effect. To insure that the good effect, and not the evil effect, prevails, just war theory imposes five conditions that must be met for a war to be morally permissible: just cause, right intention, discrimination, proportionality, and legitimate authority (314). Just cause tests the end or purpose for which war is fought. Within the just war tradition, this is translated as defending human beings from death or serious human rights violations. Right intention adds a further condition to just cause by seeking “a caring common ground for resolving conflicts before proceeding to the belligerent military option” (314). If one can prevent serious harm and death without resorting to war in which serious harm and death happens intentionally to combatants and unintentionally to noncombatants, then one can obviate the principle of double effect and have multiple good effects instead of an evil effect and a good effect. Should negotiations fail, then just war theory adds another condition on those who would pursue war as the means to a good effect: discrimination between combatants and noncombatants. Military action cannot seek to harm noncombatants as part of its strategy to resolve a conflict; however, just war theory does allow that foreseeable noncombatant deaths are permissible so long as they are not intended. The fourth criterion that must be met is proportionality, which is an overall assessment of the probability and cost of success. Those who are seeking a good effect in spite of foreseeable, but unintended evil effects, must weigh whether the number of lives that will be saved is likely to be more than the number of lives lost and that the human rights that will be preserved are greater than the human rights that will be sacrificed. If a nation or group can satisfy all of the above conditions, they must also have legitimate authority. A suitable governing body must approve military action (315–17). Although all five conditions of just war theory must be met in order for war and military action to be morally permissible under the principle of double effect, the picture of war that just war theory presents is too narrow especially when it comes to war’s costs, justified or not. If just war theory were followed in its entirety, wars would presumably decrease. In 1915, while World War I was spreading, Jane Addams, who went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931, participated in the founding conference of the Women’s Peace Party in Washington, D.C., where she gave a speech that detailed the many hidden and added costs of war that simple calculations do not measure (1915, 61–64). Addams overall concern was that war destroys “sensitiveness to human life.” War destroys this sensitiveness by diminishing the protection, the nurture, the fulfillment, the conservation, and the ascent of human life. Addams elaborated each of the ways in which war undermines sensitiveness to human life. First, was destroys the protection of human life by instead redirecting toward the war effort resources and medical progress that could be channeled into, for example, curbing infant mortality and childhood diseases. Second, war compromises the nurture of human life by removing soldiers from society to fight—soldiers that would otherwise have been productive, cooperative members of society. The nurturing work is forever lost when soldiers die, and it is forever compromised and undermined even when those soldiers return. War circumscribes the fulfillment of human life when children who might otherwise have entered professions that serve humanity are instead sacrificed to professions that obliterate rather than uplift other human beings. War destroys the conservation of human life by diverting time, talent, and money away from social programs for children, the elderly, and the disabled. Finally, war cuts short the ascent of human life by decreasing sensitivity to human life instead of advancing our sensitiveness to human life between generations. Instead of building on the achievements of the last generation, those who have gone to war and suffered through war must begin again because war produces a hardening against human suffering (62–63). The costs of war that Addams enumerated serve as an important reminder that war takes its toll on some of the most fundamental relations of cooperation among people. Just war theory calculates the evil effects of war but does not define the evil effects of war broadly enough to account for the ways in which not only is justice compromised but sensitiveness to human life is compromised as well. What Addams pointed out was that wars, even justified wars, do far more destruction than what is apparent on the surface. Beyond tremendous loss of life and physical dismemberment, war undermines human trust and human life. Adams comments were against war because she favored its elimination, not its justification. Addams was saying that even with just wars the toll is too great. Stop wars and get on with life-giving practices. Wars destroy the very human trust they hope to protect and defend.<br />

<strong>Don’t evaluate their evidence – it is locked into the ideology of polarization that silences challenges to the war narrative.</strong><br />
<strong>Creed</strong>, Dissertation for doctorate of philosophy ; Master of Education and Bachelor of Arts, <strong>2009</strong> [Pamela M. “Myth, Memory and Militarism: The Evolution of an American War Narrative” PDF]<br />
This story drives the rest of the 9.11/Iraq narrative patterns and creates a new reality – war. It provides justification for the “self-righteous and punitive” (Gilligan, 1996) American response – a response that may be consistent with certain tendencies located in the broader American cultural context. The narrative provides an interpretation of the event that absolves America from questioning not only its own policies but also the darker tendencies existent in our national character. But, just as American policy may have played a considerable role in creating conditions for the motivation behind the attacks, elements of our sense of national identity, character and purpose may have contributed significantly to half the nation overwhelmingly supporting violent retaliation against not only the Taliban, but later Iraq as well. The explanation for the attacks embedded in the 9.11/Iraq narrative patterns fits an understanding of the world in Manichaean terms of absolutes. Both Good and Evil exist as competing forces, each with a life force of its own. This creates an easily understood moral order in which characters and acts can be aligned. Bush appealed to the simplicity of this universe and in doing so, eliminated all complexity from the conflict. People could understand that evil existed within certain people – the Others – and that such people would resort to the most heinous violent acts because they were evil. This neat division of us/them with ‘them’ acting out of an inherent inclination to hate America and its way of life is a familiar story anchored in our historical mythological constructs. It reveals more about us than those we call our enemies. Americans intuitively understand the moral order that shapes our national identity. This local moral order sets up boundaries of good and evil with the U.S. on the ‘good side.’ A storyline emerges easily within this frame, situating actors and action in predictable positions. At their most pernicious these thought-forms position oppositional characters and traits: if one is evil, one is irrational; therefore, rational dialogue becomes pointless. Only a violent response would counter the forces of evil. Half of the population of the U.S. accepted this explanation and would later become ardent supporters of war. Given the simplicity of this narrative’s storyline, we must ask why at least half the American public accepted it as legitimate. What tendencies in the American cultural fabric help us understand the response to this simplistic narrative? Why do we march to the politics of retaliation instead of reconciliation? President Bush implicitly appeals to a political religion of extremism, which amounts to a social/political determinism whereby some within a national group remain fixed in their beliefs and are unified by the beliefs of their leaders. In accepting the narrative constructed by his administration approval is given to the assumptions – or beliefs – underlying the storyline. Approval is given then to the simplistic division of absolutes. If we accept Bush’s explanatory narrative then we are in fact accepting the idea that human beings can be born evil and will therefore be violent because it is in their nature to be so. It is a rather short leap then from the evil individual to the evil group. The implicit assumption in this binary construct is that America is inherently ‘good’. In this social/political determinist scenario, nothing else can be done except to “smoke [evildoers] out of their holes”1 and eliminate the forces of evil altogether. America, as the force for good, must take up that challenge. No alternative course of action is possible. Simplistic narratives based on binary constructs embedded in myth and public memory that incite or perpetuate violence often give rise to a tacit militaristic society that may ironically perceive itself as promoters of peace. President Bush and the American public backed into a corner of social/political determinism and an intractable conflict with the explanatory and retaliatory narrative that served to justify the U.S. unilateral and pre-emptive use of force against Iraq – a sovereign nation unconnected to the 9.11 attacks. For a brief moment Americans did ask, “Why?” America seemed ready to reflect and engage in the critical thinking that would not strip 9.11 of its complexity and relational nature. That quickly faded. Half the nation accepted the us/them dichotomy, which simplified the event. They are evil; we are good. They are irrational; we are rational. They are uncivilized; we are civilized. They use incomprehensible violence against innocent people without cause; we do not. In short, we are essentially, fundamentally different from them. But are we?<br />
