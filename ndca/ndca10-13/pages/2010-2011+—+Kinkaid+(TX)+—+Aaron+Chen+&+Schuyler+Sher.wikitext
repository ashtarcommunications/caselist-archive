Suspicions continue to mount that North Korea torpedoed the Cheonan...impoverished South Korea in 1950 is understandable. To argue that America must continue doing so in 2010 is bizarre.

**STRATFOR 10**<span style="font-weight: normal;"> [5/26/10, “North Korea, South Korea: The Military Balance on the Peninsula,”<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; color: windowtext; padding-right: 10px; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100526_north_korea_south_korea_military_balance_peninsula]]</span>] </span>

Managing Escalation But no one, of course, is interested in another war on the Korean Peninsula ... But current tensions are quickly escalating to a level unprecedented in the post-Cold War period, and the constraints that do exist have never been tested in the way they might be if the situation escalates much further.


**Military presence guarantees US involvement and conflict escalation**

Notwithstanding its occupations of two nations — Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. Empire is at it again, fulfilling its role as the world’s international policeman, this time with respect to North Korea ... bring all overseas troops home from everywhere, and discharge them, and end the U.S. government’s self-assumed role as the world’s international policeman, before the empire plunges our nation into bigger messes than it already has.

The international community is increasingly aware that cooperative diplomacy is the most productive way to tackle the multiple, interconnected global challenges facing humanity, not least of which is the increasing proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction ... The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community.

The most significant component of the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which the Obama administration released on April 6th, was the announcement that the United States will maintain the option of nuclear preemptive attack on North Korea and Iran ... Otherwise, they need to be prepared to endure "all options" the United States has available to it, including nuclear preemptive attack.


**US nuclear response destroys the taboo and shatters deterrence**
**Tannenwald 5****<span style="font-weight: normal;"> [Nina Tannenwald, *Associate Research Professor of International Relations at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, Cambridge Studies in International Relations, The Nuclear Taboo: The United States and the Non-Use of Nuclear Weapons Since 1945, pgs 30-33] </span>**


Still, the nuclear taboo is probably more fragile than other kinds of taboos, and thus is not quite the equivalent of a taboo on pedophilia or incest. ... Few equivalent mechanisms of social containment exist in international society.


**CONTENTION TWO—REGIONALISM:**

**US bilateral alliances are unsustainable—Asian multilateralism is critical to regional stability**
**Francis 6****<span style="font-weight: normal;"> [Neil, *former Australian Ambassador to Croatia and fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs – Harvard University from 05-06, Fall 2006, Harvard International Review, “For an East Asian Union: Rethinking Asia's Cold War Alliances,”<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; color: windowtext; padding-right: 10px; text-decoration: none;">[[http://hir.harvard.edu/index.php?page=article&id=1586]]</span>] </span>**


At the conclusion of the Second World War, the United States established bilateral military alliances in the Asia-Pacific intended to contain Soviet and Chinese communist expansion in the region. ... The determining factor will be ASEAN’s ability to provide the leadership necessary to create a strong, independent East Asian Union.


**Bilateralism inhibits multilateralism—reducing military presence motivates regional cooperation**

The security treaties with the United States and the U.S. troop presence allow the diversion of financial resources to domestic priorities ...When countries in a region facing a security problem cannot offload that problem onto the United States, they take action to contain a crisis and defend their own interests.


**US withdrawal ends South Korean obstructionism to multilateral security mechanisms**

Second, a multilateral security arrangement in Northeast Asia is fundamentally a global security arrangement, as it includes all the global powers except the European Union. ... Moreover, if the U.S. capability and credibility in delivering its security promises to alliance partners are questioned, there will be fewer veto powers in Korean politics against a multilateral security mechanism in Northeast Asia, particularly when such an option still maintains a loose form of the U.S.-Korea alliance.


**South Korean participation is the lynchpin to effective regionalism**
**Choi 8**<span style="font-weight: normal;"> [Dr. Young-Jong, *Professor of International Relations – Catholic University, “South Korea’s Middle Power: Diplomacy and Regional Security Cooperation”, AsiaViews, November, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding-right: 10px;">[[http://new.asiaviews.org/?content=ger53rger567664&voices=]]</span> 20081120141855] </span>

As a ‘middle power, South Korea, can take the initiative and play a key role in the field of regional cooperation. ... South Koreans have also learned from history that South Korea should not be excluded from a table set to discuss critical regional issues. An active foreign policy holds a key to deal with this concern.


**East Asia is on brink of war—only regional solutions solve instability**
**Feng 5/10/10**<span style="font-weight: normal;"> [Zhu, PhD, Professor of School of International Studies and Director of the Center for International & Strategic Studies @ Peking University, has served as research fellow @ Washington based CSIS & Fairbank Center for East Asian Studies @ Harvard University, visiting scholar @ Durham University in UK, “AN EMERGING TREND IN EAST ASIA: MILITARY BUDGET INCREASES AND THEIR IMPACT”, May 10, 2010, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; color: windowtext; padding-right: 10px; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.fpif.org/articles/an_emerging_trend_in_east_asia]]</span>] </span>

If it is not yet an alarmist warning, the rise in military spending in the region is at least a timely wake-up call as to the vulnerability of East Asia security ... Nevertheless, the avoidance of diplomatic clashes and the management of contending security concerns should be a concern for every country in the region.


**Regionalism prevents conflict escalation and nuclear war—bilateralism fails**

After the end of the Cold War, states, regional and international organizations have also adopted a more diversified view on security that also encompasses humanitarian, environmental and economic issues. ... It has been suggested that regional organizations could function more effectively as conductors of conflict prevention than other units within the international system (international or state level), but more research is needed on this issue before any conclusions can be drawn.


**Asian instability causes global nuclear war**
**Landay 2k**<span style="font-weight: normal;"> [Jonathan S., National Security and Intelligence Correspondent, Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, 3-10, Lexis] </span>

Few if any experts think China and Taiwan, North Korea and South Korea, or India and Pakistan are spoiling to fight. But even a minor miscalculation by any of them could destabilize Asia, jolt the global economy and even start a nuclear war. ... Numerous U.S. firms and millions of American jobs depend on trade with Asia that totaled $600 billion last year, according to the Commerce Department.

Conclusion The United States cannot live with the risks involved in an unstable region. ... It is possible by taking the “let them work it out” (the Koreas) approach would certainly be advantageous to the U.S. The time is now for the Eagle to head home.
