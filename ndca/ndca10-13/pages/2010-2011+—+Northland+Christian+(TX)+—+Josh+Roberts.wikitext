Many lawyers apparently view their ability to drive up the opponents' costs as a powerful weapon. 37 The American rule making each party responsible for its own legal fees encourages strategic misuse of discovery, as well as the filing of dilatory and burdensome motions and "nuisance suits." 38 Both state and federal judges, as well as litigators of all types, are particularly critical of the discovery process, rating it the most important cause of both delay and excessive cost in civil litigation. 39 Discovery has become a blunt bludgeon to beat the opposition into submission. Whatever the reason, the bottom line is clear: "There can be little doubt that the system is not working very well. Too many cases take too much time to be resolved and impose too much cost upon litigants and taxpayers alike." 40 High transaction costs of delay and direct expense are the enemies of justice; when these costs become high enough, people who have been injured or had their rights violated may despair of vindication, choosing instead to "lump it." 41 To the extent that delay and expense produce settlements, they can do so unfairly: some plaintiffs are "being coerced by the cost of justice into accepting far less than their due, while some defendants are yielding to opportunistic litigants who unabashedly wield the expenses of litigation as weapons to extort undeserved settlements." 42</span>

These effects are perhaps clearest in Florida, California, and Texas, where Hispanic communities have experienced the most dramatic growth. 2 Many other communities are also having identity crises, either accepting the Spanish-speaking newcomers with open arms or turning them away. 3 Employers have been quick to embrace Hispanic immigrants, for many industries depend heavily on migrant labor. 4 However, they face backlash from many labor unions and politicians who claim that immigrants are stealing American jobs. 5 Finally, </span><span class="Underline">the reality that millions of undocumented migrants successfully cross the U.S.-Mexico border</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with-out [*196] detection </span><span class="Underline">raises national security concerns</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially after September 11, 2001. 6 </span><span class="Underline">While migrant communities continue to grow, U.S. immigration law has lagged</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

That’s key to prevent terrorism
HERMAN ‘09 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Susan N.; Centennial Professor of Law – Brooklyn Law School, “Federal Criminal Litigation in 20/20 Vision” 13 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 461, Summer, l/n)</span>
<span class="Underline"> Drug enforcement has been my chief example of federal crime so far because it has been one of the major components of growth in the federal docket. From comprising a rather small percentage of the federal docket in 1968, by the 1980's, drug cases amounted to about twenty-one percent of the federal criminal docket</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 12 More recently, they amounted to about thirty-five percent of the federal criminal docket. 13 So </span><span class="Underline">decisions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> made by Congress, not only </span><span class="Underline">about what to criminalize</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the statutes themselves, but also about resources allocated to investigation and prosecution, combined with the agency's and prosecutors' enforcement decisions, </span><span class="Underline">have caused the federal courts to experience a tremendous and growing volume of drug cases - currently amounting to about seventeen percent of the federal criminal docket</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 14 </span><span class="Underline">However, a new trend seems to be emerging that may be rivaling drug enforcement in having a major impact on the kinds of cases federal judges confront.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There were some 155,694 federal criminal cases in fiscal year 2008. 15 Analysis shows that many of those new cases were referrals from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). 16 Just when federal drug prosecutions seem to be settling down, immigration enforcement is on the rise, evidently fueling a twenty-seven and a half [*465] percent increase in one year in the number of immigration offense cases on the federal docket, which has greatly contributed to the overall increase in the federal criminal caseload. 17 As Dean Erwin Chemerinsky remarked at the 2008 conference, certain aspects of the approach of the DHS in its anti-terrorism efforts are challenging our model of criminal jurisdiction. 18 </span><span class="Underline">Instead of being backward looking, waiting for someone to commit a crime and then prosecuting him or her for the crime, the DHS aims to prevent terrorism-related crime. Most DHS cases that end up as federal prosecutions are not prosecutions under terrorism-related statutes, but are prosecutions for immigration violations. 19 The DHS seems to be focusing on immigration enforcement as part of its forward-looking strategy to prevent terrorism. Whether or not this strategy is effective can be debated; that the strategy has an impact on the work of the federal courts is not debatable.</span>

Unchecked terrorism will expand and <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">à</span> extinction
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Alexander ’03</span> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">(Yonah, professor and director of the Inter-University for Terrorism Studies in Israel and the United States, August 28, The Washington Times l/n)</span>
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">Last week's brutal suicide bombings in Baghdad and Jerusalem have once again illustrated dramatically that the </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">international community failed</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;">, thus far at least</span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">, to understand the magnitude and implications of the terrorist threats to the very survival of civilization itself</span>.__<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Even the United States and Israel have for decades tended to regard terrorism as a mere tactical nuisance or irritant rather than a critical strategic challenge to their national security concerns. It is not surprising, therefore, that on September 11, 2001, Americans were stunned by the unprecedented tragedy of 19 al Qaeda terrorists striking a devastating blow at the center of the nation's commercial and military powers. Likewise, Israel and its citizens, despite the collapse of the Oslo Agreements of 1993 and numerous acts of terrorism triggered by the second intifada that began almost three years ago, are still "shocked" by each suicide attack at a time of intensive diplomatic efforts to revive the moribund peace process through the now revoked cease-fire arrangements [hudna]. Why are the United States and Israel, as well as scores of other countries affected by the universal nightmare of modern terrorism surprised by new terrorist "surprises"? There are many reasons, including misunderstanding of the manifold specific factors that contribute to terrorism's expansion, such as lack of a universal definition of terrorism, the religionization of politics, double standards of morality, weak punishment of terrorists, and the exploitation of the media by terrorist propaganda and psychological warfare</span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Unlike their historical counterparts, contemporary terrorists have introduced a new scale of violence in terms of conventional and unconventional threats and impact</span>.__ <span style="font-size: 9pt;">The internationalization and brutalization of current and future terrorism make it </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">clear we have entered an Age of Super Terrorism</span>__ __[____<span style="font-size: 12pt;">e.g. biological, chemical, radiological, nuclear and cyber] with its serious implications concerning national, regional and global security concerns.</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;">Two myths in particular must be debunked immediately if an effective counterterrorism "best practices" strategy can be developed [e.g., strengthening international cooperation]. The first illusion is that terrorism can be greatly reduced</span>__,__<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> if not eliminated completely, provided the root causes of conflicts - political, social and economic - are addressed. The conventional illusion is that terrorism must be justified by oppressed people seeking to achieve their goals and consequently the argument advanced by "freedom fighters" anywhere, "give me liberty and I will give you death," should be tolerated if not glorified. This traditional rationalization of "sacred" violence often conceals that the real purpose of terrorist groups is to gain political power through the barrel of the gun, in violation of fundamental human rights of the noncombatant segment of societies. For instance, Palestinians religious movements [e.g., Hamas, Islamic Jihad] and secular entities [such as Fatah's Tanzim and Aqsa Martyr Brigades]] wish not only to resolve national grievances [such as Jewish settlements, right of return, Jerusalem] but primarily to destroy the Jewish state. Similarly, Osama bin Laden's international network not only opposes the presence of American military in the Arabian Peninsula and Iraq, but its stated objective is to "unite all Muslims and establish a government that follows the rule of the Caliphs." </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> second</span> __<span style="font-size: 12pt;">myth is that strong action against terrorist infrastructure</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> [leaders, recruitment, funding, propaganda, training, weapons, operational command and control] </span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">will only increase terrorism</span>__.<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> The argument here is that law-enforcement efforts and military retaliation inevitably will fuel more brutal acts of violent revenge. Clearly, if this perception continues to prevail, particularly in democratic societies, there is the danger it will paralyze governments and thereby encourage further terrorist attacks. In sum, past experience provides useful lessons for a realistic future strategy. The prudent application of force has been demonstrated to be an effective tool for short- and long-term deterrence of terrorism</span>.<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> For example, Israel's targeted killing of Mohammed Sider, the Hebron commander of the Islamic Jihad, defused a "ticking bomb." The assassination of Ismail Abu Shanab - a top Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip who was directly responsible for several suicide bombings including the latest bus attack in Jerusalem - disrupted potential terrorist operations. Similarly, the U.S. military operation in Iraq eliminated Saddam Hussein's regime as a state sponsor of terror</span>.<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Thus</span>__,__ __<span style="font-size: 12pt;">it behooves those countries victimized by terrorism to understand a cardinal message</span>__<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> communicated by Winston Churchill to the House of Commons on May 13, 1940: "</span>__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Victory at all costs, victory in spite of terror, victory however long and hard the road may be</span>:__

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%;">Bill would clarify conflict that has hampered needle-exchange programs, Cara Matthews has been a statehouse correspondent in the Albany Bureau since August 2005. Prior to that, she covered Putnam County government and politics at The Journal News for nearly five years., June 29th, 2010 at 7:19 pm by [[http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/author/cmatthews|Cara Matthews]]</span>






<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%; text-align: left;">Both the Senate and Assembly have passed legislation to clarify that people who are returning used syringes as part of a needle-exchange program cannot be arrested and charged with possession if a residual amount of a drug remains in the syringe. The bill now goes to Gov. David Paterson, who is expected to sign it. </span>



<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%; text-align: left;">The state has had needle-exchange programs for more than 10 years, but some people who have returned syringes lawfully have been arrested on drug charges because of a conflict between state public-health law and penal code. That has led to addicts dumping used syringes, rather than surrendering them, because they are afraid of getting arrested. </span>



<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%; text-align: left;">“Throwing an infected syringe into the gutter, out of fear of prosecution for possession of a microscopic trace of substance, is not an acceptable method of protecting public health,” said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, D-Manhattan, who sponsored the legislation in his house. “This bill addresses the serious risks improper syringe disposal poses to the population and creates measures that may be taken to prevent possible exposure.” </span>



<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%; text-align: left;">Some law enforcement agencies and defense attorneys are not familiar with a state public-health law that makes syringe returns legal if they are part of a recognized needle-exchange program, the Assembly said. If signed by the governor, the legislation would change the penal law to clarify that having a used syringe doesn’t violate the prohibition on illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia as long as the person participates in a recognized exchange program. The state Division of Criminal Justice Services would be required to educate law enforcement officials on the legislation. </span>



<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%; text-align: left;">Paterson proposed the legislation last year. It passed the Assembly but not the Senate because of the month-long Senate leadership coup. </span>



<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%; text-align: left;">The conflict between the public-health law and penal code has led to a “chilling effect around a syringe exchange” and lower participation, according to the Drug Policy Alliance and VOCAL NY-Users Union, which includes current and former drug users. Syringe-exchange programs have been found to reduce the transmission of HIV/AIDS. Exchanges provide testing for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C, condoms, counseling and referrals to drug treatment, the groups said. </span>



<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%; text-align: left;">“By clarifying the law on syringe possession, there will be less confusion by cops and communities alike about accessing syringe exchanges, which will save New Yorkers tens of millions of dollars in health-care costs each year while increasing the health of communities,” Evan Goldstein, policy associate at the Drug Policy Alliance, said in a statement.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%;">Examples of some affs that meet my interpretation are: </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%;">A. The aff can defend a world where representative payees receive drug users money on their behalf because Social Security doesn’t want people to use their benefits on drugs. </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%;">B. Assertive Community Treatment: ACT is a service-delivery model that provides comprehensive, locally based treatment to people with serious and persistent illnesses. Dual Diagnosis, a premier organization for treating persons with addiction and mental health disorders, did a study on Modified Assertive Community Treatment Services, and how it affects people who abuse illegal drugs, so there is definitely literature on this debate. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 90%;">Coercion is defined ...occurs in the criminal justice system through drug and mental health courts, when clients choose an enforced treatment regimen with judicial and clinical oversight in the community in lieu of criminal charges and possible incarceration.</span>
