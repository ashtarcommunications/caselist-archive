Let’s say you have two entangled photons and you are measuring their polarization, or the direction in which they are oscillating. If one photon has a vertical polarization, you know the other one is going to be exactly the same. The trouble is that quantum mechanics works on probability – before you measure a particle’s polarization it is equally likely to be horizontal or vertical. According to the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, particles exist in some strange simultaneous vertical/horizontal state until you make a measurement. </span>//

At its best, <span style="font-size: 9.5pt;">science might be seen to represent the closest thing we have to universality, perhaps even truth. In the roiling realm of international relations, science diplomacy merits considerably more attention than it has recently been accorded.</span> It may be that the conference in Dunedin, like the meeting in Oslo, will break new ground.
