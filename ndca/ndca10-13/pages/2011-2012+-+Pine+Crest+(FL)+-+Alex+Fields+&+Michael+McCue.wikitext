===Plan=== 

Text: The United States federal government should fully fund and pursue satellite hardening, Space Situational Awareness, satellite reconstitution, the launching of small satellites, and the development of fast-launch mechanisms through Operationally Responsive Space.

===China Adv=== 

Advantage 1 is China:

Attack by China is inevitable- 4 reasons:

A. The perception of vulnerability of our space assets – US-Sino competition is unique
Tellis 8 (Ashley J., senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, specializing in international security, defense, and Asian strategic issues. While on assignment to the U.S. Department of State as senior adviser to the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, October 2008, China’s Space Capabilities and U.S. Security Interests, http://www.carnegieendowment.org/2008/10/01/china-s-space-capabilities-and-u.s.-security-interests/68r)DR

While it is no doubt easier to assess the …offensive capabilities possessed by an adversary.

B. Chinese technical journals, doctrine, analysis, and rising power
Wortzel, 8 - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research… will have access to space in any future conflict.

C. PLA will initiate it because they’re insulated from pressure, makes high risk of crisis instability and miscalc
MacDonald, 11 - Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)

One characteristic of too many wars … seems high and likely to grow.


D. China is weaponizing space – multiple indicators prove our epistemology is correct
Peoples 8 – Lecturer in International Relations School of Sociology, Politics and International Studies, PhD (12/2/2008, Columba, “Assuming the Inevitable? Policy Perspectives on the Weaponization of Outer Space”, Contemporary Security Policy, Vol. 29, Is. 3) MGM

It would, however, be somewhat simplistic … vulnerable to China's less advanced military.’50


Chinese attack is bad- 3 reasons:

A. Wipes out US space assets, escalating to first strike and war
Tellis 8 (Ashley J., senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, specializing in international security, defense, and Asian strategic issues. While on assignment to the U.S. Department of State as senior adviser to the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, October 2008, China’s Space Capabilities and U.S. Security Interests, http://www.carnegieendowment.org/2008/10/01/china-s-space-capabilities-and-u.s.-security-interests/68r)DR

The cumulative consequences of China’s space and counterspace …but also a variety of outcomes terrestrially.

B. Undermines deterrence, risking miscalculation and immediate nuclear escalation because of perception of vulnerability
Burke, 06 – Lt Col, USAF, command space professional with operational experience in missile operations, space surveillance, space control, missile warning, and command and control (Alan, “SPACE THREAT WARNING: FOUNDATION FOR SPACE SUPERIORITY, AVOIDING A SPACE PEARL HARBOR,” https://www.afresearch.org/skins/RIMS/display.aspx?moduleid=be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153&mode=user&action=researchproject&objectid=07acf878-3a5f-4a2c-8259-4a34c0717e9b)

The erosion of the US ability to execute … with US satellites without fear of retribution.57

C. Causes a pre-emptive US strike on China – this escalates
Tellis 7, Senior Associate @ Carnegie (Ashley, Senior Associate @ Carnegie, Survival, Autumn, “China’s Military Space Strategy”, ingenta)

Finally, the growing Chinese capability for space … accidents and further misperception.96

All three scenarios culminate in extinction
Strait Times 2K (Ching, Senior Writer at the Strait Times, “No one gains in a war over Taiwan,” June 25th, Lexis)

THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war … the destruction of civilization.

===Hegemony Adv=== 

Advantage 2 is Hegemony:

We’ll isolate 2 scenarios:

The 1st is dominance-

China is directly challenging US space superiority, we must decrease our vulnerability to maintain it
Brownfield 8/19 (Mike, Assistant Director of Strategic Communications at The Heritage Foundation, “Morning Bell: China Threatening U.S. Space Superiority,” 8/19/11, accessed 9/3/11, http://blog.heritage.org/2011/08/19/morning-bell-china-threatening-u-s-space-superiority/, MichaelMarcus)

Yesterday in New York City, NASA’s last space shuttle astronauts …space so that it can defend itself, its friends, and allies.

This destroys US military capabilities and our ability to project power- winning the space race is key
Whitelaw 7 (Kevin, US News and World Report, national security, intelligence, and international affairs, 12-04-07, China Aims High Beijing's blast sets off a debate about how to protect U.S. satellites, http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2007/12/04/china-aims-high?PageNr=1)DR

That's just one small example of how integral satellites …infrastructure, including ATMs and traffic lights.

Effective space deterrence contributes to general deterrence of conflict and political leadership
Morgan, 10 - defense policy researcher working in RAND Corporation's Pittsburgh Office. Prior to joining RAND in January 2003, Dr. Morgan served a 27-year career in the U.S. Air Force (Forrest, “Deterrence and First-Strike Stability in Space,”
http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA522541&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf

Space Deterrence and General Deterrence Although this assessment focuses specifically on …deterrence fortifies general deterrence and stability.

Heg is good- precludes and de-escalates conflict
Zhang and Shi, 11 -– *Yuhan Zhang is a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, D.C.; Lin Shi is from Columbia University. She also serves as an independent consultant for the Eurasia Group and a consultant for the World Bank in Washington, D.C. (America’s decline: A harbinger of conflict and rivalry, http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/01/22/americas-decline-a-harbinger-of-conflict-and-rivalry/)

This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, …will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy


Scenario 2 is the aerospace industry-

Aerospace industry collapse will be fast and take decades to recover from—we’ve reached the tipping point
Albaugh 11 -- Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and member of the International Academy of Astronautics (4/27/2011 , Jim Albaugh, “Keeping America’s Lead in Aerospace”, Speech to the 10th Annual Aviation Summit US Chamber of Commerce, http://www.aia-aerospace.org/newsroom/speeches_testimony/)

Today we take America’s industrial base for granted, … launch vehicle. To me, that’s unconscionable.

ORS is critical to revitalizing the industrial base – it’s been shrinking in recent years
AIA 10 (Aerospace Industries Association, represents leading manufacturers and suppliers of civil, military, and business aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aircraft systems, space systems, aircraft engines, missiles, materiel and related components, equipment, services and information technology, 2010, Operationally Responsive Space: An AIA Priority, http://www.aia-aerospace.org/newsroom/publications/aia_eupdate/march_2010_eupdate/new_aia_report_on_operationally_responsive_space_launch_systems/)DR

Could the current economic crisis affecting … However sometimes history repeats itself.

===Solvency=== 

Contention 3 is Solvency:

The plan establishes credible deterrence by denial – when countries know that we have systems that can’t be damaged, they won’t attack
Sejba, 10 - USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf)

===Framework:=== 

The sole purpose of the ballot is to answer the resolutional question: Is the outcome of the enactment of a topical plan better than the status quo or a competitive policy option?

This is best:

1) __Fairness__ --- the grammar of the resolution is decisively policy-oriented
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ericson 3</span> (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts – California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater’s Guide, Third Edition, p. 4)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Proposition of Policy:… future action that you propose.</span>

Grammar is critical to fairness --- ignoring it justifies throwing out the resolution altogether, destroying predictability. Alternative frameworks are infinite, lack clear criteria increasing judge intervention, and are biased toward the Neg by allowing them to pick any one representation in the 1AC to criticize for 8 minutes. Fairness outweighs --- it’s critical for our ability to engage their arguments in the first place.

2) __Plan-focus__ --- only ‘policy debate’ teaches a logical method for real-world policymaking --- their’s will privilege form over substance, creating illegal outcomes where good ideas are negated. This undermines the __singular logical purpose__ of debate: the search for the best policy. Logical policymaking is the biggest educational impact --- any other learning is worthless because it can’t be applied to the real world.

<span class="Underline">**3) Even if they win their framework arguments we should still get to weigh our affirmative:**</span>
<span class="Underline">**A) Time and strategy skew- not letting the affirmative frame and weigh their affirmative moots the entire 1ac- it puts the aff at a structural disadvantage as we have dedicated 8 minutes to our advocacy and the negative would get one more speech then us**</span>


B) Predictability --- they can pick any ‘K framework of the week’ and we’d never be able to keep up. The shifting nature of their argument destroys Aff ground, ensuring the Neg is always a step ahead.

<span class="Underline">**C)Middle Ground- our framework is more inclusive.

**B) Violation- the plan deploys debris mitigation systems on the ground, which is below the mesosphere**



**C) Standards**



**1. Limits- allowing development of ground based systems that affect objects in space exponentially expands the system- kills research burden, allows affs like BMD which aren’t space-specific education**



**2. Ground- they spike out of our DAs and Ks based on going into space and focusing outward**



**D) Prefer competing interpretations- only objective way to evaluate T, reasonability creates judge intervention**

Congress and the executive will delegate authority to the agency to create recommendations and allow 90 days to pass legislation maintaining existing legislative baselines. If Congress does not pass legislation revising the Commission’s recommendations within the specified period, those recommendations will enter into legal force.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Focusing on major power drama scenarios is the first step to forgetting our own responsibility for the many expressions of violence in the world.

==<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Framework vs K Affs</span>== 


A. Interpretation --- the ballot’s sole purpose is to answer the resolutional question: Is the outcome of the enactment of a topical plan better than the status quo or a competitive policy option?



Definitional support ---



1. “Resolved” before a colon reflects a legislative forum

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Army Officer School 4</span> (5-12, “# 12, Punctuation – The Colon and Semicolon”, http://usawocc.army.mil/IMI/wg12.htm)



The colon introduces… That this council petition <span class="underline">the mayor.</span>



2. “United States Federal Government should” means the debate is __solely about__ the outcome of a policy established by governmental means

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ericson 3</span> (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts – California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater’s Guide, Third Edition, p. 4)



<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action… perform the future action that you propose. </span>



B. Violation --- they claim advantages that are independent of the plan



C. Reasons to prefer:



1. __Predictable limits__ --- the grammar of the resolution is based upon enacting a policy. They justify arbitrarily changing the question of the debate to an infinite number of potential frameworks, ensuring the Aff always wins. Grammar is the only predictable basis for determining meaning; it’s the foundation for how words interact. Ignoring it justifies changing the focus of the debate, mooting the resolution altogether.



Worse, the potential list is literally infinite --- only our interpretation limits debate to promote politically relevant dialogue

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lutz 00</span> (Donald, Professor of Political Science – U Houston, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p. 39-40)



<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Aristotle notes in the Politics that political theory…not in the moral vision of the non-theorist. </span>







The NDT caselist proves the potential frameworks are infinite

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The product of this disagreement has been a veritable boon…</span><span class="underline">And this is only a partial list. </span>





2. __Ground__ --- advantages that aren’t linked to the outcome of the plan are impossible to negate. They can claim “critical” arguments outweigh disads linked to the plan or shift their advocacy to avoid impact-turns.



3. __Plan-focus__ --- critical frameworks change the role of the ballot from a yes / no question about the desirability of the plan to something else. This undermines the __singular logical purpose__ of debate: the search for the best policy. Logical policymaking is the biggest educational impact --- any other learning is worthless because it can’t be applied to the real world.





D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness and outweighs all other issues because without it, debate is impossible

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shively 00</span> (Ruth Lessl, Assistant Prof Political Science – Texas A&M U., Partisan Politics and Political Theory, p. 181-182)
