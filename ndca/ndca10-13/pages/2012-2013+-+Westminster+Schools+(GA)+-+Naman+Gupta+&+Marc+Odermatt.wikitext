<span style="font-size: 8pt;">5.6 Direct Costs of Not Deepening Harbors to Accommodate Larger Ships </span>__The direct costs of not deepening harbors to accommodate larger ships could be measured as cargo diverted to a foreign port and higher per unit transportation costs which would result in higher commodity prices making imported goods more expensive and exported goods and less competitive in world markets. These__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> types of </span>__impacts__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> could </span>__dampen international trade that has significantly contributed to the Nation’s recent economic expansion.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The potential impacts of these costs are best demonstrated with an example. Assume a fully loaded 6,000 TEU containership is sailing on a trade route from Rotterdam to New York. Fully loaded the ship sails at a draft of 46 feet and requires water depths of about 51 feet to safely navigate. To sail into New York, which is assumed to have a 45 foot channel, the vessel would likely offload cargo at the Canadian port of Halifax. Sailing with a lighter load results in a 35 percent cost increase per TEU. 34 This substantial increase in transportation costs could result in a vessel operator bypassing the constrained port altogether, at least for discretionary hinterland cargo. The point is that </span>under such circumstancesthere is a significant impact on<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> port </span>competitiveness and __depending on location and other factors, trade may be lost to the Nation.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">At the very least, the constrained port would be used inefficiently resulting in higher transportation costs that are ultimately reflected in commodity prices, and a loss of revenue for the port and local economies. 5.7 Conclusion </span>__The U__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>__needs to maintain its competitive position in the global marketplace by providing an efficient port system fully capable of servicing new generations of containerships.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Public ports in the U.S. have allocated huge sums of capital in an effort to prepare their facilities for growing container trade and larger containerships. Given the cost pressures facing the Nation’s ports and since ports have taken a major step in securing an efficient maritime transportation network, perhaps the Federal role in deep draft navigation channels should be expanded as a matter of national policy. </span>

In a world of lockouts and lockdowns, any link that transmits systemic financial pressures across markets through arbitrage or portfolio-based risk management, or that allows diseases to be easily spread from one country to the next by tourists and wildlife, or that otherwise facilitates unwelcome exchanges of any kind will be viewed with suspicion and dealt with accordingly.

__The push by U.S. ports for more federal dredging dollars is finally beginning to make waves in Congress__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>
__Language that would require all funds collected through the Harbor Maintenance Tax to be used for navigation projects is likely to be included in the final surface transportation bill__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>That's a major breakthrough<span style="font-size: 8pt;">for maritime advocates who argue it's unfair that roughly one-third of the collected taxes are used to plug other budget gaps. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund collects roughly $1.5 billion annually from importers, who pay a rate of 0.125 percent of the value of their cargo. </span>__The HMTF is expected to have a surplus of nearly $7 billion by the end of fiscal 2013__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, according to the Association of American Port Authorities. </span>
__The ports' argument that more money needs to be spent on dredging to create jobs and boost trade also is gaining traction on the front line of congressional funding allocations__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Under the latest House energy and water appropriations bill, ports in fiscal 2013 would get $1 billion for maintenance dredging. That's the largest single annual federal award for dredging and about $170 million more than the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers received last time around. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">"This is a significant development. It wasn't so long ago that (the corps) only received $750 million," said Paul Bea, principal of PHB Public Affairs, a maritime consulting firm. </span>
__Ports will actually get less dredging help__ __in the next fiscal year than in fiscal 2012, however__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, said Barry Holliday, executive director of Dredging Contractors of America. Funding tied to military project dredging and disaster relief pushed total maintenance dollars to about $1.1 billion in fiscal 2012.</span>__The latest appropriation shows a congressional willingness to spend more, even if the full allocation of HMTF dollars would fall short in tackling port needs__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Holliday said. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Realize America's Maritime Promise Act, or RAMP Act, has been the major driver in convincing Congress the HMTF needs reform and more spending is needed. The legislation was included in the House's 90-day extension, which paved the way for the chamber to begin conferencing with the Senate on the surface transportation bill. The Senate has similar but less forceful language in its two-year, $109 billion plan. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This boosts the chances that HMTF reform language will make it in the final version of the transportation bill, but it's just the first step in blocking appropriators from shifting money out of the fund for non-dredging purposes. Even if the RAMP Act language is adopted, it's not a mandate. Supporters would have to call a point of order in appropriation committees to slap the hands of would-be siphoners, Bea said. </span>
__Despite the positive signs for ports, they are still stifled in getting authorization and funding for **new**__ __major navigation projects.__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Historically, </span>__the Water Resources Development Act has been the vehicle for ports to get authorization for such projects__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and funding is granted separately through the annual appropriations process. The last WRDA was in 2007, and </span>__there is no new version on the horizon__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even if there were, it's unclear how it would proceed under the House's ban on earmarks and the Senate's similar stance. Not only do the earmarks allow legislators to include language relating to their home ports, but they also provide impetus for representatives and senators to back the bill. </span>
__The **federal uncertainty**__ __hits the East Coast__ __particularly hard, because only a few ports have the funding and approval necessary to deepen their channels.____Ports__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">such as Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C, </span>__need deeper harbors to handle larger ships able to pass through the__ __expanded Panama Canal in 2015.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">That supporters of Charleston and Savannah are preparing to take on the deepening expenses themselves reflects just how little optimism there is for federal help. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Bea said maritime advocates and legislators are attempting to figure out how they can get projects funded and authorized in new ways. One such approach is by Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., to create a national assessment of which ports should be deepened. Plans to create a program for prioritization in authorization and funding come with their own set of problems, however, Holliday said. "When you start prioritizing ports, you begin picking winners and losers," he said. </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Aside from skepticism of the government's ability to discern champions from laggards,</span>__prioritization sidesteps the issue that **most, if not all, ports**__ __need funding to maintain their infrastructure and grow.____Such a prioritization process could dampen efforts to boost overall port spending__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That could, unfortunately, fit too well with Congress's history of favoring easy short-term fixes over harder, more meaningful long-term decisions. </span>

**Cohen and Monaco 8** – *associate professor of Economics at the University of Hartford and ** Professor of Economics at California State University, Long Beach. She is a recognized expert in the economics of the trucking industry and has published extensively on the wages, characteristics, and working conditions of port truck drivers, port labor issues, port infrastructure, and the effects of port deregulation.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The sign and significance of the elasticity of variable costs with respect to the average ports infrastructure in neighboring states (N) is particularly intriguing. We find that εVC,N = 0.129 (p-value = .003) in the SAR model, approximately half the 0.239 (p-value < 0.001) in the SUR model. This implies that </span>increasing neighboring states’ ports infrastructure<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> stocks by 1 percent </span>leads to an increase in a particular state’s manufacturing costs<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by 0.129 percent. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This can be attributed to the presence of external diseconomies of scale</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as was found by Cohen and Morrison Paul (2005) in the context of food manufacturing industry costs. </span>If<span style="font-size: 8pt;">13 </span>neighboring states become too large<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in terms of the sizes of their ports),</span> these neighbors may draw away productive resources from a p<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">articular</span> state, leading to higher <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">manufacturing </span>costs <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in that state</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Boarnet (1998) found a similar phenomenon in an analysis of California county highway capital stocks. A</span>__n interesting ramification of the finding of external diseconomies from neighboring states’ ports here is that from society’s viewpoint__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>__the overall stock of ports infrastructure may be too large__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__When choosing the optimal size of ports infrastructure, individual states do not account for these diseconomies faced by a neighboring state,__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and thus </span>__states may choose too much ports infrastructure__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>//Assistance from a higher level of government may lead state policy makers to coordinate their decisions and choose a more “socially” desirable level of ports infrastructure//<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is important to qualify this finding, however, that </span>__within individual states there may be too little ports infrastructure investment__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This may be due to the fact that ports infrastructure investment undertaken at the county or regional level within a particular state may impose benefits upon manufacturing firms in nearby counties or regions within that state, due to the proximity to improved ports infrastructure. If this is the case, then state or regional port authorities could be helpful through playing a more prominent role in the ports infrastructure investment decision making process. In order to assess these overall impacts, a county level follow-up study would be extremely helpful, either for ports within a particular state, or for ports over counties or regions across all states. The spatial autocorrelation parameter estimates are positive and significant for the cost function equation as well as for each of the input demand equations. The sign and significance of these estimates implies that a shock (to costs or input demands) that hits some states, such as a hurricane in the Gulf coast, spills over to become shocks (to manufacturing 14costs and/or input demands) in a neighboring state. Thus, in addition to the agglomeration economies measure described above, spatial autocorrelation can be an additional source of spillovers. We now describe findings on the relationships between the infrastructure variables. First, εSHVH,S <0 and εSHVS,H <0, but both are insignificant. </span>__These findings imply that additional ports infrastructure has no significant impact on the shadow value of highways, and additional highways have no impact on the shadow value of ports infrastructure, respectively__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This result is robust in both the SUR and spatial autocorrelation adjusted models. Second, εSHVN,S <0 and is significant in the spatial autocorrelation model. This implies that </span>__a smaller ports infrastructure stock in a particular state results in additional ports in neighboring states causing variable costs to increase in the particular state__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 2 In other words, states that are “contracting” (states with decreasing ports infrastructure stocks) are hit harder by the external diseconomies of scale due to additional neighboring states’ ports infrastructure, while the shadow value of additional ports in neighboring states decreases in states that increase their ports infrastructure. On the other hand, εSHVS,N was insignificant in both estimations, implying </span>__that additional ports infrastructure in neighboring states has no impact on the shadow value of ports infrastructure in a particular state__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There are other insights that the cost function can yield, including information on the elasticities of substitution between inputs and the infrastructure variables. One finding is that with both estimation procedures, </span>__the shadow value of ports increases when the number of production workers, non-production workers, or materials inputs increase__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is an important finding, since </span>__it implies that additional workers or materials inputs__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (that is, economic activity) </span>__make ports more valuable to manufacturing firms__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Second, the shadow value of neighboring states’ ports with respect to each of the three variable inputs is positive and significant. The interpretation here is that </span>with fewer manufacturing <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">inputs in a particular state, </span>additional ports in <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">neighboring states </span>lead to higher costs to <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">manufacturing</span> firms <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in the particular state.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This may be related to the negative external economies of scale from neighboring states’ ports infrastructure. </span>States with decreasing amounts of manufacturing inputs are more severely impacted by the negative external economies of scale than growing states<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (i.e., states with increasing manufacturing employment). The elasticity of the shadow value of ports with respect to private capital is insignificant, which says that private capital and ports are neither substitutes nor complements. Finally, the elasticity of the shadow value of ports with respect to time is positive and significant. </span>__This finding implies that the pure passage of time makes additional ports in a particular state more valuable to manufacturing firms in that state__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Similarly, </span>__the elasticity of the shadow value of other states’ ports with respect to time is positive and significant, implying that the passage of time (__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">holding all other cost determinants constant) </span>__makes additional neighboring states’ ports capital stocks more valuable to a particular state in terms of how this extra capital would reduce manufacturing costs in the particular state.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Conclusions </span>__Using____both__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> seemingly </span>__unrelated regression and spatial autocorrelation models, we estimate input demands together with a cost function model with state-level data. This allows us to measure the effects on manufacturing from increasing ports and highways 16infrastructure__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__We find that increasing ports and highway infrastructure will decrease manufacturing costs at the state-level. However__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>//if a neighboring state increases its port infrastructure, manufacturing costs will increase//<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">evidence of </span>__external diseconomies of scale__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, we find no significant relationship between the shadow value of ports and highways infrastructure or the shadow value of highways and port infrastructure.</span>

**D. Constitution**
**AAPA 11** – AAPA represents 160 of the leading seaport authorities in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean and more than 300 sustaining and associate members, firms and individuals with an interest in seaports (American Association of Port Authorities, “The U.S. Government’s Historic Role in Developing and Maintaining Landside and Waterside Connections to Seaports”, March 2011, [[http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/Transportation%20and%20the%20Constitution1.pdf)//GP]]

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Over time these constitutional responsibilities have been further defined and</span> __our Constitution has formed the basis for the U.S. government to play a significant role in our nation’s transportation and infrastructure system__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As established in the timeline on page 2, over the years the leaders of our country saw that it was in the national interest to ensure that our ports, waterways, railways and highways benefited from federal __oversight and__ support. For four centuries, beginning with the founding of the Jamestown colony, seaports have served as a vital economic lifeline for America by bringing goods and services to people, creating economic activity and enhancing the overall quality of life. Seaports continue to be the critical link for access to the global marketplace here in the United States handling more than 99 percent of cargoes. </span>__Maintaining our national infrastructure that supports foreign and interstate commerce is__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">not only </span>__a federal responsibility__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> but is in the national interest as established by our forefathers. In fact, </span>__improving__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> waterways and coastal </span>__ports__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for navigation and national security </span>__is____the most federal of infrastructure responsibilities__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, dating to the early missions assigned the Continental Army by then General George Washington. In Federalist Paper #42 written by James Madison, a case is made that the powers conferred by the Constitution for regulating commerce and establishing post roads are essential. He wrote: “Nothing which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the States can be deemed unworthy of the public care.” Back to Basics In these times of a tightening Federal Budget, as Congress and the Administration take on the task of prioritizing expenditures, we need to identify and prioritize core federal missions that are in the national interest and help to revitalize our economy. Modern, navigable seaports are vital</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to international commerce and economic prosperity. For this to be a reality, </span>__Federal government investment is needed to maintain and strengthen our nation’s infrastructure that supports foreign and interstate commerce____— the underpinnings of our economic security__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These are wise investments that pay dividends immediately and over time, and form the backbone of our economy and society at large. </span>__Investments in port infrastructure are multipliers, as they create infrastructure that allows long-term job creation,__**__positioning the United States as a leader__** __in international trade and commerce__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Waterways Pursuant to Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, Congress, by statute, has reserved jurisdiction over navigable waters for the federal government, which can determine how the waters are used, by whom, and under what conditions. As a result, the federal government takes the lead in building, maintaining, and operating the nation’s navigation channels. Authority to construct and maintain navigation projects on behalf of the United States was granted to the Corps of Engineers in the General Survey Act of 1824. In 1826, Congress passed the first Rivers and Harbors Act and provided funds to the Corps to make specific navigation improvements to the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri Rivers. Congress has continued to appropriate funds for specific navigation projects and the Corps has played a dual role by assessing, as well as implementing, needed projects in federal navigation channels. In 1899, Congress enacted the Rivers and Harbors Act, which makes it unlawful to undertake any modifications of navigable water channels unless authorized by the Secretary of the Army on the recommendation of the Corps of Engineers. It is well established that </span>__the Commerce Clause is the basis for **exclusive federal jurisdiction** over navigable waterways__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__The__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">landmark United States </span>__Supreme Court__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">case of Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1 (1824) </span>__found that navigation of vessels in and out of__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the</span> __ports__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of the nation</span> __is a form of interstate commerce and that **federal law takes precedence**__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Federal authority over navigable waterways has been repeatedly affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Highways and Intermodal Connectors With interstate commerce and connectivity as the impetus, the federal role in ensuring a contiguous system of roads spanning the states has been implicit in our federal government since the writing of the Constitution. These powers were granted to Congress in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution by the clauses describing the regulation of commerce with foreign nations and among the several states …” and the responsibility “to establish Post Offices and Post Roads.” As the timeline illustrates, since the founding of this great nation, our most visionary leaders have engaged in national infrastructure initiatives. The highway system as we know it today was largely borne out of the 1939 Bureau of Public Roads report commissioned by Franklin Delano Roosevelt titled Toll Roads and Free Roads, which proposed a map of a transcontinental national superhighway system. This led to President Eisenhower’s Federal-Aid Highway of 1956 and subsequent development of the Interstate System. Without the federal role in planning, coordinating and providing funding, our current system of inter-regional highways would not have been possible. Today, this federal responsibility continues through the surface transportation programs funded largely by federal gas taxes. Highways, arterials and secondary roads that are identified as being important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility are classified as part of the National Highway System (NHS) and are eligible for federal funds through the federal-aid program. Road infrastructure that accesses major intermodal terminals, including seaports, are designated NHS connectors by the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT). While accounting for less than one percent of total NHS mileage, this important infrastructure represents a critical link in the goods movement value chain, carrying truck traffic between transportation modes and to the broader network of the interstate system. According to the Federal Highway Administration, of the 616 total defined NHS intermodal connectors, 253 are connected to ocean and river ports. Of the 1,222 total miles defined as part of the NHS intermodal connectors, 532 miles are port-related infrastructure. Unfortunately, these roads are often inadequate and in poor condition, plagued by inadequate turning radii and shoulder deficiencies and have been found to have twice the percentage of mileage with pavement deficiencies when compared to non-interstate NHS routes according to a study conducted by USDOT. States and MPOs have traditionally assigned freight-focused projects a low priority when compared with passenger-related improvements. Due to their freight-focused nature, NHS connectors generally do not fare well in project selection within the State and MPO planning processes. This critical infrastructure is more important than ever as our nation rebuilds the economy and creates jobs by expanding commerce through free trade agreements and increasing America’s exports and international competitiveness. These roads are key pieces of our connection to the world marketplace. In addition to their national economic importance, NHS Intermodal connectors are vital to defense mobilization and national security. </span>__With the military's increasing reliance on strategic ports__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and commercial trucking for mobility, </span>__intermodal connectors are critical to national defense planning__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Given the reliance of our national economy and defense on intermodal connectors, </span>__it is important that the federal government remain engaged in identifying, prioritizing and funding improvements to this critical infrastructure____which has **languished when dependent upon State and local planning processes**__. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Summary From the earliest days of our nation, </span>__there has been a clear and____consistent federal role and national interest in developing and maintaining landside and waterside connections to America’s seaports__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This vital transportation infrastructure literally connects American farmers, manufacturers and consumers to the world marketplace. More than a quarter of U.S. GDP and over 13 million jobs are accounted for by international trade. Especially in challenging fiscal times like today, </span>__it is critical that basic, core federal missions such as these, that directly impact America’s economic vitality, jobs, and global competitiveness, be recognized and prioritized__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**Constitutional amendments take out solvency**
(Kathleen M., Professor of Constitutional Law, Stanford Law School, and author of the influential Sullivan & Gunther Constitutional Law Casebook, Fall. (“Constitutional Amendments” – American Prospect) http://www.albionmonitor.com/1-12-96/amendmentitis.html)
This rash of amendment proposals is cause for alarm, even apart from any of their individual merits. For <span class="underlinedChar">there are strong structural reasons for amending the Constitution only reluctantly and as a last resort</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This strong presumption against constitutional amendment has been bedrock in our constitutional history, and there is no good reason for overturning it now. Proponents of the current wave of amendments suggest that it simply represents the appropriate product of a mobilized citizenry exercising popular sovereignty. We the People created the Constitution and, they imply, We the People are free to rewrite it as We please. Amendment advocates could, if they wished, cite Thomas Jefferson in their cause.</span> <span class="underlinedChar">Jefferson</span> wrote in an 1816 letter, "Some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched. They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment." But, he <span class="underlinedChar">urged</span>, <span class="underlinedChar">one should not "believe that one generation is not as capable as another of taking care of itself, and of ordering its own affairs</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">." As Jefferson had put it years earlier in a letter to James Madison, "I hold that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing." Constitutional idolatry, of course, is not an attractive organizing principle. But Jefferson's position lost out in our constitutional history for good reasons that do not depend on fetishizing the Constitution or treating it as mystically sacred. A brief recap of these reasons will help show why the Congress's current amendment fever is misguided. 1. Stability. James Madison, one of the principal architects of Article V, disagreed with Jefferson. In Madison's view, "a little rebellion now and then" is to be avoided. To be sure, Madison acknowledged in Federalist No. 43 that "useful alterations will be suggested by experience," and that amending the Constitution must not be made so difficult as to "perpetuate its discovered faults." But </span>Madison cautioned too "against that extreme facility" of constitutional amendment "which would render the Constitution too mutable." Implicit in this caution is the view that <span class="underlinedChar">stability is a key virtue of a Constitution, and</span> that <span class="underlinedChar">excessive "mutability" would </span>thus <span class="underlinedChar">**undercut the whole point of having a Constitution in the first place**</span>. As Chief Justice John Marshall put the point similarly in McCulloch v. Maryland, the Constitution is "intended to endure for ages to come." Keeping amendment relatively infrequent thus preserves public confidence in the stability of the basic constitutional structure. While the Framers had to take the argument from stability on faith, the argument looks stronger two centuries later. <span class="underlinedChar">The relative success of the American constitutional regime</span>, one bloody civil war excepted, <span class="underlinedChar">supports arguments along the lines of </span>"if it ain't broke don't fix it." Our spare Constitution has withstood the test of time. Anyone with a Burkean trust in the collective wisdom embodied in custom and tradition ought to be wary of a sudden shift to rapid constitutional revision. 2. The Rule of Law. <span class="underlinedChar">The very idea of a constitution turns on the separation of the legal and the political realms. The Constitution sets up the framework of government</span>. <span class="underlinedChar">It also sets forth a few fundamental political ideals</span> (equality, representation, individual liberties) <span class="underlinedChar">that place limits on how far any short-term majority may go. This is our higher law.All the rest is left to politics</span>. <span class="underlinedChar">Those who lose in the short run of ordinary politics obey the winners out of respect for the long-run rules and boundaries set forth in the Constitution</span>. <span class="underlinedChar">Without such respect for the constitutional framework</span>, the peaceful operation of ordinary <span class="underlinedChar">**politics would degenerate into fractious****war**</span>. Frequent constitutional amendment can be expected to undermine this respect by breaking down the boundary between law and politics<span class="underlinedChar">. The more you amend the Constitution, the more it seems like ordinary legislation</span>. And the more the Constitution is cluttered up with specific regulatory directives, the less it looks like a fundamental charter of government. Picture the Ten Commandments with a few parking regulations thrown in. This is why <span class="underlinedChar">opponents of new amendments often argue that they would tend to trivialize or politicize the Constitution</span>. They trivialize it in the sense that they clutter it up and diminish its fundamentality. Consider the experience of the state constitutions. Most state constitutions are amendable by simple majority, including by popular initiative and referendum. <span class="underlinedChar">While the federal Constitution has been amended only 27 times in over 200 years, the fifty state constitutions have had a total of nearly 6,000 amendments added to them. They have thus taken on what Marshall called in McCulloch "the prolixity of a legal code" -- a vice he praised the federal Constitution for avoiding. Many of these state constitutional amendments are products of pure interest-group politics</span>. State constitutions thus are difficult to distinguish from general state legislation, and they water down the notion of fundamental rights in the process: The California constitution, for example, protects not only the right to speak but also the right to fish. Amendments politicize a constitution to the extent that they embed in it a controversial substantive choice. Here the experience of Prohibition is instructive: The only modern amendment to enact a social policy into the Constitution, it is also the only modern amendment to have been repealed. Amendments that embody a specific and controversial social or economic policy allow one generation to tie the hands of another, entrenching approaches that ought to be revisable in the crucible of ordinary politics. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The balanced budget amendment, for example, would enshrine, for the first time in our history, a particular and highly contestable macroeconomic policy -- no deficit spending -- in the Constitution. As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes cautioned early in the century, however, the Constitution ought not "embody a particular economic theory," whether that of Milton Friedman or John Maynard Keynes.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While the reports on this topic have been consistent over the past days, some</span> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">fr</span>eight forwarders have asserted that while cargo volumes have increased they are in line with seasonal expectations and space can still be found on vessels.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Furthermore</span>, the container shortage has yet to have an impac<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">t. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Shippers could stay in close contact with their transportation providers and intermediaries and devise contingency plans that might include looking at different ports if bottlenecks or equipment issues arise and modal options such as ocean-air and air.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Whether or not the ocean container shortage is fact or fiction, </span>shippers should continue carefully inspecting the equipment for suitability prior to loading their cargo into the box<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">es</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">A few minutes can make the difference between loss-free delivery and a cargo claim. A quick walk around the container and stepping inside (being sure to close the doors to detect any light entering) allow you to identify defects and damages that need repair or require the container to be replaced.</span>

**The choice is revolution or Armageddon. Capitalism is the driving force behind global wars that will culminate in extinction.**

**Alternative text: Reject the affirmative as a means of refusing complicity with capitalism.**

**Hopelessness about the alternative is a manufactured myth. Calls for social justice, such as the civil rights movement, have been extraordinarily effective. New movements against capitalism are about to break out—we just need to think differently about what constitutes politics for them to succeed.**
