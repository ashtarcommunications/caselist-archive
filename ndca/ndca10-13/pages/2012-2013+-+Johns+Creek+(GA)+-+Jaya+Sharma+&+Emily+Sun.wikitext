**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Contention 1: Duck</span>**

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">The national highway system was created as a mechanism for evacuation from nuclear war</span></span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;">The coup de grace came from the ... as joyful as a bureaucratic picnic</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Nuclear defense uses the idea of all hazards planning to create an apparent affinity between natural disasters and nuclear exchange</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Lee, Prof of Sociology @ Rutgers , Mission Improbable: Using Fantasy Documents To Tame Disaster, pg. 73-4</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 11pt;">The idea of "solving problems" i... hurricanes, earthquakes, and so forth.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The apparent affinity between nuclear war and natural disasters facilitates evacuation planning, this planning is a way to pretend that we can control the uncontrollable</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Lee, Prof of Sociology @ Rutgers , Mission Improbable: Using Fantasy Documents To Tame Disaster, pg. 98-100</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 11pt;">Once an affinity is created...</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 5pt;">social conflict, the topic of the next chapter.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">This normalizes nuclear war and allows for the creation of artificially constructed “nuclear expertise”</span>**
**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Clarke 99</span></span>**
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Lee, Prof of Sociology @ Rutgers , Mission Improbable: Using Fantasy Documents To Tame Disaster, pg. 97-8</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 11pt;">Folding natural disasters and nuclear attack into the same category ...reliable, that it can be drawn upon</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">These evacuation plans legitimize nuclear war and create a system of rationality that justifies new wars, torture and terror to be unleashed on the enemy de jour</span>**

In his 1999 book, Mission Improbable: ...</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 11pt;"> foray beyond received conventional wisdom is viewed as unthinkable.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 6pt;">¶</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Thus: vote aff to increase our intellectual investment in transportation infrastructure by recognizing that nuclear evacuation plans legitimize unnecessary risks</span>**

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Contention two: Cover</span>**

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">These plans to use freeways to evacuate are fantasy documents, they aren’t intended to be used but serve a symbolic and rhetorical purpose in order to control the frame of debate, convincing the public that the risks our leaders take in our name are acceptable, while at the same time determining who can and who can’t speak on the issue of nuclear weapons. This system results in threat construction and risks annihilation. Voting Aff ruptures current politics and enables new ways of talking about the nuclear complex</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Lee, Prof of Sociology @ Rutgers , Mission Improbable: Using Fantasy Documents To Tame Disaster, pg. 167-171</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;">A short while ago I claimed that ...</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 11pt;"> frankly that they can not control the uncontrollable</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Nuclear weapons play a role in our everyday lives, highways are just the most obvious marker, the entirety of the national infrastructure is built around the nuclear-industrial complex, causing massive deaths world-wide</span>**

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Joesph, Prof of Anthropology, U of Chicago, The Nuclear Borderlands, pg 24-7</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 11pt;">The strange new intimacy of life in the nuclear age is ...</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 5pt;">has engendered new tactile experiences of everyday life in the United States, and with them, new psychosocial realities.</span>

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The role of the ballot should be to vote for the team that best challenges nuclear weapons in our everyday lives.</span>**
**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Now is the key time to challenge the nuclear complex that we encounter every day without realizing it. Your ballot re-writes the history of the nuclear age</span>**

**Contention 1 is the status quo sucks**

**To understand transportation infrastructure, we must first understand transit. To be in transit is to be made to move.**
**Byrd 11**
Jodi A., (Chickasaw), assistant professor of American Indian studies and English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, The Transit of Empire: Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism

**This is the experience of the indigenous peoples. Transit describes the forced movement of those subjugated due to the United States' imperialist drive**
**Byrd 11**
Jodi A., (Chickasaw), assistant professor of American Indian studies and English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, The Transit of Empire: Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism

**The history of the United States is the history of the oppressor, forcing the indigenous populations out of htier homes and out of themselves. Settler colonialism has manifested itself in a culture of sexism, homphobia, and transphobia. We must first reconclie the relation between our bodies and our histories in order to successfully spillover to our broader communities.**

**Contention 2 is solvency**

**Indianness is used by the state to justify its violence and genocide. We must start our critique here.**
**Byrd 11**
Jodi A., (Chickasaw), assistant professor of American Indian studies and English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, The Transit of Empire: Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism

**Elaborating Indigenous struggle through the rubric of government policy strengthens Settler civil society and weakens Indigenous struggle**

**This round, this space, is a setting in which you should deploy Red Pedagogy – that is, an educational praxis which foregrounds Native intellectualism. This is the role of the ballot. Red pedagogy allows us to create a decolonized democratic space and activate our political agency**

**Contention 3 is the 'monster terrorist fag'**

**US imperialism has created a new form of homonationalism which frames the Other as a queer monster terrorist to be marked for death**

**‘Indian Savages’ are represented as the derealized Other, a securitized population that must be targeted and destroyed. Indianness is projected upon other foreign nations to maintain the US Empire**

Jodi A., (Chickasaw), assistant professor of American Indian studies and English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, The Transit of Empire: Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism
