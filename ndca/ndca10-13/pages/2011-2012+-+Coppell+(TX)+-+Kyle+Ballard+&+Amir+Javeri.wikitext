<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">In Part I of this Article I argued that metaphors can reflect the circumstances and attitudes of the society that generates them. In light of this point, it seems reasonable to suggest that the traditional popularity of visual metaphors in American legal language has much to do with the bias towards visual expression and experience that has traditionally characterized American culture and, inevitably, American law. The traditional American bias towards the visual is aptly captured by the observation that "[i]n our society, . . . to be real, a thing must be visible."45 </span>…<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">power.</span>

Mesosphere refers to 80 KM above the Earth’s surface

<span class="TagChar">Atmospheric Chemistry Glossary 11</span>
<span class="underline">Mesosphere - In the atmosphere, the region immediately above the stratosphere and immediately below the thermosphere</span>. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">The mesosphere begins </span><span class="underline">about 50 kilometers high</span> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">at the stratopause and ends about 80 kilometers high at the mesopause. The temperature in the mesosphere decreases sharply with increased altitude.</span>

Space refers to at least 80KM from Earth's surface - NASA definition

Thirsk 9 <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">(Robert, Canadian Space Agency “The Space-Flight Environment: the International Space Station and Beyond”, June, http://www.ecmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/180/12/)AV</span>
<span class="underline">There are different definitions for the boundary to space. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) uses flight above 80 km to designate individuals as astronauts</span>, <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">while the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale uses the 100 km Karman line as the internationally accepted boundary to space</span>. <span class="underline">Beyond this altitude, aerodynamic flight is not possible, and spacecraft must travel faster than orbital velocity to manoeuvre and remain in orbit.</span>

# Violation – The affirmative does not increase exploration and/or development at least 80KM above the Earth’s surface.

# Standards

1. Predictable Limits – A strict interpretation of what the mesosphere refers to is necessary to limit the enormous topic – affirmatives that develop below the mesosphere explode the negative’s research burden.

2. Ground – the mesosphere divides outer space from Earth’s environment – our specific space disads or even our generics don’t link to affirmatives that develop below the mesosphere.

# Topicality is a voter for fairness and education. Evaluate the round under competing interpretations, which limits judge intervention and is the most objective way to view the debate.
===Development=== 
A. The word “development” is limited to research and development and activities to increase exploration

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">(Space Development Promotion Act of the Republic of Korea, Journal of Space Law, 33, 5-31, http://www.spacelaw.olemiss.edu/library/space/Korea/Laws/33jsl175.pdf)</span>
Article 2 (Definitions)
Definitions of terms used in this Act are as follows:
(a) <span class="DebateUnderline">The term “space development” means one of the following</span>:
(i) <span class="DebateUnderline">Research and technology development activities related to design, production, launch, operation, etc. of space objects; </span>
(ii) <span class="DebateUnderline">Use and exploration of outer space and activities to facilitate them; </span>
(b) The term “space development project” means a project to promote space development or a project to pursue the development of education, technology, information, industry, etc. related to space development;
(c) The term “space object” means an object designed and manufactured for use in outer space, including a launch vehicle, a satellite, a space ship and their components;
(d) The term “space accident” means an occurrence of damage to life, body or property due to crash, collision or explosion of a space object or other situation;
(e) The term “satellite information” means image, voice, sound or data acquired by using a satellite, or in formation made of their combination, including processed or applied information.
B. The affirmative violates this because space-based lasers neither increase exploration or research and development.
C. Vote negative to preserve limits – allowing the affirmative to develop space-based lasers opens the floodgates to any type of space weapons. This makes the neg debate impossible because there would be an infinite number of cases to research.
