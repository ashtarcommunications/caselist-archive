<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">OBAMA IS SHRINKING THE MILITARY FOOTPRINT IN IRAQ, BUT IS REPLACING IT WITH COLONIAL POLICING TO ENSURE IRAQ’S ROLE AS A CLIENT STATE AND ECONOMY

Unfortunately, not just for the Iraqis, …all significant government decision-making.

WE HAVE ENTERED THE MOST DANGEROUS PHASE OF IMPERIALISM—COLONIAL MILITARISM IS SCRAMBLING TO CONTROL EVERY FACET OF LIFE—CAPITAL NOW TRIES TO MONOPOLIZE EXISTENCE WITH BRUTE MILITARY PRESENCE

The military dimension … policies as it pleases.

IRAQ’S AN INTEGRAL SYMBOL OF NEOLIBERAL MILITARISM SPECIFICALLY—IT SIGNIFIES AMERICA’S IRON FIST POSTURE TOWARDS ECONOMICALLY DEVIANT NATIONS

Getting U.S. militarism back … maintenance of revitalized militarism.

US PRESENCE IN IRAQ IS STRATEGICALLY KEY TO NEOLIBERAL MILITARISM—MOLDED IN THE FORM OF AN IDEAL NEOLIBERAL CLIENT STATE, IRAQ SERVES AS A STAGING POINT FOR FURTHER NEOLIBERALIZATION IN THROUGH AFRO-ASIA

In the United States, the objectives of global-neoliberal militarism … conformity with the new model of global-neoliberal militarism.

OUR SPEECH ACT IS AN INSTANCE OF EXPOSURE—OUR CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE WAR ON IRAQ EXPOSES A COG WITHIN A LARGER SYSTEM OF NEOLIBERAL INJUSTICE—THIS CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF IDEOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC MECHANISMS CHALLENGES NEOLIBERALISM BY HIGHLIGHTING DISPOSABILITY POLITICS
Giroux 08
[Henry, PROF. OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND COMMUNICATION AT MCMASTER UNIVERSITY, “Beyond the biopolitics of disposability: rethinking neoliberalism in the New Gilded Age” Social Identities, September, 2008]
Any attempt to address the current biopolitics of neoliberalism and disposability must … yet unrecycled waste of the global frontier-land’ (p. 138).

SPECIFICALLY, THE NEOLIBERAL MILITARISM IN IRAQ CULMINATES IN SACRIFICIAL GENOCIDE IN WHICH VIOLENCE AGAINST THE EXCLUDED AND DISPOSABLE IS NORMALIZED

According to Franz Hinkelammert, the …neoliberalism plus war.

WE MUST PRIORITIZE THE INJUSTICES CAUSED BY NEOLIBERALISM FIRST—WE MUST CONDEMN DISPOSABILITY BECAUSE OF THE SUFFERING IT CAUSES—THE ALTERNATIVE IS THE EVENTUAL DESTRUCTION OF THE PLANET

(Henry, PROF. OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND COMMUNICATION AT MCMASTER UNIVERSITY, “Beyond the biopolitics of disposability: rethinking neoliberalism in the New Gilded Age” Social Identities, September, 2008)
Needless to say, invoking hope … the atrophy of democratic politics.

WE DEMAND THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAW ITS MILITARY AND POLICE PRESENCE FROM IRAQ.

ACKNOWLEDGING US DEFEAT IN IRAQ IS THE DEATH KNELL OF CAPITALIST IMPERIALISM THAT MARKS A NEW ERA OF A MORE JUST FOREIGN POLICY

The war against Iraq was wrong, … in continuing this nightmare.

CLAIMS OF AMERICA’S ROLE IN IRAQ AS BENEVOLENT SUPER POWER ARE FALSE—THE US WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH NEOLIBERLISM ON IRAQ UNTIL WE DEMAND A COMPLETE AND IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL—ANYTHING LESS IS POLITICALLY DEBILITATING AND CAN’T END IMPERIALISM

AMERICANS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN PERMANENTLY BURY THE DREAM OF A NEOLIBERALIZED IRAQI COLONY—IRAQI RESISTANCE HAS BEEN PUNISHED—WE MUST REJECT IMPERIAL FANTASIES

The formal political leadership … bury this imperial dream for all time.

NEOLIBERAL DISPOSABILITY IS SUSTAINED BY IDEOLOGICAL NORMALIZATION——USING POLICY DEBATE AS A PEDAGOGICAL SITE OF CRITICAL RESISTANCE GIVES US INDIVIDUAL AGENCY TO CHALLENGE NEOLIBERALISM

Neoliberalism’s politics of disposability not only are maintained … totalitarianism in its various fundamentalisms and guises.</span>
