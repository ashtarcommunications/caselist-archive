==Security Advantage== 

====Enforcing the Cuban embargo overstretches US national security assets —- prevents effective counter-terror and anti-prolif efforts==== 
International Debates 7 From the November 2007 Government Accountability Office report Economic Sanctions: Agencies Face Competing Priorities in Enforcing the U.S. Economic Embargo on Cuba. "Enforcing Economic Sanctions Government Accountability Office Analysis," International Debates, February 2009, Vol. 7 Issue 2, p21-22.
Since 2004, the United States has tightened the rules governing these exceptions—directly
AND
those on countries engaged in terrorism, weapons proliferation, and narcotics trafficking.

====AND, US security reports confirm that the risk of nuclear terrorism in Latin America is high====

The TBA is a small area in Latin America where the borders of Argentina,
AND
great concern to the US, particularly Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. This
**comes in light of the pink tide, but is reinforced by the Iranian government􏰁s increased interest in influencing the region because of its geographic location to the United States border.**

**====Latin America is the critical staging point for terrorist attacks against the US====**

**Hellman 8** ~~[Martin E. Hellman, emeritus prof of engineering @ Stanford, "Risk Analysis of Nuclear Deterrence" SPRING 2008 THE BENT OF TAU BETA PI, http://www.nuclearrisk.org/paper.pdf~~]
The threat of nuclear terrorism looms much larger in the public~’s mind than the threat

**====Independently, nuclear proliferation increases the risk of nuclear war====**

In truth, because the track record, happily, is bare, no one
AND
therefore poses a threat to both the United States and the international community.

==Relations ADV==

FOR most of our history, the United States assumed that its security was inextricably

In 1960, the United States government imposed a full trade embargo on the nation
