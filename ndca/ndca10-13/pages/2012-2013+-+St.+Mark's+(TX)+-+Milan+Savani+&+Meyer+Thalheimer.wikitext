A small preface to what we're doing here:
We've decided that Word documents are the best way to post many cites on the wiki while preserving organization and accessibility. We post the most recent 1AC directly on the wiki with partial text (albeit small-sized for organization), then we post a Word document with full text for the 1AC and each additional subheading. We also provide a short description of opponent, affirmative, 1NC strategies, block division, 2NR choice, and decision from all of our negative rounds. After that, we post 2NR statistics. We try to put up the full text of every 1NC, 1AC, and 2AC card that we read. The only exception to this rule is 1NC case arguments - to upload all of those would be quite difficult. We will put up cards we've read in any other speech in any debate by request. Naturally, we're only human, so we probably will forget some cites along the way. Feel free to email us (Milan generally manages most disclosure) if you need any help finding anything, want us to put up more cites, or have trouble accessing anything here. If one of us doesn't respond promptly, try the other.

Negative questions: email Meyer at [[media type="custom" key="20776246"]].

===Statistics (Updated 09/24/12)=== 
NOTE: These statistics are based on 2NR choice from all of our negative rounds this year. There may be some discrepancies in the numbers, as our tabulation may have been a bit off. Also, certain arguments did not fit into a single classification, so they were tabulated more than once, once in each applicable column; therefore, the percentage values below will not add to 100%, but should still be a relatively accurate representation of our 2NR choice. All percentage values are reported to two decimal places. The arguments are listed in descending order of percentage. When there is a tie in percentages, the arguments are listed alphabetically.
