<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I believe </span><u>we’re at a crossroads. No one is ahead of America in aerospace, at least not yet</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><u>The U.S. is the undisputed leader</u><u>. We build the most efficient and capable commercial airplanes in the world. The weapons systems we produce are unmatched, Our commercial and military satellites are phenomenal in what they can do,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And our orbital manned space program – a program the United States will walk away from this year – is second to none. But </span><u>our leadership is being threatened by</u> <u>other countries intent on replacing the U.S. as the world’s leader in aerospace</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Today, </span><u>we’re not trying to reclaim our lead.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We’re trying to keep it. The question is: </span><u>Will we take the steps required to maintain our leadership? Or will we allow aerospace</u> <u>and aviation to join the list of industries that America used to lead?</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Aerospace Makes America Strong To understand why that’s so important, we have to look at what aerospace has done for our country. I was fortunate enough to join this industry in the final quarter of a remarkable century. To me, American aerospace defined the 20th Century. It helped win World War II. It brought the world closer together with commercial air travel. It changed the way we communicate with commercial satellites. And, of course, it changed forever how we look at the world around us when man first walked on the Moon. I am also convinced that aerospace will define the 21st century. The question is, will it be U.S. aerospace that does it? That’s a critical question because what we do helps keep America strong. No industry has a bigger impact on exports. It tips the balance of trade in our favor by about $53 billion. President Obama has set the goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years. Aerospace will be essential to help us reach that goal. When you look at direct </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">￼￼￼￼</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1 and secondary impacts, it's been estimated that U.S. civil aviation alone is responsible for 12 million jobs and contributes to more than 5 1/2 percent of the US GDP. The State of Aerospace So what does our commercial marketplace look like today? It’s vibrant, growing, challenging and rapidly changing. A Recovering Market The commercial aviation market has been roaring back the last 15 months, despite the impact of the worst recession since the Great Depression. At Boeing, we have a 7-year, $263 billion commercial airplane backlog. With air traffic increasing at a rate 1.5 times world GDP, the future looks good. Looking forward, we expect world GDP to grow at about 4 percent between 2011 and 2015. While not discounting events in Northern Africa, and the potential impact on the price of oil, the future looks good from a macro standpoint. Over the next 20 years, we see a need for 31,000 new airplanes. That’s a $3.6 trillion dollar market. It’s a market many countries and companies covet. That outlook is being shaped by many factors. I’d like to talk about a few of them: globalization, competition, and shifting demographics. Globalization Let’s talk first about globalization. The world is more interconnected, yet more complicated because of that interconnection. What happens in other areas of the world matters everywhere. We saw that with the earthquake in Japan. Despite the fact that our factories in Washington state are more than 4,000 miles from the epicenter, we felt the impact of that disaster. Tom Friedman was right; the world is flat. Globalization means our partners and customers are not just in the U.S.; they are around the world. And of course, globalization drives air traffic. In 1990, 72 percent of passenger traffic was in Europe and the Americas. By 2030, that number will be only 45 percent. Soon, over half of the world’s GDP will be coming from emerging countries. Increased Competition We’re also seeing increased competition. The traditional duopoly between Boeing and Airbus is over. Other countries and companies are attracted by the $3.6 trillion market I mentioned earlier... countries like China with Comac, Russia with Sukhoi, Canada with Bombardier and Brazil with Embraer. Not all the new entrants will be successful, but some of them will. </span><u>We’ve got to assume our competitors will do what they say they’re going to do. They have the financial and intellectual resources necessary.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Let me give you an example. </span><u>The Chinese have made commercial aviation a national priority</u><u>. They spent $5 billion on a regional jet.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It didn’t meet market expectations. </span><u>They are now developing the C-919</u><u>, a narrow-body airplane to compete with the 737. It will be competitive in China.</u><u>Eventually, Chinese airplanes will compete around the world</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">￼￼￼￼￼</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2 </span><u>China is investing $30 billion in this industry</u><u>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They’re one of only three countries to put a man into space and once they make something a national priority, they make it happen. At the same time, </span><u>China is the largest market outside the U</u><u>nited States for many companies – including Boeing. And the desire for market access has convinced many American executives to share technologies that may one day help Chinese companies compete around the world for the same business. We have to be very mindful in balancing those risks and potential rewards, not only in China, but around the globe. It’s interesting that China has moved from customer/supplier to customer/competitor in four short decades representing both opportunity and challenge.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This should not scare us. It should focus us. Changing Military Threats Meanwhile, military threats have also evolved. </span><u>During the Cold War, we knew who our enemies were, and we trusted them not to use weapons of mass destruction. Today we often don't know who they are, but we know that if given the chance to use deadly weapons they will. As a result of this shifting dynamic, the needs of our military have evolved.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Our armed forces must prepare for nontraditional threats, and that’s changing the mix of platforms and priorities the DoD is seeking. Shifting Demographics A final issue influencing the future of aerospace today is our demographics. About half of Boeing’s engineers will be able to retire by 2015. The same is true for all the aerospace companies. We simply are not producing enough engineers in this country, with the right skill sets, to meet this demand. It’s contributing to what I call the “intellectual disarmament” of our country. Along with reduced R&amp;D spending, I believe this puts us at risk. If we continue along this path: America will lose its lead in aerospace. We also risk breaking a long-standing continuum of capability in our industry</span><u>. Our economy will lose an important engine of growth, and our country will be more vulnerable and less secure.</u><u>Companies like Boeing will survive, but it may be outside the U.S. We will go to where the engineers and capabilities are.</u><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Aerospace and Defense: The Strength to Lift America </span><u>Aerospace</u> <u>and defense is a powerful economic engine. We must keep the industry strong.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">As the U.S. economy moves through uncertain times, </span><u>America’s</u> <u>aerospace industry remains a powerful, reliable engine of employment, innovation, and export income. Aerospace contributed $95.1 billion in export sales to America’s economy last year</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.1 Conservatively, </span><u>U</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><u>S. aerospace sales alone account for 3-5 percent of our country’s gross domestic product,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and </span><u>every aerospace dollar yields an extra</u> <u>$1.50 to $3 in further economic activity</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.2 Aerospace products and services are pillars of our nation’s security and competitiveness. </span><u>In these challenging times, the aerospace industry is solidly and reliably contributing strongly to the national economy and the lives of millions of Americans</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We strongly believe that keeping this economic workhorse on track is in America’s best interest, To accomplish this, </span><u>our government must develop policies that strengthen</u> <u>the positions of all workers in all industries, especially economic producers like aerospace and defense.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This paper explains what’s at stake, and ways to ensure that a proven economic success continues to endure and thrive. A High-Skilled People Business </span><u>The aerospace</u> <u>and defense industry directly employs 844,000 Americans, located in every state of the union – and supports more than two million jobs in related fields.3 Our people bring a diverse set of skills and capabilities to their jobs: engineers on the cutting edge of advanced materials, structures and information technology; machinists fabricating complex shapes and structures; and technicians from almost every degree field, testing, applying and integrating the latest technologies. Most of these positions are high-skill, quality jobs, paying above average wages.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Production workers average $29.93 an hour;4 entry-level engineers average more than $74,000 a year, with more senior engineers well into six figures.5 </span><u>And that employment has grown steadily for years.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Many of these jobs are unique, and require skills that take time to develop. It takes ten years for a degreed aerospace engineer to master the intricacies of aerospace vehicle designs. Technicians skilled in applying stealth coatings, programmers fluent in satellite-control algorithms, metallurgists expert in high-temperature jet engine design -- these skills and many more are very hard to replace. </span><u>Because many of our programs involve national security</u><u>, America’s aerospace and defense industry relies on home-grown talent.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Of the more than 32,000 jobs open in the industry last April, 53 percent required U.S. citizenship.</span><u>6 These jobs can’t be sent overseas.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">That’s why we are increasingly working with educators at federal, state, and local levels in many ways ─ adopting schools, sponsoring competitions, providing internships and scholarships and other measures. </span><u>We are also advocating national education and R&amp;D policies that will advance American innovation and technological leadership in all sectors of the economy.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">A Good Trade Government policies that advance free and fair trade in global markets are vital to our industry and our country. Aerospace brings in the biggest foreign trade surplus of any manufacturing sector.7 The industry’s $57 billion surplus in 2008 came from exporting nearly 40 percent of all aerospace production and, during some economic quarters, nearly 70 percent of civil aircraft and components.8 </span><u>That’s American economic growth being paid for by other countries’ money. And it can only happen when government policies allow the things American workers build to compete fairly in international markets.</u><br />

<strong>ORS Stimulates the Launch Market – creates incentives for future business and creates the perception of sustainability</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Felt, 10</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - USAF Commander, Space Test Operations Squadron Space Development and Test Wing Kirtland AFB, New Mexico (Eric, “Responsive Space Funding Challenges and Solutions: Avoiding a Tragedy of the Commons,” High Frontier, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a>)</span><br />
<br />
<u>Industry watching for decisive government leadership</u><u>, especially in the budget</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Unlike those of most exquisite space programs, </span><u>the ORS business model is not based upon awarding one contract spanning many years to a single contractor. The responsive space business model calls for a significantly higher transaction rate, which establishes the “carrot” of capturing future business as the primary motivation to perform well on existing contracts</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Most companies seem to recognize the benefits that a more competitive US government space marketplace would provide</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Other aspects of the ORS business model may be less appealing to industry, however. In-sourcing of final assembly and test, lower contract values in general, a return to linking fee/profit to risk on cost-plus contracts, interfaces based on open rather than proprietary standards, and open source flight software are concepts that some contractors perceive as threats to their short-term corporate profitability. Others realize that these concepts are necessary to maintain the overall health of the space enterprise over the long run and grow the overall space budget, benefitting many companies and shareholders. Government acquisition decisions must be based on what is good for the taxpayer and the country, not only on maximizing the prime contractor’s near-term corporate profits. The government is the entity likely to benefit most from the ORS business model, and should be eager to experiment with elements of the new model and evaluate risks and benefits. Since the barriers to entry are lower and the US government is not their only customer, the small space industry base is much more vibrant, competitive, and innovative than might be expected from looking only at the US government small space budget. For example, ORS business solicitations have elicited hundreds of excellent proposals from hungry industry partners, including many small businesses. Nevertheless, industry’s luke-warm embrace of ORS has influenced decision makers within the government to move more slowly toward responsive space than they otherwise might have. Unfortunately</span><u>, the government moving slowly on responsive space induces a “wait and see” response from the established space contractors, perpetuating the cycle of moving slowly on responsive space.</u><u>The bottom line is that industry will follow the money and embrace responsive space fully</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> when, and </span><u>only when, the government shifts enough budget resources to</u> <u>actually field significant operational capability</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>Economic Collapse Leads to Nuclear War – resource conflicts, hotspot escalation, and protectionism</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">Increased Potential for Global Conflict</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces. With so many possible permutations of outcomes, each with ample Revisiting the Future opportunity for unintended consequences, there is a growing sense of insecurity. Even so, </span><u>history may be more instructive than ever</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While we continue to believe that </span><u>the Great Depression</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is not likely to be repeated, the </span><u>lessons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to be drawn from that period </span><u>include the harmful effects on fledgling democracies and multiethnic societies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (think Central Europe in 1920s and 1930s) </span><u>and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the </span><u>sustainability of multilateral institutions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (think League of Nations in the same period). </span><u>There is no reason to think that this would not be true in the twenty-first as much as in the twentieth century.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For that reason, the ways in which </span><u>the potential for greater conflict could grow</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> would seem to be even more apt </span><u>in a constantly volatile economic environment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as they would be if change would be steadier. In surveying those risks, the report stressed the likelihood that terrorism and nonproliferation will remain priorities even as resource issues move up on the international agenda. </span><u>Terrorism’s appeal will decline if economic growth continues in the Middle East and youth unemployment is reduced.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For those terrorist groups that remain active in 2025, however, the diffusion of technologies and scientific knowledge will place some of the world’s most dangerous capabilities within their reach. </span><u>Terrorist groups</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in 2025 </span><u>will</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> likely be a combination of descendants of long established groups_inheriting organizational structures, command and control processes, and training procedures necessary to conduct sophisticated attacks_and newly emergent collections of the angry and disenfranchised that </span><u>become self-radicalized, particularly in the absence of economic outlets that would become narrower in an economic downturn. The most dangerous casualty of any economically-induced drawdown of U.S. military presence would</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> almost certainly </span><u>be the Middle East</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Even actions short of war, however, will have important geopolitical implications.

<strong><span style="color: #282a21;">First, the newest evidence confirms – China’s weaponizing and its military doctrine focuses on denying the US access through offensive actions</span></strong><br />

<br />
<u><span style="color: #282a21;">In addition, China’s improving space capabilities, coupled with its steadily advancing conventional capabilities, will provide the increased ability to seek space superiority or space dominance</span></u><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;"> (zhitian quan) </span><u><span style="color: #282a21;">through a combination of</span></u><u><span style="color: #282a21;"> space offensive and defensive operations. In discussing Chinese space offensive and defensive operations, it is important to note that, while many of the tasks associated with these efforts align with what American military planners consider “counterspace” activities, the Chinese themselves do not employ such a term.</span></u><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;"> Moreover, Chinese writings on offensive and defensive space operations are not limited to, or even primarily focused on, attacking systems in orbit. Indeed, </span><u><span style="color: #282a21;">establishing space dominance entails sustaining the entire structure of terrestrial and space systems, including orbiting satellites, space-related terrestrial facilities, and the data, communications, and telemetry links that tie all of these systems together.[6] Thus, the improvements in the PLA’s broader conventional portfolio are also important because they might be used to debilitate portions of the overall American space infrastructure.</span></u><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;"> For example, </span><u><span style="color: #282a21;">Chinese descriptions of space offensive operations include not only applying hard-kill capabilities against satellites</span></u><u><span style="color: #282a21;">, but also attacking launch bases and tracking, telemetry, and control facilities.[7] They also discuss soft-kill techniques, such as jamming and dazzling satellites to minimize the generation of debris and the attendant physical and diplomatic consequences. </span></u><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;">Offensive operations will also likely involve cyber attacks against the various data and communications links that transfer information and commands used to control satellites in orbit. Similarly, </span><u><span style="color: #282a21;">Chinese writings on space defensive operations incorporate</span></u><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;"> a range of information denial measures. These include passive steps, such as </span><u><span style="color: #282a21;">camouflage and deception</span></u><u><span style="color: #282a21;">, to prevent an opponent from using space-based systems to gather accurate information. Information denial also includes preventing an opponent from attacking Chinese space-related systems, which would mean efforts to neutralize and suppress the enemy’s space infrastructure. These include both kinetic and electronic means directed at space-based systems</span></u><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;">, terrestrial facilities, and the data and communications links among them. </span><u><span style="color: #282a21;">This is all consistent with what may be a guiding concept for China’s space operations, “unified operations, key point is space dominance.” Unified operations refer to applying all typesof capabilities, terrestrial and space-based, active and passive measures, hard-kill and soft-kill. These operations would focus on ensuring that the PLA can exploit space at key, decisive times and places of its choosing, while preventing an opponent from doing so.</span></u><br />

<u>The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.77 </span><u>These include</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">:</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, </span><u>it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 </span><u>The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.81 One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. </span><u>As the PLA modernizes its</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (</span><u>C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, </span><u>an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For example, </span><u>four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, in Wuhan, </span><u>have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85 In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88 </span><u>The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research. Space Deterrence Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems. In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability. Conclusions There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, </span><u>in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA. U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. </span><u>There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">;97 </span><u>the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory. The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. </span><u>The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. </span><u>No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures. </span><u>Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. </span><u>As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, </span><u>and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The strategy to deter nuclear attack worked throughout the Cold War; the Soviet Union was powerful, but it was also a rational adversary. For this reason, the United States worked hard to understand the culture, goals, incentives, and ideals of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was also open to, and reciprocated, U.S. diplomatic engagement overtures. </span><u>The United States has gained great advantage through development and integration of space capabilities. This has forced potential adversaries to evolve techniques to neutralize this superiority</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Attacks on U.S. space systems can be performed through terrorist proxies, third parties, or covert acts that offer perpetrators plausible deniability for damage inflicted</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>The United States now confronts a diverse set of adversaries, and their rogue leaders are arguably much more risk prone, or perhaps</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, just oxymoronic, </span><u>acting deliberately reckless. These adversaries know full well the importance of space capabilities to U.S. diplomatic, military, and economic success. They see that attacking and disrupting space capabilities presents a significant opportunity to deny U.S. national objectives, to retain or expand their own relative power, and to compensate for their own lack of conventional strength</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Deterrence has failed throughout history ‘‘because the object of deterring measures fails to notice them, does not find the measures credible, or is pursuing an agenda sufficiently important enough to its interests that it is prepared to ignore the deterrence attempt</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.’’30 </span><u>Given this, the United States cannot depend solely on deterrence to secure itself. It must prepare for the possibility that its measures could fail. Therefore, defenses should also be deployed</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">; though the extent of these should be measured and balanced against their utility, and measured by projected costs, lost opportunity costs, likely effectiveness, and effects obtained in the end. Deterrence and defense tasks are inexorably linked to each other. As noted by Robert Butterworth, ‘‘Defenses offer protection, while deterrence threatens punishment. </span><u>Defenses can succeed whether the enemy believes in them or not</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.’’31 There are a number of active and passive defensive capabilities that can be developed and deployed to protect space systems, particularly against kinetic-kill ASATs and jammers.</span><br />

<u>The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, facilities or services; </span><u>the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets</u><strong>.</strong> <u>One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> on the US homeland or an attack </span><u>that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, </span><u>other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.44Although a major attack on the US is not likely, </span><u>the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculation</u><u>that the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><u>The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, </span><u>the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a <em>fait accompli</em></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.45 A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49 The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “</span><u>Space capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> are no longer nice to have, but </span><u>are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.”51 </span><u>The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets.</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52 Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives. The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, </span><u>successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. </span><u>A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability. The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55 Today, </span><u>other nations are working to develop</u><u>new weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—</span><u>information</u><u>war</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The current </span><u>coverage gaps in our space surveillance network</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset </span><u>makes it more likely an adversary could develop <strong>a</strong>nti-<strong>sat</strong>ellite weapons</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">without our knowledge. Finally, </span><u>without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> to counter an attack against US space assets. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is </span><u>to deter an attack on US space assets</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. </span><u>A senior officer in US Strat</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">egic </span><u>Com</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">mand recently </span><u>stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.57 </span><br />

<br />
<strong>1. The plan prevents an arms race from <u>happening</u> – it creates the perception of credible deterrence which negates the benefits of asymmetry</strong><br />
<strong>Sejba, 10</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> - USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a>)</span><br />
<br />
<u>The space domain,</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> often referred to as “The High Frontier,” </span><u>no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is now time to take actions for the </span><em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">sake of space</span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. </span><u>Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 </span><u>Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: </span><em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">assured </span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">… being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So </span><u>while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic</u> <strong><u>deterrent</u></strong> <u>against space attacks. As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, </span><u>ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations. Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, </span><u>a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space. For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy </span><u>is not directly applicable to space</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.6 Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space. </span><u>Instead,</u><u>deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">);9 </span><u>and encourage their restraint</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. A New Focus of Deterrence </span><em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">What does deterrence look like in the 21st century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear. ~ </span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Sandra I. Erwin, </span><em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Future of War—How the Game is Changing … Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… </span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">~ US National Security Strategy, 2006 In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command. The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. </span><u>Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples </span><em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict. </span></em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12 </span><u>The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “</span><u>our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.”14 The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices. Moving forward, </span><u>to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them.</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). </span><u>Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Lastly, </span><u>one</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">very popular</span> <u>argument against developing space defenses is the fear that it would precipitate a space arms race</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Typically, this argument is more often associated with competing offensive capabilities; however, there is ample empirical evidence that improved defenses can also cause an adversary to seek improved offensive weapon effectiveness. The original line of reasoning postulates that space assets are free from attack now because of the sanctuary they enjoy and because they do not represent a clear and present danger which an adversary feels compelled to directly challenge. Unfortunately, continued American reliance upon unchallenged space exploitation is slowly changing the equation. If the U.S. should develop more OCS capability (such as fielding a destructive ASAT or placing weapons in space) then other nations would feel compelled to develop an equal if not superior threat capability to balance the superiority of the U.S., which in turn creates a threat to the satellites that might not have existed in the first place.160 The defensive theory is a twist of that original argument. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. </span><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. </span>First, this line of thought assumes that the impetus causing the adversary to create space weapons in the first place can be abated or removed, and that only by making the adversary feel a greater or unreasonable risk does the arms race begin</u><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. While America has not placed weapons or even unassailable defenses in space yet, </span>potential adversaries are feeling threatened by U.S. space dominance</u><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is unrealistic that the U.S. will forego the strategic and tactical advantages that space represents, or will willingly give up the dominance it enjoys today. It is exactly that dedication to</span> space dominance</u> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">that </span>is making nations like China and North Korea turn to ASAT technology.</u><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">161 While U.S. weaponization of space in order to gain an offensive initiative can certainly be argued against</span>, the only viable means to protect already threatened satellites is to improve defenses or suffer the consequences. ASAT threats against U.S. satellites already exist and the adversary countries have demonstrated a desire to use them</u><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, if necessary. </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">The U.S. cannot afford to do nothing about the threat and hope that it will never be challenged in space dominance.</span></u><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Even reversing space polic</span>y today</u> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">and negotiating a treaty to ban all ASAT weapons</span> would not physically prevent an adversary country from secretly building a robust ASAT capability</u> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">while the U.S. rests on its laurels. Arguing diplomatically that the adversary country was in violation of a signed treaty would provide little comfort as U.S. satellites continued to be disabled or destroyed. </span>By fielding a defensive system that mitigates or negates the effectiveness of a threat, the adversary country will become <strong>less inclined</strong> to risk war with the U.S.</u> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">by employing ASATs</span></u><u>if they could not guarantee some reasonable expectation of success</u><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. There is little evidence that specifically placing defenses onboard satellites will suddenly cause a space arms race to spiral out of control. Space systems are already protected through various means including threat of an air or surface attack, small maneuvers, configuration changes and others. These defensive measures exist today and a space arms race (if one exists at all) is proceeding at a relatively measured pace. Some can argue that U.S. DCS measures today are spurring the improvement of ASATs worldwide, but it is just as valid to point to inevitable strategic balancing that usually occurs against empires and hegemons throughout history as a stimulus for contemporary ASAT development</span>. Second,</u><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">there is a simple economic balance that prevents a space arms race from spiraling out of control</span>, especially when matching adversarial offensive threats against competing domestic defensive capability.</u> <u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, explained the economic math, “’I can’t afford as a nation to just do an exchange ratio where they send up a $100 million [ASAT] missile and I send up a $1.5 billion satellite.’”162 What the U.S. could afford, however, is to spend $45 million to neutralize the effect of the $100 million ASAT in protection of the $1.5 billion satellite. Most of the defenses proposed would cost less than or equal to the cost of a destructive ASAT. If they are effective and negate the usefulness of the threat ASAT, then the adversary has to increase spending to improve their ASAT. Typically that improvement cost is proportional to cost of the original system, in this case starting at $100 million. The same generally holds true for the defensive improvements. Therefore, the next spiral in the arms race would equate to a $200 million ASAT to attack a $1.5 billion satellite protected by a $100 million defensive system. And,</span> much like the cold war, the U.S. would be in a position to outspend most any foreseeable adversary and neutralize the threat.</u><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> That is based upon the assumption, of course, that defensive improvements could keep pace with offensive improvements technologically. </span>Outpacing the potential adversary threat is exactly the goal of this proposal.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">The arguments against additional defensive measures may spark interest initially but, once examined, have limited rationale that would warrant abandoning satellite self-defense development and employment. However, lacking good reasons against improving the defense of satellites does not imply that the measures should therefore be developed. The Benefits of Chasing Additional Defensive Measures The first and most obvious advantage of developing timely and responsive satellite defenses is that America’s critical space capability would be preserved. Some of the technologies like increasing redundancy or whipple bumpers and nanotechnology can provide additional protection not only against ASATs but against a whole host of natural electromagnetic and projectile events that occur every day. Since nature can sometimes represent the biggest threat to the largest number of U.S. satellites, the additional protection ensures the availability of space exploitation when needed. The expeditionary nature of the American military depends greatly upon space for command and control, and modern military battlefields almost require precision weapons, many of which are also dependent upon space assets. Unfettered space support is necessary for the U.S. military to continue to function as it has over the past decade and predicted to do so in the future. Many of the technologies presented as possible near-term candidates have been developed for terrestrial application. Just as the technology transfer can go from air assets to space assets, so can the applications of some of the technologies developed for protecting satellites. The miniaturization and autonomous processing that will inevitably precipitate from micro- and nano-satellite development can greatly aid unmanned aircraft development in addition to other air, sea, and ground platforms.163 Aircraft could be made lighter and more capable. Ships could conserve space for additional supplies and ground vehicles could be made more reliable and have more room to carry additional equipment or supplies. Nanotechnology shielding could produce new means of concealing military vehicles from a vast array of sensors including from electronic sniffers.164 Just as the space race of the 1960s produced a great deal of spin off technologies, not just for NASA, but for the U.S. military and for the civilian population as well. Similar spin offs can be reasonably expected from developing effective satellite ASAT defense. Lastly, </span><u>building an overwhelming defense may actually discourage adversary nations from pursuing offensive capabilities against the U.S</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.165 “If a weapon is vulnerable, yet capable of dramatically affecting the outcome of a conflict, the state that possesses it has an even more powerful incentive to employ the weapon early on in a conflict”166 Conversely, </span><u>if a weapon is vulnerable and not capable of affecting the outcome of a conflict, which satellite self-defense would achieve against current generation ASATS, then there would be little motivation to resort to ASATs.</u><br />

<u>The U</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u>has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. </span><u>The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that </span><u>efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> ,,39 Further, </span><u>the DoD's <em>Plan for Operationally Responsive Space</em> highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1 implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , </span><u>ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. </span><u>Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness </span><u>Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The U</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u>must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Although the U</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u>maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (SSN) network, </span><u>it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">;</span> <u>the</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> February 10, 2009 </span><u>collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. </span><u>Improved SSA also allows the U</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u>to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions </span><u>Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack.</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These </span><u>orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. </span><u>If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the U</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><u>enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability </span><u>The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites </span><u>The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 </span><u>Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Finally, </span><u>small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, </span><u>defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency </span><u>The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Engagement Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic• missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, </span><u>the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.53 </span><u>Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, </span><u>proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, </span><u>these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that</u> <u>can damage satellite systems</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. “</span><u>A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations </span><u>The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><u>Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. </span><u>The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58</span><br />

<strong>Near space has too many tech issues – hull structure, controllability and power management</strong><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Limitations As mentioned earlier, near-space technologies offer tremendous benefits. </span><u>At the low end of technology/cost, minor modifications would make some systems available today, but as technology moves toward the high end, limitations and vulnerabilities become daunting.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The maneuver airships required to house U-2, Global Hawk, or TACSAT communication packages remain on the drawing board because </span><u>engineers must solve a number of technical issues. Structure may pose the greatest challeng</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">e. According to a RAND study, </span><u>helium leakage will likely represent the &quot;binding constraint to high-altitude, long-loiter airship endurance,&quot; and ultraviolet radiation degrades hull fabric.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> 51 Designers and engineers must allow for the hazardous and turbulent lower atmosphere, where vehicles ascend and descend. </span><u>Although metallized and reflective coating in the fabric might increase hull strength, the increased radar cross section could make the craft vulnerable to air defenses</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.5 2 Operating at near-space altitudes also presents a massfraction challenge for airships. 53 Lowering altitude to below 65,000 feet would help, but </span><u>overcoming atmospheric gusts requires an increase in hull strength</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (and empty weight) and decreases available payload mass.5 </span><u>4 Because gust criteria significantly influence an airship's hull strength and shear feasibility, high-altitude, long-loiter vehicles would then fall under the same air-defense vulnerabilities as do HAE UAVs. Controllability represents another significant concern</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. An airship, which must take off and land through the normal atmosphere, requires greater downwind segments because engineers match its propulsion system to the vehicle's operating altitude. Since air is less dense at operating altitudes, designing a maximum speed of 90 knots at 65,000 feet results in a top speed of only 38 knots at sea level. 55 Furthermore, if the vehicle launches in the United States, air-traffic control becomes an issue. Additionally, the effects of airspace, weather, and the airship's large inertia create a need for power and lift controls. Trade-offs among safety factors, weight, and operating altitudes will occur, possibly driving the reduction of operating ceiling and endurance and thereby negating the benefits. </span><u>Power, gas</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and heat </span><u>management</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> present smaller challenges but </span><u>require innovative solutions. Fossil fuel adds more weight; thus solar cells become the power source of choice,</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> especially for the endurance benefit. </span><u>However, propellers, gas pumps, compressors, and, of course, payloads increase the demand for power.</u></em><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 7pt;">What is important, I think, is that the inseparability of our space capabilities from our total national security relationship, whether it is theater power or global capa-bilities, </span><u>means that we are going to have a different view of what is meaningful in terms of threats and capabilities than anyone else</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. We have to make sure that if we are going to pursue deterrence, that we have punishment that links up to whatever it is that we are trying to dissuade people from attacking, and that can be enormously difficult for us, because to be effective our deterrence strategies must take into account our overall context. But we don’t have to worry about those, in fact, and this is my final point, be-cause we really don’t need them for our space systems.</span> <u>We have defense programs</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> that are </span><u>available.

For example</span><u>, we could try rapid augmentation and reconstitution of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> That would in itself reduce the benefits of initial attack. We could </span><u>have a quick-planned launch for our LEO birds and have silent spares</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, for example, for ones in higher orbits. That is an option. We could have </span><u>tighter coordination with our allied and commercial systems</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and create a virtual armada that could preclude a sudden and debilitating strike against our systems and would also complicate the targeting of some-one who was trying to take after us in space. Those are near-term things that we could do actually starting this year. A little further away, </span><u>we can improve our space situational awareness</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, which is going to take a while, and improve our command and control for active measures, such as orbit adjustments or perhaps intercepting things that are on their way up to get us in higher orbits. We might </span><u>also move toward a distributed architecture for our military support systems</u><u>.</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> What is interesting about this as well is not only that these things that are real defenses and don’t depend on the deterrent threat of punishment, but that they have also don’t put weapons in space nor do they invite warfare in space. </span><u>We need space in order for warfare here on the ground, but we don’t particularly need warfare in space.</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">So in sum, I am urging you to </span><u>consider only the capability to deny someone the military incentive to strike our space assets.</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">That is the defense option, a response to more of the risks that might initiate attacks and that provides more options for limiting the consequences if those attacks should happen. </span><u>The defense of our military assets in space is possible without requiring miracles of technology</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><u>They are sustainable and effective</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, no matter what other governments or their constituent elements believe.</span></em><br />

I believe we’re at a crossroads. No one is ahead of America in aerospace, at least not yet. The U.S. is the undisputed leader. We build the most efficient and capable commercial airplanes in the world. The weapons systems we produce are unmatched, Our commercial and military satellites are phenomenal in what they can do, And our orbital manned space program – a program the United States will walk away from this year – is second to none. But our leadership is being threatened by other countries intent on replacing the U.S. as the world’s leader in aerospace. Today, we’re not trying to reclaim our lead. We’re trying to keep it. The question is: Will we take the steps required to maintain our leadership? Or will we allow aerospace and aviation to join the list of industries that America used to lead? Aerospace Makes America Strong To understand why that’s so important, we have to look at what aerospace has done for our country. I was fortunate enough to join this industry in the final quarter of a remarkable century. To me, American aerospace defined the 20th Century. It helped win World War II. It brought the world closer together with commercial air travel. It changed the way we communicate with commercial satellites. And, of course, it changed forever how we look at the world around us when man first walked on the Moon. I am also convinced that aerospace will define the 21st century. The question is, will it be U.S. aerospace that does it? That’s a critical question because what we do helps keep America strong. No industry has a bigger impact on exports. It tips the balance of trade in our favor by about $53 billion. President Obama has set the goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years. Aerospace will be essential to help us reach that goal. When you look at direct ￼￼￼￼1 and secondary impacts, it's been estimated that U.S. civil aviation alone is responsible for 12 million jobs and contributes to more than 5 1/2 percent of the US GDP. The State of Aerospace So what does our commercial marketplace look like today? It’s vibrant, growing, challenging and rapidly changing. A Recovering Market The commercial aviation market has been roaring back the last 15 months, despite the impact of the worst recession since the Great Depression. At Boeing, we have a 7-year, $263 billion commercial airplane backlog. With air traffic increasing at a rate 1.5 times world GDP, the future looks good. Looking forward, we expect world GDP to grow at about 4 percent between 2011 and 2015. While not discounting events in Northern Africa, and the potential impact on the price of oil, the future looks good from a macro standpoint. Over the next 20 years, we see a need for 31,000 new airplanes. That’s a $3.6 trillion dollar market. It’s a market many countries and companies covet. That outlook is being shaped by many factors. I’d like to talk about a few of them: globalization, competition, and shifting demographics. Globalization Let’s talk first about globalization. The world is more interconnected, yet more complicated because of that interconnection. What happens in other areas of the world matters everywhere. We saw that with the earthquake in Japan. Despite the fact that our factories in Washington state are more than 4,000 miles from the epicenter, we felt the impact of that disaster. Tom Friedman was right; the world is flat. Globalization means our partners and customers are not just in the U.S.; they are around the world. And of course, globalization drives air traffic. In 1990, 72 percent of passenger traffic was in Europe and the Americas. By 2030, that number will be only 45 percent. Soon, over half of the world’s GDP will be coming from emerging countries. Increased Competition We’re also seeing increased competition. The traditional duopoly between Boeing and Airbus is over. Other countries and companies are attracted by the $3.6 trillion market I mentioned earlier... countries like China with Comac, Russia with Sukhoi, Canada with Bombardier and Brazil with Embraer. Not all the new entrants will be successful, but some of them will. We’ve got to assume our competitors will do what they say they’re going to do. They have the financial and intellectual resources necessary. Let me give you an example. The Chinese have made commercial aviation a national priority. They spent $5 billion on a regional jet. It didn’t meet market expectations. They are now developing the C-919, a narrow-body airplane to compete with the 737. It will be competitive in China. Eventually, Chinese airplanes will compete around the world. ￼￼￼￼￼2 China is investing $30 billion in this industry. They’re one of only three countries to put a man into space and once they make something a national priority, they make it happen. At the same time, China is the largest market outside the United States for many companies – including Boeing. And the desire for market access has convinced many American executives to share technologies that may one day help Chinese companies compete around the world for the same business. We have to be very mindful in balancing those risks and potential rewards, not only in China, but around the globe. It’s interesting that China has moved from customer/supplier to customer/competitor in four short decades representing both opportunity and challenge. This should not scare us. It should focus us. Changing Military Threats Meanwhile, military threats have also evolved. During the Cold War, we knew who our enemies were, and we trusted them not to use weapons of mass destruction. Today we often don't know who they are, but we know that if given the chance to use deadly weapons they will. As a result of this shifting dynamic, the needs of our military have evolved. Our armed forces must prepare for nontraditional threats, and that’s changing the mix of platforms and priorities the DoD is seeking. Shifting Demographics A final issue influencing the future of aerospace today is our demographics. About half of Boeing’s engineers will be able to retire by 2015. The same is true for all the aerospace companies. We simply are not producing enough engineers in this country, with the right skill sets, to meet this demand. It’s contributing to what I call the “intellectual disarmament” of our country. Along with reduced R&amp;D spending, I believe this puts us at risk. If we continue along this path: America will lose its lead in aerospace. We also risk breaking a long-standing continuum of capability in our industry. Our economy will lose an important engine of growth, and our country will be more vulnerable and less secure. Companies like Boeing will survive, but it may be outside the U.S. We will go to where the engineers and capabilities are.<br />

Aerospace collapse would devastate the US economy – it’s a major part of the GDP, provides tons of high quality jobs to Americans, and invests in other sectors<br />

<br />
Aerospace and Defense: The Strength to Lift America Aerospace and defense is a powerful economic engine. We must keep the industry strong. As the U.S. economy moves through uncertain times, America’s aerospace industry remains a powerful, reliable engine of employment, innovation, and export income. Aerospace contributed $95.1 billion in export sales to America’s economy last year.1 Conservatively, U.S. aerospace sales alone account for 3-5 percent of our country’s gross domestic product, and every aerospace dollar yields an extra $1.50 to $3 in further economic activity.2 Aerospace products and services are pillars of our nation’s security and competitiveness. In these challenging times, the aerospace industry is solidly and reliably contributing strongly to the national economy and the lives of millions of Americans. We strongly believe that keeping this economic workhorse on track is in America’s best interest, To accomplish this, our government must develop policies that strengthen the positions of all workers in all industries, especially economic producers like aerospace and defense. This paper explains what’s at stake, and ways to ensure that a proven economic success continues to endure and thrive. A High-Skilled People Business The aerospace and defense industry directly employs 844,000 Americans, located in every state of the union – and supports more than two million jobs in related fields.3 Our people bring a diverse set of skills and capabilities to their jobs: engineers on the cutting edge of advanced materials, structures and information technology; machinists fabricating complex shapes and structures; and technicians from almost every degree field, testing, applying and integrating the latest technologies. Most of these positions are high-skill, quality jobs, paying above average wages. Production workers average $29.93 an hour;4 entry-level engineers average more than $74,000 a year, with more senior engineers well into six figures.5 And that employment has grown steadily for years. Many of these jobs are unique, and require skills that take time to develop. It takes ten years for a degreed aerospace engineer to master the intricacies of aerospace vehicle designs. Technicians skilled in applying stealth coatings, programmers fluent in satellite-control algorithms, metallurgists expert in high-temperature jet engine design -- these skills and many more are very hard to replace. Because many of our programs involve national security, America’s aerospace and defense industry relies on home-grown talent. Of the more than 32,000 jobs open in the industry last April, 53 percent required U.S. citizenship.6 These jobs can’t be sent overseas. That’s why we are increasingly working with educators at federal, state, and local levels in many ways ─ adopting schools, sponsoring competitions, providing internships and scholarships and other measures. We are also advocating national education and R&amp;D policies that will advance American innovation and technological leadership in all sectors of the economy. A Good Trade Government policies that advance free and fair trade in global markets are vital to our industry and our country. Aerospace brings in the biggest foreign trade surplus of any manufacturing sector.7 The industry’s $57 billion surplus in 2008 came from exporting nearly 40 percent of all aerospace production and, during some economic quarters, nearly 70 percent of civil aircraft and components.8 That’s American economic growth being paid for by other countries’ money. And it can only happen when government policies allow the things American workers build to compete fairly in international markets.<br />

ORS Stimulates the Launch Market – creates incentives for future business and creates the perception of sustainability<br />

<br />
Industry watching for decisive government leadership, especially in the budget. Unlike those of most exquisite space programs, the ORS business model is not based upon awarding one contract spanning many years to a single contractor. The responsive space business model calls for a significantly higher transaction rate, which establishes the “carrot” of capturing future business as the primary motivation to perform well on existing contracts. Most companies seem to recognize the benefits that a more competitive US government space marketplace would provide. Other aspects of the ORS business model may be less appealing to industry, however. In-sourcing of final assembly and test, lower contract values in general, a return to linking fee/profit to risk on cost-plus contracts, interfaces based on open rather than proprietary standards, and open source flight software are concepts that some contractors perceive as threats to their short-term corporate profitability. Others realize that these concepts are necessary to maintain the overall health of the space enterprise over the long run and grow the overall space budget, benefitting many companies and shareholders. Government acquisition decisions must be based on what is good for the taxpayer and the country, not only on maximizing the prime contractor’s near-term corporate profits. The government is the entity likely to benefit most from the ORS business model, and should be eager to experiment with elements of the new model and evaluate risks and benefits. Since the barriers to entry are lower and the US government is not their only customer, the small space industry base is much more vibrant, competitive, and innovative than might be expected from looking only at the US government small space budget. For example, ORS business solicitations have elicited hundreds of excellent proposals from hungry industry partners, including many small businesses. Nevertheless, industry’s luke-warm embrace of ORS has influenced decision makers within the government to move more slowly toward responsive space than they otherwise might have. Unfortunately, the government moving slowly on responsive space induces a “wait and see” response from the established space contractors, perpetuating the cycle of moving slowly on responsive space. The bottom line is that industry will follow the money and embrace responsive space fully when, and only when, the government shifts enough budget resources to actually field significant operational capability.<br />

Increased Potential for Global Conflict<br />
<br />
Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces. With so many possible permutations of outcomes, each with ample Revisiting the Future opportunity for unintended consequences, there is a growing sense of insecurity. Even so, history may be more instructive than ever. While we continue to believe that the Great Depression is not likely to be repeated, the lessons to be drawn from that period include the harmful effects on fledgling democracies and multiethnic societies (think Central Europe in 1920s and 1930s) and on the sustainability of multilateral institutions (think League of Nations in the same period). There is no reason to think that this would not be true in the twenty-first as much as in the twentieth century. For that reason, the ways in which the potential for greater conflict could grow would seem to be even more apt in a constantly volatile economic environment as they would be if change would be steadier. In surveying those risks, the report stressed the likelihood that terrorism and nonproliferation will remain priorities even as resource issues move up on the international agenda. Terrorism’s appeal will decline if economic growth continues in the Middle East and youth unemployment is reduced. For those terrorist groups that remain active in 2025, however, the diffusion of technologies and scientific knowledge will place some of the world’s most dangerous capabilities within their reach. Terrorist groups in 2025 will likely be a combination of descendants of long established groups_inheriting organizational structures, command and control processes, and training procedures necessary to conduct sophisticated attacks_and newly emergent collections of the angry and disenfranchised that become self-radicalized, particularly in the absence of economic outlets that would become narrower in an economic downturn. The most dangerous casualty of any economically-induced drawdown of U.S. military presence would almost certainly be the Middle East. Although Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is not inevitable, worries about a nuclear-armed Iran could lead states in the region to develop new security arrangements with external powers, acquire additional weapons, and consider pursuing their own nuclear ambitions. It is not clear that the type of stable deterrent relationship that existed between the great powers for most of the Cold War would emerge naturally in the Middle East with a nuclear Iran. Episodes of low intensity conflict and terrorism taking place under a nuclear umbrella could lead to an unintended escalation and broader conflict if clear red lines between those states involved are not well established. The close proximity of potential nuclear rivals combined with underdeveloped surveillance capabilities and mobile dual-capable Iranian missile systems also will produce inherent difficulties in achieving reliable indications and warning of an impending nuclear attack. The lack of strategic depth in neighboring states like Israel, short warning and missile flight times, and uncertainty of Iranian intentions may place more focus on preemption rather than defense, potentially leading to escalating crises. 36 Types of conflict that the world continues to experience, such as over resources, could reemerge, particularly if protectionism grows and there is a resort to neo-mercantilist practices. Perceptions of renewed energy scarcity will drive countries to take actions to assure their future access to energy supplies. In the worst case, this could result in interstate conflicts if government leaders deem assured access to energy resources, for example, to be essential for maintaining domestic stability and the survival of their regime. Even actions short of war, however, will have important geopolitical implications. Maritime security concerns are providing a rationale for naval buildups and modernization efforts, such as China’s and India’s development of blue water naval capabilities. If the fiscal stimulus focus for these countries indeed turns inward, one of the most obvious funding targets may be military. Buildup of regional naval capabilities could lead to increased tensions, rivalries, and counterbalancing moves, but it also will create opportunities for multinational cooperation in protecting critical sea lanes. With water also becoming scarcer in Asia and the Middle East, cooperation to manage changing water resources is likely to be increasingly difficult both within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world.<br />

<br />
[ ] Subpoint A is Weaponization Now:<br />
<br />
First, the newest evidence confirms – China’s weaponizing and its military doctrine focuses on denying the US access through offensive actions<br />

<br />
In addition, China’s improving space capabilities, coupled with its steadily advancing conventional capabilities, will provide the increased ability to seek space superiority or space dominance (zhitian quan) through a combination of space offensive and defensive operations. In discussing Chinese space offensive and defensive operations, it is important to note that, while many of the tasks associated with these efforts align with what American military planners consider “counterspace” activities, the Chinese themselves do not employ such a term. Moreover, Chinese writings on offensive and defensive space operations are not limited to, or even primarily focused on, attacking systems in orbit. Indeed, establishing space dominance entails sustaining the entire structure of terrestrial and space systems, including orbiting satellites, space-related terrestrial facilities, and the data, communications, and telemetry links that tie all of these systems together.[6] Thus, the improvements in the PLA’s broader conventional portfolio are also important because they might be used to debilitate portions of the overall American space infrastructure. For example, Chinese descriptions of space offensive operations include not only applying hard-kill capabilities against satellites, but also attacking launch bases and tracking, telemetry, and control facilities.[7] They also discuss soft-kill techniques, such as jamming and dazzling satellites to minimize the generation of debris and the attendant physical and diplomatic consequences. Offensive operations will also likely involve cyber attacks against the various data and communications links that transfer information and commands used to control satellites in orbit. Similarly, Chinese writings on space defensive operations incorporate a range of information denial measures. These include passive steps, such as camouflage and deception, to prevent an opponent from using space-based systems to gather accurate information. Information denial also includes preventing an opponent from attacking Chinese space-related systems, which would mean efforts to neutralize and suppress the enemy’s space infrastructure. These include both kinetic and electronic means directed at space-based systems, terrestrial facilities, and the data and communications links among them. This is all consistent with what may be a guiding concept for China’s space operations, “unified operations, key point is space dominance.” Unified operations refer to applying all types of capabilities, terrestrial and space-based, active and passive measures, hard-kill and soft-kill. These operations would focus on ensuring that the PLA can exploit space at key, decisive times and places of its choosing, while preventing an opponent from doing so.<br />

<br />
It is a rule in strategy, one derived empirically from the evidence of two and a half millennia, that anything of great strategic importance to one belligerent, for that reason has to be worth attacking by others. And the greater the importance, the greater has to be the incentive to damage, disable, capture, or destroy it. In the bluntest of statements: space warfare is a certainty in the future because the use of space in war has become vital. . . . Regardless of public sentimental or environmentally shaped attitudes towards space as the pristine final frontier, space warfare is coming.20 The strategic value of space to states is not in question. Advanced spacefaring states are already reliant—and moving toward dependence—on space-derived services for activities across every sector of their societies. Spacepower is becoming critical to their styles of warfighting. Likewise, the injury that can be caused to such states by menacing their space systems can be considerable. Given these incentives, the beast of war will either break its chains all at once or stretch them slowly over time.21<br />
<br />
Specifically, Chinese doctrine, spending, and actions all portend an attack on US space assets – it will escalate because of military tone-deaf-ness and perceived geographical advantages<br />
Wortzel, 8 - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY<br />
AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons.77 These include:<br />
. satellite jamming technology;<br />
. collisions between space bodies;<br />
. kinetic energy weapons;<br />
. space-to-ground attack weapons;<br />
. space planes that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space;<br />
. high-power laser weapons;<br />
. high-power microwave weapon systems;<br />
. particle-beam weapons; and<br />
. electromagnetic pulse.78<br />
PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success. PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S.81 One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. As the PLA modernizes its own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict. The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis. For example, four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College, in Wuhan, have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85 In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88 The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems. One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research. Space Deterrence Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems. In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability. Conclusions There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA. U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims;97 the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory. The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures. Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability. PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature. By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict.<br />

[ ] Subpoint B is Asymmetry and Miscalculation:<br />
<br />
Adversaries will use space as an asymmetric means to destroy US military power – the US lacks defenses and states could act through rogue third parties<br />
Rendleman, 10 - Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The strategy to deter nuclear attack worked throughout the Cold War; the Soviet Union was powerful, but it was also a rational adversary. For this reason, the United States worked hard to understand the culture, goals, incentives, and ideals of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was also open to, and reciprocated, U.S. diplomatic engagement overtures. The United States has gained great advantage through development and integration of space capabilities. This has forced potential adversaries to evolve techniques to neutralize this superiority. Attacks on U.S. space systems can be performed through terrorist proxies, third parties, or covert acts that offer perpetrators plausible deniability for damage inflicted. The United States now confronts a diverse set of adversaries, and their rogue leaders are arguably much more risk prone, or perhaps, just oxymoronic, acting deliberately reckless. These adversaries know full well the importance of space capabilities to U.S. diplomatic, military, and economic success. They see that attacking and disrupting space capabilities presents a significant opportunity to deny U.S. national objectives, to retain or expand their own relative power, and to compensate for their own lack of conventional strength. Deterrence has failed throughout history ‘‘because the object of deterring measures fails to notice them, does not find the measures credible, or is pursuing an agenda sufficiently important enough to its interests that it is prepared to ignore the deterrence attempt.’’30 Given this, the United States cannot depend solely on deterrence to secure itself. It must prepare for the possibility that its measures could fail. Therefore, defenses should also be deployed; though the extent of these should be measured and balanced against their utility, and measured by projected costs, lost opportunity costs, likely effectiveness, and effects obtained in the end. Deterrence and defense tasks are inexorably linked to each other. As noted by Robert Butterworth, ‘‘Defenses offer protection, while deterrence threatens punishment. Defenses can succeed whether the enemy believes in them or not.’’31 There are a number of active and passive defensive capabilities that can be developed and deployed to protect space systems, particularly against kinetic-kill ASATs and jammers.<br />

<br />
The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services; the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets. One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland or an attack that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US.44 Although a major attack on the US is not likely, the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculation that the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike. The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a fait accompli.45 A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49 The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “Space capabilities are no longer nice to have, but are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars.”51 The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets. The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52 Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives. The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces. Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability. The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55 Today, other nations are working to develop new weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—information war. The current coverage gaps in our space surveillance network, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons without our knowledge. Finally, without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy to counter an attack against US space assets. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is to deter an attack on US space assets. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. A senior officer in US Strategic Command recently stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution.57<br />

<br />
On January 11, 2007, China destroyed a low earth orbit satellite. Although the weapon may not be the sole determinant in a military struggle, it does represent a milestone worthy of consideration. China’s military modernization is intended to be able to fight a short duration conflict with highly technical weapons that incorporate surprise to gain the upper hand early in the conflict.2 A likely scenario that could lead to the use of an ASAT against U.S. space assets is a Taiwan contingency. If used as a first strike weapon in a Taiwan Strait conflict, the U.S. Navy could potentially be forced to operate in an environment in which space assets become the first targets. Since the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the U.S. Navy, Seventh Fleet, has maintained a continued presence in the Taiwan Strait in times of elevated tensions between the governments of Taiwan and China.3 Additionally, the United States is the largest customer of space assets, and any disruption to these assets could prove challenging for U.S. naval surface forces.4 Currently, the U.S. naval surface forces use space for several mission related areas supporting Sea Power 21. 5 Reconnaissance satellites provide the Sea Power 21 concept with several assets such as ocean and littoral observation, locating opposition forces, assistance in the determination of counter force measures and targeting. Communication satellites provide vast amounts of data used to exchange vital information, and Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) assist in maneuvering and targeting data for complex weapon systems. Space systems have become an embedded element of U.S. naval surface warfare. During the 1996 Taiwan Crisis, the Chinese learned that the U.S. Navy could be expected to maintain a presence if Beijing were to use force against the island of Taiwan.6 Joan Johnson-Freese states that China’s military modernization is directed against U.S. interference in a Taiwan conflict.7 For whatever reason, national prestige, strategic relevance, internal unrest and the need for governing legitimacy, or secure its increasing demand for energy, if China’ leaders feel that Taiwan’s separation from the mainland is no longer in their best interest, they could move forcefully to reunite it.8 The situation remains a tinderbox and more than likely the U.S. Navy would be required to maintain regional presence if hostilities were to erupt. In 2005, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Annual Report to Congress on the Military Power of the People’s Republic of China suggested that China’s leaders might overestimate its military capabilities, thereby possibly leading it to miscalculation and crisis; this point has been iterated every successive year.9<br />

<br />
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.<br />

[ ] Subpoint C is Solvency:<br />
<br />
There are three levels of solvency:<br />
<br />
1. The plan prevents an arms race from happening – it creates the perception of credible deterrence which negates the benefits of asymmetry<br />
Sejba, 10 - USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:10794:http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:10794 -->)<br />
<br />
The space domain, often referred to as “The High Frontier,” no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons. It is now time to take actions for the sake of space, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide. Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: assured … being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic deterrent against space attacks. As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities. Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus. Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space. ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year. The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations. Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space. For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy is not directly applicable to space.6 Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space. Instead, deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets);9 and encourage their restraint. A New Focus of Deterrence What does deterrence look like in the 21st century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear. ~ Sandra I. Erwin, Future of War—How the Game is Changing … Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… ~ US National Security Strategy, 2006 In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command. The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment. Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict. ~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12 The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent. Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack.”14 The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices. Moving forward, to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them. Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2.<br />

<br />
Lastly, one very popular argument against developing space defenses is the fear that it would precipitate a space arms race. Typically, this argument is more often associated with competing offensive capabilities; however, there is ample empirical evidence that improved defenses can also cause an adversary to seek improved offensive weapon effectiveness. The original line of reasoning postulates that space assets are free from attack now because of the sanctuary they enjoy and because they do not represent a clear and present danger which an adversary feels compelled to directly challenge. Unfortunately, continued American reliance upon unchallenged space exploitation is slowly changing the equation. If the U.S. should develop more OCS capability (such as fielding a destructive ASAT or placing weapons in space) then other nations would feel compelled to develop an equal if not superior threat capability to balance the superiority of the U.S., which in turn creates a threat to the satellites that might not have existed in the first place.160 The defensive theory is a twist of that original argument. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. First, this line of thought assumes that the impetus causing the adversary to create space weapons in the first place can be abated or removed, and that only by making the adversary feel a greater or unreasonable risk does the arms race begin. While America has not placed weapons or even unassailable defenses in space yet, potential adversaries are feeling threatened by U.S. space dominance. It is unrealistic that the U.S. will forego the strategic and tactical advantages that space represents, or will willingly give up the dominance it enjoys today. It is exactly that dedication to space dominance that is making nations like China and North Korea turn to ASAT technology.161 While U.S. weaponization of space in order to gain an offensive initiative can certainly be argued against, the only viable means to protect already threatened satellites is to improve defenses or suffer the consequences. ASAT threats against U.S. satellites already exist and the adversary countries have demonstrated a desire to use them, if necessary. The U.S. cannot afford to do nothing about the threat and hope that it will never be challenged in space dominance. Even reversing space policy today and negotiating a treaty to ban all ASAT weapons would not physically prevent an adversary country from secretly building a robust ASAT capability while the U.S. rests on its laurels. Arguing diplomatically that the adversary country was in violation of a signed treaty would provide little comfort as U.S. satellites continued to be disabled or destroyed. By fielding a defensive system that mitigates or negates the effectiveness of a threat, the adversary country will become less inclined to risk war with the U.S. by employing ASATs if they could not guarantee some reasonable expectation of success. There is little evidence that specifically placing defenses onboard satellites will suddenly cause a space arms race to spiral out of control. Space systems are already protected through various means including threat of an air or surface attack, small maneuvers, configuration changes and others. These defensive measures exist today and a space arms race (if one exists at all) is proceeding at a relatively measured pace. Some can argue that U.S. DCS measures today are spurring the improvement of ASATs worldwide, but it is just as valid to point to inevitable strategic balancing that usually occurs against empires and hegemons throughout history as a stimulus for contemporary ASAT development. Second, there is a simple economic balance that prevents a space arms race from spiraling out of control, especially when matching adversarial offensive threats against competing domestic defensive capability. Secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, explained the economic math, “’I can’t afford as a nation to just do an exchange ratio where they send up a $100 million [ASAT] missile and I send up a $1.5 billion satellite.’”162 What the U.S. could afford, however, is to spend $45 million to neutralize the effect of the $100 million ASAT in protection of the $1.5 billion satellite. Most of the defenses proposed would cost less than or equal to the cost of a destructive ASAT. If they are effective and negate the usefulness of the threat ASAT, then the adversary has to increase spending to improve their ASAT. Typically that improvement cost is proportional to cost of the original system, in this case starting at $100 million. The same generally holds true for the defensive improvements. Therefore, the next spiral in the arms race would equate to a $200 million ASAT to attack a $1.5 billion satellite protected by a $100 million defensive system. And, much like the cold war, the U.S. would be in a position to outspend most any foreseeable adversary and neutralize the threat. That is based upon the assumption, of course, that defensive improvements could keep pace with offensive improvements technologically. Outpacing the potential adversary threat is exactly the goal of this proposal. The arguments against additional defensive measures may spark interest initially but, once examined, have limited rationale that would warrant abandoning satellite self-defense development and employment. However, lacking good reasons against improving the defense of satellites does not imply that the measures should therefore be developed. The Benefits of Chasing Additional Defensive Measures The first and most obvious advantage of developing timely and responsive satellite defenses is that America’s critical space capability would be preserved. Some of the technologies like increasing redundancy or whipple bumpers and nanotechnology can provide additional protection not only against ASATs but against a whole host of natural electromagnetic and projectile events that occur every day. Since nature can sometimes represent the biggest threat to the largest number of U.S. satellites, the additional protection ensures the availability of space exploitation when needed. The expeditionary nature of the American military depends greatly upon space for command and control, and modern military battlefields almost require precision weapons, many of which are also dependent upon space assets. Unfettered space support is necessary for the U.S. military to continue to function as it has over the past decade and predicted to do so in the future. Many of the technologies presented as possible near-term candidates have been developed for terrestrial application. Just as the technology transfer can go from air assets to space assets, so can the applications of some of the technologies developed for protecting satellites. The miniaturization and autonomous processing that will inevitably precipitate from micro- and nano-satellite development can greatly aid unmanned aircraft development in addition to other air, sea, and ground platforms.163 Aircraft could be made lighter and more capable. Ships could conserve space for additional supplies and ground vehicles could be made more reliable and have more room to carry additional equipment or supplies. Nanotechnology shielding could produce new means of concealing military vehicles from a vast array of sensors including from electronic sniffers.164 Just as the space race of the 1960s produced a great deal of spin off technologies, not just for NASA, but for the U.S. military and for the civilian population as well. Similar spin offs can be reasonably expected from developing effective satellite ASAT defense. Lastly, building an overwhelming defense may actually discourage adversary nations from pursuing offensive capabilities against the U.S.165 “If a weapon is vulnerable, yet capable of dramatically affecting the outcome of a conflict, the state that possesses it has an even more powerful incentive to employ the weapon early on in a conflict”166 Conversely, if a weapon is vulnerable and not capable of affecting the outcome of a conflict, which satellite self-defense would achieve against current generation ASATS, then there would be little motivation to resort to ASATs.<br />

<br />
The United States has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities. ,,39 Further, the DoD's Plan for Operationally Responsive Space highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1 implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions. PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The United States must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit. Although the United States maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network (SSN) network, it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space; the February 10, 2009 collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. Improved SSA also allows the United States to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations. While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the United States enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program. The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture. A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished. Finally, small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities. Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons. China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities. Engagement Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic• missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options. In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program.53 Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems. “A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons. Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58<br />

Near space has too many tech issues – hull structure, controllability and power management<br />

<br />
<em>Limitations As mentioned earlier, near-space technologies offer tremendous benefits. At the low end of technology/cost, minor modifications would make some systems available today, but as technology moves toward the high end, limitations and vulnerabilities become daunting. The maneuver airships required to house U-2, Global Hawk, or TACSAT communication packages remain on the drawing board because engineers must solve a number of technical issues. Structure may pose the greatest challenge. According to a RAND study, helium leakage will likely represent the &quot;binding constraint to high-altitude, long-loiter airship endurance,&quot; and ultraviolet radiation degrades hull fabric. 51 Designers and engineers must allow for the hazardous and turbulent lower atmosphere, where vehicles ascend and descend. Although metallized and reflective coating in the fabric might increase hull strength, the increased radar cross section could make the craft vulnerable to air defenses.5 2 Operating at near-space altitudes also presents a massfraction challenge for airships. 53 Lowering altitude to below 65,000 feet would help, but overcoming atmospheric gusts requires an increase in hull strength (and empty weight) and decreases available payload mass.5 4 Because gust criteria significantly influence an airship's hull strength and shear feasibility, high-altitude, long-loiter vehicles would then fall under the same air-defense vulnerabilities as do HAE UAVs. Controllability represents another significant concern. An airship, which must take off and land through the normal atmosphere, requires greater downwind segments because engineers match its propulsion system to the vehicle's operating altitude. Since air is less dense at operating altitudes, designing a maximum speed of 90 knots at 65,000 feet results in a top speed of only 38 knots at sea level. 55 Furthermore, if the vehicle launches in the United States, air-traffic control becomes an issue. Additionally, the effects of airspace, weather, and the airship's large inertia create a need for power and lift controls. Trade-offs among safety factors, weight, and operating altitudes will occur, possibly driving the reduction of operating ceiling and endurance and thereby negating the benefits. Power, gas, and heat management present smaller challenges but require innovative solutions. Fossil fuel adds more weight; thus solar cells become the power source of choice, especially for the endurance benefit. However, propellers, gas pumps, compressors, and, of course, payloads increase the demand for power.</em><br />

<em>These satellite protection methods all have varying levels of probability of success. They are cutting-edge emerging technologies and none of them have yet to be thoroughly tested for satellite protection against ASAT threats. Some technologies will directly transfer; others will require a great deal of modification and adaptation. Keep in mind that these defenses are not the only options available for space system protection. These are just the defenses needed in a time critical situation when the timing of an attack is unknown or will occur too quickly for adequate response. These defenses will be used in conjunction with the entire gambit of space system defenses employed today. Whipple bumpers are the most mature of the proposed defenses. It has already been developed to protect against similar hypervelocity threats to the ISS. The modifications needed to adapt to the role of kinetic ASAT defense is minimal. And, since it has been in development for over forty years and is being used today, the likelihood of producing a commercially viable product that will suit the needs of the space community is exceedingly high.</em><br />

<em>What is important, I think, is that the inseparability of our space capabilities from our total national security relationship, whether it is theater power or global capa-bilities, means that we are going to have a different view of what is meaningful in terms of threats and capabilities than anyone else. We have to make sure that if we are going to pursue deterrence, that we have punishment that links up to whatever it is that we are trying to dissuade people from attacking, and that can be enormously difficult for us, because to be effective our deterrence strategies must take into account our overall context. But we don’t have to worry about those, in fact, and this is my final point, be-cause we really don’t need them for our space systems. We have defense programs that are available. We have technology that doesn’t require miracles to be implemented. We can do a lot of strategic things to protect them and it is not going to cost us as much as the National Reconnaissance Program, for example, by a long shot. For example, we could try rapid augmentation and reconstitution of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. That would in itself reduce the benefits of initial attack. We could have a quick-planned launch for our LEO birds and have silent spares, for example, for ones in higher orbits. That is an option. We could have tighter coordination with our allied and commercial systems and create a virtual armada that could preclude a sudden and debilitating strike against our systems and would also complicate the targeting of some-one who was trying to take after us in space. Those are near-term things that we could do actually starting this year. A little further away, we can improve our space situational awareness, which is going to take a while, and improve our command and control for active measures, such as orbit adjustments or perhaps intercepting things that are on their way up to get us in higher orbits. We might also move toward a distributed architecture for our military support systems. What is interesting about this as well is not only that these things that are real defenses and don’t depend on the deterrent threat of punishment, but that they have also don’t put weapons in space nor do they invite warfare in space. We need space in order for warfare here on the ground, but we don’t particularly need warfare in space. So in sum, I am urging you to consider only the capability to deny someone the military incentive to strike our space assets. That is the defense option, a response to more of the risks that might initiate attacks and that provides more options for limiting the consequences if those attacks should happen. The defense of our military assets in space is possible without requiring miracles of technology. They are sustainable and effective, no matter what other governments or their constituent elements believe.</em><br />

<em>Associated Press, November 18, 2011 [Army tests hypersonic weapon over the Pacifichttp:</em>news.yahoo.com/army-tests-hypersonic-weapon-over-pacific-025853085.html<br />
<br />
The Army on Thursday conducted its first flight test of a new weapon capable of traveling five times the speed of sound. The Army launched the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon from the military's Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai at about 1:30 a.m. The weapon's &quot;glide vehicle&quot; reached Kwajalein Atoll — some 2,300 miles away — in less than half an hour, said Lt. Col. Melinda Morgan, a Pentagon spokeswoman. Earlier this year, the Congressional Research Service said in a report the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon is part of the military's program to develop &quot;prompt global strike&quot; weapons that would allow the U.S. to strike targets anywhere in the world with conventional weapons in as little as an hour. The Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, are developing a similar vehicle. The Pentagon said the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon, or AHW, vehicle is designed to fly long ranges within the earth's atmosphere at speeds that are at least five times the speed of sound. The objective of Thursday's test was to collect data on technologies that boost the hypersonic vehicle and allow it to glide. The Army was also testing how the vehicle performed in long-range flight. The Congressional Research Service report said the AHW would be able to maneuver to avoid flying over third party nations as it approached its target. The weapon would use a precision guidance system to home in on the target, it said.<br />

<br />
In addition, China’s improving space capabilities, coupled with its steadily advancing conventional capabilities, will provide the increased ability to seek space superiority or space dominance (zhitian quan) through a combination of space offensive and defensive operations. In discussing Chinese space offensive and defensive operations, it is important to note that, while many of the tasks associated with these efforts align with what American military planners consider “counterspace” activities, the Chinese themselves do not employ such a term. Moreover, Chinese writings on offensive and defensive space operations are not limited to, or even primarily focused on, attacking systems in orbit. Indeed, establishing space dominance entails sustaining the entire structure of terrestrial and space systems, including orbiting satellites, space-related terrestrial facilities, and the data, communications, and telemetry links that tie all of these systems together.[6] Thus, the improvements in the PLA’s broader conventional portfolio are also important because they might be used to debilitate portions of the overall American space infrastructure. For example, Chinese descriptions of space offensive operations include not only applying hard-kill capabilities against satellites, but also attacking launch bases and tracking, telemetry, and control facilities.[7] They also discuss soft-kill techniques, such as jamming and dazzling satellites to minimize the generation of debris and the attendant physical and diplomatic consequences. Offensive operations will also likely involve cyber attacks against the various data and communications links that transfer information and commands used to control satellites in orbit. Similarly, Chinese writings on space defensive operations incorporate a range of information denial measures. These include passive steps, such as camouflage and deception, to prevent an opponent from using space-based systems to gather accurate information. Information denial also includes preventing an opponent from attacking Chinese space-related systems, which would mean efforts to neutralize and suppress the enemy’s space infrastructure. These include both kinetic and electronic means directed at space-based systems, terrestrial facilities, and the data and communications links among them. This is all consistent with what may be a guiding concept for China’s space operations, “unified operations, key point is space dominance.” Unified operations refer to applying all types of capabilities, terrestrial and space-based, active and passive measures, hard-kill and soft-kill. These operations would focus on ensuring that the PLA can exploit space at key, decisive times and places of its choosing, while preventing an opponent from doing so.<br />

It is a rule in strategy, one derived empirically from the evidence of two and a half millennia, that anything of great strategic importance to one belligerent, for that reason has to be worth attacking by others. And the greater the importance, the greater has to be the incentive to damage, disable, capture, or destroy it. In the bluntest of statements: space warfare is a certainty in the future because the use of space in war has become vital. . . . Regardless of public sentimental or environmentally shaped attitudes towards space as the pristine final frontier, space warfare is coming.20 The strategic value of space to states is not in question. Advanced spacefaring states are already reliant—and moving toward dependence—on space-derived services for activities across every sector of their societies. Spacepower is becoming critical to their styles of warfighting. Likewise, the injury that can be caused to such states by menacing their space systems can be considerable. Given these incentives, the beast of war will either break its chains all at once or stretch them slowly over time.21<br />

Currently, the configuration of global space technologies and assets is highly desirable from a US perspective.67 The US has begun to rely heavily on space assets for a myriad of capabilities in recent years. Some have voiced worries that the United States will lose its lead as the global innovator in technology or that an enemy could make technological leaps that would give it significant advantages.68 That is possible, but by no means a foregone conclusion.69 However one thing is clear, “technology will proliferate.”70 Space technology has become increasingly available to any country or multinational corporation with the ability to fund the research or acquire the technology and place it in orbit.71 The increasing proliferation of launch and satellite capabilities, as well as the development of anti-satellite capabilities has begun to level the playing field.72 Adversary technological advances in kinetic-energy weapons causing structural damage by impacting the target with one or more high-speed masses, directed-energy weapons that are either ground- or air-based systems never getting close to their target, and nuclear weapons that detonate at an empty point in space could put our space assets at risk in the near future.73 Kinetic-energy weapons such as China‘s 11 January 2007 successful test of a direct-ascent, kinetic-kill anti-satellite (ASAT) vehicle destroying an inactive Chinese weather satellite generating thousands of pieces of space debris that threatened many operational spacecraft is of growing concern.74 Another kinetic energy weapon that is of concern is microsatellites (microsats). Currently, at least 40 countries have demonstrated some ability to design, build, launch, and operate microsats.75 Microsats can maneuver in such a way to observe and disrupt operations of orbiting assets. These microsats may soon be capable of harassing or destroying larger satellites at virtually any altitude.76 Because these satellites are so small, they may not be easily detectable as part of a payload or when maneuvering in space. Directed-energy weapons are laser, radio frequency, and particle beam weapons. Lasers operate by delivering energy onto the surface of the target and gradual or rapid absorption of this energy leads to several forms of thermal damage.77 Radio frequency (RF) weapons such as the high-power microwave (HPM) have either ground-and space-based RF emitters that fire an intense burst of radio energy at a satellite, disabling electronic components.78 Nuclear weapons are perhaps the technology of most concern to US space assets. Some argue though that adversaries would desist from using nuclear weapons in space out of fear of retaliation.79 While others say “what better way to use nuclear weapons than to destroy a key military capability of an enemy country without killing any of its population.”80 Regardless of the arguments, one thing is clear; a nuclear detonation would have three huge environmental effects in space: electromagnetic pulse (EMP), transient nuclear radiation, and thermal radiation.81 EMP from a nuclear detonation will induce potentially damaging voltages and currents in unprotected electronic circuits and components virtually rendering space assets inoperative.82 Increased radiation from such a detonation would also have profound effects on the space environment. This would severely damage nearby orbiting satellites reducing the lifetime of satellites in LEO from years to months or less and make satellite operations futile for many months.83 The risk of this potential threat is significant. To execute this mission, all that is needed is a rocket and a simple nuclear device.84 Countries such as Iran, North Korea, Iraq, and Pakistan possess such missiles that could carry warheads to the necessary altitudes to perform such missions.85 Technological advances in adversary weaponry are certainly hard to predict even in the near term. However, if this weaponry matures enough and is successfully used it will create additional space debris from the orbiting satellites being rendered inoperative (space junk) and becoming potential hazards to other satellites.<br />
<br />
Specifically, Chinese doctrine, spending, and actions all portend an attack on US space assets – it will escalate because of military tone-deaf-ness and perceived geographical advantages<br />
Wortzel, 8 - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY<br />
AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons.77 These include:<br />
. satellite jamming technology;<br />
. collisions between space bodies;<br />
. kinetic energy weapons;<br />
. space-to-ground attack weapons;<br />
. space planes that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space;<br />
. high-power laser weapons;<br />
. high-power microwave weapon systems;<br />
. particle-beam weapons; and<br />
. electromagnetic pulse.78<br />
PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success. PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S.81 One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. As the PLA modernizes its own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict. The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis. For example, four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College, in Wuhan, have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85 In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88 The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems. One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research. Space Deterrence Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems. In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability. Conclusions There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA. U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims;97 the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory. The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures. Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability. PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature. By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict.<br />

[ ] Subpoint B is Asymmetry and Miscalculation:<br />
<br />
Adversaries will use space as an asymmetric means to destroy US military power – the US lacks defenses and states could act through rogue third parties<br />
Rendleman, 10 - Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The strategy to deter nuclear attack worked throughout the Cold War; the Soviet Union was powerful, but it was also a rational adversary. For this reason, the United States worked hard to understand the culture, goals, incentives, and ideals of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was also open to, and reciprocated, U.S. diplomatic engagement overtures. The United States has gained great advantage through development and integration of space capabilities. This has forced potential adversaries to evolve techniques to neutralize this superiority. Attacks on U.S. space systems can be performed through terrorist proxies, third parties, or covert acts that offer perpetrators plausible deniability for damage inflicted. The United States now confronts a diverse set of adversaries, and their rogue leaders are arguably much more risk prone, or perhaps, just oxymoronic, acting deliberately reckless. These adversaries know full well the importance of space capabilities to U.S. diplomatic, military, and economic success. They see that attacking and disrupting space capabilities presents a significant opportunity to deny U.S. national objectives, to retain or expand their own relative power, and to compensate for their own lack of conventional strength. Deterrence has failed throughout history ‘‘because the object of deterring measures fails to notice them, does not find the measures credible, or is pursuing an agenda sufficiently important enough to its interests that it is prepared to ignore the deterrence attempt.’’30 Given this, the United States cannot depend solely on deterrence to secure itself. It must prepare for the possibility that its measures could fail. Therefore, defenses should also be deployed; though the extent of these should be measured and balanced against their utility, and measured by projected costs, lost opportunity costs, likely effectiveness, and effects obtained in the end. Deterrence and defense tasks are inexorably linked to each other. As noted by Robert Butterworth, ‘‘Defenses offer protection, while deterrence threatens punishment. Defenses can succeed whether the enemy believes in them or not.’’31 There are a number of active and passive defensive capabilities that can be developed and deployed to protect space systems, particularly against kinetic-kill ASATs and jammers.<br />
<br />
We’ll isolate two scenarios to miscalculation:<br />
<br />
Scenario 1 – Chinese Space Strikes<br />
<br />
The risk of crisis instability and miscalculation in space is high – the PLA is likely to initiate an attack in a crisis<br />
MacDonald, 11 - Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)<br />
<br />
One characteristic of too many wars in the last century is that they are the result of miscalculation that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, the PLA's senior officer corps trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. This means that the PLA overall views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted their 2007 ASAT test. This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government, and reports only to the Central Military Commission, currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. government. Normally this would not be too great a concern, but in a crisis this could be dangerous. Add to this the fact that China has no equivalent of our National Security Council, a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure. In a crisis, the PLA probably cannot be counted on to show as sophisticated a sense of judgment as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability and Communist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead. Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space Space assets, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well. As such, these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and their relative vulnerability can provide dangerously attractive incentives in a crisis to preempt, escalating to war. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise: going first in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary appears to offer many advantages, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable. As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems. Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken. The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management. There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space when &quot;going first&quot; pays off - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.<br />

An attack on US space assets risks miscalculation and nuclear escalation<br />

<br />
The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services; the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets. One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland or an attack that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US.44 Although a major attack on the US is not likely, the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculation that the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike. The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a fait accompli.45 A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49 The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “Space capabilities are no longer nice to have, but are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars.”51 The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets. The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52 Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives. The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces. Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability. The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55 Today, other nations are working to develop new weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—information war. The current coverage gaps in our space surveillance network, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons without our knowledge. Finally, without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy to counter an attack against US space assets. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is to deter an attack on US space assets. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. A senior officer in US Strategic Command recently stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution.57<br />

On January 11, 2007, China destroyed a low earth orbit satellite. Although the weapon may not be the sole determinant in a military struggle, it does represent a milestone worthy of consideration. China’s military modernization is intended to be able to fight a short duration conflict with highly technical weapons that incorporate surprise to gain the upper hand early in the conflict.2 A likely scenario that could lead to the use of an ASAT against U.S. space assets is a Taiwan contingency. If used as a first strike weapon in a Taiwan Strait conflict, the U.S. Navy could potentially be forced to operate in an environment in which space assets become the first targets. Since the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the U.S. Navy, Seventh Fleet, has maintained a continued presence in the Taiwan Strait in times of elevated tensions between the governments of Taiwan and China.3 Additionally, the United States is the largest customer of space assets, and any disruption to these assets could prove challenging for U.S. naval surface forces.4 Currently, the U.S. naval surface forces use space for several mission related areas supporting Sea Power 21. 5 Reconnaissance satellites provide the Sea Power 21 concept with several assets such as ocean and littoral observation, locating opposition forces, assistance in the determination of counter force measures and targeting. Communication satellites provide vast amounts of data used to exchange vital information, and Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) assist in maneuvering and targeting data for complex weapon systems. Space systems have become an embedded element of U.S. naval surface warfare. During the 1996 Taiwan Crisis, the Chinese learned that the U.S. Navy could be expected to maintain a presence if Beijing were to use force against the island of Taiwan.6 Joan Johnson-Freese states that China’s military modernization is directed against U.S. interference in a Taiwan conflict.7 For whatever reason, national prestige, strategic relevance, internal unrest and the need for governing legitimacy, or secure its increasing demand for energy, if China’ leaders feel that Taiwan’s separation from the mainland is no longer in their best interest, they could move forcefully to reunite it.8 The situation remains a tinderbox and more than likely the U.S. Navy would be required to maintain regional presence if hostilities were to erupt. In 2005, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Annual Report to Congress on the Military Power of the People’s Republic of China suggested that China’s leaders might overestimate its military capabilities, thereby possibly leading it to miscalculation and crisis; this point has been iterated every successive year.9<br />

Acting now is key – Chinese impatience and a growing sense of military superiority means that US vulnerability tempts China into attacking Taiwan<br />

<br />
As we look to the future, a troubling wildcard is the possibility that impatience, when combined with a growing sense of Chinese triumphalism, could lead Beijing to decide to force the issue of reunification. Because of this possibility, and the fact that the United States and China will be engaged in a military capabilities competition, even if things turn out well in cross-Strait relations, is not a bad thing. As long as the United States chooses to keep competing to assure its access, and does not let Chinese capabilities gain the upper hand, there will continue to be a powerful deterrent to Chinese impatience. The worst of all possible outcomes would be the dangerous brew of a China that calculates that it has achieved the military upper hand—i.e., that its anti-access/area-denial capabilities will deter U.S. intervention— combined with impatience with the progress of reunification with Taiwan and an overweening sense of confidence that the PRC can afford to throw its weight around in East Asia without regard to the consequences. This situation represents the worst-case scenario because, in the absence of some provocation by Taipei, if China loses patience and elects to use force to settle unification once and for all, that decision could lead to a U.S.– China war. Today, it seems improbable that Beijing would be this reckless, but it is something that bears watching because even now there are press reports of PLA generals worrying that Taiwan’s current policy will lead to a - 108 - “peaceful split from China.”<br />

Recent economic integration emboldens Taiwan and convinces them China won’t attack – they will miscalculate and push the envelope on sovereignty issues, leading to war<br />

<br />
Economic integration can thus potentially lead to a reduced likelihood of cross-Strait military conflict through several distinct processes. However, such an effect should not be assumed to hold true. Before concluding that China-Taiwan economic integration does reduce the danger of war, it would be important to confirm that one or more of these causal processes is, in fact, playing out in the Taiwan Strait. Indeed, there are some reasons for skepticism. For instance, deepening economic integration has not reversed a general upward trend in the percentage of Taiwan’s citizens who self-identify as “Taiwanese” (as opposed to identifying as either “Chinese” or “both Chinese and Taiwanese”). Similarly, public opinion polls in Taiwan suggest declining support for unification, even as a long-term solution. While it is important to be cautious in drawing inference from these trends (for instance, perhaps the trends would be even more pronounced if not for deepening economic integration), they do nonetheless suggest that some caution is also warranted in speculating that cross-Strait economic ties will ineluctably lead to a fundamental transformation in Taiwan’s foreign policy preferences. Moreover, it is quite possible that economic integration can actually be destabilizing in certain contexts. For instance, if economic integration does indeed raise the costs of war for Beijing, then Taiwan’s president may be tempted to “push the envelope” on sovereignty issues farther than he otherwise might. And to the extent that economic integration is expected to generate the sort of transformative effects on Taiwan’s policy preferences noted above, a pro-independence leader of Taiwan may be more likely to conclude that “time is not on our side.” Fearing that support for consolidation of Taiwan’s sovereignty will only decline in the future, he may calculate that action is needed in the short term, potentially increasing cross-Strait tensions as a result. Finally, while economic integration may give Beijing an increased ability to punish Taiwan without using military force, the PRC would also face significant constraints in this regard. Sanctions, for instance, would impose considerable economic costs on China as well as Taiwan. Sanctions also have the potential to backfire because they would harm most the very actors—such as the Taiwan business community—that already have a strong stake in a stable and peaceful relationship with China.<br />

<br />
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.<br />

<br />
Loss of space assets will annihilate US hegemony and military capabilities<br />
Marshall, 8 - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (1) the U.S. military space systems—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligence; and (2) space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’’1 Whether one agrees with the tone, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3 The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world. Importance of Space Assets For better or worse, it is clear that the U.S. military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. These satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. First, the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and signals intelligence from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack. As Gray classified, space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military over the last decade.5 Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to being catastrophic to U.S. security. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. The latter scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability from normal operations. In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.<br />

American retrenchment could have devastating consequences. Without an American security blanket, regional powers could rearm in an attempt to balance against emerging threats. Under this scenario, there would be a heightened possibility of arms races, miscalculation, or other crises spiraling into all-out conflict. Alternatively, in seeking to accommodate the stronger powers, weaker powers may shift their geopolitical posture away from the United States. Either way, hostile states would be emboldened to make aggressive moves in their regions. As rival powers rise, Asia in particular is likely to emerge as a zone of great-power competition. Beijing’s economic rise has enabled a dramatic military buildup focused on acquisitions of naval, cruise, and ballistic missiles, long-range stealth aircraft, and anti-satellite capabilities. China’s strategic modernization is aimed, ultimately, at denying the United States access to the seas around China. Even as cooperative economic ties in the region have grown, China’s expansive territorial claims — and provocative statements and actions following crises in Korea and incidents at sea — have roiled its relations with South Korea, Japan, India, and Southeast Asian states. Still, the United States is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression.<br />

There are three levels of solvency:<br />
<br />
1. The plan prevents an arms race from happening – it creates the perception of credible deterrence which negates the benefits of asymmetry<br />

<br />
The space domain, often referred to as “The High Frontier,” no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons. It is now time to take actions for the sake of space, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide. Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: assured … being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic deterrent against space attacks. As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities. Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus. Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space. ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year. The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations. Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space. For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy is not directly applicable to space.6 Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space. Instead, deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets);9 and encourage their restraint. A New Focus of Deterrence What does deterrence look like in the 21st century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear. ~ Sandra I. Erwin, Future of War—How the Game is Changing … Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… ~ US National Security Strategy, 2006 In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command. The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment. Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict. ~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12 The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent. Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack.”14 The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices. Moving forward, to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them. Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2.<br />

<br />
Lastly, one very popular argument against developing space defenses is the fear that it would precipitate a space arms race. Typically, this argument is more often associated with competing offensive capabilities; however, there is ample empirical evidence that improved defenses can also cause an adversary to seek improved offensive weapon effectiveness. The original line of reasoning postulates that space assets are free from attack now because of the sanctuary they enjoy and because they do not represent a clear and present danger which an adversary feels compelled to directly challenge. Unfortunately, continued American reliance upon unchallenged space exploitation is slowly changing the equation. If the U.S. should develop more OCS capability (such as fielding a destructive ASAT or placing weapons in space) then other nations would feel compelled to develop an equal if not superior threat capability to balance the superiority of the U.S., which in turn creates a threat to the satellites that might not have existed in the first place.160 The defensive theory is a twist of that original argument. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. First, this line of thought assumes that the impetus causing the adversary to create space weapons in the first place can be abated or removed, and that only by making the adversary feel a greater or unreasonable risk does the arms race begin. While America has not placed weapons or even unassailable defenses in space yet, potential adversaries are feeling threatened by U.S. space dominance. It is unrealistic that the U.S. will forego the strategic and tactical advantages that space represents, or will willingly give up the dominance it enjoys today. It is exactly that dedication to space dominance that is making nations like China and North Korea turn to ASAT technology.161 While U.S. weaponization of space in order to gain an offensive initiative can certainly be argued against, the only viable means to protect already threatened satellites is to improve defenses or suffer the consequences. ASAT threats against U.S. satellites already exist and the adversary countries have demonstrated a desire to use them, if necessary. The U.S. cannot afford to do nothing about the threat and hope that it will never be challenged in space dominance. Even reversing space policy today and negotiating a treaty to ban all ASAT weapons would not physically prevent an adversary country from secretly building a robust ASAT capability while the U.S. rests on its laurels. Arguing diplomatically that the adversary country was in violation of a signed treaty would provide little comfort as U.S. satellites continued to be disabled or destroyed. By fielding a defensive system that mitigates or negates the effectiveness of a threat, the adversary country will become less inclined to risk war with the U.S. by employing ASATs if they could not guarantee some reasonable expectation of success. There is little evidence that specifically placing defenses onboard satellites will suddenly cause a space arms race to spiral out of control. Space systems are already protected through various means including threat of an air or surface attack, small maneuvers, configuration changes and others. These defensive measures exist today and a space arms race (if one exists at all) is proceeding at a relatively measured pace. Some can argue that U.S. DCS measures today are spurring the improvement of ASATs worldwide, but it is just as valid to point to inevitable strategic balancing that usually occurs against empires and hegemons throughout history as a stimulus for contemporary ASAT development. Second, there is a simple economic balance that prevents a space arms race from spiraling out of control, especially when matching adversarial offensive threats against competing domestic defensive capability. Secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, explained the economic math, “’I can’t afford as a nation to just do an exchange ratio where they send up a $100 million [ASAT] missile and I send up a $1.5 billion satellite.’”162 What the U.S. could afford, however, is to spend $45 million to neutralize the effect of the $100 million ASAT in protection of the $1.5 billion satellite. Most of the defenses proposed would cost less than or equal to the cost of a destructive ASAT. If they are effective and negate the usefulness of the threat ASAT, then the adversary has to increase spending to improve their ASAT. Typically that improvement cost is proportional to cost of the original system, in this case starting at $100 million. The same generally holds true for the defensive improvements. Therefore, the next spiral in the arms race would equate to a $200 million ASAT to attack a $1.5 billion satellite protected by a $100 million defensive system. And, much like the cold war, the U.S. would be in a position to outspend most any foreseeable adversary and neutralize the threat. That is based upon the assumption, of course, that defensive improvements could keep pace with offensive improvements technologically. Outpacing the potential adversary threat is exactly the goal of this proposal. The arguments against additional defensive measures may spark interest initially but, once examined, have limited rationale that would warrant abandoning satellite self-defense development and employment. However, lacking good reasons against improving the defense of satellites does not imply that the measures should therefore be developed. The Benefits of Chasing Additional Defensive Measures The first and most obvious advantage of developing timely and responsive satellite defenses is that America’s critical space capability would be preserved. Some of the technologies like increasing redundancy or whipple bumpers and nanotechnology can provide additional protection not only against ASATs but against a whole host of natural electromagnetic and projectile events that occur every day. Since nature can sometimes represent the biggest threat to the largest number of U.S. satellites, the additional protection ensures the availability of space exploitation when needed. The expeditionary nature of the American military depends greatly upon space for command and control, and modern military battlefields almost require precision weapons, many of which are also dependent upon space assets. Unfettered space support is necessary for the U.S. military to continue to function as it has over the past decade and predicted to do so in the future. Many of the technologies presented as possible near-term candidates have been developed for terrestrial application. Just as the technology transfer can go from air assets to space assets, so can the applications of some of the technologies developed for protecting satellites. The miniaturization and autonomous processing that will inevitably precipitate from micro- and nano-satellite development can greatly aid unmanned aircraft development in addition to other air, sea, and ground platforms.163 Aircraft could be made lighter and more capable. Ships could conserve space for additional supplies and ground vehicles could be made more reliable and have more room to carry additional equipment or supplies. Nanotechnology shielding could produce new means of concealing military vehicles from a vast array of sensors including from electronic sniffers.164 Just as the space race of the 1960s produced a great deal of spin off technologies, not just for NASA, but for the U.S. military and for the civilian population as well. Similar spin offs can be reasonably expected from developing effective satellite ASAT defense. Lastly, building an overwhelming defense may actually discourage adversary nations from pursuing offensive capabilities against the U.S.165 “If a weapon is vulnerable, yet capable of dramatically affecting the outcome of a conflict, the state that possesses it has an even more powerful incentive to employ the weapon early on in a conflict”166 Conversely, if a weapon is vulnerable and not capable of affecting the outcome of a conflict, which satellite self-defense would achieve against current generation ASATS, then there would be little motivation to resort to ASATs.<br />

The United States has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities. ,,39 Further, the DoD's Plan for Operationally Responsive Space highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1 implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions. PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The United States must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit. Although the United States maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network (SSN) network, it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space; the February 10, 2009 collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. Improved SSA also allows the United States to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations. While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the United States enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program. The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture. A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished. Finally, small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities. Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons. China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities. Engagement Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic• missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options. In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program.53 Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems. “A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons. Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58<br />

Prompt Global Strike is Non-Unique – the military just tested advanced hypersonic weapons<br />
Associated Press, November 18, 2011 [Army tests hypersonic weapon over the Pacifichttp://news.yahoo.com/army-tests-hypersonic-weapon-over-pacific-025853085.html<br />
<br />
The Army on Thursday conducted its first flight test of a new weapon capable of traveling five times the speed of sound. The Army launched the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon from the military's Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai at about 1:30 a.m. The weapon's &quot;glide vehicle&quot; reached Kwajalein Atoll — some 2,300 miles away — in less than half an hour, said Lt. Col. Melinda Morgan, a Pentagon spokeswoman. Earlier this year, the Congressional Research Service said in a report the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon is part of the military's program to develop &quot;prompt global strike&quot; weapons that would allow the U.S. to strike targets anywhere in the world with conventional weapons in as little as an hour. The Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, are developing a similar vehicle. The Pentagon said the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon, or AHW, vehicle is designed to fly long ranges within the earth's atmosphere at speeds that are at least five times the speed of sound. The objective of Thursday's test was to collect data on technologies that boost the hypersonic vehicle and allow it to glide. The Army was also testing how the vehicle performed in long-range flight. The Congressional Research Service report said the AHW would be able to maneuver to avoid flying over third party nations as it approached its target. The weapon would use a precision guidance system to home in on the target, it said.<br />

And, there’s no risk of miscalculation from PGS – silo verification and the number of weapons means Russia and China won’t feel their nuclear deterrence fails<br />

“Today, we can present some conventional options to the president to strike a target anywhere on the globe that range from 96 hours, to several hours maybe, 4, 5, 6 hours,” General Chilton said. That would simply not be fast enough, he noted, if intelligence arrived about a movement by Al Qaeda terrorists or the imminent launching of a missile. “If the president wants to act on a particular target faster than that, the only thing we have that goes faster is a nuclear response,” he said. But the key to filling that gap is to make sure that Russia and China, among other nuclear powers, understand that the missile launching they see on their radar screens does not signal the start of a nuclear attack, officials said. Under the administration’s new concept, Russia or other nations would regularly inspect the Prompt Global Strike silos to assure themselves that the weapons were nonnuclear. And they would be placed in locations far from the strategic nuclear force. “Who knows if we would ever deploy it?” Gary Samore, Mr. Obama’s top adviser on unconventional weapons, said at a conference in Washington on Wednesday. But he noted that Russia was already so focused on the possibility that it insisted that any conventional weapon mounted on a missile that could reach it counted against the new limit on the American arsenal in the treaty. In a follow-on treaty, he said, the Russians would certainly want to negotiate on Prompt Global Strike and ballistic missile defenses. If Mr. Obama does decide to deploy the system, Mr. Samore said, the number of weapons would be small enough that Russia and China would not fear that they could take out their nuclear arsenals.<br />

Treaties Fail – lack of transparency in the Chinese government and actions prove that they use international law to bind the US to commitments and weaponize in secret<br />

<br />
The lack of transparency in China's military and security affairs poses risks to stability by increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation. This situation will naturally and understandably lead to hedging against the unknown. 149 Potential adversaries, such as China, may also employ strategic lawfare to limit U.S. command of space. Recognizing its current technological inferiority in space as compared to the United States, China has focused its military efforts on &quot;developing capabilities that target potential vulnerabilities of the United States.&quot; 150 This is particularly the case with American dependence on space assets, something China views as America's &quot;soft ribs and strategic weakness.&quot; 151 Aware that military options are not a viable choice at this time given the financial, military, and technological gap between it and America, China is beginning to use international law as a means of countering American space power, in part to buy itself time to develop capabilities to take advantage of America's space vulnerabilities. 152 To justify its future military actions in space, China is continually developing doctrine and legal justifications to garner support within the international community. 153 It has, in essence, taken Machiavelli's advice 154 and not only sought to achieve its military objectives through resort to law, but also to legitimize its military actions in case resort to military means become necessary. A. Chinese Lawfare The Chinese view space as an essential arena for future warfare. 155 Rather than attempt to achieve parity and directly compete with U.S. space capabilities, China appears focused on an asymmetric strategy &quot;to deny its opponent use of [space] as much as possible.&quot; 156 Thus, China is pursuing means to inhibit American freedom of action in [*134] space through the development of capabilities to destroy, damage, and interfere with American satellite systems in an effort to blind and deafen the U.S. military in the event of conflict. 157 Complementing its increase in military capabilities, China has embraced asymmetric warfare at a level previously unimagined. 158 Chinese doctrine views warfare as not only &quot;a military struggle, but also a comprehensive contest on fronts of politics, economy, diplomacy, and law.&quot; 159 Thus, China appears to eschew the tactical use of lawfare in favor of its strategic use as an &quot;active defense&quot; to be employed in advance of actual conflict and across the spectrum of human activity. 160 The Chinese formulation of full-spectrum warfare is contained in the concept of &quot;Three Warfares&quot; that combines and incorporates psychological, media, and legal components into a coordinated strategy. 161 The legal component describes &quot;the use of international and domestic laws to gain international support and manage possible political repercussions of China's military actions&quot; 162 and advocates seizing &quot;the earliest opportunity to set up regulations.&quot; 163 Further, Chinese military doctrine closely intertwines public opinion warfare--media and psychological warfare--and lawfare. Media warfare seeks to manipulate the news media to achieve a propaganda victory and break an enemy's will to fight. 164 Psychological warfare employs the use of &quot;selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals . . . to induce or reinforce foreign attitudes and behavior favorable to [China].&quot; 165 Thus, China blends lawfare and public opinion warfare in order to achieve international legitimacy for its actions. 166 This strategy [*135] finds current expression in China's actions regarding the sea--a use of lawfare that has enormous implications for its projected activities in the space domain.<br />

Creating large constellations of small satellites solves launch costs, radiation vulnerabilities, and inevitable ASAT attacks<br />

The US’s increasing economic and military reliance on space creates a vulnerability that is an attractive target for foreign adversaries. If enemies employ offensive counterspace operations -operations which are intended to deceive, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy US space systems -the force multiplication effect US assets provide would be reduced or eliminated. 25 Large complex satellite systems must be protected from enemy offensive counterspace operations, while small less-expensive satellite systems may be viewed as “expendable” if their numbers mean one inoperable satellite is not a single point of failure for the system. As most current space missions have a small (mission vulnerable) constellation of large, complex systems, policy supports the need for protection. The recently released National Security Space Policy (NSSS) insists on hardening satellites against kinetic and electronic attack and maintaining redundant satellites ready to launch and rapidly replace those destroyed. 26 As we invest in next generation space capabilities and fill gaps in current capabilities, we will include resilience as a key criterion in evaluating alternative architectures. Resilience can be achieved in a variety of ways, to include cost effective space system protection, cross-domain solutions, hosting payloads on a mix of platforms in various orbits, drawing on distributed international and commercial partner capabilities, and developing and maturing responsive space capabilities. – National Security Space Strategy, Jan 2011 27 China has proven that they can shoot down a satellite in orbit. Experts now believe that this kind of anti-satellite technology is within reach of rogue states or well-funded terrorist groups, using a medium range missile, a college-level team of individuals and some crude, yet effective, technology. 28 Kinetic damage to a satellite is not the only threat; electronic attack on the communications and links or targeting/sabotaging ground segments are simple means of disrupting the billion-dollar assets the military heavily depends on. While any satellite is vulnerable to a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) attack, it is costly to install protection measures. For that reason, it was found that only some of the national military satellites have built-in security and countermeasures that increase both weight and cost of the program. 29 Analysts estimate that satellite hardening would increase the total system cost by between two and five percent. 30 Increased maneuverability (thrusters, etc) may be an effective counter for a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon. However, the added thrusters and fuel again increases weight and cost. Analysts estimate that to add maneuverability to a satellite system would increase the total system cost by between 10 - 20% depending on the satellite altitude (warning time), nature of the threat, and threat detection efficiency. 31 For single-mission satellites, it may be argued that the short design life doesn’t warrant these increased costs when considered with the probability of anti-satellite kinetic or jamming attack. Instead of hardening, it could be viewed as strategically beneficial to exponentially increase the number of space targets for our enemies that might attack our satellite systems. While the “basic” spacecraft may not be hardened for attack, by increasing the number of targets it makes it virtually impossible to fully destroy the mission. If some satellites are lost in an attack, a robust production line is accessible to replace the inexpensive assets. Subsumptive, large constellations of small satellites is an advantageous idea that military doctrine writers and acquirers should begin considering. Another danger to our spacecraft is the by-product of a high altitude nuclear burst (above 100 km altitude). Large quantities of highly radioactive debris, in the form of expanding plasma that strongly interacts with the Earth's magnetic field, can interfere and degrade our space capabilities. Considering the risk of this threat, hardening of a space system is the single most effective survivability measure. 32 The technologies to harden against damage from nuclearweapons effects exists, however, this complex level of hardening is only used for a few large military satellites, such as MILSTAR. Most of the hardening programs are focused on electronic component hardening to protect satellites from natural environment effects. However, advanced concepts have been proposed for protection against an attack by lasers. If the satellite could be a single point of failure for the mission, the US must advance hardening technology to increase satellite survivability against nuclear, high-power microwave, and neutral particle beam weapons. Satellites are also vulnerable to radiation that is naturally present in the Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts. Satellite designers must consider radiation hardness of electronic components in the design of satellites so the vehicles can pass through these radiation belts with little to no degradation. The radiation dose a satellite receives is dependent on its altitude. 33 Electronic devices must be radiation-hardened to sustain the hostile environment of space. Once the hardware has been tested successfully, it is considered “space-qualified” and may be used on a military satellite. Radiation hardening is a cost driver as well as a performance killer, since newer Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products, that are not space-qualified, provide much better processing power than the much older, yet space-qualified, products. 34 Spreading capabilities around space to ensure that one satellite doesn’t become a single point of failure in an attack, known as disaggregation, allows spacecraft designers to shed extra satellite protection measures, thereby decreasing weight. Defense Advanced Research Project’s (DARPA) F-6 concept exploits disaggregation by parsing different subsystems on separate, smaller satellites. 35 A concept mentioned in the Jan 2011 National Security Space Strategy, the sensor may be on one satellite with the communications link on another, etc – all tied together with a broadband connection. 36 The project aims to replace traditional &quot;monolithic&quot; spacecraft with clusters of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules. The principal objective is the ability to resist or survive a variety of natural and manmade threats like anti-satellite weapons. 37 If one component falters, the whole system does not necessarily fail. This makes the system more difficult to attack yet easier to enhance. F-6 is derived from a number of terms used to describe the program: future, fast, flexible, fractionated, and free-flying. 38 DARPA is spending $185 million on the second and third phases of the F-6 program and hope to launch an operational demonstration in 2013. 39 Additionally, satellite complexity is reduced by dismantling the complex system into less complex pieces, a benefit to protection as well as system development and risk. “Since the components are spread out over a larger swath of space, an enemy cannot take out the entire system with an anti-satellite weapon. If one component fails, the operator would only have to replace one of the satellites instead of the entire system. Another benefit will be allowing small satellite manufacturers to compete for contracts.” - Deputy Secretary of Defense Lynn, referring to the F6 program 40 Finally, consider that a constellation of many small satellites has advantages in numbers one small satellite is vulnerable but many together are power. Could military strategists accept a concept of expendable satellites? Simply put, small, inexpensive satellites may be cheap enough to lose in a counterspace offensive attack, nuclear burst, or other radiation anomaly. Large satellite constellations acquired in small numbers do not capitalize on a small, inexpensive satellite’s insignificance. Acquisition The current acquisition process has decades of experience in building large, complex space systems. Still, with many years of practice, it is difficult to deliver large, multi-mission satellite systems on-time and on-budget. Senior leaders continue to drive home the fact that new technologies must be fielded on-time and on-budget. Congress singled out the cumbersome and expensive process of building satellites as a leading example of how major acquisition programs fail to produce requirements in a timely manner. Two years ago, Secretary of Defense Gates cancelled Transformational-Satellite (TSAT), a $26 billion program, after its schedule slipped by four years. 41 Large satellite programs must normally start from scratch and these clean designs require more money and more time. Unlike many of our military purchases, large satellite systems are not ordered in large quantities and cannot take advantage of economies of scale such as a product built on an assembly line. Communications satellites, for example, may be produced once every one or two years. 42 Satellite programs grow out of control because military and intelligence analysts want to fit as many capabilities as possible on one spacecraft, causing requirements “creep.” It is expensive to launch a satellite and once it is in orbit, it could be there for 15 years or more delivering enormous pressure that comes with one shot to get it right. Clearly this process is not the most efficient to accomplish defense needs, so we continue to refine it. In 2004, spiral or incremental development was adopted as a “preferred” space acquisition standard according to DoD Directive 5000.01, and primarily exercised on large, complex satellite systems such as MILSTAR and GPS. Are the multi-missions on the current large satellite systems truly a required “spiral” of development or are they simply a push to have the best, most innovative spacecraft -- driving acquirers to larger, more complex systems? A good illustration of this issue comes from the failure of the National Reconnaissance Office’s Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) program. These huge, pricey satellites offer extremely detailed resolution and calibrated meticulously precise sensors, however with numerous intelligence requirements from competing agencies the initial design of the optical system for the satellite was so elaborate, the engineers building it said it would not work. There is wide agreement that FIA sunk under enormous data demands and technological risk. The program was terminated in September of 2005 with cost estimates of $18-billion, leaving the nation with a fragile, dwindling constellation of aging imaging satellites, integral to intelligence and military operations, which were designed in the 1970s. 43 Should we just build smaller, more basic, systems? Instead of building one complex multimission spacecraft with multiple sensors on a spacecraft larger than a bus, build three or four smaller, simpler spacecraft that host their own sensors. Additional simplification is available with fractioned systems, like the F6 program discussed earlier in this paper. Fractionated systems can mitigate launch risks by spreading component launches over a number of smaller launch vehicles instead of one large one. If these small, single-mission fractionated satellites share a common bus or other components, economies of scale will drive down production costs compared to building a few larger spacecraft. Additionally, government agencies are now saving money by paying commercial satellites to piggyback a military component on their spacecraft. 44 While these “hosted payloads” can save money, there are security implications that must be acknowledged. Successfully proven in the last year, an SES Americom communications satellite hosted an Air Force sensor at a fraction of the cost of sending up a free-flying spacecraft. The Commerce Department’s Office of Space Commercialization said adding the sensor to the satellite answered about 80% of the technical questions the Air Force needed to answer. At a price tag of $65 million, it saved an estimated $435 million by “hitching a ride” on the Americom satellite. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Coast Guard have also used hosted payloads. 45 Large satellites will not disappear quickly; however, a new method of acquisition must be codified to ensure the military is delivering its space capabilities on-time and on-budget. If acquirers continue to contract large, multi-mission satellite systems, sticking to solid, basic requirements is a must. However, other options are gaining momentum. Multiple, single-basic satellites that crosslink to become a single system, fractionated small satellites, or even commercial piggybacking must be considered if the U.S military wants to continue to maintain the ultimate high ground -- space.<br />

<br />
A New Approach to Space Deterrence The book entitled Complex Deterrence states that deterrence works best among major great-powers and is therefore ineffective against rogue groups or terrorists.35 Thus, deterrence must evolve beyond the threat of potential costs imposed by a punishment strategy. Expressed mathematically, deterrence is comprised of gains (G) sought by the adversary and the cost imposed by punishment (C). Thus, if G &gt; C the actor attacks and if C &gt; G he does not. Usually deterrence concentrates on making the cost or punishment so great that the potential aggressor will not attack. This approach will not work for space because an attack is extraordinarily difficult to attribute to any adversary. For example, in 1998, PANAMSAT’s Galaxy IV satellite experienced a battery anomaly leading to a satellite failure that left nearly 40 million customers without paging services.36 What if this incident was not caused by the battery anomaly? Who then attacked the satellite and how? For deterrence to work, one must gather convincing evidence that attributes the attack to someone specific. Lack of attribution will convince the adversary to attack. First, the probability of a nation-state counterattacking, without demonstrable evidence, is low. Second, the inability to rapidly identify the responsible party reduces the probability of retribution thereby increasing the potential gains to an aggressor. As technology miniaturizes satellites, the potential target becomes smaller, cheaper and can effectively hide in the clutter of space debris. For this reason, the approach to space deterrence must concentrate on significantly reducing the perceived gain (G) or success to be won by an adversary. The conditions must be such that it becomes manifestly clear; attacking another asset in space is pointless and counterproductive. Space deterrence must revolve around two concepts: transparency and diversity. Transparency, or the ability to see without obstruction the events that occur in space, creates a peaceful environment which promotes understanding and accountability. Theoretically, when information is released, under the auspices of transparency, it produces an informed and engaged public, one that will hold a culprit accountable. 37 The ability to monitor and understand the rapidly changing conditions in space is critical to the preservation of security in space. While the US developed its current satellite capabilities in compliance with international rules and treaties it also deemed it prudent to develop a space surveillance network to monitor all near space activity and ensure a secure environment for all space faring nations. This network, of ground and space based sensors, provides radar and optical data used to characterize the mission of any satellite, identify the class and type or to simply aid in anomaly resolution.38 Currently, ground systems can track objects with a resolution of 12cm or greater39 making it challenging to track nanosats. Air Force Space Command’s 2030 vision is enabled by technological improvement. It includes upgrades to existing sensors and an increase in the number of space-based optical sensors in an attempt to provide persistent and complete coverage of the near space domain. The resolution of near-term upgrades will improve to 1cm increasing the ability to track nanosatellites.40 In order to ensure safe space operations and uphold its commitment to cooperation with other nations and the peaceful use of space, the US consistently provides the orbit positional data41 via a public website accessible by anyone. The principles and goals stated in the national space policy highlight the nation’s vision of leading the way in space surveillance in order to promote and provide a safe operating environment for machines and people.42 In the end, for transparency to work, space situational awareness must allow analysts to identify deliberate actions by a spacecraft and its owners and ultimately predict, detect, and attribute an attack43. The second concept in space deterrence is diversity. It provides a tailored approach, focusing on minimizing the impact of an attack, also known as graceful degradation, consequently driving the perceived gains (G) for the adversary as close to zero as possible. Diversity can be achieved through large networked constellations of space-based assets complimenting the existing ground based sensors, with a distributed architecture so that destruction of one or even several satellites does not take down the entire system. In the past, the US employed the costly approach of maintaining on-orbit spares, hardening on-board components, enhancing uplink and downlink encryption to increase satellite and signal survivability.44 In the future, nanotechnology will facilitate redundancy and rapid reconstitution. Presently, several companies, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, are currently demonstrating the technology. By 2035, on-orbit repair along with the robotic on-orbit refueling of satellites will become standard. Spacecraft will use autonomous navigation and conduct housekeeping tasks independent of a ground station. This is especially useful in the event of a communication failure or loss of the ground segment. Moreover, rapid reaction maneuvering capability will allow spacecraft to evade kinetic kill vehicles. The cornerstone of resilience is agile, capable, and functional technology able to diminish an adversary’s gain while increasing the cost of an attack – success in both enables deterrence. Above all, the space industrial base must grow to deliver the technical transformation required to employ this new approach to deterrence. Recommendations The US was shocked by a technological surprise on 4 October 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, a 184 pound satellite, into orbit on top of a rocket weighing nearly 4 tons. In contrast, the Vanguard satellite the US developed and had yet to launch weighed only 3.5 pounds.45 Sputnik completely collapsed the technological comfort zone the US. It heated up the Cold War as peoples’ fear grew over what the Soviets might do next; the strategic deterrence calculus was fundamentally altered. Today the US has the opportunity to shape the future and set conditions for effective space deterrence. Reconstituting and energizing the space industrial base is critical to future deterrence. Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 2-2 states, “Operators and planners must know as quickly as possible the origin of any anomaly and be able to identify and geolocate the threat in a timely manner.”46 In order to meet the intent of AFDD 2-2 the US must embrace the goals identified in the National Space Policy, most importantly to “enable a robust science and technology base supporting national security.”47 Without industrial base growth, the international community’s influence will grow and undermine the nation’s future space security. The US cannot allow its own space industry to abrogate its role in national security nor can it continue to set conditions through ITAR and national policies which leave industry with little choice but to divest itself of its space tools. The US government must focus on the following areas: improving space situational awareness, miniaturizing spacecraft and launch vehicles, promoting innovation and risk taking in technology development, and improving export control policies and procedures. First, the key enabler for transparency is space situational awareness. Today’s space surveillance network is composed of diverse sensors to include tracking radars, optical telescopes and space-based visible sensors. To prepare for tomorrow’s smaller target upgrades are required. The W-band upgrade to the Haystack sensor in Massachusetts increases the ground-based sensor’s collection bandwidth from 1GHz to 8 GHz thereby improving its resolution from 25 cm to 1cm and facilitating the tracking of nanosatellites.48 Although the upgrade is significant for the ground-based sensor network, it must be complimented with additional space based capabilities. In this instance, miniaturization becomes a force multiplier as it allows the next generation of space-based space surveillance to be configured with full motion video. Ground-based sensors can tip-off the space-based sensor to track a specific target. The video’s dynamic feedback can in turn provide greater insight into the intent of the adversary as it observes the target. CubeSat has already demonstrated the ability of one nanosat to take a picture of another (figure 3). Consequently, a successful deterrence strategy is dependent on the surveillance network’s ability to identify threats, characterize the potential damage, determine an aggressor’s intent and ultimately attribute the action to the adversary. Second, CubeSat redefined the approach to building satellites through the development of standard building modules and taking advantage of the latest breakthroughs in nanotechnology. This approach makes CubeSat the model for “smaller, cheaper, and faster”. The US government must adopt a similar approach. While tradeoffs are necessary, government interest and investment in the many facets of the space should allow for good decisions about when a technology is “good enough” to satisfy mission and national security requirements. The approach facilitates decreasing the size of satellites, increasing spacecraft redundancy and allowing a higher number of satellites per constellation thereby complicating the targeting equation for the adversary. Its centerpiece focused on driving down the adversary’s perceived gain (G) closer to zero. This approach will increase diversity and future space deterrence effectiveness within a dynamic security environment. Third, advanced miniaturization is creating a growing market for a very small, capable launch vehicle. As CubeSat gains momentum, it creates a strong market dynamic for a very 17 small and highly responsive launch vehicle. Currently, most CubeSats are launched on decommissioned Russian rockets as secondary payloads49. Up to this point, companies like Eurokot and Kosmotras have kept the launch cost to no more than $40K per CubeSat. As demand rises and slots for secondary payloads become scarce, the cost of each CubeSat will inexorably rise. Sensing a growing need for CubeSats, launch companies are developing a two-stage liquid propellant, launch vehicle capable of delivering 10 kg to a 250 kilometer polar orbit. If successful, such a capability will increase launch market share for the US space industry, enhance growth in other areas and lower launch costs.50 Affordable launch enables satellite replenishment. Even if the adversary destroys a satellite, the spacecraft can be quickly replaced minimizing the impact of the attack. Fourth, changes to US export control laws are required. The primary agencies governing export control are the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Commerce (DOC). The DOS is responsible for maintaining the US’ munitions list which is used to identify which products or services are subject to export controls. Currently, satellites and all related space technologies are under DOS jurisdiction.51 However, DOS is not the most knowledgeable agency with regard to spacecraft or the associated technology and it uses ITAR to implement requirements established in the arms Export Control Act. According to the Defense Industrial Base Assessment on the US space industry, “US manufacturers have not introduced a new satellite bus since the Boeing 702 was developed in 1999. In contrast, European manufacturers have introduced 3 new busses in the last 5 years and are currently developing a 4th.”52 Players within the space industry argue that the US market share dipped from approximately 70% in 1995 to 25% in 2005. Compliance with export control cost US companies an average of $49M per year from 2003-2006.53 This cost was not applicable to foreign 18 competitors. Clearly, export controls provide foreign competitors an advantage in marketing to non-US customers because they limit what can be bought and who can buy it. It can also control the actions of the authorized buyers and users in terms of what they can use the technology for and whom they can share the technology with. Such restrictions adversely affect a US company’s ability to compete in foreign space markets consequently opening up opportunities for foreign space ventures whose governments are not as particular about how technology is used or who buys it.54 In the end, international competition is critical in order to reduce costs, preserve US dominance, forge closer relationships in order to globalize and thereby protect the use of space for all benevolent users. It enables an advanced form of deterrence denying the adversary the option of attacking. In short, space technology must move off the munitions list and into its own category which protects the technology that needs protecting while allowing the US space industrial base to sell non-critical space technology internationally. Conclusion Current developments in the field of nanotechnology are highlighting pathways for spacecraft to become smaller and ultimately affordable. As nanotechnology helps solve the problems of spacecraft mass, volume, and power consumption, national leaders must not lose sight of the fact that it is also opening access to space to virtually anyone. Adversaries understand the US’ increasing space reliance and will challenge the medium especially if it provides an audience and even worldwide recognition for their cause. As future adversaries benefit from smaller, lighter, and affordable satellites, the US must invest in an approach that 19 relies on transparency and diversity as the backbone of a strong deterrence posture to meet the threat in 2035. This new approach to space deterrence concentrates on significantly reducing the perceived gain (G) or success to be won by an adversary instead of solely focusing on the traditional approach of punishment. In order to lower the adversary’s perceived gain, the US’ future ability to deter an attack rests on a space surveillance network that allows for the identification and persistent tracking of miniaturized spacecrafts thereby highlighting intent and ultimately attributing an action to a specific actor. Equally important, the US must embrace nanotechnology as the cornerstone to materials magnifying ways for spacecraft to become smaller, lighter, and affordable while further developing the space industry base. Furthermore, nanotechnology will enable diversity or added redundancy in the more autonomous spacecraft and increase survivability in space while lessening dependency on ground stations making the perceived gains (G) of attacking the ground infrastructure close to zero. Lastly, export control reform will allow nanotechnology to power the industrial base engine and minimize the potential for a nation-state, group or individual actor to create a strategic shock to the space sector. After Sputnik’s voyage, public opinion blamed the government for not doing enough and ultimately risking US’ national security. The response was a significant increase in funding for military and civil space. In a post-9/11 world, the US cannot allow another technological surprise to occur, especially one perpetrated by non-state actors availing themselves of readily available and inexpensive space capabilities that can be used in ways to fundamentally alter the deterrence calculus. Once again, a significant commitment is required to strengthen the space industry and set the conditions needed for success in 2035. The natural deterrent created by high launch costs is disappearing and the ability to monitor and understand the rapidly changing 20 conditions in space continues to be critical to the preservation of national security. In short, the nation’s best technological approach for future space deterrence lies in becoming the world leader in the application of nanotechnology. It will increase the industrial base, lower launch costs, improve transparency and diversity ultimately setting the conditions for the deterrence calculus to tip in favor of the United States. Only then will the adversary’s gain/loss assessment dictate not to attack; effectively deterring him.<br />

<br />
In addition, China’s improving space capabilities, coupled with its steadily advancing conventional capabilities, will provide the increased ability to seek space superiority or space dominance (zhitian quan) through a combination of space offensive and defensive operations. In discussing Chinese space offensive and defensive operations, it is important to note that, while many of the tasks associated with these efforts align with what American military planners consider “counterspace” activities, the Chinese themselves do not employ such a term. Moreover, Chinese writings on offensive and defensive space operations are not limited to, or even primarily focused on, attacking systems in orbit. Indeed, establishing space dominance entails sustaining the entire structure of terrestrial and space systems, including orbiting satellites, space-related terrestrial facilities, and the data, communications, and telemetry links that tie all of these systems together.[6] Thus, the improvements in the PLA’s broader conventional portfolio are also important because they might be used to debilitate portions of the overall American space infrastructure. For example, Chinese descriptions of space offensive operations include not only applying hard-kill capabilities against satellites, but also attacking launch bases and tracking, telemetry, and control facilities.[7] They also discuss soft-kill techniques, such as jamming and dazzling satellites to minimize the generation of debris and the attendant physical and diplomatic consequences. Offensive operations will also likely involve cyber attacks against the various data and communications links that transfer information and commands used to control satellites in orbit. Similarly, Chinese writings on space defensive operations incorporate a range of information denial measures. These include passive steps, such as camouflage and deception, to prevent an opponent from using space-based systems to gather accurate information. Information denial also includes preventing an opponent from attacking Chinese space-related systems, which would mean efforts to neutralize and suppress the enemy’s space infrastructure. These include both kinetic and electronic means directed at space-based systems, terrestrial facilities, and the data and communications links among them. This is all consistent with what may be a guiding concept for China’s space operations, “unified operations, key point is space dominance.” Unified operations refer to applying all types of capabilities, terrestrial and space-based, active and passive measures, hard-kill and soft-kill. These operations would focus on ensuring that the PLA can exploit space at key, decisive times and places of its choosing, while preventing an opponent from doing so.<br />

It is a rule in strategy, one derived empirically from the evidence of two and a half millennia, that anything of great strategic importance to one belligerent, for that reason has to be worth attacking by others. And the greater the importance, the greater has to be the incentive to damage, disable, capture, or destroy it. In the bluntest of statements: space warfare is a certainty in the future because the use of space in war has become vital. . . . Regardless of public sentimental or environmentally shaped attitudes towards space as the pristine final frontier, space warfare is coming.20 The strategic value of space to states is not in question. Advanced spacefaring states are already reliant—and moving toward dependence—on space-derived services for activities across every sector of their societies. Spacepower is becoming critical to their styles of warfighting. Likewise, the injury that can be caused to such states by menacing their space systems can be considerable. Given these incentives, the beast of war will either break its chains all at once or stretch them slowly over time.21<br />
<br />
Specifically, Chinese doctrine, spending, and actions all portend an attack on US space assets – it will escalate because of military tone-deaf-ness and perceived geographical advantages<br />
Wortzel, 8 - Colonel, United States Army (Retired) (Larry, Astropolitics, 6:112–137, “THE CHINESE PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY<br />
AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons.77 These include:<br />
. satellite jamming technology;<br />
. collisions between space bodies;<br />
. kinetic energy weapons;<br />
. space-to-ground attack weapons;<br />
. space planes that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space;<br />
. high-power laser weapons;<br />
. high-power microwave weapon systems;<br />
. particle-beam weapons; and<br />
. electromagnetic pulse.78<br />
PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success. PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S.81 One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. As the PLA modernizes its own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict. The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis. For example, four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College, in Wuhan, have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85 In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88 The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems. One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research. Space Deterrence Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems. In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability. Conclusions There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA. U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims;97 the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory. The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures. Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability. PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature. By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict.<br />

[ ] Subpoint B is Asymmetry and Miscalculation:<br />
<br />
Multiple adversaries will use space as an asymmetric means to destroy US hegemony – deterrence by punishment will fail because the US lacks defenses and states could act through terrorist proxies<br />
Rendleman, 10 - Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The strategy to deter nuclear attack worked throughout the Cold War; the Soviet Union was powerful, but it was also a rational adversary. For this reason, the United States worked hard to understand the culture, goals, incentives, and ideals of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was also open to, and reciprocated, U.S. diplomatic engagement overtures. The United States has gained great advantage through development and integration of space capabilities. This has forced potential adversaries to evolve techniques to neutralize this superiority. Attacks on U.S. space systems can be performed through terrorist proxies, third parties, or covert acts that offer perpetrators plausible deniability for damage inflicted. The United States now confronts a diverse set of adversaries, and their rogue leaders are arguably much more risk prone, or perhaps, just oxymoronic, acting deliberately reckless. These adversaries know full well the importance of space capabilities to U.S. diplomatic, military, and economic success. They see that attacking and disrupting space capabilities presents a significant opportunity to deny U.S. national objectives, to retain or expand their own relative power, and to compensate for their own lack of conventional strength. Deterrence has failed throughout history ‘‘because the object of deterring measures fails to notice them, does not find the measures credible, or is pursuing an agenda sufficiently important enough to its interests that it is prepared to ignore the deterrence attempt.’’30 Given this, the United States cannot depend solely on deterrence to secure itself. It must prepare for the possibility that its measures could fail. Therefore, defenses should also be deployed; though the extent of these should be measured and balanced against their utility, and measured by projected costs, lost opportunity costs, likely effectiveness, and effects obtained in the end. Deterrence and defense tasks are inexorably linked to each other. As noted by Robert Butterworth, ‘‘Defenses offer protection, while deterrence threatens punishment. Defenses can succeed whether the enemy believes in them or not.’’31 There are a number of active and passive defensive capabilities that can be developed and deployed to protect space systems, particularly against kinetic-kill ASATs and jammers.<br />
<br />
We’ll isolate two scenarios to miscalculation:<br />
<br />
Scenario 1 – China<br />
<br />
The risk of crisis instability and miscalculation in space is high – the PLA is likely to initiate an attack in a crisis<br />
MacDonald, 11 - Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)<br />
<br />
One characteristic of too many wars in the last century is that they are the result of miscalculation that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, the PLA's senior officer corps trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. This means that the PLA overall views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted their 2007 ASAT test. This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government, and reports only to the Central Military Commission, currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. government. Normally this would not be too great a concern, but in a crisis this could be dangerous. Add to this the fact that China has no equivalent of our National Security Council, a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure. In a crisis, the PLA probably cannot be counted on to show as sophisticated a sense of judgment as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability and Communist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead. Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space Space assets, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well. As such, these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and their relative vulnerability can provide dangerously attractive incentives in a crisis to preempt, escalating to war. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise: going first in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary appears to offer many advantages, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable. As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems. Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken. The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management. There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space when &quot;going first&quot; pays off - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.<br />

An attack on US space assets risks miscalculation and nuclear escalation<br />

<br />
The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services; the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets. One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland or an attack that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US.44 Although a major attack on the US is not likely, the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculation that the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike. The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a fait accompli.45 A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49 The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “Space capabilities are no longer nice to have, but are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars.”51 The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets. The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52 Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives. The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces. Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability. The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55 Today, other nations are working to develop new weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—information war. The current coverage gaps in our space surveillance network, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons without our knowledge. Finally, without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy to counter an attack against US space assets. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is to deter an attack on US space assets. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. A senior officer in US Strategic Command recently stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution.57<br />
<br />
Independently, the perception of vulnerability in space will cause the US to preemptively first strike China – leading to nuclear conflict<br />
Tellis, 7 (Ashley, Senior Associate @ Carnegie, Survival, Autumn, “China’s Military Space Strategy”, ingenta)<br />
<br />
Finally, the growing Chinese capability for space warfare implies that a future conflict in the Taiwan Strait would entail serious deterrence and crisis instabilities. If such a clash were to compel Beijing to attack US space systems at the beginning of a war, the very prospect of such a ‘space Pearl Harbor’94 could, in turn, provoke the United States to contemplate pre-emptive attacks or horizontal escalation on the Chinese mainland. Such outcomes would be particularly likely in a conflict in the next decade, before Washington has the opportunity to invest fully in redundant space capabilities. Already, US Strategic Command officials have publicly signalled that conventionally armed Trident submarine- launched ballistic missiles would be appropriate weapons for executing the prompt strikes that might become necessary in such a contingency.95 Such attacks, even if employing only conventional warheads, on space launch sites, sensor nodes and command and control installations on the Chinese mainland could well be perceived as a precursor to an all-out war. It would be difficult for all sides to limit the intensification of such a conflict, even without the added complications of accidents and further misperception.96<br />
<br />
Scenario Two – Taiwan<br />
<br />
China’s military space modernization is intended to disrupt US naval power over Taiwan – their leaders will miscalculate in a conflict because they assume an attack will force the US to withdraw<br />

<br />
On January 11, 2007, China destroyed a low earth orbit satellite. Although the weapon may not be the sole determinant in a military struggle, it does represent a milestone worthy of consideration. China’s military modernization is intended to be able to fight a short duration conflict with highly technical weapons that incorporate surprise to gain the upper hand early in the conflict.2 A likely scenario that could lead to the use of an ASAT against U.S. space assets is a Taiwan contingency. If used as a first strike weapon in a Taiwan Strait conflict, the U.S. Navy could potentially be forced to operate in an environment in which space assets become the first targets. Since the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the U.S. Navy, Seventh Fleet, has maintained a continued presence in the Taiwan Strait in times of elevated tensions between the governments of Taiwan and China.3 Additionally, the United States is the largest customer of space assets, and any disruption to these assets could prove challenging for U.S. naval surface forces.4 Currently, the U.S. naval surface forces use space for several mission related areas supporting Sea Power 21. 5 Reconnaissance satellites provide the Sea Power 21 concept with several assets such as ocean and littoral observation, locating opposition forces, assistance in the determination of counter force measures and targeting. Communication satellites provide vast amounts of data used to exchange vital information, and Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) assist in maneuvering and targeting data for complex weapon systems. Space systems have become an embedded element of U.S. naval surface warfare. During the 1996 Taiwan Crisis, the Chinese learned that the U.S. Navy could be expected to maintain a presence if Beijing were to use force against the island of Taiwan.6 Joan Johnson-Freese states that China’s military modernization is directed against U.S. interference in a Taiwan conflict.7 For whatever reason, national prestige, strategic relevance, internal unrest and the need for governing legitimacy, or secure its increasing demand for energy, if China’ leaders feel that Taiwan’s separation from the mainland is no longer in their best interest, they could move forcefully to reunite it.8 The situation remains a tinderbox and more than likely the U.S. Navy would be required to maintain regional presence if hostilities were to erupt. In 2005, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Annual Report to Congress on the Military Power of the People’s Republic of China suggested that China’s leaders might overestimate its military capabilities, thereby possibly leading it to miscalculation and crisis; this point has been iterated every successive year.9<br />
<br />
Acting now is key – Chinese impatience and a growing sense of military superiority means that US vulnerability tempts China into attacking Taiwan<br />

<br />
As we look to the future, a troubling wildcard is the possibility that impatience, when combined with a growing sense of Chinese triumphalism, could lead Beijing to decide to force the issue of reunification. Because of this possibility, and the fact that the United States and China will be engaged in a military capabilities competition, even if things turn out well in cross-Strait relations, is not a bad thing. As long as the United States chooses to keep competing to assure its access, and does not let Chinese capabilities gain the upper hand, there will continue to be a powerful deterrent to Chinese impatience. The worst of all possible outcomes would be the dangerous brew of a China that calculates that it has achieved the military upper hand—i.e., that its anti-access/area-denial capabilities will deter U.S. intervention— combined with impatience with the progress of reunification with Taiwan and an overweening sense of confidence that the PRC can afford to throw its weight around in East Asia without regard to the consequences. This situation represents the worst-case scenario because, in the absence of some provocation by Taipei, if China loses patience and elects to use force to settle unification once and for all, that decision could lead to a U.S.– China war. Today, it seems improbable that Beijing would be this reckless, but it is something that bears watching because even now there are press reports of PLA generals worrying that Taiwan’s current policy will lead to a - 108 - “peaceful split from China.”<br />

Recent economic integration emboldens Taiwan and convinces them China won’t attack – they will miscalculate and push the envelope on sovereignty issues, leading to war<br />

<br />
Economic integration can thus potentially lead to a reduced likelihood of cross-Strait military conflict through several distinct processes. However, such an effect should not be assumed to hold true. Before concluding that China-Taiwan economic integration does reduce the danger of war, it would be important to confirm that one or more of these causal processes is, in fact, playing out in the Taiwan Strait. Indeed, there are some reasons for skepticism. For instance, deepening economic integration has not reversed a general upward trend in the percentage of Taiwan’s citizens who self-identify as “Taiwanese” (as opposed to identifying as either “Chinese” or “both Chinese and Taiwanese”). Similarly, public opinion polls in Taiwan suggest declining support for unification, even as a long-term solution. While it is important to be cautious in drawing inference from these trends (for instance, perhaps the trends would be even more pronounced if not for deepening economic integration), they do nonetheless suggest that some caution is also warranted in speculating that cross-Strait economic ties will ineluctably lead to a fundamental transformation in Taiwan’s foreign policy preferences. Moreover, it is quite possible that economic integration can actually be destabilizing in certain contexts. For instance, if economic integration does indeed raise the costs of war for Beijing, then Taiwan’s president may be tempted to “push the envelope” on sovereignty issues farther than he otherwise might. And to the extent that economic integration is expected to generate the sort of transformative effects on Taiwan’s policy preferences noted above, a pro-independence leader of Taiwan may be more likely to conclude that “time is not on our side.” Fearing that support for consolidation of Taiwan’s sovereignty will only decline in the future, he may calculate that action is needed in the short term, potentially increasing cross-Strait tensions as a result. Finally, while economic integration may give Beijing an increased ability to punish Taiwan without using military force, the PRC would also face significant constraints in this regard. Sanctions, for instance, would impose considerable economic costs on China as well as Taiwan. Sanctions also have the potential to backfire because they would harm most the very actors—such as the Taiwan business community—that already have a strong stake in a stable and peaceful relationship with China.<br />

<br />
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.<br />

[ ] Subpoint C is Hegemony:<br />
<br />
Loss of space assets will annihilate US hegemony and military capabilities<br />
Marshall, 8 - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (1) the U.S. military space systems—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligence; and (2) space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’’1 Whether one agrees with the tone, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3 The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world. Importance of Space Assets For better or worse, it is clear that the U.S. military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. These satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. First, the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and signals intelligence from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack. As Gray classified, space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military over the last decade.5 Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to being catastrophic to U.S. security. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. The latter scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability from normal operations. In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.<br />

American retrenchment could have devastating consequences. Without an American security blanket, regional powers could rearm in an attempt to balance against emerging threats. Under this scenario, there would be a heightened possibility of arms races, miscalculation, or other crises spiraling into all-out conflict. Alternatively, in seeking to accommodate the stronger powers, weaker powers may shift their geopolitical posture away from the United States. Either way, hostile states would be emboldened to make aggressive moves in their regions. As rival powers rise, Asia in particular is likely to emerge as a zone of great-power competition. Beijing’s economic rise has enabled a dramatic military buildup focused on acquisitions of naval, cruise, and ballistic missiles, long-range stealth aircraft, and anti-satellite capabilities. China’s strategic modernization is aimed, ultimately, at denying the United States access to the seas around China. Even as cooperative economic ties in the region have grown, China’s expansive territorial claims — and provocative statements and actions following crises in Korea and incidents at sea — have roiled its relations with South Korea, Japan, India, and Southeast Asian states. Still, the United States is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression.<br />

<br />
The United States has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities. ,,39 Further, the DoD's Plan for Operationally Responsive Space highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1 implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions. PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The United States must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit. Although the United States maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network (SSN) network, it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space; the February 10, 2009 collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. Improved SSA also allows the United States to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations. While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the United States enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program. The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture. A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished. Finally, small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities. Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons. China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities. Engagement Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic• missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options. In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program.53 Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems. “A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons. Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58<br />

Defensive action in space doesn’t cause an arms race – one already exists, the US can dissuade adversaries by outspending them, and it deters an attack by nullifying the effectiveness of current ASATs<br />

Lastly, one very popular argument against developing space defenses is the fear that it would precipitate a space arms race. Typically, this argument is more often associated with competing offensive capabilities; however, there is ample empirical evidence that improved defenses can also cause an adversary to seek improved offensive weapon effectiveness. The original line of reasoning postulates that space assets are free from attack now because of the sanctuary they enjoy and because they do not represent a clear and present danger which an adversary feels compelled to directly challenge. Unfortunately, continued American reliance upon unchallenged space exploitation is slowly changing the equation. If the U.S. should develop more OCS capability (such as fielding a destructive ASAT or placing weapons in space) then other nations would feel compelled to develop an equal if not superior threat capability to balance the superiority of the U.S., which in turn creates a threat to the satellites that might not have existed in the first place.160 The defensive theory is a twist of that original argument. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. First, this line of thought assumes that the impetus causing the adversary to create space weapons in the first place can be abated or removed, and that only by making the adversary feel a greater or unreasonable risk does the arms race begin. While America has not placed weapons or even unassailable defenses in space yet, potential adversaries are feeling threatened by U.S. space dominance. It is unrealistic that the U.S. will forego the strategic and tactical advantages that space represents, or will willingly give up the dominance it enjoys today. It is exactly that dedication to space dominance that is making nations like China and North Korea turn to ASAT technology.161 While U.S. weaponization of space in order to gain an offensive initiative can certainly be argued against, the only viable means to protect already threatened satellites is to improve defenses or suffer the consequences. ASAT threats against U.S. satellites already exist and the adversary countries have demonstrated a desire to use them, if necessary. The U.S. cannot afford to do nothing about the threat and hope that it will never be challenged in space dominance. Even reversing space policy today and negotiating a treaty to ban all ASAT weapons would not physically prevent an adversary country from secretly building a robust ASAT capability while the U.S. rests on its laurels. Arguing diplomatically that the adversary country was in violation of a signed treaty would provide little comfort as U.S. satellites continued to be disabled or destroyed. By fielding a defensive system that mitigates or negates the effectiveness of a threat, the adversary country will become less inclined to risk war with the U.S. by employing ASATs if they could not guarantee some reasonable expectation of success. There is little evidence that specifically placing defenses onboard satellites will suddenly cause a space arms race to spiral out of control. Space systems are already protected through various means including threat of an air or surface attack, small maneuvers, configuration changes and others. These defensive measures exist today and a space arms race (if one exists at all) is proceeding at a relatively measured pace. Some can argue that U.S. DCS measures today are spurring the improvement of ASATs worldwide, but it is just as valid to point to inevitable strategic balancing that usually occurs against empires and hegemons throughout history as a stimulus for contemporary ASAT development. Second, there is a simple economic balance that prevents a space arms race from spiraling out of control, especially when matching adversarial offensive threats against competing domestic defensive capability. Secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, explained the economic math, “’I can’t afford as a nation to just do an exchange ratio where they send up a $100 million [ASAT] missile and I send up a $1.5 billion satellite.’”162 What the U.S. could afford, however, is to spend $45 million to neutralize the effect of the $100 million ASAT in protection of the $1.5 billion satellite. Most of the defenses proposed would cost less than or equal to the cost of a destructive ASAT. If they are effective and negate the usefulness of the threat ASAT, then the adversary has to increase spending to improve their ASAT. Typically that improvement cost is proportional to cost of the original system, in this case starting at $100 million. The same generally holds true for the defensive improvements. Therefore, the next spiral in the arms race would equate to a $200 million ASAT to attack a $1.5 billion satellite protected by a $100 million defensive system. And, much like the cold war, the U.S. would be in a position to outspend most any foreseeable adversary and neutralize the threat. That is based upon the assumption, of course, that defensive improvements could keep pace with offensive improvements technologically. Outpacing the potential adversary threat is exactly the goal of this proposal. The arguments against additional defensive measures may spark interest initially but, once examined, have limited rationale that would warrant abandoning satellite self-defense development and employment. However, lacking good reasons against improving the defense of satellites does not imply that the measures should therefore be developed. The Benefits of Chasing Additional Defensive Measures The first and most obvious advantage of developing timely and responsive satellite defenses is that America’s critical space capability would be preserved. Some of the technologies like increasing redundancy or whipple bumpers and nanotechnology can provide additional protection not only against ASATs but against a whole host of natural electromagnetic and projectile events that occur every day. Since nature can sometimes represent the biggest threat to the largest number of U.S. satellites, the additional protection ensures the availability of space exploitation when needed. The expeditionary nature of the American military depends greatly upon space for command and control, and modern military battlefields almost require precision weapons, many of which are also dependent upon space assets. Unfettered space support is necessary for the U.S. military to continue to function as it has over the past decade and predicted to do so in the future. Many of the technologies presented as possible near-term candidates have been developed for terrestrial application. Just as the technology transfer can go from air assets to space assets, so can the applications of some of the technologies developed for protecting satellites. The miniaturization and autonomous processing that will inevitably precipitate from micro- and nano-satellite development can greatly aid unmanned aircraft development in addition to other air, sea, and ground platforms.163 Aircraft could be made lighter and more capable. Ships could conserve space for additional supplies and ground vehicles could be made more reliable and have more room to carry additional equipment or supplies. Nanotechnology shielding could produce new means of concealing military vehicles from a vast array of sensors including from electronic sniffers.164 Just as the space race of the 1960s produced a great deal of spin off technologies, not just for NASA, but for the U.S. military and for the civilian population as well. Similar spin offs can be reasonably expected from developing effective satellite ASAT defense. Lastly, building an overwhelming defense may actually discourage adversary nations from pursuing offensive capabilities against the U.S.165 “If a weapon is vulnerable, yet capable of dramatically affecting the outcome of a conflict, the state that possesses it has an even more powerful incentive to employ the weapon early on in a conflict”166 Conversely, if a weapon is vulnerable and not capable of affecting the outcome of a conflict, which satellite self-defense would achieve against current generation ASATS, then there would be little motivation to resort to ASATs.<br />

A firm commitment to ORS is vital to credible deterrence by denial – nations will see attacking as net counterproductive<br />
Sejba, 10 - USAF Congressional Budget Liaison Officer Budget and Appropriations Liaison Directorate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Secretary of the Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC (Timothy, “ Deterrence for Space: Is Operationally Responsive Space Part of the Solution?”, High Frontier, May, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:10823:http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101019-072.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:10823 -->)<br />
<br />
The space domain, often referred to as “The High Frontier,” no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons. It is now time to take actions for the sake of space, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide. Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: assured … being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic deterrent against space attacks. As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities. Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus. Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space. ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year. The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations. Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space. For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy is not directly applicable to space.6 Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space. Instead, deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets);9 and encourage their restraint. A New Focus of Deterrence What does deterrence look like in the 21st century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear. ~ Sandra I. Erwin, Future of War—How the Game is Changing … Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… ~ US National Security Strategy, 2006 In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command. The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment. Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict. ~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12 The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent. Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack.”14 The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices. Moving forward, to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them. Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2.<br />

The US’s increasing economic and military reliance on space creates a vulnerability that is an attractive target for foreign adversaries. If enemies employ offensive counterspace operations -operations which are intended to deceive, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy US space systems -the force multiplication effect US assets provide would be reduced or eliminated. 25 Large complex satellite systems must be protected from enemy offensive counterspace operations, while small less-expensive satellite systems may be viewed as “expendable” if their numbers mean one inoperable satellite is not a single point of failure for the system. As most current space missions have a small (mission vulnerable) constellation of large, complex systems, policy supports the need for protection. The recently released National Security Space Policy (NSSS) insists on hardening satellites against kinetic and electronic attack and maintaining redundant satellites ready to launch and rapidly replace those destroyed. 26 As we invest in next generation space capabilities and fill gaps in current capabilities, we will include resilience as a key criterion in evaluating alternative architectures. Resilience can be achieved in a variety of ways, to include cost effective space system protection, cross-domain solutions, hosting payloads on a mix of platforms in various orbits, drawing on distributed international and commercial partner capabilities, and developing and maturing responsive space capabilities. – National Security Space Strategy, Jan 2011 27 China has proven that they can shoot down a satellite in orbit. Experts now believe that this kind of anti-satellite technology is within reach of rogue states or well-funded terrorist groups, using a medium range missile, a college-level team of individuals and some crude, yet effective, technology. 28 Kinetic damage to a satellite is not the only threat; electronic attack on the communications and links or targeting/sabotaging ground segments are simple means of disrupting the billion-dollar assets the military heavily depends on. While any satellite is vulnerable to a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) attack, it is costly to install protection measures. For that reason, it was found that only some of the national military satellites have built-in security and countermeasures that increase both weight and cost of the program. 29 Analysts estimate that satellite hardening would increase the total system cost by between two and five percent. 30 Increased maneuverability (thrusters, etc) may be an effective counter for a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon. However, the added thrusters and fuel again increases weight and cost. Analysts estimate that to add maneuverability to a satellite system would increase the total system cost by between 10 - 20% depending on the satellite altitude (warning time), nature of the threat, and threat detection efficiency. 31 For single-mission satellites, it may be argued that the short design life doesn’t warrant these increased costs when considered with the probability of anti-satellite kinetic or jamming attack. Instead of hardening, it could be viewed as strategically beneficial to exponentially increase the number of space targets for our enemies that might attack our satellite systems. While the “basic” spacecraft may not be hardened for attack, by increasing the number of targets it makes it virtually impossible to fully destroy the mission. If some satellites are lost in an attack, a robust production line is accessible to replace the inexpensive assets. Subsumptive, large constellations of small satellites is an advantageous idea that military doctrine writers and acquirers should begin considering. Another danger to our spacecraft is the by-product of a high altitude nuclear burst (above 100 km altitude). Large quantities of highly radioactive debris, in the form of expanding plasma that strongly interacts with the Earth's magnetic field, can interfere and degrade our space capabilities. Considering the risk of this threat, hardening of a space system is the single most effective survivability measure. 32 The technologies to harden against damage from nuclearweapons effects exists, however, this complex level of hardening is only used for a few large military satellites, such as MILSTAR. Most of the hardening programs are focused on electronic component hardening to protect satellites from natural environment effects. However, advanced concepts have been proposed for protection against an attack by lasers. If the satellite could be a single point of failure for the mission, the US must advance hardening technology to increase satellite survivability against nuclear, high-power microwave, and neutral particle beam weapons. Satellites are also vulnerable to radiation that is naturally present in the Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts. Satellite designers must consider radiation hardness of electronic components in the design of satellites so the vehicles can pass through these radiation belts with little to no degradation. The radiation dose a satellite receives is dependent on its altitude. 33 Electronic devices must be radiation-hardened to sustain the hostile environment of space. Once the hardware has been tested successfully, it is considered “space-qualified” and may be used on a military satellite. Radiation hardening is a cost driver as well as a performance killer, since newer Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products, that are not space-qualified, provide much better processing power than the much older, yet space-qualified, products. 34 Spreading capabilities around space to ensure that one satellite doesn’t become a single point of failure in an attack, known as disaggregation, allows spacecraft designers to shed extra satellite protection measures, thereby decreasing weight. Defense Advanced Research Project’s (DARPA) F-6 concept exploits disaggregation by parsing different subsystems on separate, smaller satellites. 35 A concept mentioned in the Jan 2011 National Security Space Strategy, the sensor may be on one satellite with the communications link on another, etc – all tied together with a broadband connection. 36 The project aims to replace traditional &quot;monolithic&quot; spacecraft with clusters of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules. The principal objective is the ability to resist or survive a variety of natural and manmade threats like anti-satellite weapons. 37 If one component falters, the whole system does not necessarily fail. This makes the system more difficult to attack yet easier to enhance. F-6 is derived from a number of terms used to describe the program: future, fast, flexible, fractionated, and free-flying. 38 DARPA is spending $185 million on the second and third phases of the F-6 program and hope to launch an operational demonstration in 2013. 39 Additionally, satellite complexity is reduced by dismantling the complex system into less complex pieces, a benefit to protection as well as system development and risk. “Since the components are spread out over a larger swath of space, an enemy cannot take out the entire system with an anti-satellite weapon. If one component fails, the operator would only have to replace one of the satellites instead of the entire system. Another benefit will be allowing small satellite manufacturers to compete for contracts.” - Deputy Secretary of Defense Lynn, referring to the F6 program 40 Finally, consider that a constellation of many small satellites has advantages in numbers one small satellite is vulnerable but many together are power. Could military strategists accept a concept of expendable satellites? Simply put, small, inexpensive satellites may be cheap enough to lose in a counterspace offensive attack, nuclear burst, or other radiation anomaly. Large satellite constellations acquired in small numbers do not capitalize on a small, inexpensive satellite’s insignificance. Acquisition The current acquisition process has decades of experience in building large, complex space systems. Still, with many years of practice, it is difficult to deliver large, multi-mission satellite systems on-time and on-budget. Senior leaders continue to drive home the fact that new technologies must be fielded on-time and on-budget. Congress singled out the cumbersome and expensive process of building satellites as a leading example of how major acquisition programs fail to produce requirements in a timely manner. Two years ago, Secretary of Defense Gates cancelled Transformational-Satellite (TSAT), a $26 billion program, after its schedule slipped by four years. 41 Large satellite programs must normally start from scratch and these clean designs require more money and more time. Unlike many of our military purchases, large satellite systems are not ordered in large quantities and cannot take advantage of economies of scale such as a product built on an assembly line. Communications satellites, for example, may be produced once every one or two years. 42 Satellite programs grow out of control because military and intelligence analysts want to fit as many capabilities as possible on one spacecraft, causing requirements “creep.” It is expensive to launch a satellite and once it is in orbit, it could be there for 15 years or more delivering enormous pressure that comes with one shot to get it right. Clearly this process is not the most efficient to accomplish defense needs, so we continue to refine it. In 2004, spiral or incremental development was adopted as a “preferred” space acquisition standard according to DoD Directive 5000.01, and primarily exercised on large, complex satellite systems such as MILSTAR and GPS. Are the multi-missions on the current large satellite systems truly a required “spiral” of development or are they simply a push to have the best, most innovative spacecraft -- driving acquirers to larger, more complex systems? A good illustration of this issue comes from the failure of the National Reconnaissance Office’s Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) program. These huge, pricey satellites offer extremely detailed resolution and calibrated meticulously precise sensors, however with numerous intelligence requirements from competing agencies the initial design of the optical system for the satellite was so elaborate, the engineers building it said it would not work. There is wide agreement that FIA sunk under enormous data demands and technological risk. The program was terminated in September of 2005 with cost estimates of $18-billion, leaving the nation with a fragile, dwindling constellation of aging imaging satellites, integral to intelligence and military operations, which were designed in the 1970s. 43 Should we just build smaller, more basic, systems? Instead of building one complex multimission spacecraft with multiple sensors on a spacecraft larger than a bus, build three or four smaller, simpler spacecraft that host their own sensors. Additional simplification is available with fractioned systems, like the F6 program discussed earlier in this paper. Fractionated systems can mitigate launch risks by spreading component launches over a number of smaller launch vehicles instead of one large one. If these small, single-mission fractionated satellites share a common bus or other components, economies of scale will drive down production costs compared to building a few larger spacecraft. Additionally, government agencies are now saving money by paying commercial satellites to piggyback a military component on their spacecraft. 44 While these “hosted payloads” can save money, there are security implications that must be acknowledged. Successfully proven in the last year, an SES Americom communications satellite hosted an Air Force sensor at a fraction of the cost of sending up a free-flying spacecraft. The Commerce Department’s Office of Space Commercialization said adding the sensor to the satellite answered about 80% of the technical questions the Air Force needed to answer. At a price tag of $65 million, it saved an estimated $435 million by “hitching a ride” on the Americom satellite. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Coast Guard have also used hosted payloads. 45 Large satellites will not disappear quickly; however, a new method of acquisition must be codified to ensure the military is delivering its space capabilities on-time and on-budget. If acquirers continue to contract large, multi-mission satellite systems, sticking to solid, basic requirements is a must. However, other options are gaining momentum. Multiple, single-basic satellites that crosslink to become a single system, fractionated small satellites, or even commercial piggybacking must be considered if the U.S military wants to continue to maintain the ultimate high ground -- space.<br />

A New Approach to Space Deterrence The book entitled Complex Deterrence states that deterrence works best among major great-powers and is therefore ineffective against rogue groups or terrorists.35 Thus, deterrence must evolve beyond the threat of potential costs imposed by a punishment strategy. Expressed mathematically, deterrence is comprised of gains (G) sought by the adversary and the cost imposed by punishment (C). Thus, if G &gt; C the actor attacks and if C &gt; G he does not. Usually deterrence concentrates on making the cost or punishment so great that the potential aggressor will not attack. This approach will not work for space because an attack is extraordinarily difficult to attribute to any adversary. For example, in 1998, PANAMSAT’s Galaxy IV satellite experienced a battery anomaly leading to a satellite failure that left nearly 40 million customers without paging services.36 What if this incident was not caused by the battery anomaly? Who then attacked the satellite and how? For deterrence to work, one must gather convincing evidence that attributes the attack to someone specific. Lack of attribution will convince the adversary to attack. First, the probability of a nation-state counterattacking, without demonstrable evidence, is low. Second, the inability to rapidly identify the responsible party reduces the probability of retribution thereby increasing the potential gains to an aggressor. As technology miniaturizes satellites, the potential target becomes smaller, cheaper and can effectively hide in the clutter of space debris. For this reason, the approach to space deterrence must concentrate on significantly reducing the perceived gain (G) or success to be won by an adversary. The conditions must be such that it becomes manifestly clear; attacking another asset in space is pointless and counterproductive. Space deterrence must revolve around two concepts: transparency and diversity. Transparency, or the ability to see without obstruction the events that occur in space, creates a peaceful environment which promotes understanding and accountability. Theoretically, when information is released, under the auspices of transparency, it produces an informed and engaged public, one that will hold a culprit accountable. 37 The ability to monitor and understand the rapidly changing conditions in space is critical to the preservation of security in space. While the US developed its current satellite capabilities in compliance with international rules and treaties it also deemed it prudent to develop a space surveillance network to monitor all near space activity and ensure a secure environment for all space faring nations. This network, of ground and space based sensors, provides radar and optical data used to characterize the mission of any satellite, identify the class and type or to simply aid in anomaly resolution.38 Currently, ground systems can track objects with a resolution of 12cm or greater39 making it challenging to track nanosats. Air Force Space Command’s 2030 vision is enabled by technological improvement. It includes upgrades to existing sensors and an increase in the number of space-based optical sensors in an attempt to provide persistent and complete coverage of the near space domain. The resolution of near-term upgrades will improve to 1cm increasing the ability to track nanosatellites.40 In order to ensure safe space operations and uphold its commitment to cooperation with other nations and the peaceful use of space, the US consistently provides the orbit positional data41 via a public website accessible by anyone. The principles and goals stated in the national space policy highlight the nation’s vision of leading the way in space surveillance in order to promote and provide a safe operating environment for machines and people.42 In the end, for transparency to work, space situational awareness must allow analysts to identify deliberate actions by a spacecraft and its owners and ultimately predict, detect, and attribute an attack43. The second concept in space deterrence is diversity. It provides a tailored approach, focusing on minimizing the impact of an attack, also known as graceful degradation, consequently driving the perceived gains (G) for the adversary as close to zero as possible. Diversity can be achieved through large networked constellations of space-based assets complimenting the existing ground based sensors, with a distributed architecture so that destruction of one or even several satellites does not take down the entire system. In the past, the US employed the costly approach of maintaining on-orbit spares, hardening on-board components, enhancing uplink and downlink encryption to increase satellite and signal survivability.44 In the future, nanotechnology will facilitate redundancy and rapid reconstitution. Presently, several companies, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, are currently demonstrating the technology. By 2035, on-orbit repair along with the robotic on-orbit refueling of satellites will become standard. Spacecraft will use autonomous navigation and conduct housekeeping tasks independent of a ground station. This is especially useful in the event of a communication failure or loss of the ground segment. Moreover, rapid reaction maneuvering capability will allow spacecraft to evade kinetic kill vehicles. The cornerstone of resilience is agile, capable, and functional technology able to diminish an adversary’s gain while increasing the cost of an attack – success in both enables deterrence. Above all, the space industrial base must grow to deliver the technical transformation required to employ this new approach to deterrence. Recommendations The US was shocked by a technological surprise on 4 October 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, a 184 pound satellite, into orbit on top of a rocket weighing nearly 4 tons. In contrast, the Vanguard satellite the US developed and had yet to launch weighed only 3.5 pounds.45 Sputnik completely collapsed the technological comfort zone the US. It heated up the Cold War as peoples’ fear grew over what the Soviets might do next; the strategic deterrence calculus was fundamentally altered. Today the US has the opportunity to shape the future and set conditions for effective space deterrence. Reconstituting and energizing the space industrial base is critical to future deterrence. Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 2-2 states, “Operators and planners must know as quickly as possible the origin of any anomaly and be able to identify and geolocate the threat in a timely manner.”46 In order to meet the intent of AFDD 2-2 the US must embrace the goals identified in the National Space Policy, most importantly to “enable a robust science and technology base supporting national security.”47 Without industrial base growth, the international community’s influence will grow and undermine the nation’s future space security. The US cannot allow its own space industry to abrogate its role in national security nor can it continue to set conditions through ITAR and national policies which leave industry with little choice but to divest itself of its space tools. The US government must focus on the following areas: improving space situational awareness, miniaturizing spacecraft and launch vehicles, promoting innovation and risk taking in technology development, and improving export control policies and procedures. First, the key enabler for transparency is space situational awareness. Today’s space surveillance network is composed of diverse sensors to include tracking radars, optical telescopes and space-based visible sensors. To prepare for tomorrow’s smaller target upgrades are required. The W-band upgrade to the Haystack sensor in Massachusetts increases the ground-based sensor’s collection bandwidth from 1GHz to 8 GHz thereby improving its resolution from 25 cm to 1cm and facilitating the tracking of nanosatellites.48 Although the upgrade is significant for the ground-based sensor network, it must be complimented with additional space based capabilities. In this instance, miniaturization becomes a force multiplier as it allows the next generation of space-based space surveillance to be configured with full motion video. Ground-based sensors can tip-off the space-based sensor to track a specific target. The video’s dynamic feedback can in turn provide greater insight into the intent of the adversary as it observes the target. CubeSat has already demonstrated the ability of one nanosat to take a picture of another (figure 3). Consequently, a successful deterrence strategy is dependent on the surveillance network’s ability to identify threats, characterize the potential damage, determine an aggressor’s intent and ultimately attribute the action to the adversary. Second, CubeSat redefined the approach to building satellites through the development of standard building modules and taking advantage of the latest breakthroughs in nanotechnology. This approach makes CubeSat the model for “smaller, cheaper, and faster”. The US government must adopt a similar approach. While tradeoffs are necessary, government interest and investment in the many facets of the space should allow for good decisions about when a technology is “good enough” to satisfy mission and national security requirements. The approach facilitates decreasing the size of satellites, increasing spacecraft redundancy and allowing a higher number of satellites per constellation thereby complicating the targeting equation for the adversary. Its centerpiece focused on driving down the adversary’s perceived gain (G) closer to zero. This approach will increase diversity and future space deterrence effectiveness within a dynamic security environment. Third, advanced miniaturization is creating a growing market for a very small, capable launch vehicle. As CubeSat gains momentum, it creates a strong market dynamic for a very 17 small and highly responsive launch vehicle. Currently, most CubeSats are launched on decommissioned Russian rockets as secondary payloads49. Up to this point, companies like Eurokot and Kosmotras have kept the launch cost to no more than $40K per CubeSat. As demand rises and slots for secondary payloads become scarce, the cost of each CubeSat will inexorably rise. Sensing a growing need for CubeSats, launch companies are developing a two-stage liquid propellant, launch vehicle capable of delivering 10 kg to a 250 kilometer polar orbit. If successful, such a capability will increase launch market share for the US space industry, enhance growth in other areas and lower launch costs.50 Affordable launch enables satellite replenishment. Even if the adversary destroys a satellite, the spacecraft can be quickly replaced minimizing the impact of the attack. Fourth, changes to US export control laws are required. The primary agencies governing export control are the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Commerce (DOC). The DOS is responsible for maintaining the US’ munitions list which is used to identify which products or services are subject to export controls. Currently, satellites and all related space technologies are under DOS jurisdiction.51 However, DOS is not the most knowledgeable agency with regard to spacecraft or the associated technology and it uses ITAR to implement requirements established in the arms Export Control Act. According to the Defense Industrial Base Assessment on the US space industry, “US manufacturers have not introduced a new satellite bus since the Boeing 702 was developed in 1999. In contrast, European manufacturers have introduced 3 new busses in the last 5 years and are currently developing a 4th.”52 Players within the space industry argue that the US market share dipped from approximately 70% in 1995 to 25% in 2005. Compliance with export control cost US companies an average of $49M per year from 2003-2006.53 This cost was not applicable to foreign 18 competitors. Clearly, export controls provide foreign competitors an advantage in marketing to non-US customers because they limit what can be bought and who can buy it. It can also control the actions of the authorized buyers and users in terms of what they can use the technology for and whom they can share the technology with. Such restrictions adversely affect a US company’s ability to compete in foreign space markets consequently opening up opportunities for foreign space ventures whose governments are not as particular about how technology is used or who buys it.54 In the end, international competition is critical in order to reduce costs, preserve US dominance, forge closer relationships in order to globalize and thereby protect the use of space for all benevolent users. It enables an advanced form of deterrence denying the adversary the option of attacking. In short, space technology must move off the munitions list and into its own category which protects the technology that needs protecting while allowing the US space industrial base to sell non-critical space technology internationally. Conclusion Current developments in the field of nanotechnology are highlighting pathways for spacecraft to become smaller and ultimately affordable. As nanotechnology helps solve the problems of spacecraft mass, volume, and power consumption, national leaders must not lose sight of the fact that it is also opening access to space to virtually anyone. Adversaries understand the US’ increasing space reliance and will challenge the medium especially if it provides an audience and even worldwide recognition for their cause. As future adversaries benefit from smaller, lighter, and affordable satellites, the US must invest in an approach that 19 relies on transparency and diversity as the backbone of a strong deterrence posture to meet the threat in 2035. This new approach to space deterrence concentrates on significantly reducing the perceived gain (G) or success to be won by an adversary instead of solely focusing on the traditional approach of punishment. In order to lower the adversary’s perceived gain, the US’ future ability to deter an attack rests on a space surveillance network that allows for the identification and persistent tracking of miniaturized spacecrafts thereby highlighting intent and ultimately attributing an action to a specific actor. Equally important, the US must embrace nanotechnology as the cornerstone to materials magnifying ways for spacecraft to become smaller, lighter, and affordable while further developing the space industry base. Furthermore, nanotechnology will enable diversity or added redundancy in the more autonomous spacecraft and increase survivability in space while lessening dependency on ground stations making the perceived gains (G) of attacking the ground infrastructure close to zero. Lastly, export control reform will allow nanotechnology to power the industrial base engine and minimize the potential for a nation-state, group or individual actor to create a strategic shock to the space sector. After Sputnik’s voyage, public opinion blamed the government for not doing enough and ultimately risking US’ national security. The response was a significant increase in funding for military and civil space. In a post-9/11 world, the US cannot allow another technological surprise to occur, especially one perpetrated by non-state actors availing themselves of readily available and inexpensive space capabilities that can be used in ways to fundamentally alter the deterrence calculus. Once again, a significant commitment is required to strengthen the space industry and set the conditions needed for success in 2035. The natural deterrent created by high launch costs is disappearing and the ability to monitor and understand the rapidly changing 20 conditions in space continues to be critical to the preservation of national security. In short, the nation’s best technological approach for future space deterrence lies in becoming the world leader in the application of nanotechnology. It will increase the industrial base, lower launch costs, improve transparency and diversity ultimately setting the conditions for the deterrence calculus to tip in favor of the United States. Only then will the adversary’s gain/loss assessment dictate not to attack; effectively deterring him.<br />

Currently, the configuration of global space technologies and assets is highly desirable from a US perspective.67 The US has begun to rely heavily on space assets for a myriad of capabilities in recent years. Some have voiced worries that the United States will lose its lead as the global innovator in technology or that an enemy could make technological leaps that would give it significant advantages.68 That is possible, but by no means a foregone conclusion.69 However one thing is clear, “technology will proliferate.”70 Space technology has become increasingly available to any country or multinational corporation with the ability to fund the research or acquire the technology and place it in orbit.71 The increasing proliferation of launch and satellite capabilities, as well as the development of anti-satellite capabilities has begun to level the playing field.72 Adversary technological advances in kinetic-energy weapons causing structural damage by impacting the target with one or more high-speed masses, directed-energy weapons that are either ground- or air-based systems never getting close to their target, and nuclear weapons that detonate at an empty point in space could put our space assets at risk in the near future.73 Kinetic-energy weapons such as China‘s 11 January 2007 successful test of a direct-ascent, kinetic-kill anti-satellite (ASAT) vehicle destroying an inactive Chinese weather satellite generating thousands of pieces of space debris that threatened many operational spacecraft is of growing concern.74 Another kinetic energy weapon that is of concern is microsatellites (microsats). Currently, at least 40 countries have demonstrated some ability to design, build, launch, and operate microsats.75 Microsats can maneuver in such a way to observe and disrupt operations of orbiting assets. These microsats may soon be capable of harassing or destroying larger satellites at virtually any altitude.76 Because these satellites are so small, they may not be easily detectable as part of a payload or when maneuvering in space. Directed-energy weapons are laser, radio frequency, and particle beam weapons. Lasers operate by delivering energy onto the surface of the target and gradual or rapid absorption of this energy leads to several forms of thermal damage.77 Radio frequency (RF) weapons such as the high-power microwave (HPM) have either ground-and space-based RF emitters that fire an intense burst of radio energy at a satellite, disabling electronic components.78 Nuclear weapons are perhaps the technology of most concern to US space assets. Some argue though that adversaries would desist from using nuclear weapons in space out of fear of retaliation.79 While others say “what better way to use nuclear weapons than to destroy a key military capability of an enemy country without killing any of its population.”80 Regardless of the arguments, one thing is clear; a nuclear detonation would have three huge environmental effects in space: electromagnetic pulse (EMP), transient nuclear radiation, and thermal radiation.81 EMP from a nuclear detonation will induce potentially damaging voltages and currents in unprotected electronic circuits and components virtually rendering space assets inoperative.82 Increased radiation from such a detonation would also have profound effects on the space environment. This would severely damage nearby orbiting satellites reducing the lifetime of satellites in LEO from years to months or less and make satellite operations futile for many months.83 The risk of this potential threat is significant. To execute this mission, all that is needed is a rocket and a simple nuclear device.84 Countries such as Iran, North Korea, Iraq, and Pakistan possess such missiles that could carry warheads to the necessary altitudes to perform such missions.85 Technological advances in adversary weaponry are certainly hard to predict even in the near term. However, if this weaponry matures enough and is successfully used it will create additional space debris from the orbiting satellites being rendered inoperative (space junk) and becoming potential hazards to other satellites.<br />

It is a rule in strategy, one derived empirically from the evidence of two and a half millennia, that anything of great strategic importance to one belligerent, for that reason has to be worth attacking by others. And the greater the importance, the greater has to be the incentive to damage, disable, capture, or destroy it. In the bluntest of statements: space warfare is a certainty in the future because the use of space in war has become vital. . . . Regardless of public sentimental or environmentally shaped attitudes towards space as the pristine final frontier, space warfare is coming.20 The strategic value of space to states is not in question. Advanced spacefaring states are already reliant—and moving toward dependence—on space-derived services for activities across every sector of their societies. Spacepower is becoming critical to their styles of warfighting. Likewise, the injury that can be caused to such states by menacing their space systems can be considerable. Given these incentives, the beast of war will either break its chains all at once or stretch them slowly over time.21<br />
<br />
Specifically, Chinese doctrine, spending, and actions all portend an attack on US space assets – it will escalate because of military tone-deaf-ness and perceived geographical advantages<br />

AND SPACE WARFARE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
The PLA is exploring in theoretical research, basic research, and applied research a variety of forms of space weapons.77 These include: . satellite jamming technology; . collisions between space bodies; . kinetic energy weapons; . space-to-ground attack weapons; . space planes that can transit and fight ‘‘up or down’’ in the upper atmosphere or space; . high-power laser weapons; . high-power microwave weapon systems; . particle-beam weapons; and . electromagnetic pulse.78 PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies. The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not, it is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the blinding of a U.S. satellite mean they are achieving some success. PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 The Chinese see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they would probably use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.S.81 One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. As the PLA modernizes its own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4SIR) systems, it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict. The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons or a deeper crisis. For example, four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College, in Wuhan, have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S.82 In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85 In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88 The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems. One possible reaction by the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike against China’s strategic missile forces. Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research. Space Deterrence Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems. In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability. Conclusions There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First, in the event of conflict with the PLA, military operations carried out across all the domains of war, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, are likely. Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA. U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions. There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims;97 the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory. The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance. No such dialogue has taken place with China. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures. Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability. PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature. By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S. To this end, the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict.<br />

The strategy to deter nuclear attack worked throughout the Cold War; the Soviet Union was powerful, but it was also a rational adversary. For this reason, the United States worked hard to understand the culture, goals, incentives, and ideals of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was also open to, and reciprocated, U.S. diplomatic engagement overtures. The United States has gained great advantage through development and integration of space capabilities. This has forced potential adversaries to evolve techniques to neutralize this superiority. Attacks on U.S. space systems can be performed through terrorist proxies, third parties, or covert acts that offer perpetrators plausible deniability for damage inflicted. The United States now confronts a diverse set of adversaries, and their rogue leaders are arguably much more risk prone, or perhaps, just oxymoronic, acting deliberately reckless. These adversaries know full well the importance of space capabilities to U.S. diplomatic, military, and economic success. They see that attacking and disrupting space capabilities presents a significant opportunity to deny U.S. national objectives, to retain or expand their own relative power, and to compensate for their own lack of conventional strength. Deterrence has failed throughout history ‘‘because the object of deterring measures fails to notice them, does not find the measures credible, or is pursuing an agenda sufficiently important enough to its interests that it is prepared to ignore the deterrence attempt.’’30 Given this, the United States cannot depend solely on deterrence to secure itself. It must prepare for the possibility that its measures could fail. Therefore, defenses should also be deployed; though the extent of these should be measured and balanced against their utility, and measured by projected costs, lost opportunity costs, likely effectiveness, and effects obtained in the end. Deterrence and defense tasks are inexorably linked to each other. As noted by Robert Butterworth, ‘‘Defenses offer protection, while deterrence threatens punishment. Defenses can succeed whether the enemy believes in them or not.’’31 There are a number of active and passive defensive capabilities that can be developed and deployed to protect space systems, particularly against kinetic-kill ASATs and jammers.<br />

Current vulnerabilities of space assets are the Achilles heel of deterrence – having multiple adversaries with different military doctrines increases the risk of misperceptions and deterrence failure that could lead to escalation<br />

<br />
The 11 January 2007 test of a Chinese ground-based, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) kinetic-kill interceptor against one of their own defunct weather satellites generated considerable angst across the United States space community. The 2007 test demonstrated that the importance of space capabilities is also their Achilles heel, that is, their deadly weakness in spite of overall strength; it is far too easy to neutralize space systems and their power. In the broad strategic context, space capabilities have their own set of unique, inherent vulnerabilities, which are largely the result of orbital mechanics. This invites destruction, damage, and even just mischief delivered by even the least significant adversary. However, other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions. Negation Threats Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&amp;C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base. Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5 Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space, and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologies. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts. Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it. Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases. In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries. As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems. Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments. Prevention Threats Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9 As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11 Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats. Implications for U.S. Space Strategy The wide span of threats poses profound implications for U.S. space strategy and its execution. First, unlike the Cold War era, the United States now confronts a wide array of global actors, all operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities. These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences. Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand. This complicates efforts to understand motivations and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes. These differences, in turn, increase the likelihood of misperception, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems. Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, potential adversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations, or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China may fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown, U.S. military supremacy continues. But, that supremacy does not make or guarantee a successful space strategy. Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the United States in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict. Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible. Fourth, while the United States has produced superlative space capabilities, it has not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment. The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the direst of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. This belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the United States to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems. This, predictably, can now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who, with their recent ASAT test, appear more willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.<br />
<br />
The risk of crisis instability and miscalculation in space is high – the PLA is likely to initiate an attack in a crisis<br />
<br />
MacDonald, 11 - Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis)<br />
<br />
One characteristic of too many wars in the last century is that they are the result of miscalculation that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, the PLA's senior officer corps trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. This means that the PLA overall views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted their 2007 ASAT test. This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government, and reports only to the Central Military Commission, currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. government. Normally this would not be too great a concern, but in a crisis this could be dangerous. Add to this the fact that China has no equivalent of our National Security Council, a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure. In a crisis, the PLA probably cannot be counted on to show as sophisticated a sense of judgment as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability and Communist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead. Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space Space assets, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well. As such, these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and their relative vulnerability can provide dangerously attractive incentives in a crisis to preempt, escalating to war. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise: going first in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary appears to offer many advantages, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable. As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems. Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken. The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management. There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space when &quot;going first&quot; pays off - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.<br />

The erosion of the US ability to execute the space threat warning mission has serious implications for US national security to include: the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland; the loss of space capabilities which would degrade US warfighting effectiveness; the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services; the increased possibility that adversaries could develop new weapons or covertly conduct probing attacks on US space systems; and the lack of a credible means to execute stated US policy in response to an attack against space assets. One of the most serious impacts of the failure to develop or execute a reliable space threat warning and attack verification system is the loss of a key early warning indicator of an attack on the US homeland or an attack that is part of a major regional action by a near-peer adversary such as an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese mainland. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US.44 Although a major attack on the US is not likely, the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculation that the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike. The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a fait accompli.45 A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49 The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “Space capabilities are no longer nice to have, but are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars.”51 The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets. The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52 Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives. The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces. Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability. The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55 Today, other nations are working to develop new weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—information war. The current coverage gaps in our space surveillance network, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons without our knowledge. Finally, without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy to counter an attack against US space assets. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is to deter an attack on US space assets. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. A senior officer in US Strategic Command recently stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution.57<br />

Independently, the perception of vulnerability in space will cause the US to preemptively first strike China – leading to nuclear conflict<br />

<br />
Finally, the growing Chinese capability for space warfare implies that a future conflict in the Taiwan Strait would entail serious deterrence and crisis instabilities. If such a clash were to compel Beijing to attack US space systems at the beginning of a war, the very prospect of such a ‘space Pearl Harbor’94 could, in turn, provoke the United States to contemplate pre-emptive attacks or horizontal escalation on the Chinese mainland. Such outcomes would be particularly likely in a conflict in the next decade, before Washington has the opportunity to invest fully in redundant space capabilities. Already, US Strategic Command officials have publicly signalled that conventionally armed Trident submarine- launched ballistic missiles would be appropriate weapons for executing the prompt strikes that might become necessary in such a contingency.95 Such attacks, even if employing only conventional warheads, on space launch sites, sensor nodes and command and control installations on the Chinese mainland could well be perceived as a precursor to an all-out war. It would be difficult for all sides to limit the intensification of such a conflict, even without the added complications of accidents and further misperception.96<br />

<br />
On January 11, 2007, China destroyed a low earth orbit satellite. Although the weapon may not be the sole determinant in a military struggle, it does represent a milestone worthy of consideration. China’s military modernization is intended to be able to fight a short duration conflict with highly technical weapons that incorporate surprise to gain the upper hand early in the conflict.2 A likely scenario that could lead to the use of an ASAT against U.S. space assets is a Taiwan contingency. If used as a first strike weapon in a Taiwan Strait conflict, the U.S. Navy could potentially be forced to operate in an environment in which space assets become the first targets. Since the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the U.S. Navy, Seventh Fleet, has maintained a continued presence in the Taiwan Strait in times of elevated tensions between the governments of Taiwan and China.3 Additionally, the United States is the largest customer of space assets, and any disruption to these assets could prove challenging for U.S. naval surface forces.4 Currently, the U.S. naval surface forces use space for several mission related areas supporting Sea Power 21. 5 Reconnaissance satellites provide the Sea Power 21 concept with several assets such as ocean and littoral observation, locating opposition forces, assistance in the determination of counter force measures and targeting. Communication satellites provide vast amounts of data used to exchange vital information, and Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) assist in maneuvering and targeting data for complex weapon systems. Space systems have become an embedded element of U.S. naval surface warfare. During the 1996 Taiwan Crisis, the Chinese learned that the U.S. Navy could be expected to maintain a presence if Beijing were to use force against the island of Taiwan.6 Joan Johnson-Freese states that China’s military modernization is directed against U.S. interference in a Taiwan conflict.7 For whatever reason, national prestige, strategic relevance, internal unrest and the need for governing legitimacy, or secure its increasing demand for energy, if China’ leaders feel that Taiwan’s separation from the mainland is no longer in their best interest, they could move forcefully to reunite it.8 The situation remains a tinderbox and more than likely the U.S. Navy would be required to maintain regional presence if hostilities were to erupt. In 2005, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Annual Report to Congress on the Military Power of the People’s Republic of China suggested that China’s leaders might overestimate its military capabilities, thereby possibly leading it to miscalculation and crisis; this point has been iterated every successive year.9<br />

A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.<br />

Loss of space assets will annihilate US hegemony and military capabilities<br />

Marshall, 8 - NASA Ames Research Center (Will, Astropolitics, 6:154–199, “REDUCING THE VULNERABILITY OF SPACE ASSETS: A MULTITIERED MICROSATELLITE CONSTELLATION ARCHITECTURE,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
Space assets are one of the most critical ‘‘Achilles’ heels’’ of the current military capability of the United States (U.S.). This is for two reasons: (1) the U.S. military space systems—in particular reconnaissance, navigation, signals intelligence, early warning, and communications systems—are critical to modern military warfare and intelligence; and (2) space systems are inherently vulnerable to attack. This combination is understood at the highest levels and was espoused in the ‘‘Rumsfeld Space Commission’’ with talk of a ‘‘Space Pearl Harbor.’’1 Whether one agrees with the tone, this is a genuine security problem for the U.S. in need of a near-term solution. While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3 The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world. Importance of Space Assets For better or worse, it is clear that the U.S. military is to some significant extent dependent on its key satellites, which number about 86–105 operational satellites at present. These satellites constitute a significant part of the eyes, ears, and central nervous system of the modern military.4 A practical example that helps to illustrate this is the case of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. First, the decision to go was based in part on satellite imagery and signals intelligence from satellites; whether or not it was interpreted or used correctly is a separate issue. Second, the planning and operation were facilitated by satellite imagery. Third, many planes, ships, tanks, and units’ positions were known through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and even most munitions were guided by GPS. Fourth, the operation was commanded from the U.S. in large part through the use of communications satellites. Perhaps more importantly than any of the functions in the Iraq example, early warning (EW) satellites are the U.S.’s and Russia’s first warning of nuclear missile attack. As Gray classified, space assets have moved from being ‘‘useful and important’’ to an ‘‘indispensable adjunct’’ in the military over the last decade.5 Space assets are definitely used a great deal by the U.S. military, but that does not mean necessarily as strong a dependence as Gray implies. The loss of U.S. space assets could range in its effect anywhere from a loss to the U.S. military in practical operations, to being catastrophic to U.S. security. The former would entail a reduction in operational effectiveness or speed, but fundamentally supposes that back-up systems and/or redundancy allow a near continuation of military capability. The latter scenario would entail an effective disablement of the U.S. military capability from normal operations. In reality, the significance lies between these boundaries, but this is a topic that could benefit from further research.<br />

American retrenchment could have devastating consequences. Without an American security blanket, regional powers could rearm in an attempt to balance against emerging threats. Under this scenario, there would be a heightened possibility of arms races, miscalculation, or other crises spiraling into all-out conflict. Alternatively, in seeking to accommodate the stronger powers, weaker powers may shift their geopolitical posture away from the United States. Either way, hostile states would be emboldened to make aggressive moves in their regions. As rival powers rise, Asia in particular is likely to emerge as a zone of great-power competition. Beijing’s economic rise has enabled a dramatic military buildup focused on acquisitions of naval, cruise, and ballistic missiles, long-range stealth aircraft, and anti-satellite capabilities. China’s strategic modernization is aimed, ultimately, at denying the United States access to the seas around China. Even as cooperative economic ties in the region have grown, China’s expansive territorial claims — and provocative statements and actions following crises in Korea and incidents at sea — have roiled its relations with South Korea, Japan, India, and Southeast Asian states. Still, the United States is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression.<br />

<br />
The United States has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities. ,,39 Further, the DoD's Plan for Operationally Responsive Space highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1 implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions. PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The United States must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit. Although the United States maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network (SSN) network, it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space; the February 10, 2009 collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. Improved SSA also allows the United States to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations. While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the United States enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program. The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture. A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished. Finally, small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities. Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons. China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities. Engagement Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic• missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options. In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program.53 Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems. “A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons. Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58<br />

Defensive action in space doesn’t cause an arms race – one already exists, the US can dissuade adversaries by outspending them, and it deters an attack by nullifying the effectiveness of current ASATs<br />

Lastly, one very popular argument against developing space defenses is the fear that it would precipitate a space arms race. Typically, this argument is more often associated with competing offensive capabilities; however, there is ample empirical evidence that improved defenses can also cause an adversary to seek improved offensive weapon effectiveness. The original line of reasoning postulates that space assets are free from attack now because of the sanctuary they enjoy and because they do not represent a clear and present danger which an adversary feels compelled to directly challenge. Unfortunately, continued American reliance upon unchallenged space exploitation is slowly changing the equation. If the U.S. should develop more OCS capability (such as fielding a destructive ASAT or placing weapons in space) then other nations would feel compelled to develop an equal if not superior threat capability to balance the superiority of the U.S., which in turn creates a threat to the satellites that might not have existed in the first place.160 The defensive theory is a twist of that original argument. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. First, this line of thought assumes that the impetus causing the adversary to create space weapons in the first place can be abated or removed, and that only by making the adversary feel a greater or unreasonable risk does the arms race begin. While America has not placed weapons or even unassailable defenses in space yet, potential adversaries are feeling threatened by U.S. space dominance. It is unrealistic that the U.S. will forego the strategic and tactical advantages that space represents, or will willingly give up the dominance it enjoys today. It is exactly that dedication to space dominance that is making nations like China and North Korea turn to ASAT technology.161 While U.S. weaponization of space in order to gain an offensive initiative can certainly be argued against, the only viable means to protect already threatened satellites is to improve defenses or suffer the consequences. ASAT threats against U.S. satellites already exist and the adversary countries have demonstrated a desire to use them, if necessary. The U.S. cannot afford to do nothing about the threat and hope that it will never be challenged in space dominance. Even reversing space policy today and negotiating a treaty to ban all ASAT weapons would not physically prevent an adversary country from secretly building a robust ASAT capability while the U.S. rests on its laurels. Arguing diplomatically that the adversary country was in violation of a signed treaty would provide little comfort as U.S. satellites continued to be disabled or destroyed. By fielding a defensive system that mitigates or negates the effectiveness of a threat, the adversary country will become less inclined to risk war with the U.S. by employing ASATs if they could not guarantee some reasonable expectation of success. There is little evidence that specifically placing defenses onboard satellites will suddenly cause a space arms race to spiral out of control. Space systems are already protected through various means including threat of an air or surface attack, small maneuvers, configuration changes and others. These defensive measures exist today and a space arms race (if one exists at all) is proceeding at a relatively measured pace. Some can argue that U.S. DCS measures today are spurring the improvement of ASATs worldwide, but it is just as valid to point to inevitable strategic balancing that usually occurs against empires and hegemons throughout history as a stimulus for contemporary ASAT development. Second, there is a simple economic balance that prevents a space arms race from spiraling out of control, especially when matching adversarial offensive threats against competing domestic defensive capability. Secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, explained the economic math, “’I can’t afford as a nation to just do an exchange ratio where they send up a $100 million [ASAT] missile and I send up a $1.5 billion satellite.’”162 What the U.S. could afford, however, is to spend $45 million to neutralize the effect of the $100 million ASAT in protection of the $1.5 billion satellite. Most of the defenses proposed would cost less than or equal to the cost of a destructive ASAT. If they are effective and negate the usefulness of the threat ASAT, then the adversary has to increase spending to improve their ASAT. Typically that improvement cost is proportional to cost of the original system, in this case starting at $100 million. The same generally holds true for the defensive improvements. Therefore, the next spiral in the arms race would equate to a $200 million ASAT to attack a $1.5 billion satellite protected by a $100 million defensive system. And, much like the cold war, the U.S. would be in a position to outspend most any foreseeable adversary and neutralize the threat. That is based upon the assumption, of course, that defensive improvements could keep pace with offensive improvements technologically. Outpacing the potential adversary threat is exactly the goal of this proposal. The arguments against additional defensive measures may spark interest initially but, once examined, have limited rationale that would warrant abandoning satellite self-defense development and employment. However, lacking good reasons against improving the defense of satellites does not imply that the measures should therefore be developed. The Benefits of Chasing Additional Defensive Measures The first and most obvious advantage of developing timely and responsive satellite defenses is that America’s critical space capability would be preserved. Some of the technologies like increasing redundancy or whipple bumpers and nanotechnology can provide additional protection not only against ASATs but against a whole host of natural electromagnetic and projectile events that occur every day. Since nature can sometimes represent the biggest threat to the largest number of U.S. satellites, the additional protection ensures the availability of space exploitation when needed. The expeditionary nature of the American military depends greatly upon space for command and control, and modern military battlefields almost require precision weapons, many of which are also dependent upon space assets. Unfettered space support is necessary for the U.S. military to continue to function as it has over the past decade and predicted to do so in the future. Many of the technologies presented as possible near-term candidates have been developed for terrestrial application. Just as the technology transfer can go from air assets to space assets, so can the applications of some of the technologies developed for protecting satellites. The miniaturization and autonomous processing that will inevitably precipitate from micro- and nano-satellite development can greatly aid unmanned aircraft development in addition to other air, sea, and ground platforms.163 Aircraft could be made lighter and more capable. Ships could conserve space for additional supplies and ground vehicles could be made more reliable and have more room to carry additional equipment or supplies. Nanotechnology shielding could produce new means of concealing military vehicles from a vast array of sensors including from electronic sniffers.164 Just as the space race of the 1960s produced a great deal of spin off technologies, not just for NASA, but for the U.S. military and for the civilian population as well. Similar spin offs can be reasonably expected from developing effective satellite ASAT defense. Lastly, building an overwhelming defense may actually discourage adversary nations from pursuing offensive capabilities against the U.S.165 “If a weapon is vulnerable, yet capable of dramatically affecting the outcome of a conflict, the state that possesses it has an even more powerful incentive to employ the weapon early on in a conflict”166 Conversely, if a weapon is vulnerable and not capable of affecting the outcome of a conflict, which satellite self-defense would achieve against current generation ASATS, then there would be little motivation to resort to ASATs.<br />

A firm commitment to the plan is vital to credible deterrence by denial – nations will see attacking as net counterproductive<br />

<br />
The space domain, often referred to as “The High Frontier,” no longer is a sanctuary outside the reach of foreign intervention. The threat to space systems and their capabilities is broad, ranging from reversible effects such as jamming or blinding, to more destructive means such as anti-satellite weapons. It is now time to take actions for the sake of space, and assure its continued contributions across the full spectrum of military operations. Given the criticality of space to not only our military power, but also our economic power, it is time we develop policies and field capabilities to deter future adversaries from attempting to degrade, deny, or destroy space capabilities and services. The asymmetric advantages enabled by space can no longer be assumed and as a result, a new National Security Strategy for space must be forged, one that combines deterrence with basic protection capabilities never before afforded our space systems. Yet, space deterrence is not an “all in” strategy, nor can it reduce the risk of attack to zero.1 Should aspects of deterrence fail, we must take steps to defend and protect our space systems and the critical global services they provide. Operationally responsive space (ORS) by definition is “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of joint force commanders’ needs.”2 Dissected further, one key word stands out: assured … being sufficiently robust, timely, agile, adaptive, and resilient, to achieve desired outcomes with a high degree of certainty.3 So while ORS intends to provide operational and tactical support to the joint warfighter, its true value will be the assurance it provides as a credible strategic deterrent against space attacks. As a deterrent, ORS provides access to existing capabilities, or rapid deployment and employment of new capabilities, denying the benefits our adversaries may seek by attacking our space capabilities. Through timely and accurate intelligence, we can work to understand our adversaries’ intent and armed with this knowledge, we gain the opportunity to influence their decision-making calculus. Understanding intent, coupled with credible and timely ORS capabilities, can effectively deny or greatly reduce the benefits they seek by attacking the asymmetric advantages enabled by space. ORS provides a responsiveness that will allow the commander, US Strategic Command (CDR USSTRATCOM), to respond and support our combatant commands real-time and near-term requirements. To support these requirements, ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year. The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations. Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space. In fact, a deterrence strategy that includes the threat of punishment (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space. For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form, mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy; a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy is not directly applicable to space.6 Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space. Instead, deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries (against their most prized assets);9 and encourage their restraint. A New Focus of Deterrence What does deterrence look like in the 21st century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear. ~ Sandra I. Erwin, Future of War—How the Game is Changing … Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… ~ US National Security Strategy, 2006 In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command. The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10 In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations even in a contested environment. Deny the Benefits—ORS Tier 1 and Tier 2 Examples People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) view of space: Space shifting from enabler to key battleground. Space characterized as important because it contributes to information dominance; space now described as important in its own right….many in the PLA see space as a likely future arena for conflict. ~ Space and PRC National Security,’ Dean Cheng, China specialist, The Heritage Foundation, 8 October 2008.12 The purpose to benefit denial is to convince an adversary that their intent will not be achieved, or have little to no value. Today, our ability to field ORS capabilities is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent. Instead, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities. These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack.”14 The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices. Moving forward, to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them. Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). Tier 1 and Two ORS capabilities can be deployed and employed rapidly, within hours to days. The cost for Tier 1 includes implementing new concept of operations for deployed on-orbit systems, or the rapid, low cost launch and deployment of systems intended to augment existing systems for Tier 2.<br />

The US’s increasing economic and military reliance on space creates a vulnerability that is an attractive target for foreign adversaries. If enemies employ offensive counterspace operations -operations which are intended to deceive, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy US space systems -the force multiplication effect US assets provide would be reduced or eliminated. 25 Large complex satellite systems must be protected from enemy offensive counterspace operations, while small less-expensive satellite systems may be viewed as “expendable” if their numbers mean one inoperable satellite is not a single point of failure for the system. As most current space missions have a small (mission vulnerable) constellation of large, complex systems, policy supports the need for protection. The recently released National Security Space Policy (NSSS) insists on hardening satellites against kinetic and electronic attack and maintaining redundant satellites ready to launch and rapidly replace those destroyed. 26 As we invest in next generation space capabilities and fill gaps in current capabilities, we will include resilience as a key criterion in evaluating alternative architectures. Resilience can be achieved in a variety of ways, to include cost effective space system protection, cross-domain solutions, hosting payloads on a mix of platforms in various orbits, drawing on distributed international and commercial partner capabilities, and developing and maturing responsive space capabilities. – National Security Space Strategy, Jan 2011 27 China has proven that they can shoot down a satellite in orbit. Experts now believe that this kind of anti-satellite technology is within reach of rogue states or well-funded terrorist groups, using a medium range missile, a college-level team of individuals and some crude, yet effective, technology. 28 Kinetic damage to a satellite is not the only threat; electronic attack on the communications and links or targeting/sabotaging ground segments are simple means of disrupting the billion-dollar assets the military heavily depends on. While any satellite is vulnerable to a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) attack, it is costly to install protection measures. For that reason, it was found that only some of the national military satellites have built-in security and countermeasures that increase both weight and cost of the program. 29 Analysts estimate that satellite hardening would increase the total system cost by between two and five percent. 30 Increased maneuverability (thrusters, etc) may be an effective counter for a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon. However, the added thrusters and fuel again increases weight and cost. Analysts estimate that to add maneuverability to a satellite system would increase the total system cost by between 10 - 20% depending on the satellite altitude (warning time), nature of the threat, and threat detection efficiency. 31 For single-mission satellites, it may be argued that the short design life doesn’t warrant these increased costs when considered with the probability of anti-satellite kinetic or jamming attack. Instead of hardening, it could be viewed as strategically beneficial to exponentially increase the number of space targets for our enemies that might attack our satellite systems. While the “basic” spacecraft may not be hardened for attack, by increasing the number of targets it makes it virtually impossible to fully destroy the mission. If some satellites are lost in an attack, a robust production line is accessible to replace the inexpensive assets. Subsumptive, large constellations of small satellites is an advantageous idea that military doctrine writers and acquirers should begin considering. Another danger to our spacecraft is the by-product of a high altitude nuclear burst (above 100 km altitude). Large quantities of highly radioactive debris, in the form of expanding plasma that strongly interacts with the Earth's magnetic field, can interfere and degrade our space capabilities. Considering the risk of this threat, hardening of a space system is the single most effective survivability measure. 32 The technologies to harden against damage from nuclearweapons effects exists, however, this complex level of hardening is only used for a few large military satellites, such as MILSTAR. Most of the hardening programs are focused on electronic component hardening to protect satellites from natural environment effects. However, advanced concepts have been proposed for protection against an attack by lasers. If the satellite could be a single point of failure for the mission, the US must advance hardening technology to increase satellite survivability against nuclear, high-power microwave, and neutral particle beam weapons. Satellites are also vulnerable to radiation that is naturally present in the Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts. Satellite designers must consider radiation hardness of electronic components in the design of satellites so the vehicles can pass through these radiation belts with little to no degradation. The radiation dose a satellite receives is dependent on its altitude. 33 Electronic devices must be radiation-hardened to sustain the hostile environment of space. Once the hardware has been tested successfully, it is considered “space-qualified” and may be used on a military satellite. Radiation hardening is a cost driver as well as a performance killer, since newer Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products, that are not space-qualified, provide much better processing power than the much older, yet space-qualified, products. 34 Spreading capabilities around space to ensure that one satellite doesn’t become a single point of failure in an attack, known as disaggregation, allows spacecraft designers to shed extra satellite protection measures, thereby decreasing weight. Defense Advanced Research Project’s (DARPA) F-6 concept exploits disaggregation by parsing different subsystems on separate, smaller satellites. 35 A concept mentioned in the Jan 2011 National Security Space Strategy, the sensor may be on one satellite with the communications link on another, etc – all tied together with a broadband connection. 36 The project aims to replace traditional &quot;monolithic&quot; spacecraft with clusters of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules. The principal objective is the ability to resist or survive a variety of natural and manmade threats like anti-satellite weapons. 37 If one component falters, the whole system does not necessarily fail. This makes the system more difficult to attack yet easier to enhance. F-6 is derived from a number of terms used to describe the program: future, fast, flexible, fractionated, and free-flying. 38 DARPA is spending $185 million on the second and third phases of the F-6 program and hope to launch an operational demonstration in 2013. 39 Additionally, satellite complexity is reduced by dismantling the complex system into less complex pieces, a benefit to protection as well as system development and risk. “Since the components are spread out over a larger swath of space, an enemy cannot take out the entire system with an anti-satellite weapon. If one component fails, the operator would only have to replace one of the satellites instead of the entire system. Another benefit will be allowing small satellite manufacturers to compete for contracts.” - Deputy Secretary of Defense Lynn, referring to the F6 program 40 Finally, consider that a constellation of many small satellites has advantages in numbers one small satellite is vulnerable but many together are power. Could military strategists accept a concept of expendable satellites? Simply put, small, inexpensive satellites may be cheap enough to lose in a counterspace offensive attack, nuclear burst, or other radiation anomaly. Large satellite constellations acquired in small numbers do not capitalize on a small, inexpensive satellite’s insignificance. Acquisition The current acquisition process has decades of experience in building large, complex space systems. Still, with many years of practice, it is difficult to deliver large, multi-mission satellite systems on-time and on-budget. Senior leaders continue to drive home the fact that new technologies must be fielded on-time and on-budget. Congress singled out the cumbersome and expensive process of building satellites as a leading example of how major acquisition programs fail to produce requirements in a timely manner. Two years ago, Secretary of Defense Gates cancelled Transformational-Satellite (TSAT), a $26 billion program, after its schedule slipped by four years. 41 Large satellite programs must normally start from scratch and these clean designs require more money and more time. Unlike many of our military purchases, large satellite systems are not ordered in large quantities and cannot take advantage of economies of scale such as a product built on an assembly line. Communications satellites, for example, may be produced once every one or two years. 42 Satellite programs grow out of control because military and intelligence analysts want to fit as many capabilities as possible on one spacecraft, causing requirements “creep.” It is expensive to launch a satellite and once it is in orbit, it could be there for 15 years or more delivering enormous pressure that comes with one shot to get it right. Clearly this process is not the most efficient to accomplish defense needs, so we continue to refine it. In 2004, spiral or incremental development was adopted as a “preferred” space acquisition standard according to DoD Directive 5000.01, and primarily exercised on large, complex satellite systems such as MILSTAR and GPS. Are the multi-missions on the current large satellite systems truly a required “spiral” of development or are they simply a push to have the best, most innovative spacecraft -- driving acquirers to larger, more complex systems? A good illustration of this issue comes from the failure of the National Reconnaissance Office’s Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) program. These huge, pricey satellites offer extremely detailed resolution and calibrated meticulously precise sensors, however with numerous intelligence requirements from competing agencies the initial design of the optical system for the satellite was so elaborate, the engineers building it said it would not work. There is wide agreement that FIA sunk under enormous data demands and technological risk. The program was terminated in September of 2005 with cost estimates of $18-billion, leaving the nation with a fragile, dwindling constellation of aging imaging satellites, integral to intelligence and military operations, which were designed in the 1970s. 43 Should we just build smaller, more basic, systems? Instead of building one complex multimission spacecraft with multiple sensors on a spacecraft larger than a bus, build three or four smaller, simpler spacecraft that host their own sensors. Additional simplification is available with fractioned systems, like the F6 program discussed earlier in this paper. Fractionated systems can mitigate launch risks by spreading component launches over a number of smaller launch vehicles instead of one large one. If these small, single-mission fractionated satellites share a common bus or other components, economies of scale will drive down production costs compared to building a few larger spacecraft. Additionally, government agencies are now saving money by paying commercial satellites to piggyback a military component on their spacecraft. 44 While these “hosted payloads” can save money, there are security implications that must be acknowledged. Successfully proven in the last year, an SES Americom communications satellite hosted an Air Force sensor at a fraction of the cost of sending up a free-flying spacecraft. The Commerce Department’s Office of Space Commercialization said adding the sensor to the satellite answered about 80% of the technical questions the Air Force needed to answer. At a price tag of $65 million, it saved an estimated $435 million by “hitching a ride” on the Americom satellite. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Coast Guard have also used hosted payloads. 45 Large satellites will not disappear quickly; however, a new method of acquisition must be codified to ensure the military is delivering its space capabilities on-time and on-budget. If acquirers continue to contract large, multi-mission satellite systems, sticking to solid, basic requirements is a must. However, other options are gaining momentum. Multiple, single-basic satellites that crosslink to become a single system, fractionated small satellites, or even commercial piggybacking must be considered if the U.S military wants to continue to maintain the ultimate high ground -- space.<br />

A New Approach to Space Deterrence The book entitled Complex Deterrence states that deterrence works best among major great-powers and is therefore ineffective against rogue groups or terrorists.35 Thus, deterrence must evolve beyond the threat of potential costs imposed by a punishment strategy. Expressed mathematically, deterrence is comprised of gains (G) sought by the adversary and the cost imposed by punishment (C). Thus, if G &gt; C the actor attacks and if C &gt; G he does not. Usually deterrence concentrates on making the cost or punishment so great that the potential aggressor will not attack. This approach will not work for space because an attack is extraordinarily difficult to attribute to any adversary. For example, in 1998, PANAMSAT’s Galaxy IV satellite experienced a battery anomaly leading to a satellite failure that left nearly 40 million customers without paging services.36 What if this incident was not caused by the battery anomaly? Who then attacked the satellite and how? For deterrence to work, one must gather convincing evidence that attributes the attack to someone specific. Lack of attribution will convince the adversary to attack. First, the probability of a nation-state counterattacking, without demonstrable evidence, is low. Second, the inability to rapidly identify the responsible party reduces the probability of retribution thereby increasing the potential gains to an aggressor. As technology miniaturizes satellites, the potential target becomes smaller, cheaper and can effectively hide in the clutter of space debris. For this reason, the approach to space deterrence must concentrate on significantly reducing the perceived gain (G) or success to be won by an adversary. The conditions must be such that it becomes manifestly clear; attacking another asset in space is pointless and counterproductive. Space deterrence must revolve around two concepts: transparency and diversity. Transparency, or the ability to see without obstruction the events that occur in space, creates a peaceful environment which promotes understanding and accountability. Theoretically, when information is released, under the auspices of transparency, it produces an informed and engaged public, one that will hold a culprit accountable. 37 The ability to monitor and understand the rapidly changing conditions in space is critical to the preservation of security in space. While the US developed its current satellite capabilities in compliance with international rules and treaties it also deemed it prudent to develop a space surveillance network to monitor all near space activity and ensure a secure environment for all space faring nations. This network, of ground and space based sensors, provides radar and optical data used to characterize the mission of any satellite, identify the class and type or to simply aid in anomaly resolution.38 Currently, ground systems can track objects with a resolution of 12cm or greater39 making it challenging to track nanosats. Air Force Space Command’s 2030 vision is enabled by technological improvement. It includes upgrades to existing sensors and an increase in the number of space-based optical sensors in an attempt to provide persistent and complete coverage of the near space domain. The resolution of near-term upgrades will improve to 1cm increasing the ability to track nanosatellites.40 In order to ensure safe space operations and uphold its commitment to cooperation with other nations and the peaceful use of space, the US consistently provides the orbit positional data41 via a public website accessible by anyone. The principles and goals stated in the national space policy highlight the nation’s vision of leading the way in space surveillance in order to promote and provide a safe operating environment for machines and people.42 In the end, for transparency to work, space situational awareness must allow analysts to identify deliberate actions by a spacecraft and its owners and ultimately predict, detect, and attribute an attack43. The second concept in space deterrence is diversity. It provides a tailored approach, focusing on minimizing the impact of an attack, also known as graceful degradation, consequently driving the perceived gains (G) for the adversary as close to zero as possible. Diversity can be achieved through large networked constellations of space-based assets complimenting the existing ground based sensors, with a distributed architecture so that destruction of one or even several satellites does not take down the entire system. In the past, the US employed the costly approach of maintaining on-orbit spares, hardening on-board components, enhancing uplink and downlink encryption to increase satellite and signal survivability.44 In the future, nanotechnology will facilitate redundancy and rapid reconstitution. Presently, several companies, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, are currently demonstrating the technology. By 2035, on-orbit repair along with the robotic on-orbit refueling of satellites will become standard. Spacecraft will use autonomous navigation and conduct housekeeping tasks independent of a ground station. This is especially useful in the event of a communication failure or loss of the ground segment. Moreover, rapid reaction maneuvering capability will allow spacecraft to evade kinetic kill vehicles. The cornerstone of resilience is agile, capable, and functional technology able to diminish an adversary’s gain while increasing the cost of an attack – success in both enables deterrence. Above all, the space industrial base must grow to deliver the technical transformation required to employ this new approach to deterrence. Recommendations The US was shocked by a technological surprise on 4 October 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, a 184 pound satellite, into orbit on top of a rocket weighing nearly 4 tons. In contrast, the Vanguard satellite the US developed and had yet to launch weighed only 3.5 pounds.45 Sputnik completely collapsed the technological comfort zone the US. It heated up the Cold War as peoples’ fear grew over what the Soviets might do next; the strategic deterrence calculus was fundamentally altered. Today the US has the opportunity to shape the future and set conditions for effective space deterrence. Reconstituting and energizing the space industrial base is critical to future deterrence. Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 2-2 states, “Operators and planners must know as quickly as possible the origin of any anomaly and be able to identify and geolocate the threat in a timely manner.”46 In order to meet the intent of AFDD 2-2 the US must embrace the goals identified in the National Space Policy, most importantly to “enable a robust science and technology base supporting national security.”47 Without industrial base growth, the international community’s influence will grow and undermine the nation’s future space security. The US cannot allow its own space industry to abrogate its role in national security nor can it continue to set conditions through ITAR and national policies which leave industry with little choice but to divest itself of its space tools. The US government must focus on the following areas: improving space situational awareness, miniaturizing spacecraft and launch vehicles, promoting innovation and risk taking in technology development, and improving export control policies and procedures. First, the key enabler for transparency is space situational awareness. Today’s space surveillance network is composed of diverse sensors to include tracking radars, optical telescopes and space-based visible sensors. To prepare for tomorrow’s smaller target upgrades are required. The W-band upgrade to the Haystack sensor in Massachusetts increases the ground-based sensor’s collection bandwidth from 1GHz to 8 GHz thereby improving its resolution from 25 cm to 1cm and facilitating the tracking of nanosatellites.48 Although the upgrade is significant for the ground-based sensor network, it must be complimented with additional space based capabilities. In this instance, miniaturization becomes a force multiplier as it allows the next generation of space-based space surveillance to be configured with full motion video. Ground-based sensors can tip-off the space-based sensor to track a specific target. The video’s dynamic feedback can in turn provide greater insight into the intent of the adversary as it observes the target. CubeSat has already demonstrated the ability of one nanosat to take a picture of another (figure 3). Consequently, a successful deterrence strategy is dependent on the surveillance network’s ability to identify threats, characterize the potential damage, determine an aggressor’s intent and ultimately attribute the action to the adversary. Second, CubeSat redefined the approach to building satellites through the development of standard building modules and taking advantage of the latest breakthroughs in nanotechnology. This approach makes CubeSat the model for “smaller, cheaper, and faster”. The US government must adopt a similar approach. While tradeoffs are necessary, government interest and investment in the many facets of the space should allow for good decisions about when a technology is “good enough” to satisfy mission and national security requirements. The approach facilitates decreasing the size of satellites, increasing spacecraft redundancy and allowing a higher number of satellites per constellation thereby complicating the targeting equation for the adversary. Its centerpiece focused on driving down the adversary’s perceived gain (G) closer to zero. This approach will increase diversity and future space deterrence effectiveness within a dynamic security environment. Third, advanced miniaturization is creating a growing market for a very small, capable launch vehicle. As CubeSat gains momentum, it creates a strong market dynamic for a very 17 small and highly responsive launch vehicle. Currently, most CubeSats are launched on decommissioned Russian rockets as secondary payloads49. Up to this point, companies like Eurokot and Kosmotras have kept the launch cost to no more than $40K per CubeSat. As demand rises and slots for secondary payloads become scarce, the cost of each CubeSat will inexorably rise. Sensing a growing need for CubeSats, launch companies are developing a two-stage liquid propellant, launch vehicle capable of delivering 10 kg to a 250 kilometer polar orbit. If successful, such a capability will increase launch market share for the US space industry, enhance growth in other areas and lower launch costs.50 Affordable launch enables satellite replenishment. Even if the adversary destroys a satellite, the spacecraft can be quickly replaced minimizing the impact of the attack. Fourth, changes to US export control laws are required. The primary agencies governing export control are the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Commerce (DOC). The DOS is responsible for maintaining the US’ munitions list which is used to identify which products or services are subject to export controls. Currently, satellites and all related space technologies are under DOS jurisdiction.51 However, DOS is not the most knowledgeable agency with regard to spacecraft or the associated technology and it uses ITAR to implement requirements established in the arms Export Control Act. According to the Defense Industrial Base Assessment on the US space industry, “US manufacturers have not introduced a new satellite bus since the Boeing 702 was developed in 1999. In contrast, European manufacturers have introduced 3 new busses in the last 5 years and are currently developing a 4th.”52 Players within the space industry argue that the US market share dipped from approximately 70% in 1995 to 25% in 2005. Compliance with export control cost US companies an average of $49M per year from 2003-2006.53 This cost was not applicable to foreign 18 competitors. Clearly, export controls provide foreign competitors an advantage in marketing to non-US customers because they limit what can be bought and who can buy it. It can also control the actions of the authorized buyers and users in terms of what they can use the technology for and whom they can share the technology with. Such restrictions adversely affect a US company’s ability to compete in foreign space markets consequently opening up opportunities for foreign space ventures whose governments are not as particular about how technology is used or who buys it.54 In the end, international competition is critical in order to reduce costs, preserve US dominance, forge closer relationships in order to globalize and thereby protect the use of space for all benevolent users. It enables an advanced form of deterrence denying the adversary the option of attacking. In short, space technology must move off the munitions list and into its own category which protects the technology that needs protecting while allowing the US space industrial base to sell non-critical space technology internationally. Conclusion Current developments in the field of nanotechnology are highlighting pathways for spacecraft to become smaller and ultimately affordable. As nanotechnology helps solve the problems of spacecraft mass, volume, and power consumption, national leaders must not lose sight of the fact that it is also opening access to space to virtually anyone. Adversaries understand the US’ increasing space reliance and will challenge the medium especially if it provides an audience and even worldwide recognition for their cause. As future adversaries benefit from smaller, lighter, and affordable satellites, the US must invest in an approach that 19 relies on transparency and diversity as the backbone of a strong deterrence posture to meet the threat in 2035. This new approach to space deterrence concentrates on significantly reducing the perceived gain (G) or success to be won by an adversary instead of solely focusing on the traditional approach of punishment. In order to lower the adversary’s perceived gain, the US’ future ability to deter an attack rests on a space surveillance network that allows for the identification and persistent tracking of miniaturized spacecrafts thereby highlighting intent and ultimately attributing an action to a specific actor. Equally important, the US must embrace nanotechnology as the cornerstone to materials magnifying ways for spacecraft to become smaller, lighter, and affordable while further developing the space industry base. Furthermore, nanotechnology will enable diversity or added redundancy in the more autonomous spacecraft and increase survivability in space while lessening dependency on ground stations making the perceived gains (G) of attacking the ground infrastructure close to zero. Lastly, export control reform will allow nanotechnology to power the industrial base engine and minimize the potential for a nation-state, group or individual actor to create a strategic shock to the space sector. After Sputnik’s voyage, public opinion blamed the government for not doing enough and ultimately risking US’ national security. The response was a significant increase in funding for military and civil space. In a post-9/11 world, the US cannot allow another technological surprise to occur, especially one perpetrated by non-state actors availing themselves of readily available and inexpensive space capabilities that can be used in ways to fundamentally alter the deterrence calculus. Once again, a significant commitment is required to strengthen the space industry and set the conditions needed for success in 2035. The natural deterrent created by high launch costs is disappearing and the ability to monitor and understand the rapidly changing 20 conditions in space continues to be critical to the preservation of national security. In short, the nation’s best technological approach for future space deterrence lies in becoming the world leader in the application of nanotechnology. It will increase the industrial base, lower launch costs, improve transparency and diversity ultimately setting the conditions for the deterrence calculus to tip in favor of the United States. Only then will the adversary’s gain/loss assessment dictate not to attack; effectively deterring him.<br />

Nearly every president since Eisenhower has released a “national space policy<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">,” outlining his views on the significance of space to American interests and identifying high level priorities intended to guide government action. Of course, the policies also are meant for international and public consumption, and so, they </span>signal intentions and priorities meant to influence subsequent events. The new national space policy<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> (released June 28, 2010) includes unique elements, but many of its principles, goals, and objectives are found in earlier space policies and reflect long-standing U.S. views on the use of and objectives in outer space. The natural comparison for the policy is the one it replaces, which is the Bush Administration’s policy released in October 2006. In general terms, the new policy builds on the old policy, much as one expects. Although phrased differently, the core principles embodied in the 2006 document remain, just as the 2006 policy included the core principles of the 1996 Clinton space policy. New areas </span>recognize new challenges and different approaches to old problems. The Obama policy adds several new terms to the space policy lexicon – sustainability, responsible behavior, and stability, most notably. How those terms come to be interpreted and subsequently reflected in decisions about other policies and programs will be of considerable interest to U.S. departments and agencies, policy analysts, and foreign governments<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. On face, the </span>Obama policy <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">appears to </span>emphasize international cooperation and highlights the goal of U.S. space leadership more than past policies. The U.S. actively participates in and leads international discussions on a host of space issues, leaving one to ask what additional efforts are anticipated in the new policy. The Obama policy adds a welcome emphasis on expanding cooperation with allies on space security concerns and added prioritization on assuring access to space. Finally, the Obama policy offers more detailed discussion of commercial and civil space issues. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">The policy signals principles and goals, but ultimately, actions, reflected by budgets, decisions about programs and technical investments, and positions taken in bilateral and multilateral settings, will determine the character of U.S. space policy.

Q But if the United States exercises restraint, will other countries play by these rules? A The United States doesn’t depend on the good faith of others, which is why a hedging strategy is also required. America enjoys the world’s best space monitoring capabilities and armed forces. If others insist on testing ASATs, the United States could, too. But it is not in the economic and national security interest for the United States to open this Pandora’s box. Q Doesn’t hedging send the wrong signal, prompting ASAT tests by others? A Not hedging against the use of ASATs by others could also send the wrong signal, inviting use without consequences. But if the US hedges too much — such as by initiating a resumption of ASAT testing — others will surely follow. So a hedging strategy requires balance, such as by flight testing multi-purpose technologies.<br />

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Space Weapons: Perception and Provocation</span> The term <em>space weaponization</em> defies precise definition; it is a matter of observed actions and perceived intent<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. As an inherent survival instinct, humans tend to distrust or fear those things -- in this case technologies and deployed systems -- they do not control, do not understand, or, given the first two conditions, into which they do not have, or are not afforded, insight sufficient to assuage their discomfort.51 This is an especially important issue relative to policy decisions and system deployment in the space domain, for the simple reason that the space domain is not restricted by borders, oceans, terrain, or firewalls.

<strong>11. Cooperation fails – not verifiable and leads to opaque weaponization</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Setting aside such semantic quibbling, the real challenge now facing the United States is how best to deter, deny, and dissuade the Chinese, and other emerging space powers, from hostile actions in space. One approach would involve diplomacy and international discussions. For some time, arms-control advocates have been pushing for agreements to ban weapons in space. More recently, </span>in light of the changed circumstances brought on by China's tests, the focus has shifted to securing &quot;codes of conduct&quot; and devising &quot;rules of the road&quot; to regulate how nation-states behave in space<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Sympathetically interpreting China's recent tests as an understandable reaction to U.S. policies, </span>arms-control advocates have characterized American actions in space as dangerous and provocative, and have condemned the United States for refusing to enter into international negotiations. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Only a treaty, they argue, can restrain the Americans' aggressive tendencies. As one arms-control advocate told the Washington Post, the Chinese were responding to U.S. space policies and sending a signal to the Pentagon: &quot;We can play this game, too, and we can play it dirtier than you.&quot; Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, told the Post that the United States must initiate &quot;an international agreement to ban the development, testing, and deployment of space weapons and anti-satellite systems.&quot; This attitude--</span>blaming America for other countries' actions and demanding that the United States preemptively disarm itself--is reminiscent of the old Cold War debates over nuclear weapons<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span>Also strikingly familiar to students of the Cold War is Beijing's hypocritical hand-wringing over the specter of an arms race in, and the weaponization of, outer space<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. As Michael Pillsbury has pointed out, &quot;</span>While China has publicly assumed a leadership position in international activities to ban space weapons, there is an active group within China not only advocating the weaponization of space but also putting forth specific proposals for implementation of a Chinese space-based weapons program.&quot; Even while the PLA was successfully executing at least two anti-satellite tests, the Chinese diplomatic corps was raging against the supposed weaponization of space by the United States.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> At a U.N. conference on space in 2006, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official, Tang Guoqiang, complained about actions in space that could &quot;cause serious consequences&quot;: &quot;The policy of a certain country [i.e., the United States] to test, deploy and use weapons and weapon systems in outer space [is] disconcerting. Outer space is the common heritage of mankind and [the] weaponization of outer space is bound to trigger off [an] arms race in outer space, thus rendering outer space a new arena for military confrontation.&quot; Even after the January 2007 ASAT test, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official insisted that countries &quot;opposed to the weaponization of space&quot; should &quot;join hands to realize this goal.&quot; </span>Existing treaties allow actions to protect and defend national interests in space. Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty forbids signatories <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">(including the United States and China)</span>from placing nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on the Moon<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, and prohibits the testing of weapons, conduct of maneuvers, or construction of fortifications on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Since October 1967, when the treaty went into force, nearly every U.S. president has interpreted its requirements in such a way as to explicitly allow the development, operation, and maintenance of the space-control capabilities needed to ensure freedom of action in space and to deny such freedom of action to adversaries. During successive administrations of both political parties, the National Security Council has interpreted the treaty as not barring the deployment of space-based missile defenses or other systems to perform space-control missions. Work to draft new treaties continues apace. </span>China and Russia have been spearheading international efforts to construct a framework to govern space. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">The Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) process at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament calls for formal negotiations to prohibit the placement of weapons in orbit or on celestial bodies. </span>But whatever shreds of credibility this international process had were destroyed by the recent Chinese tests. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Another diplomatic tack contemplated by those opposed to &quot;weaponizing space&quot; is the adoption of </span>multilateral codes of conduct<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. To a certain extent, such norms will develop organically on their own, as the growing interdependence between economic and security interests forces government and commercial satellite operators to cooperate, and as Washington increasingly coordinates its space activities with military and civil space authorities in allied and friendly nations. Over time, new norms for shared space situational awareness, debris mitigation, and orbital traffic management may emerge among responsible space-faring nations. But such norms </span>make no sense if the parties have no<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">t</span> first built up trust. And if such norms are externally imposed, they will be nothing more than unverifiable arms control agreements in camouflage. Absent the ability to ascertain or enforce compliance, a code-of-conduct rule regime will be weak and, more likely than not, ineffectual<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span>A rules system for space between potential adversaries that relies on voluntary compliance and lacks viable punitive measures will be a hollowone.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> (Nor, for that matter, would an international treaty &quot;banning&quot; anti-satellite testing be enforceable or verifiable; the ignominious record of enforcing and verifying treaties prohibiting activities on Earth should be proof enough of that.) </span>The chief failing of the diplomatic approach to dealing with the new reality of space weapons is that it is blind to the reason a potential adversary like China would seek access to space in the first place--namely, the desire to be able to inflict a crippling blow against U.S. military and economic might by decapitating its surveillance and communications abilities. Those pushing for a new treaty or a code of conduct have yet to explain why China would abandon capabilities that threaten the &quot;soft underbelly&quot; of American military power<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span>The Chinese regime clearly aspires to develop such capabilities; there is little reason to believe it would negotiate them away. The United States should resist calls for such futile diplomatic efforts<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.</span><br />

Sputnik’s launch bestowed the honor and prestige of being first in orbit upon the Soviet Union, but was fortuitous for United States policy makers, as well.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Whether or not the soviets beat the United States outright or the United States allowed the soviets to go first is irrelevant. The critical point is the soviets <em>did</em> go first. </span>In one stroke, Sputnik solved the complicated, politically charged overflight issue that us policy makers grappled with and could not resolve. This enabled the United States to pursue its space reconnaissance program free<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> from the legal and policy quagmire that accompanied launching first, and avoided appearing as an aggressor. Responding to the soviet capability fueled and legitimized the United States’ spending on its space program, 291 and garnered unprecedented public support. Robust funding complemented by international legitimacy and public support provided the united states space program a significant advantage. </span>If, as some argue, weaponization of space is truly inevitable, the United States should manage risk, research and develop in secret, allow an adversary to cross the weapons in space threshold first, and reap the sputnik-like rewards of being a close second<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. In spite of the apparent advantages this strategy offers, it is likely much easier said than done. Advocating or supporting any second-follower strategy would be an extremely difficult position for an elected official or military officer, considering the US’ clear, longstanding preference for positive action and offensive solutions.</span><br />

<strong><span style="color: #231f20;">15. ORS solves the impact to an ASAT attack without being perceived as weaponization</span></strong><br />
<strong>Butterworth, 8</strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> - President, Aries Analytics, Inc. Fellow, George C. Marshall Institute (Robert, “Assuring Space Support Despite ASATs,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.marshall.org/pdf/materials/575.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.marshall.org/pdf/materials/575.pdf</a></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Responses </span><span style="color: #231f20;">Satellites can be defended against some kinds of direct kinetic attacks</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 10.6667px;">. They can be moved out of range of the attacker’s terminal engagement sensors, if there is enough warning and accurate track of the interceptor and enough understanding of the kill mechanism, and if the satellite has been designed to withstand the loads created by the movement. There may be ways to confuse or defeat the sensors used to detect and track the target satellite, either in initial acquisition or in terminal engagement. The target might also be protected by active defenses, although with intercept occurring only about ten minutes after launch, the defenses will probably need to be directed energy rather than kinetic weapons. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">Either case would require precise situational awareness—exact information about the technology and operation of the attack—together with major advances in command and control for the defenses</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">Even without enemy action, satellites in orbit might provide less space support than needed. Satellites might be lost to collisions with debris or other objects; or essential components might fail.</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 10.6667px;"> Or it may be that prewar planning proved inaccurate, that more support is needed to meet unforeseen needs, or that demand for space support at the outbreak of crisis proves much greater than had been anticipated. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">These problems are not remedied by defenses; instead, they call for a supplemental capability, to augment capacity to meet surging needs and to replace lost or failed sensors</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 10.6667px;">. Some of this supplemental capability might be found already in orbit: the communications and intelligence satellites of commercial entities and allied governments. While not all of the products of these systems will be militarily useful to the U.S.—and probably none will possess the capability of analogous U.S. government systems—the diversity of information they could provide and the speed with which it could be available would surely prove advantageous. </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">More capable systems, fully compatible with U.S. forces and fully under U.S. control, could in principle be stored in orbit; the engineering requirements for long-term storage and return to full operation seem well understood</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 10.6667px;">. At the same time, these systems might themselves suffer on-orbit misadventures, might potentially be targeted, and might prove useless in the face of unforeseen needs. Still, this approach offers the fastest, and probably the most expensive, path to the most capable supplementary systems. Supplements might be provided more cheaply and more reliably if they were stored on the ground, ready to be launched in response to the developing needs of joint force commanders. </span><span style="color: #231f20;">If these supplemental systems could be launched and brought into operation quickly enough, the time required for adversaries to detect, track, and assess them might deter antisatellite attacks completely</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 10.6667px;">. If launched before hostilities began, </span><span style="color: #231f20;">these supplements would confront adversaries with the need to prepare revised and more complicated plans for attacks in space, perhaps with less confidence that all important systems were in the crosshairs</span><span style="color: #231f20; font-size: 10.6667px;">. If launched as replacements for satellites </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">initially lost to enemy action, the supplements would shrink the advantage that was sought in attacking the original satellites. </span>If the U.S. <span style="color: #231f20;">coupled its supplemental replacements with vigorous offensive counterspace actions of its own, an enemy’s initial attacks would leave the U.S. with a diminished yet effective set of space assets and the enemy with none. All in all, being able to supplement or restore needed capability in orbit would likely prove a stabilizing and deterring influence; not being destructive weapons themselves, the supplements <strong>could scarcely be considered escalatory</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #231f20;">.</span></strong><br />

<strong>4. Political capital is not key – issues are compartmentalized</strong><br />
<strong>Dickinson 9</strong><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">- professor of political science at Middlebury College and taught previously at Harvard University where he worked under the supervision of presidential scholar Richard Neustadt (5/26/09, Matthew, Presidential Power: A NonPartisan Analysis of Presidential Politics, “Sotomayor, Obama and Presidential Power,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/</a>)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">As for Sotomayor, from here the path toward almost certain confirmation goes as follows: the Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold hearings sometime this summer (this involves both written depositions and of course open hearings), which should lead to formal Senate approval before Congress adjourns for its summer recess in early August. So Sotomayor will likely take her seat in time for the start of the new Court session on October 5. (I talk briefly about the likely politics of the nomination process below).What is of more interest to me, however, is what her selection reveals about the basis of presidential power.</span>Political scientists, like baseball writers evaluating hitters, have devised numerous means of measuring a president’s influence in Congress.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> I will devote a separate post to discussing these, but in brief, </span>they often center on the creation of legislative “box scores” designed to measure how many times a president’s preferred piece of legislation, or nominee to the executive branch or the courts, is approved by Congress. That is, how many pieces of legislation that the president supports actually pass Congress? How often do members of Congress vote with the president’s preferences?<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> How often is a president’s policy position supported by roll call outcomes? </span>These measures<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, however, </span>are a misleading gauge of presidential power – they are a better indicator of congressional power.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> This is because </span>how members of Congress vote on a<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> nominee or </span>legislative item is rarely influenced by anything a president does. Although journalists (and political scientists) often focus on the legislative “endgame” to gauge presidential influence – will the President swing enough votes to get his preferred legislation enacted? – this mistakes an outcome with actual evidence of presidential influence Once we control for other factors–a member of Congress’ ideological and partisan leanings, the political leanings of her constituency, whether she’s up for reelection or not – we can usually predict how she will vote without needing to know much of anything about what the president wants.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> (I am ignoring the importance of a president’s veto power for the moment.) </span>Despite the much publicized and celebrated instances of presidential arm-twisting during the legislative endgame, then, most legislative outcomes don’t depend on presidential lobbying.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">But this is not to say that presidents lack influence. Instead, the primary means by which presidents influence what Congress does is through their ability to determine the alternatives from which Congress must choose. That is, presidential power is largely an exercise in agenda-setting – not arm-twisting. And we see this in the Sotomayer nomination. Barring a major scandal, she will almost certainly be confirmed to the Supreme Court whether Obama spends the confirmation hearings calling every Senator or instead spends the next few weeks ignoring the Senate debate in order to play Halo III on his Xbox. That is, how senators decide to vote on Sotomayor will have almost nothing to do with Obama’s lobbying from here on in (or lack thereof). His real influence has already occurred, in the decision to present Sotomayor as his nominee.If we want to measure Obama’s “power”, then, we need to know what his real preference was and why he chose Sotomayor. My guess – and it is only a guess – is that after conferring with leading Democrats and Republicans, he recognized the overriding practical political advantages accruing from choosing an Hispanic woman, with left-leaning credentials. We cannot know if this would have been his ideal choice based on judicial philosophy alone, but presidents are never free to act on their ideal preferences. Politics is the art of the possible. Whether Sotomayer is his first choice or not, however, her nomination is a reminder that the power of the presidency often resides in the president’s ability to dictate the alternatives from which Congress (or in this case the Senate) must choose. Although Republicans will undoubtedly attack Sotomayor for her judicial “activism” (citing in particular her decisions regarding promotion and affirmative action), her comments regarding the importance of gender and ethnicity in influencing her decisions, and her views regarding whether appellate courts “make” policy, they run the risk of alienating Hispanic voters – an increasingly influential voting bloc (to the extent that one can view Hispanics as a voting bloc!) I find it very hard to believe she will not be easily confirmed. In structuring the alternative before the Senate in this manner, then, Obama reveals an important aspect of presidential power that cannot be measured through legislative boxscores.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">A $690 billion </span>defense authorization bill<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> approved May 26 in the U.S. House of Representatives would allow the Air Force to buy two more secure communications satellites, </span>add $20 million to the Pentagon’s budget for Operationally Responsive Space<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and authorize $8 million to conduct a study on space-based missile interceptors. </span>The bill<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, H.R. 1540, </span>passed by a vote of 322-96 despite a White House threat to veto the measure over several provisions related to nuclear arms reductions and Guantanamo detainees. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">The Air Force, in the budget request it sent to Congress for 2012, is seeking permission to contract on a fixed-price basis with Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif., for the fifth and sixth Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) communications satellites. The House bill — which gives policy guidance and recommends spending levels, but provides no actual funding — would allow the Air Force to contract for the satellites and pay for them over as many as five years provided that the total cost is no more than $3.1 billion. However, the bill does not authorize the advance appropriations that the Pentagon requested for the satellites. </span>The White House<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, in a May 24 statement of administration policy on the bill, </span>reiterated the need for advance appropriations. The Pentagon requested $86.5 million for the joint Operationally Responsive Space Office, which is chartered to develop quick-response space capabilities for urgent warfighter needs. <strong>The bill recommends increasing funding</strong> to $106.5 million.<br />

<br />
The Pentagon's new office to rapidly produce space capabilities for commanders has so far received support from Capitol Hill,<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> but the fledgling program faces a number of obstacles as it moves forward. Col. Kevin McLaughlin, the director of the recently formed Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) office, gave a nuts and bolts presentation at a meeting of the group's executive committee. The office will need more funding and better organization, but a strategic framework could help overcome those hurdles in the future, according to McLaughlin's briefing. Air Force Space Command Commander Gen. Kevin Chilton, in line to become the next Strategic Command commander, also gave a briefing at the meeting, in which Chilton recommended that the Air Force assume control over ORS, sources said. That message that left some befuddled about the organization's way forward, sources said. According to one official present at the meeting, if Congress had wanted the Air Force to make operationally responsive satellites, it would have asked the Air Force to do so. </span>Air Force Space Command responded<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> to discussion about Chilton's briefing in a statement </span>saying it supports the ORS program<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> as it was laid out in the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization Act. </span>&quot;We are supporting the leadership of the [Department of Defense (DOD<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">)] executive agent for space and the commander of US STRATCOM in working to make ORS a success.&quot; Chilton's briefing pointed to a potential sore point for ORS similar to a smoldering debate over who will control the military's unmanned aerial vehicles, the official said. In the case of future satellites, other services are concerned that if the Air Force assumes control of the program, design tradeoffs will come first from items sought by the Army and Navy. Another tension within ORS is whether to place investments in large existing satellite programs, or pursue smaller, lighter and cheaper new satellite systems</span>. The Aerospace Industries Association of America has an ORS working group with members who work for companies producing both kinds of satellites. As such the group advocates continuing to balance investment between both types and maintain consistent funding for the effort<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, according to J.P. Stevens, vice president of the space systems division at the Aerospace Industries Association of America. </span>The ORS office received strong support from Congress so far t<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">his year, but current language addresses the issue of the program's internal balance. Each bill recommends additional funding for the effort but for slightly different purposes. The House appropriations bill adds $20 million, but $6 million of that should be used for classified efforts, according to the committee's report on the bill. The House authorization bill reflects a concern that the Pentagon has not balanced the funding for low-cost payloads, spacelift and launch control capabilities and put the bulk of its money in existing launch vehicle purchases, responsive launch vehicle development, responsive payload and bus development, and responsive launch control capabilities, according to a report on the bill. </span>The bill recommends rebalancing ORS funding to develop more responsive capabilities. House authorizers also added $30 million for launch and payload design and testing. The Senate Armed Services Committee added $15 million to the program, noting that ORS should pay more attention to sensor development<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. The Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee has yet to mark up its version of the bill, and industry officials said they are eager to learn how ORS fares. </span>Though challenges with ORS remain, support from Congress is encouraging to Stevens, who said several years ago people questioned whether the effort should move forward at all.<br />

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">President </span>Bush could not have won the Electoral College in 2000 without the military vote<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, and that vote is shaping up to go his way again on Nov. 2, military analysts and pollsters from both sides say. &quot;When we look at the veterans' vote and the military vote, it looks like it's going pretty solidly for the president,&quot; Democrat pollster Celinda Lake said. Total voter turnout -- civilian, current and retired military -- was 105 million in 2000. Last year, </span>the Defense Department reported that 1.4 million men and women were on active duty and an additional 882,000 were in the reserves<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. But experts define the military vote as far larger than that. &quot;</span>Among the electorate, 30 percent of households have at least one member on active duty or a veteran,<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">&quot; Republican pollster Ed Goeas said. &quot;These households tend to vote Republican by a six-point margin over Democrats.&quot; If the election were held tomorrow, those active-duty, reserve and veteran votes would go to Mr. Bush by a margin of 52 percent to 44 percent, according to the June 20 to 23 bipartisan Battleground Poll of likely voters that Ms. Lake conducted with Mr. Goeas. The poll confirms that, so far, Sen. John Kerry's status as decorated Vietnam War veteran has given him no boost in this military vote, both pollsters agree. They also agree that </span>large populations of military voters and their families are not scattered evenly across the country, but are concentrated in a number of states. And many of those states -- most notably Florida -- are considered battlegrounds in the war to win the Electoral College, where presidents are chosen<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Official United States’ reaction to the ASAT has been muted. National Security Council spokesperson Gordon Johndroe said the country “expressed our concern” about the test to the Chinese.4 Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the test was “troubling”5 while the Department of State wanted the Chinese to “clarify their intentions in seeking to develop” their anti-satellite capability.6 The most visible sign of United States’ disapproval of the test was the suspension of cooperative civil space endeavors between China and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).7 Criticism has been much louder from several members of Congress</span>. Senator Jon Kyl argued, “Key policy makers seem oblivious to the nature and the urgency of the threat.”8 In speeches following the Chinese ASAT test, Senator Kyl, <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">as well as the former Ranking Member on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Representative Jane Harman and current Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Representative Terry Everett,9 </span>called on the nation to create new <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Operationally Responsive Space </span>(ORS) capabilities as a means to mitigate the Chinese ASAT threat<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.10 </span>The members of Congress look to ORS as a means to reconstitute critical assets lost in space combat<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. “</span>In a world where our space assets are likely to be threatened, operationally responsive space capabilities will allow us to quickly and affordably replace assets lost to anti-satellite attacks,”<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Senator </span>Kyl advocated.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> While a key motivator, ORS is more than just a satellite replenishment strategy. In a broader sense, Congress seeks ORS “to launch – and activate quickly – militarily useful satellites”11 in order to “supplement a battlefield commander’s capabilities.”12</span><br />

In the Senate,<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Arizona's Jon </span>Kyl has built a reputation for his encyclopedic knowledge of domestic and foreign policy, and his hard work and leadership. Few people have his command of policy<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, his knowledge of its nuances or his grip on how they fit together. </span>This is why so many of his Senate colleagues look to him for policy advice. Kyl,<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> 68, i</span>s a principled conservative who knows what is attainable. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">He believes in the wisdom contained in a sign on President Reagan's desk that said, &quot;There's no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.&quot; Jon </span>Kyl is a great persuader. As minority whip, the No. 2 position in the Senate Republican leadership, he is responsible for rallying his Republican colleagues for key legislative votes. What is unique is his single-minded focus on convincing them that a particular vote is in the best interests of their state and the nation. Jon demonstrates continually that the essence of Senate power is the power to persuade.<br />

<strong>That’s key to the agenda—determines congressional cooperation</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">In his memoirs, President Johnson wrote, </span>&quot;Presidential popularity is a major source of strength in gaining cooperation from Congress.&quot;<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">19 Thus, following his landslide electoral victory, he assembled the congressional liaison officials from the various departments and told them that his victory at the polls &quot;might be more of a loophole than a mandate,&quot; and, moreover, that since his popularity could decrease rapidly, they would have to use it to their advantage while it lasted.20 President Carter's aides were quite explicit about the importance of public approval in their efforts to influence Congress. One stated that the &quot;only way to keep those guys [Congress] honest is to keep our popularity high.&quot;21 The president's legislative liaison officials generally agreed that their effectiveness with Congress ultimately depended on the president's ability to influence public opinion. As one of them said, &quot;When you go up to the Hill and the latest polls show Carter isn't doing well, there isn't much reason for a member to go along with him. There's little we can do if the member isn't persuaded on the issue.&quot;22 The Reagan administration was especially sensitive to the president's public approval levels. According to one top aide, &quot;Everything here is built on the idea that the president's success depends on grassroots support.&quot;23 Why is presidential approval or popularity such an important source of influence in Congress? According to a senior aide to President Carter: </span>When the President is low in public opinion polls, the Members of Congress see little hazard in bucking him. . . . After all, very few Congressmen examine an issue solely on its merits; they are politicians and they think politically<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. I'm not saying they make only politically expedient choices. </span>But they read the polls and from that they feel secure in turning their backs on the President with political impunity. Unquestionably, the success of the President's policies bears a tremendous relationship to his popularity in the polls.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Despite the country's struggling economy and vocal opposition to some of his policies, President </span>Obama's favorability rating is at an all-time high.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Two-thirds feel hopeful about his leadership and six in 10 approve of the job he's doing in the White House. </span>&quot;What is amazing here is how much political capital Obama has spent in the first six weeks,&quot;<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> said Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. </span>&quot;And against that, he stands at the end of this six weeks with as much or more capital in the bank.&quot;<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Peter Hart gets at a key point. </span>Some believe that political capital is finite<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, that it can be used up. To an extent that's true. But it's important to note, too, that </span>political capital can be regenerated -- and<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, specifically, that </span>when a President expends a great deal of capital on a measure that was difficult to enact and then succeeds, he can build up more capital.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Indeed, that appears to be what is happening with Barack </span>Obama<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, who </span>went to the mat to pass the stimulus package out of the gate, got it passed despite near-unanimous opposition of<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> the </span>Republicans<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> on Capitol Hill, </span>and is being rewarded by the American public as a result. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Take a look at the numbers. President Obama now has a 68 percent favorable rating in the NBC-WSJ poll, his highest ever showing in the survey. Nearly half of those surveyed (47 percent) view him very positively. Obama's Democratic Party earns a respectable 49 percent favorable rating. The Republican Party, however, is in the toilet, with its worst ever showing in the history of the NBC-WSJ poll, 26 percent favorable. On the question of blame for the partisanship in Washington, 56 percent place the onus on the Bush administration and another 41 percent place it on Congressional Republicans. Yet just 24 percent blame Congressional Democrats, and a mere 11 percent blame the Obama administration. So at this point, </span>withPresident Obama seemingly benefiting from his ambitious actions<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and the Republicans sinking further and further as a result of their knee-jerked opposition to that agenda, </span>there appears to be no reason not to push forward on<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> anything from universal healthcare to </span>energy reform<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> to ending the war in Iraq.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">With the air force and navy versions of </span>the F-35<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, the debate is more nuanced. Although a far more capable aircraft than those it is replacing, it </span>may not be useful enough for long enough to justify the size of the planned order<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Analysts question whether it is as stealthy as claimed and its ability to penetrate the best future air-defence systems. And to be as stealthy as it is, </span>the F-35 can carry only two air-to-air missiles<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. The head of the air dominance branch of the Air Combat Command says he “wakes up in a cold sweat” thinking about it. </span>The F-35’s range of around 600 miles (1,000km) is another problem. The potential adversary that will dominate American military planning in the decades ahead is China. Even now, China is acquiring weapons<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, such as accurate anti-ship ballistic missiles, </span>that will push American carriers out into the western Pacific, well beyond the range of seaborne F-35s<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. For all its sophistication, against a “near peer” opponent </span>the F-35 may not be able to do the job for which it has been intended nearly as well as the next generation of pilotless armed drones and hypersonic cruise missiles<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Indeed, it could be obsolescent only a few years after it enters service. At a time of shrinking defence budgets, the F-35’s huge cost and the affection of service chiefs for fast jets flown by brave chaps should not be allowed to crowd out the development of more capable weapon systems. Cut back the F-35s and spend the money there.</span><br />

The future belongs to the drones<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. But the longer-term outlook for the </span>F-35<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> is uncertain. Its </span>costly capabilities are intended to make it effective <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">against the air defences of a sophisticated enemy, such as China. </span>But the growing vulnerability of American aircraft carriers to Chinese missiles will mean operating from well beyond the F-35’s 600-mile (1,000km) range<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Some </span>military strategists already think that the job the F-35 is meant to do can be better handled by cruise missiles and remotely piloted drones. In many roles, unmanned planes are more efficient<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">: they carry neither a bulky pilot nor the kit that keeps him alive, which means they can both turn faster and be stealthier. And </span>if they are shot down, no one dies<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Even the F-35’s champions concede that it will probably be the last manned strike fighter aircraft the West will build.</span><br />

The future of TNW influences, to a certain extent, the choice for replacement aircraft, and vice-versa. </span>Only the U.S. produced F-35 (Joint Strike Fighter) plans include a modification that allows for carrying and dropping TNW. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Modification costs for this so-called ‘dual capability’ come on top of the many recent cost overruns, delays and technological problems the F-35 development program is facing</span>. If countries need to maintain their nuclear roles, they are pretty much tied to the uncertain future of the F-35<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.</span><br />

<strong>TNW’s are Perceived by Russia as Undercutting their Nuclear Deterrent – Leads to Miscalculation and Extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Engdahl 7</strong> <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">(William F., Journalist and geopolitics specialist, <em>Global Research. cahttp:</em>www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=4873<em>)</em></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">With NATO troops creeping up to Russia’s borders on all sides, US nuclear B-52s and SSBN submarines being deployed to strategic sites on Russia’s perimeter, Washington extending its new missile shield from Greenland to the UK, to Australia, Japan and now even Poland and the Czech Republic, it should be no surprise that the Russian Government is responding. While Washington planners may have assumed that because the once-mighty Red Army was a shell of its former glory, that the state of Russian military preparedness since the end of the Cold War was laughable. But </span>Russia never let go of its one trump card—its strategic nuclear force. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">During the entire economic chaos of the Yeltsin years, Russia never stopped producing state-of-the art military technology. In May 2003, some months after George Bush unilaterally ripped up the bilateral Anti-Missile Defense Treaty with Moscow, invaded Afghanistan and bombed Baghdad into subjugation, Russia’s President delivered a new message in his annual State of the Union Address to the Russian nation. </span>Putin spoke<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> for the first </span>time publicly of the need to modernize Russia’s nuclear deterrent by creating new types of weapons, ‘which will ensure the defense capability of Russia and its allies in the long term.’ <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">In response to the abrogation by the Bush Administration of the ABM Treaty, and with it Start II, Russia predictably stopped withdrawing and destroying its SS-18 MIRVed missiles. Start II had called for full phase out of multiple warhead or MIRVed missiles, by both sides by 2007. At that point Russia began to reconfigure its SS-18 MIRV missiles to extend their service life to 2016. Fully loaded SS-18 missiles had a range of 11,000 kilometers. In addition, it redeployed mobile rail-based SS-24 M1 nuclear missiles. In its 2003 Budget, the Russian government made funding of its SS-27 or Topol-M single-warhead missiles a ‘priority.’ And the Defense Ministry resumed test launches of both SS-27 and Topol-M. In December 2006, </span>Putin told Russian journalists that deployment of the new Russian mobile Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile system was crucial for Russia’s national security. Without naming the obvious US threat, he declared, ‘Maintaining a strategic balance will mean that our strategic deterrent forces should be able to guarantee the neutralization of any potential aggressor, no matter what modern weapons systems he possesses.’ <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">It was unmistakable whom he had in mind, and it wasn’t the Al Qaeda cave-dwellers of Tora Bora. Russian Defense Minister, Sergei Ivanov, announced at the same time that the military would deploy another 69 silo-based and mobile Topol-M missile systems over the following decade. Just after his Munich speech Putin announced he had named his old KGB/FSB friend, Ivanov to be his First Deputy Prime Minister overseeing the entire military industry. The Russian Defense Ministry reported that as of January 2006, Russia possessed 927 nuclear delivery vehicles and 4,279 nuclear warheads against 1,255 and 5,966 respectively for the United States. </span>No two other powers on the face of the earth even came close to these massive overkill capacities. This was the ultimate reason all US foreign policy, military and economic, since the end of the Cold War had covertly had as endgame the complete deconstruction of Russia as a functioning state.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> In April 2006, the Russian military tested the K65M-R missile, a new missile designed to penetrate US missile defense systems. It was part of testing and deploying a uniform warhead for both land and sea-based ballistic missiles. The new missile was hypersonic and capable of changing flight path. Four months earlier, </span>Russia successfully tested its Bulava ICBM, a naval version of the Topol-M<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. It was launched from one of its Typhoon-class ballistic missile submarines in the White Sea, travelling a thousand miles before hitting a dummy target successfully on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Bulava missiles were to be installed on Russian Borey-class nuclear submarines beginning 2008. During a personal inspection of the first regiment of Russian mobile Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles in December 2006, </span>Putin told reporters the deployment of mobile Topol-M ICBMs were crucial for Russia’s national security<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, stating, ‘This is a significant step forward in improving our defense capabilities.’ ‘</span>Maintaining a strategic balance,’ he continued, ’will mean that our strategic deterrent forces should be able to guarantee the neutralization of any potential aggressor, no matter what modern weapons systems he possesses<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.’ Putin clearly did not have France in mind when he referred to the unnamed ‘he.’ President Putin had personally given French President Chirac a tour of one of Russia’s missile facilities that January, where Putin explained the latest Russian missile advances. ‘He knows what I am talking about,’ Putin told reporters afterwards, referring to Chirac’s grasp of the weapon’s significance. Putin also did not have North Korea, China, Pakistan or India in mind, nor Great Britain with its ageing nuclear capacity, not even Israel. The only power surrounding Russia with weapons of mass destruction was its old Cold War foe--the United States. </span>The Commander of Russia’s Strategic Rocket Forces<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, General Nikolai Solovtsov, was more explicit. </span>Commenting on the successful test of the K65M-R<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> at Russia’s Kapustin Yar missile test site last April, he </span>declared that US plans for a missile defense system, ‘could upset strategic stability. The planned scale of the United States’ deployment of a…missile defense system is so considerable that the fear that it could have a negative effect on the parameters of Russia’s nuclear deterrence potential is quite justified<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.’ Put simply, he referred to the now open US quest for Full Spectrum Dominance—Nuclear Primacy. </span>A new Armageddon is in the making.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> The unilateral </span>military agenda of Washington has predictably provoked a major effort by Russia to defend herself<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. </span>The prospects of a global nuclear conflagration, by miscalculation, increase by the day<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. At what point might an American President, God forbid, decide to order a pre-emptive full-scale nuclear attack on Russia to prevent Russia from rebuilding a state of mutual deterrence? The new Armageddon is not exactly the Armageddon which George Bush’s Christian fanatics pray for as they dream of their Rapture. </span>It is an Armageddon in which Russia and the United States would irradiate the planet and, perhaps, end human civilization in the process. <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Ironically, oil, in the context of Washington’s bungled Iraq war and soaring world oil prices after 2003, has enabled Russia to begin the arduous job of rebuilding its collapsed economy and its military capacities. Putin’s Russia is no longer a begger-thy-neighbor former Superpower. It’s using its oil weapon and rebuilding its nuclear ones. Bush’s America is a hollowed-out debt-ridden economy engaged on using its last card, its vast military power to prop up the dollar and its role as world sole Superpower.</span><br />

<em><strong>7. The F-35 cannot improve the military – cost overruns cause drastic delays</strong></em><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Burning banknotes Above all, </span>the F-35 was meant to be affordable<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. Development costs would be shared across the three versions and with eight foreign partners who were also buying and helping to build the F-35. Manufacturing scale economies were assured because more than 3,000 planes were to be sold—2,443 to Uncle Sam and the rest to his NATO allies. And because 80% of the parts were common to all three versions, maintenance and logistics would be simpler and cheaper. Deliveries of operational aircraft were to begin in 2010. That was the idea, anyway. </span>The F-35’s critics have long argued that its performance is compromised by having to fulfil too many roles and that an over-complicated design lashed to an over-optimistic schedule was asking for trouble. In the past 18 months, as delays have mounted and costs escalated, even some of the plane’s ardent fans have become alarmed<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. In 2009 the Pentagon realised that a breach of the Nunn-McCurdy rules on over-budget defence-procurement programmes was inevitable, because </span>costs would exceed the original baseline by more than 50%<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. An internal report declared: “Affordability is no longer embraced as a core pillar.”</span><br />

<strong>8. The F-35 fails – cost overruns, takeoff and landing difficulties, software problems and the plane hasn’t even been tested yet</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Anticipating the breach, in March 2010 Mr </span>Gatesrestated his support for the F-35,<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> but hit out at “unacceptable delays and cost overruns”. </span>He said he was “fundamentally restructuring” the programme, adding more money and time for development<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. He also </span>withheld $614m in performance payments to Lockheed Martin, tying its future earnings to specific criteria<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> rather than the subjective ones that he believed had stiffed the taxpayer. In January this year </span>Mr Gates made a series of further announcements<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> which included spending another $4.6 billion on development, </span>slowing down initial production<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> to avoid building aircraft that would later have to be expensively upgraded </span>and putting the marines’ STOVL version on two-year “probation”<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> because of problems with the aircraft’s structure and propulsion </span>system. Condemning the failure to get costs under control, which he blamed<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> partly on the lack of financial discipline in the defence department during George Bush’s presidency and</span> partly on execution failures by Lockheed Martin and its partners, Mr Gates said that “the culture of endless money that has taken hold must be replaced by a culture of restraint<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">”. The latest cost estimates from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), published in May to coincide with a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the F-35 programme, were shocking. </span>The average price of each plane in “then-year” dollars had risen from $69m in 2001 to $133m today. Adding in $56.4 billion of development costs, the price rises from $81m to $156m<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. The GAO report concluded that since 2007 development costs had risen by 26% and the timetable had slipped by five years. Mr Gates’s 2010 restructuring helped. But still, “</span>after more than nine years in development and four in production, the JSF programme has not fully demonstrated that the aircraft design is stable, manufacturing processes are mature and the system is reliable<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">”. </span>Apart from the STOVL version’s problems, the biggest issue was integrating and testing the software that runs the aircraft’s electronics and sensors<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">. At the hearing, Senator John </span>McCain described it as “a train wreck” and accused Lockheed Martin of doing “an abysmal job”.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As we look to the future, a troubling wildcard is the possibility that </span>impatience, when combined with a growing sense of Chinese triumphalism, could lead Beijing to decide to force the issue of reunification.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Because of this possibility, and </span>the fact that the United States and China will be engaged in a military capabilities competition, even if things turn out well in cross-Strait relations, is not a bad thing. As long as the United States chooses to keep competing to assure its access, and does not let Chinese capabilities gain the upper hand, there will continue to be a powerful deterrent to Chinese impatience.The worst of all possible outcomes would be<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the dangerous brew of a </span>China that calculates that it has achieved the military upper hand<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—i.e., that its anti-access/area-denial capabilities will deter U.S. intervention— </span>combined with impatience with the progress of reunification with Taiwan and an overweening sense of confidence that the PRC can afford to throw its weight around in East Asia without regard to the consequences.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This situation represents the worst-case scenario because, in the absence of some provocation by Taipei, </span>if China loses patience and elects to use force to settle unification once and for all, that decision could lead to a U.S.– China war.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Today, it seems improbable that Beijing would be this reckless, but it is something that bears watching because even now there are press reports of PLA generals worrying that Taiwan’s current policy will lead to a - 108 - “peaceful split from China.”</span><br />

<strong>5. US Chinese space cooperation fails – China has no incentive because it is a rising hegemon</strong><br />
<strong>Richburg, 2011 - Washington Post Writer</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Keith, 2011, 1/23The Washington Post, As China eyes the stars, the U.S. watches warily, Lexis Nexis, 7/12/11.]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> China's grand ambitions extend literally to the moon, with the country now embarked on a multi-pronged program to establish its own global navigational system, launch a space laboratory and put a Chinese astronaut on the moon within the next decade. </span>The Obama administration views space as ripe territory for cooperation with China. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has called it one of four potential areas of &quot;strategic dialogue,&quot; along with cybersecurity, missile defense and nuclear weapons. And President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao vowed after their White House summit last week to &quot;deepen dialogue and exchanges&quot; in the field. But as China ramps up its space initiatives, the diplomatic talk of cooperation has so far found little traction. The Chinese leadership has shown scant interest in opening up the most sensitive details of its program, much of which is controlled by the People's Liberation Army (PLA). At the same time, Chinese scientists and space officials say that Washington's wariness of China's intentions in space, as well as U.S. bans on some high-technology exports, makes cooperation problematic. For now, the U.S.-China relationship in space appears to mirror the one on Earth - a still-dominant but fading superpower facing a new and ambitious rival, with suspicion on both sides. &quot;What you have are two major powers, both of whom use space for military, civilian and commercial purposes,&quot; said Dean Cheng, a researcher with the Washington-based Heritage Foundation and an expert on the Chinese military and space program. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">NASA's human spaceflight program has been in flux in recent years, fueling particular concern among some U.S. observers about the challenge posed by China's initiatives in that area. There is &quot;a lot of very wary, careful, mutual watching,&quot; Cheng said. Song Xiaojun, a military expert and commentator on China's CCTV, said that substantial cooperation in the space field is impossible without mutual trust. Achieving that, he said, &quot;depends on whether the U.S. can put away its pride and treat China as a partner to cooperate on equal terms. But I don't see that happening in the near future, since the U.S. is experiencing menopause while China is going through puberty.&quot;</span><br />

<br />
<span style="background-color: yellow;">The House Appropriations Committee's version of the next Continuing Resolution</span> (CR) does more than cut NASA's budget. It prohibits spending money on anything that would lead to space cooperation with China, and releases NASA from the prohibition against cancelling the Constellation program that was in an earlier appropriations bill<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The cuts to NASA are shown in a new </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt;">SpacePolicyOnline.com Fact Sheet</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">that will track NASA's FY2011 appropriations as they continue to be considered in the 112th Congress. An earlier version of the House Appropriations Committee's recommendations, released last Wednesday, called for cutting NASA $379 million from its FY2011 request as part of an overall $74 billion cut to federal spending for FY2011. Conservative &quot;Tea Party&quot; Republicans </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt;">rejected</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the committee's recommendations because they had pledged a $100 billion cut during their campaigns. The committee members regrouped and on Friday issued their revised recommendations that total $100 billion. </span>The reduction is to the FY2011 President's request for government spending, but the bill introduced by the appropriations committee, <span style="color: windowtext;">H.R. 1</span>, uses FY2010 spending as its baseline<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. When reading the bill, one must compare its budget recommendations with what is in the 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117), not the President's FY2011 request</span>. NASA would be cut $303 million compared to its 2010 spending level, but $578.7 million from the FY2011 request<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Details are in our fact sheet. </span>The committee's bill also prohibits spending any funds appropriated for NASA or the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy for space cooperation with China unless specifically authorized by Congress. The exact language is -- SEC. 1339. (a) None of the funds made available by this division may be used for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or the Office of Science and Technology Policy to develop, design, plan, promulgate, implement, or execute a policy, program, order, or contract of any kind to participate, collaborate, or coordinate in anyway with China or any Chinese-owned company unless such activities are specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of enactment of this division. (b) The limitation in subsection (a) shall also apply to any funds used to effectuate the hosting of official Chinese visitors at facilities belonging to or utilized by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">WASHINGTON -- New talks this week between American and Chinese military leaders got stuck on the issue of Taiwan, the same problem that torpedoed U.S.-China military cooperation last year. </span>Growing American concern about China’s military build-up, cyberwar attacks, aggressive maneuvers in the South China Sea and Chinese complaints about U.S. spy-planes monitoring its coastline were all topics left unaddressed after the first high-level Chinese military visit in seven years. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Following two days of discussions at the Pentagon and elsewhere in Washington, Gen. Chen Bingde, chief of the Chinese general staff, and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed hope for continued dialog and cooperation while acknowledging the deep disagreements between the two powers. &quot;We spent the bulk of our time trying to understand the security environment from one another’s perspective, and trying to gain a better sense of the common interests we share,&quot; Mullen said at a joint press briefing Wednesday. &quot;We can’t afford to wait until we are in a crisis before we start to understand each other.&quot; For his part, Chen, a 69-year-old hardliner whose career began in 1961 as a common enlisted soldier, said in a speech at the National Defense University in Washington that &quot;it is natural and necessary for the two militaries to work together toward a peaceful and stable landscape.&quot; He vowed to &quot;push forward&quot; with a U.S.-China military dialog. But beneath the beaming smiles and photo-op bonhomie, the issue of Taiwan loomed large</span>. At immediate issue: the prospective sale of U.S. F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan, an action that aroused unusual Chinese fury. &quot;Taiwan is part of Chinese territory,&quot; <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Chen declared. &quot;Why would it need U.S. weapons sales to guarantee its security?&quot; He explained away</span> China’s own surging build-up of sophisticated military capability -- <span style="font-size: 8pt;">a major and growing U.S. concern</span> -- as &quot;mainly targeted at separatist forces who have attempted to split Taiwan away from China.&quot; <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Having had a good look at U.S. military capabilities during his Washington briefings, Chen added coyly, &quot;I am surprised at the sophistication of the U.S. military … China does not have the capability to challenge the United States.&quot; &quot;This kind of candor is crucial for any good relationship</span>,&quot; Mullen<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> said. But he </span>showed no sign of easing the tension over Taiwan<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “I certainly share the view of peaceful reunification of China,&quot; he said, but added that in the meantime, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 remains in effect, requiring Taiwan to be treated as any other sovereign foreign country. &quot;We will continue to follow the law until such time as that changes,&quot; Mullen said, noting that he is unaware of any effort to change the law. &quot;We have realistic expectations about our ability to solve these issues this week,&quot; he added. China’s extreme sensitivity to Taiwan became evident a year ago, when the nation abruptly canceled military dialogue with the United States after the Obama administration announced plans to sell $6.4 billion worth of arms to Taiwan, including Patriot air defense missiles and Blackhawk helicopters. Since then, Taiwanese officials have expressed a strong interest in acquiring the F-16 fighters, but there has been no official request. Perhaps mindful of such potential explosions, </span>Mullen and Chen carefully skirted the issue when asked if the sale of F-16s to Taiwan would again derail U.S.-China military talks. It would depend, each said, on the size and scope of the proposed sale. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nevertheless, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed this week on a number of small joint steps they hope will carry the two nations beyond the Taiwan issue. Such measures include a counter-piracy exercise and a joint humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercise. These and other minor forms of cooperation will take place against large and deepening strategic concerns. Senior American analysts worry that China seeks to hold at-risk U.S. warships and military facilities in the South China Sea, where more than a third of the world’s sea-borne cargo transits, and in neighboring island chains and straits. Underscoring those concerns is China’s development of high-tech weaponry, including the Dong Feng 21D, an advanced long-range ballistic said to be capable of attacking American aircraft carriers long before they are in striking range of the Chinese coast. A senior Navy intelligence officer, Vice Adm. David Dorsett, said earlier this year the missile is designed to hunt down and strike a maneuvering target, such as an aircraft carrier. But when asked directly if the Dong Feng threatens carriers, the main instruments of asserting American power in the region, Dorsett said, &quot;That’s something I’d prefer not to talk about.&quot; China is also developing a stealth fighter that could challenge the best new U.S. fighter, the F-22. U.S. officials have said the Pentagon &quot;underestimated&quot; the speed at which high-tech weapons are being developed and deployed by China, which had been known for fielding shoddy knock-offs of clunky Soviet aircraft, missiles and warships. At present, China is finishing refitting an old Russian aircraft carrier that it expects to put to sea for trials later this year. Defense analysts have said they expect China will test the ship as a precursor to a class of new Chinese carriers to be built in the future. Chen set off Wednesday evening on a tour of U.S. military facilities, including Nellis Air Force Base just outside Las Vegas and the Army’s National Military Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif. The planned itinerary infuriated Congressional conservatives, with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fl.) charging Chen's visit amounts to little more than a sophisticated spy mission. &quot;There can be no doubt that every scrap of information this expert delegation collects will be used against us,&quot; Ros-Lehtinen, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement. </span>&quot;The Chinese military openly regards the United States as an enemy,&quot; she added. &quot;We should not undermine our own security by thinking we can make friends with self-proclaimed adversaries with hospitality and open arms.&quot;<br />

US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and published by the British Telegraph</span> reveal that Washington has threatened military action against China’s anti-satellite and anti-ballistic missile systems. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Moreover</span>, the threat<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, first formally issued in 2008,</span> has recently been reinforced by a new 10-year US National Security Space Strategy, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">released on February 4.</span> The secret cables demonstrate deep concern within both the Bush and Obama administrations about China’s capacity to destroy the satellites upon which the US military depends heavily for navigation, surveillance and precision-guidance weapons. The documents reveal aggressive messages from Washington to Beijing over the past three years. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The cables relate to three sets of missile tests. On January 11, 2007, China launched a SC-19 missile to destroy an old weather satellite 850 kilometres above the earth. On February 18, 2008, the Bush administration ordered a cruiser USS Lake Erie to fire a SM-3 interceptor missile to destroy USA 193, a spy satellite 240 kilometres above the earth. In January 2010, China launched another SC-19 missile to intercept a Chinese medium-range ballistic missile flying 250 kilometres above the earth—a sophisticated test of a type only previously carried out by the US. Leaked files from the US embassy in China dated January 6, 2008, disclosed that </span>the US had requested its major allies, such as the UK, Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea, to join a coordinated diplomatic campaign against China’s January 2007 test. The diplomatic offensive constituted the “international opinion” at the time, accusing China of “militarising” outer space. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Just a month before its own February 2008 satellite interception, the US delivered a démarche to the Chinese foreign ministry, while asking US allies, such as Germany, Italy, Israel and Japan, to do likewise. “The United States requests your government’s assistance in applying diplomatic pressure to the Chinese government,” the cable stated. The State Department issued “talking points” for these allies. One was that “China is now responsible for more breakup debris in low earth orbit than any other spacefaring nation,” alleging that this could damage other satellites. In public, the Bush administration insisted its February 2008 interception—the first since the US stopped conducting such tests in 1985—was a necessary safety measure to prevent a malfunctioning spy satellite’s toxic fuel tank from causing harm when falling to the earth. In fact, the $30 million operation aimed to send a message to China</span>. The January 2008 démarche to China, sent by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, contained an explicit threat that “any purposeful interference with US space systems will be interpreted by the United States as an infringement of its rights and considered an escalation in a crisis or conflict.” It declared that the US reserved the right “to defend and protect its space systems with a wide range of options, from diplomatic to military”. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The threat extended to any alleged Chinese “interference with the space systems of other nations which are used by the United States”. This would “be considered as contrary to the interest of maintaining international peace and security”. The démarche ended with a series of provocative questions: “What analysis did China perform to estimate the debris that would be caused by the intentional destruction of your satellite in the January 11, 2007, test?” and “What are China’s future intentions for its direct-ascent ASAT development and testing program?” The next cable shows that the US decision to destroy the USA 193 spy satellite in February 2008 angered Chinese leaders. A secret memo sent from the US embassy on February 22, 2008, noted that senior Chinese figures “repeatedly emphasized that the United States should provide information on the planned satellite interception prior to releasing the information to CNN. The Bush administration had instructed the Beijing embassy to notify the Chinese foreign ministry only after the US Pacific Command had executed the strike. Another Beijing embassy cable, dated June 13, 2008, recorded a dialogue between US Acting Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security John Rood and China’s Assistant Foreign Minister He Yefei over the 2007 Chinese test, nuclear forces, space programs and the US “missile defence” program, which features SM-3 and other interceptor missiles.</span> China refused to accept the US position that its National Missile Defence (NMD) program was “defensive” and posed no threat to Russia and China. Minister He argued that the US program would “break the global balance” because the US already had the greatest offensive military capabilities and the NMD would undercut the deterrence abilities of other states. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Chinese minister also warned that US-Japan cooperation on the NMD had “greatest relevance to China” because missile defence radar in Japan would cover all of China. The NMD would “force China to rethink its nuclear strategy”. The Chinese minister rebuffed a request from Rood to make China’s nuclear arsenal “transparent” because that “would eliminate its deterrent value”. The assistant foreign minister assured Rood that China would never seek nuclear superiority by “following the footsteps of the Soviet Union”. On space technology, Rood was told that China had not “crossed any thresholds” that threatened the US leadership, but China “cannot accept others setting limits on our capabilities”. This exchange took place against a definite background. Russia and China regarded the NMD as an aggressive rather than a defensive program. An article in the prominent US journal Foreign Affairs in 2006 had argued that the era of a US “nuclear primacy” had arrived because the numerical and technological superiorities of the American nuclear arsenal far exceeded those of Russia and China. The article insisted the US was now in a position to carry out a nuclear “first strike” to annihilate Russian and Chinese nuclear forces, with the NMD tasked with intercepting any surviving nuclear missiles from Russia or China. These</span> tensions have been exacerbated since Obama took office. The White House embarked on an even more aggressive course toward China, signalling a full-scale campaign on strategic, diplomatic and currency fronts by announcing $6.4 billion arms sales to Taiwan.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In January 2010, Beijing responded with an anti-ballistic missile test, designed to show Washington that Beijing was also developing a missile defence system. The Obama administration reacted by reiterating the line of the former Bush presidency. A cable sent by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton instructed US diplomats to demand that Australia, Japan and South Korea once again join “in demarching China in a fashion similar to the US approach”.</span><br />

<strong>2. No impact – Their prolif impact is shoddy scholarship – empirical proof</strong><br />

<strong>Potter 10</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> - Professor of Nonproliferation Studies and Director of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. [William C. Potter, “The npt &amp; the sources of nuclear restraint,” Dædalus Winter 2010]</span><br />
<br />
One of the difficulties in making accurate prognoses about the future of nonproliferation is the underdeveloped state of research on<span style="font-size: 7pt;">foreign policy forecasting in general and</span>nuclear decisionmaking<span style="font-size: 7pt;">in particular.</span>Also contributing to the problem is the paucity of relevant theory with predictive value<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>In an effort to remedy this proliferation-knowledge deficit <span style="font-size: 7pt;">and to better gauge the prospects for nuclear weapons spread during the next decade,</span>CNS undertook a study of the proliferation propensity of 13 countries from different regions<span style="font-size: 7pt;">of the world.34 The project also sought to assess the impact of various trigger events, including defections from the npt, on national nuclear decisions.</span>The project’s most significant and unanticipated finding<span style="font-size: 7pt;">with respect to proliferation propensity, and one that was evident across all of the case studies,</span>is the relatively low expectation of proliferation during the next 10 years<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>This prognosis holds regardless of <span style="font-size: 7pt;">the </span>theoretical approach and level of analyses<span style="font-size: 7pt;">favored by the analyst,</span>and appears to be largely insensitive to<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the </span>geographic location<span style="font-size: 7pt;">of the countries, their level of economic</span>development<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>government type, and perceived external security<span style="font-size: 7pt;">environment. While surprising in terms of prevailing conventional wisdom about a pending proliferation pandemic,</span>the results<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, in fact,</span>are consistent with the historically slow pace of prolif<span style="font-size: 7pt;">eration </span>and the failure of most prior forecasts of prolif<span style="font-size: 7pt;">eration </span>doom to materialize<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. They also are compatible with the theories of nuclear choice espoused by Hymans and Solingen that point to the exceptional circumstances that must pertain in order for states to abandon nuclear restraint. In addition, </span>the project found that there is little evidence of<span style="font-size: 7pt;">the operation of “</span>reactive prolif<span style="font-size: 7pt;">eration,” </span>in which one state’s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons will prompt a reciprocal response by others<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Case study</span>authors<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, for example,</span>were disinclined to regard weaponization by any single country itself as sufficient to reverse long-standing nonproliferation restraint<span style="font-size: 7pt;">on the part of most other countries, including Egypt, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, and Venezuela. 35</span>Significantly, this finding applies even when the “trigger” is Iranian defection from the npt. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Moreover, to the extent that one country’s proliferation decision has a near-term diffusion effect, it appears to be very context-dependent and requires a number of other circumstances to occur.</span>Among the effects dampening the potential operation of a proliferation chain is the fact that nuclear decisions take place in a domestic political environment sensitive to considerations of a political-economic nature<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, as well as </span>competing organizational interests and personalities<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Although one may interpret the general finding–that an Iranian defection from the npt would have a limited impact on individual country futures–as an indication of the strength and vitality of the Treaty, an alternative interpretation is that</span>the Treaty is less central to the nuclear orientation of<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> some</span>states than is often assumed<span style="font-size: 7pt;">to be the case.</span>This perspective appears to be borne out in the case studies of Australia, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia<span style="font-size: 7pt;">(post- 1974). Nevertheless, a number of the project’s other case studies, including those of Japan, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, and Ukraine, highlight the significant–if indirect–positive effect the npt has on nuclear weapons restraint by reinforcing the position of institutional advocates for nuclear abstinence in domestic political debates. The Treaty also continues to have a symbolic normative value in many of the countries surveyed, and elites in states such as Australia, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, and Ukraine regard adherence to the npt as an integral part of their credentials as members of the international community in good standing.

There are some key advantages to the CAV concept when you compare it to a regular conventional warhead <span style="font-size: 7pt;">that is being delivered on a MM II or Peacekeeper missile system may not have. The CAV may have the potential for mid-course change on target sets, will have an accuracy of 3 meters, and will be able to carry a variety of payloads to include munitions and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance payloads.37 Additionally,</span> the trajectory of the CAV will be different from a typical ICBM when launched thus enabling other countries to verify that it is not a ICBM that has a nuclear warhead on board.<br />

During the Cold War, the US model for deterrence was based upon<span style="font-size: 7pt;">a robust capability to employ</span>nuclear weapons<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> via aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Known classically as &quot;nuclear deterrence&quot;, this original Triad was designed to deter the Soviet Union. When combined with razor-sharp readiness and a bilateral dialogue that stressed both a mutual understanding of one another's capabilities and decision-making processes, the Triad underpinned the US deterrence posture that successfully kept the peace for over fifty years. Although </span>the strategic landscape has<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> dramatically </span>shifted since the end of the Cold War<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, the concept of deterrence and the need to deter adversaries from attacking our vital interests is just as important in the 21st Century as it was in the last century. However</span>, today's more complex strategic landscape demands<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> excellence and </span>nuance<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> across a much broader set of national security challenges. To address these challenges, our model for deterrence has evolved. Today, strategic deterrence is embodied by a new Triad borne of the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review. </span>The Triad now emphasizes the integration of<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> offensive capabilities, both </span>nuclear and conventional<span style="font-size: 7pt;">; defensive </span>capabilities<span style="font-size: 7pt;">; and a responsive defense infrastructure, all enabled by intelligence, planning, and global Command and Control (C2). These efforts are ably led by our Joint Functional Component Command for Global Strike and Integration (JFCC-GSI). The nuclear capability of the original Triad remains a vital part of our deterrence strategy. In light of this, USSTRATCOM is re- examining our oversight role of the Nation's strategic nuclear forces. We reviewed the US Air Force report of the Minot weapons transfer incident, as well as other independent investigative reports, and have implemented organizational and oversight changes to refocus USSTRATCOM on our nuclear mission responsibilities. We also intend to increase the oversight of Operational Readiness and Nuclear Surety Inspections of our assigned or gained units.</span>While our nuclear capability remains vital, our ability to integrate conventional long-range precision weapons is every bit as important<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Although our conventional forces are second to none, we no longer have these forces forward-deployed permanently throughout the world. Therefore, it is prudent to have the ability to defeat attacks and eliminate high value targets at global ranges on short notice. </span>We have a prompt global strike delivery capability on alert today, but it is configured only with nuclear weapons, which<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> limits the options available to the President and may in some cases </span>reduce the credibility of our deterrence. The capability we lack is the means to deliver prompt, precise, conventional kinetic effects<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> at inter-continental ranges. </span>The ability to hold at risk sites in otherwise denied territory is a key element of our strategic deterrent capability<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. At present, </span>the complex and evolving threat environment necessitates the rapid development and demonstration of a prompt conventional global strike capability<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. I appreciate past Congressional discussions concerning the need to fill our Prompt Global Strike (PGS) capability gap and wish to thank Congress for providing the Fiscal Year 2008 (FY08) resources as we continue to address this capability shortfall. The Air Force, Navy, and Army are coordinating with USSTRATCOM and the DoD Office of Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to conduct research, development, test, and evaluation of technologies which hold the greatest promise for new capability development. While we are making progress, </span>we must place emphasis on a near-term solution to fill a gap that exists today<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>Hegemony is key to prevent geopolitical rivalries from intensifying and to solve multiple hotspots for nuclear escalation</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">This is a good thing, and </span>it should continue to be a primary goal of American foreign policy to perpetuate this relatively benign international configuration of power. The unipolar order with the United States as the predominant power is unavoidably riddled with flaws and contradictions.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> It inspires fears and jealousies. The United States is not immune to error, like all other nations, and because of its size and importance in the international system those errors are magnified and take on greater significance than the errors of less powerful nations. Compared to the ideal Kantian international order, in which all the world ’s powers would be peace-loving equals, conducting themselves wisely, prudently, and in strict obeisance to international law, the unipolar system is both dangerous and unjust. </span>Compared to any plausible alternative in the real world, however, it is relatively stable and less likely to produce a major war between great powers. It is also comparatively benevolent<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, from a liberal perspective, for it is more conducive to the principles of economic and political liberalism that Americans and many others value. </span>American predominanc<span style="font-size: 7pt;">e does not stand in the way of progress toward a better world, therefore. It </span>stands in the way of regression toward a more dangerous world<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The choice is not between an American-dominated order and a world that looks like the European Union. The future international order will be shaped by those who have the power to shape it. The leaders of a post-American world will not meet in Brussels but in Beijing, Moscow, and Washington. The return of great powers and great games </span>If the world is marked by the persistence of unipolarity, it is nevertheless also being shaped by the reemergence of competitive national ambitions<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of the kind that have shaped human affairs from time immemorial. During the Cold War, this historical tendency of great powers to jostle with one another for status and influence as well as for wealth and power was largely suppressed by the two superpowers and their rigid bipolar order. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has not been powerful enough, and probably could never be powerful enough, to suppress by itself the normal ambitions of nations. </span>This does not mean the world has returned to multipolarity, since none of the large power<span style="font-size: 7pt;">s</span> is in range of competing with the superpower for global influence. Nevertheless, several large powers are now competing for regional predominance,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> both with the United States and with each other. </span>National ambition drives China’s foreign policy today<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and although it is tempered by prudence and the desire to appear as unthreatening as possible to the rest of the world, the Chinese are powerfully motivated to return their nation to what they regard as its traditional position as the preeminent power in East Asia. They do not share a European, postmodern view that power is pass é; hence their now two-decades-long military buildup and modernization</span>. Like the Americans, they believe power, including military power, is a good thing to have and that it is better to have more of it than less<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Perhaps more significant is the Chinese perception, also shared by Americans, that status and honor, and not just wealth and security, are important for a nation. The Chinese do not share the view that power is passé; hence their now twodecades- long military buildup. </span>Japan, meanwhile<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, which in the past could have been counted as an aspiring postmodern power — with its pacifist constitution and low defense spending — </span>now appears embarked on a more traditional national course<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>Partly this is in reaction to the rising power of China and concerns about North Korea ’s nuclear weapons<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. But it is also driven by Japan’s own national ambition to be a leader in East Asia or at least not to play second fiddle or “little brother” to China. China and Japan are now in a competitive quest with each trying to augment its own status and power and to prevent the other ’s rise to predominance, and this competition has a military and strategic as well as an economic and political component. Their competition is such that </span>a nation like South Korea<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, with a long unhappy history as a pawn between the two powers, </span>is once again worrying both about a “greater China” and about the return of Japanese nationalism. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">As Aaron Friedberg commented, the East Asian future looks more like Europe ’s past than its present. But it also looks like Asia’s past. </span>Russian foreign policy<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, too, looks more like something from the nineteenth century. It </span>is being driven by a typical, and typically Russian, blend of national resentment and ambition<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. A postmodern Russia simply seeking integration into the new European order, the Russia of Andrei Kozyrev, would not be troubled by the eastward enlargement of the eu and nato, would not insist on predominant influence over its “near abroad,” and would not use its natural resources as means of gaining geopolitical leverage and enhancing Russia ’s international status in an attempt to regain the lost glories of the Soviet empire and Peter the Great. But Russia, like China and Japan, is moved by more traditional great-power considerations, including the pursuit of those valuable if intangible national interests: honor and respect. Although Russian leaders complain about threats to their security from nato and the United States, the Russian sense of insecurity has more to do with resentment and national identity than with plausible external military threats. 16 Russia’s complaint today is not with this or that weapons system. It is the entire post-Cold War settlement of the 1990s that Russia resents and wants to revise. But that does not make insecurity less a factor in Russia ’s relations with the world; indeed, it makes finding compromise with the Russians all the more difficult. One could add others to this list of great powers with traditional rather than postmodern aspirations. India ’s regional ambitions are more muted, or are focused most intently on Pakistan, but it is clearly engaged in competition with China for dominance in the Indian Ocean and sees itself, correctly, as an emerging great power on the world scene. In the Middle East there is Iran, which mingles religious fervor with a historical sense of superiority and leadership in its region. 17 Its nuclear program is as much about the desire for regional hegemony as about defending Iranian territory from attack by the United States. Even the European Union, in its way, expresses a pan-European national ambition to play a significant role in the world, and it has become the vehicle for channeling German, French, and British ambitions in what Europeans regard as a safe supranational direction. Europeans seek honor and respect, too, but of a postmodern variety. The honor they seek is to occupy the moral high ground in the world, to exercise moral authority, to wield political and economic influence as an antidote to militarism, to be the keeper of the global conscience, and to be recognized and admired by others for playing this role. Islam is not a nation, but many Muslims express a kind of religious nationalism, </span>and the leaders of radical Islam, including al Qaeda, do seek to establish a theocratic nation or confederation of nations that would encompass a wide swath of the Middle East and beyond<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Like national movements elsewhere, Islamists have a yearning for respect, including self-respect, and a desire for honor. Their national identity has been molded in defiance against stronger and often oppressive outside powers, and also by memories of ancient superiority over those same powers. China had its “century of humiliation.” Islamists have more than a century of humiliation to look back on, a humiliation of which Israel has become the living symbol, which is partly why even Muslims who are neither radical nor fundamentalist proffer their sympathy and even their support to violent extremists who can turn the tables on the dominant liberal West, and particularly on a dominant America which implanted and still feeds the Israeli cancer in their midst. Islamists have more than a century of humiliation to look back on. Israel has become its living symbol. Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as “No. 1” and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. </span>Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying — its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past:<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but </span>often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. <span style="font-size: 7pt;"> It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, </span>the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> such that </span>other nations<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly </span>allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. </span>In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not only on the goodwill of peoples but also on American power. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but </span>even today Europe ’s stability depends on the guarantee<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, however distant and one hopes unnecessary</span>, thatthe United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that ’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. </span>The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world ’s great powers.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, </span>regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>War could erupt between China and Taiwan <span style="font-size: 7pt;">and draw in both the United States and Japan. </span>War could erupt between Russia and Georgia,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. </span>Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. </span>Such conflicts<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they </span>are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> That is certainly the view of most of China ’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. </span>Conflicts are more likely to erupt if the United States withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” — this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. </span>The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn ’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. </span>A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn ’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. </span>It will produce a new instability, onelikely to draw the United States back in again.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.</span><br />

<strong>6. Turn – PGS strengthens alliances, deters adversaries including nonstate actors. Negative evidence relies on outmoded cold war logic</strong><br />

<strong>Flory 06</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy [Mr. Peter C. W. Flory (Principal advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and the Secretary of Defense on issues that relate to nonproliferation and counterproliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons), “Global Strike Issues,” The Senate Armed Services Committee, Strategic Forces Subcommittee Hearing, 16 March 2006, pg. www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/TestFlory060316.doc]</span><br />
<br />
During the Cold War, the main challenge facing the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>was deterring the<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> former</span>Soviet Union<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> from using weapons of mass destruction against the United States and its allies. At that time we designed our strategic nuclear forces to deter a single foe, and generally treated all others as “lesser included cases.” </span>The new security environment is much-changed<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, however. While Russia is unlikely to pose a military threat to the United States or its allies on the same scale or intensity as the Soviet Union during the Cold War, Russia remains a country in transition. It is no longer an adversary but not yet a traditional ally,. Of the major and emerging powers, China has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States, and there are potential flash points with which we must be concerned. But </span>the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited States </span>faces a greater danger from an expanding number of hostile regimes and terrorist groups that seek to acquire and use WMD<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Even when they do not pose a direct threat to the United States</span>, these states may threaten the U.S. or its allies indirectly by transferring weapons or expertise to terrorists. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">The United States cannot predict with confidence what nation, combination of nations, or non-state actors may pose a threat to its vital interests or those of its friends and allies in the decades ahead. As the NPR noted: “</span>The September 11th attacks dramatically illustrated the unparalleled extremism, hostility, and unpredictability of some foes….” In this new and uncertain environment, a “one size fits all” approach to deterrence is no longer appropriate; we must<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> re-think our approach to 21st Century threats and </span>tailor deterrence to achieve specific effects against a wide array of potential adversaries and circumstances<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, such as advanced military competitors, regional WMD states, as well as non-state terrorist networks. In short, </span>in order to assure our allies<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and friends, </span>dissuade potential competitors, and deter<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a diverse array of potential </span>adversaries, we must have<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a broad range of credible strategic capabilities–including a mix of nuclear and </span>non-nuclear Global Strike<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, defenses, and a revitalized and responsive infrastructure. The Nuclear Posture Review of 2001 set forth, and was based on, the following assumptions: Expect Surprise Unpredictable Future Deterrence Uncertain Future adversaries (e.g., rogue states) possess WMD; Denial and deception complicate characterization of WMD facilities Terrorists and non-state actors seek WMD China modernizing conventional and nuclear forces; Taiwan a potential flash point Russia no longer an adversary, but uncertain future Since its publication in December of 2001, the logic, strategy and the fundamental assumptions of the NPR have been reviewed periodically and subjected to rigorous internal scrutiny, for example, in the 2004-2005 Strategic Capabilities Assessment. Based on the Defense Intelligence Agency’s assessment, the 2004-2005 Strategic Capabilities Assessment concluded that the NPR’s planning assumptions remain valid, although conditions are trending toward−if anything−a more stressing strategic landscape, for example, with respect to North Korea, Iran and nuclear proliferation. These same assumptions were revalidated by the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review. But the NPR was only a starting point for the transformation of U.S. strategic capabilities and concepts. The Office of the Secretary of Defense, USSTRATCOM, and the Services are working to develop detailed implementation plans and operational concepts. I would like to highlight some examples of our progress to date: 1. New missions have been assigned to USSTRATCOM beyond its continuing responsibility for strategic nuclear forces. These include: Global Strike−to include nuclear, non-nuclear and non-kinetic effects Integration of Missile Defense Space Operations Integration of Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence Offensive Information Operations, and Integrating and synchronizing DoD in Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction 2. We have made significant progress in several areas, for example: a. We have fielded an initial ballistic missile defense capability at Ft. Greely, Alaska, and expanded international cooperation and participation in our missile defense program; b. We are reducing U.S. nuclear forces to 1700-2200 operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads by 2012. We are on-track to meet our interim goal of 3800 warheads by 2007. We removed the last Peacekeeper ICBM from its silo in September of 2005, We completed the conversion to SSGNs of two of the four SSBNs that are being retired from strategic service; and We implemented a new plan for the nuclear stockpile that will cut the total number of active and inactive warheads nearly in half by 2012; c. We also are making progress in developing non-kinetic strike capabilities and improving planning, intelligence, and command and control capabilities that are needed to integrate New Triad capabilities effectively. 3. There are, however, areas where </span>we have made only limited progress<span style="font-size: 7pt;">; these include: </span>fielding prompt conventional capabilities for Global Strike, <span style="font-size: 7pt;">transforming the nuclear weapon inventory, and revitalizing the nuclear infrastructure. We need to make greater progress in these three areas in order to realize the broad mix of capabilities called for by the NPR. </span>Instead of the legacy Cold War strategic posture, with its reliance on high-yield, nuclear weapons<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> delivered by ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers to deter the Soviet Union, </span>we need to transform and strengthen our posture to enable us to tailor deterrence<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> against the full spectrum of post-Cold War threats. </span>This<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, in turn, </span>will require delivering on new capabilities that are credible both in terms of their impact on the decision-making of potential adversaries, and in the lethality of these capabilities against high-value, strategic targets. For example, in a regional crisis against an adversary armed with weapons of mass destruction, the credibility of our deterrent<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> may </span>turn on our ability to threaten assets<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> while minimizing collateral damage. These values and assets may include WMD, missiles, command and control, or leadership bunkers protected in hard and deeply buried facilities. </span>Conventional Global Strike capabilities are meant to augment the existing military options for holding such targets at risk, and expand the range of prompt, long-range strike options available to the President − currently limited to nuclear weapons<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Thus, rather than rejecting deterrence, </span>prompt, conventional Global Strike capabilities<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> are intended to </span>strengthen deterrence in the changed and evolving strategic environment<span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">As Secretary Rumsfeld emphasized in the Foreword to the NPR, our direction is designed to “improve our ability to deter attack,” while “reducing our dependence on nuclear weapons” to do so. The NPR does not reject deterrence in favor of “nuclear war-fighting,” nor does it “lower the nuclear threshold.” </span>By fielding a<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> New Triad of capabilities that includes </span>conventional Global Strike assets<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and defenses, and a responsive infrastructure, </span>we strengthen the overall credibility of our deterrent posture and maintain the nuclear threshold at an appropriately high level.By placing greater emphasis on advanced non-nuclear<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and defensive </span>capabilities<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, the NPR seeks to</span> increase the credibility of our<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> deterrent posture for many contingencies, </span>while reducing the emphasis on nuclear weapons in our strategic posture<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The broad array of New Triad </span>capabilities can better assure our allies<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and friends </span>that they should continue their reliance on the U.S. strategic deterrent<span style="font-size: 7pt;">–that they need not seek an alternative or independent nuclear capability for their security–</span>thereby strengthening our alliances and our supporting nonproliferation goals. At the same time, the more flexible and capable strategic posture <span style="font-size: 7pt;">that the New Triad represents</span> will <span style="font-size: 7pt;">help</span> dissuade <span style="font-size: 7pt;">potential </span>adversaries from investing in capabilities to challenge the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates, </span>and<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> help </span>deter aggression.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Pg. 4-8 </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Related to the last of the previous three potential applications is the counter-proliferation focus of the various national security documents covered earlier.</span>The expectation is that chemical or biological stockpiles as well as other critical targets are becoming hard and deeply buried targets requiring deep earth penetration. The C-ICBM is offered as a means to hold this target set at risk<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace working paper on counterproliferation options, the author notes the benefits of deep-earth penetration by ballistic missiles: “To further increase impact speed and thus penetration depth, intercontinental ballistic missiles</span>(ICBMs) or<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> submarine-launched ballistic missiles (</span>SLBMs) equipped with conventional penetrator warheads,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> rather than with nuclear weapons, </span>are the most promising option<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>Such missiles can easily achieve the necessary impact speed for maximum penetration<span style="font-size: 7pt;">; in fact, braking mechanisms will likely be necessary to ensure that their payload does not impact at speeds too high for the warhead to withstand. </span>Existing ICBMs can deliver one-ton payloads, implying that a single converted ICBM might be able to deliver several BLU- 116–type penetrators<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.”13 pg. 21-22 </span><br />

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. </span>While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. </span>There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. </span>With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Potentially worse than that, </span>bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE. Ironically, the Bush administration has just changed the U.S. nuclear doctrine to allow nuclear retaliation against threats upon allies by conventional weapons. The past doctrine allowed such use only as a last resort when our nation’s survival was at stake. Will the new policy also allow easier use of US bioweapons? How slippery is this slope? Against this tendency can be posed a rational alternative policy. </span>To preclude possibilities of human extinction, &quot;patriotism&quot; needs to be redefined to make humanity’s survival primary and absolute.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Even if we lose our cherished freedom, our sovereignty, our government or our Constitution, where there is life, there is hope. What good is anything else if humanity is extinguished? This concept should be promoted to the center of national debate.. For example, for sake of argument, suppose the ancient Israelites developed defensive bioweapons of mass destruction when they were enslaved by Egypt. Then suppose these weapons were released by design or accident and wiped everybody out? As bad as slavery is, extinction is worse. Our generation, our century, our epoch needs to take the long view. </span>We<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> truly </span>hold in our hands the precious gift of all future life.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Empires may come and go, but who are the honored custodians of life on earth? Temporal politicians? Corporate competitors? Strategic brinksmen? Military gamers? Inflated egos dripping with testosterone? How can any sane person believe that national sovereignty is more important than survival of the species? Now that extinction is possible, our slogan should be &quot;Where there is life, there is hope.&quot; No government, no economic system, no national pride, no religion, no political system can be placed above human survival. The egos of leaders must not blind us. The adrenaline and vengeance of a fight must not blind us. The game is over. If patriotism would extinguish humanity, then patriotism is the highest of all crimes.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The language of the current NSS is unambiguous. The US will do what it must to ensure its own security.</span> Developing an advanced long-range strike system will provide the President with an additional military option that is not hamstrung by access to foreign bases or unpredictable diplomatic wrangling<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Such a strike option<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> will not only help to ensure American security by exercising its capabilities when necessary, but also its very existence </span>will provide a substantial deterrent and coercive element in the diplomatic struggle to arrive at agreeable solutions without the actual use of force<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In 1997, while testifying before the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Procurement in support of additional B-2 procurement, Eliot Cohen, a widely respected expert on strategic studies, voiced the following opinion: </span>What deters potential opponents<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the United States </span>from acting contrary to our interests<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and policy? I would say, “</span>the knowledge that the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>has the capability to deliver military blows against which there is no defense, and which it has the will to use, even without the support of any other nation<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on earth.” . . . In the new age in which we find ourselves, such a characteristic is particularly desirable.19 Although Cohen’s testimony was for additional B-2s, the same argument can be applied even more strenuously for a new long-range strike system with increased capability against anti-access threats. </span>The effect long-range strike may have on an adversary’s strategic calculus cannot be ignored.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Herein may lay the true value of the long-range strike system—</span>its real worth lies in the strategic influence of its mere existence even more than its actual value when employed<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Although this carries the scent of nuclear deterrence, </span>long-range strikewill<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> perhaps </span>exceed the deterrent capability of nuclear weapons due to the increased likelihood of use, hence raising the credibility of the coercive element<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To sum up this section, it is evident there are still limitations to what the Air Force can presently do regarding global strike based on the current weapon system inventory and capabilities. A</span>ccess to foreign bases is a compelling concern and must not be ignored<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or marginalized and our national security strategy dictates improving our capabilities to preemptively strike an adversary posing a threat to our national security. In the words of a defense industry “think tank” analysis, “…</span>the U.S. will be best served by the creation of an agile, access-insensitive military force that can project sustained, precise, and survivable military power across great distances<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with little preparation or reliance on external political or military support.”20 With justification for long-range strike evident, this chapter will now examine the system options and capabilities. </span><br />

Hedging will be the optimal strategy for the U.S. military in the short-to-medium term, even in a world of<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> almost </span>inevitable budget cuts<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Hedging especially makes sense relevant given uncertainties about the security environment. </span>The defense officials who choose force structure and military strategy do not necessarily choose the wars<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a democracy like </span>the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>will fight<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Elected </span>officials<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> do the latter while in office, but they </span>fight with their predecessor’s militaries and fund militaries for their successors<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In contrast, unelected bureaucrats and officers do the bulk of force planning and training. </span>Rigging the game so that a future leader lacks the option of fighting <span style="font-size: 7pt;">a labor-intensive COIN campaign (as the U.S. military did in the post-Vietnam period) or </span>a state-to-state high tech war<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (if the United States chose to focus exclusively on COIN—an unlikely prospect for sure) </span>is a recipe for disaster. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">While it is important, as Secretary Gates argues, to fight, fund, and win the wars you are in, </span>the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates military </span>must<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> also </span>budget and plan for the future<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>It is important to avoid a situation where the U.S. military optimizes for conflicts that end up not being the most important ones <span style="font-size: 7pt;">because it deters some enemies while </span>creating vulnerabilities that other potential adversaries use to their advantage<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Concretely, George Kennan described the United States—and democracies in general—as prehistoric dinosaurs with very small brains, stupidly unable to anticipate and deal with problems until they become life-threatening but simultaneously capable of enormous destruction once a truly dangerous threat is upon them.49 This mirrors the classic American fallacy that there is one big threat, or type of enemy, that deserves attention to the exclusion of all others. Ironically, given the COIN community’s propensity to elevate irregular war over other forms of conflict, it is this strategic fallacy that led to the degradation of COIN capabilities after Vietnam in the first place. Given that </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates must be ready for future irregular wars but </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">must</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">also maintain and</span> strengthen its conventional warfighting capacity<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, it is entirely possible to have parts of the Army and Marine Corps optimized for COIN while optimizing the Navy and Air Forces for higher intensity engagements. This sort of division of labor makes sense given that </span>most foreseeable conventional contingencies are likely to rely heavily on naval and air assets<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, though ground assets will play an important role as well. Hoehn et al’s report for the RAND Corporation on the future of the American military offers one potential blueprint for adopting a more clear-cut division of labor scheme. They argue that U.S. ground forces should orient themselves primarily, though not exclusively, towards dealing with irregular challenges, while </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">the Navy and Air Force should primarily</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, though not exclusively, </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">devote themselves towards maintaining American power projection capabilities and conventional superiority over the global commons</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.50 Within the land services, good infantry and mechanized tactics, techniques and procedures are as necessary for fighting the Taliban as they were for fighting the Soviets. Adding crowd control and civil-military operations to the list of basic skills for infantry would never practically mean not training them how to operate against other conventionally trained infantry. The Chinese/Russians have tanks, and al Qaeda does not—but they do use vehicles. Calling in fire or using infantry weapons are pretty much the same tasks no matter the target. Some key questions for U.S. land forces involve doctrine, officer training, and procurement. Some members of the land warfare community have argued that the newest Operations manual (Manual 3-0) borrowed too heavily from COIN doctrine. This implies that all Army operations for the near future will be governed by principles and structures ideal for operating in an irregular war, specifically, Iraq.51 Many of the things that the Army should do to make these systems/processes better – for example, including culture in planning and assessment – should be done anyway, and in planning for every contingency, not just COIN. Not every part of every service has to do the same job—there are air assault divisions and mountain divisions in the Army, so why not have COIN-focused BCTs with advising specialists?52 Moreover, one outcome likely to be wasteful in a budgetary sense is if the Army fails to resolve its debate over its future and maximizes for both conventional operations and COIN. Neither will be necessary if the United States Navy cannot get Army units to a future conflict and the Air Force cannot protect them from air strikes. Fortunately, just as training troops to understand foreign cultures and other elements of the ‘‘soft’’ side of COIN are helpful for building the capabilities necessary to win conventional wars, many ‘‘high’’ technology elements essential for conventional wars, like rapid over-the-horizon strike capabilities, UAVs, satellite phones, etc., are also helpful for COIN and asymmetric warfare. Even asymmetric conflicts on the sea and in the air require conventional platforms—or at least the most advanced platforms. One example of investment overlap could be next-generation UAVs. UAVs based on similar research and development streams, might be useful both for the COIN role for which they have been praised and the fighter-replacement role. The Air Force may fight hard because of the way it will disrupt the its fighter pilot-dominant organizational hierarchy. In the meantime, the United States will still need carriers for power projection and to protect the flank of U.S. forces deployed in theater. Another example of the links between COIN capabilities and air and naval forces comes from the methods used by the American military to assist its units or Iraqi Security Forces when they call for help. Air-dropped precision guided munitions (PGMs) and UAVs have replaced indirect artillery in many cases since they are faster and more accurate. Over the last year, when Iraqi Security Forces have engaged insurgents without a massive U.S. land force component backing them up, or when they call for help, it is U.S. fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft that have played a decisive role. For example, in Basra, when Coalition Forces backed up Iraqi Security Forces who struggled to implement Operation Knights’ Charge, air support made an important difference. Finally, </span>investments in basic defense science are essential. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">As is logical, given that the United States is fighting two wars, increases in defense spending in this decade have gone mostly towards personnel, as well as operations and maintenance (O&amp;M). Between the ‘‘peace dividend’’ taken at the end of the Cold War and the budgetary focus of this decade, </span>investments in basic research and development for the weapons of the future has suffered<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. While the FY2009 budget contains an increase of 2 percent in the base DOD budget to $76.9 billion, current defense projections call for a 20 percent decrease in research and development from FY2009-2013, with the savings going into procurement for existing weapons systems.

In particular, funding for basic defense science—detached from systems close to production—is essential. While results-based funding helps ensure accountability, it also leads to a focus on incremental research that discourages the experimentation necessary to lead to breakthroughs. However, the FY2009 budget proposed only $11.5 billion in Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) funding, a decrease of 3 percent from FY2000.53 Conclusion At present, the dominant strands of defense strategy debates feature COIN advocates that wish to transform the American military to focus more on counterinsurgency and irregular wars and traditionalists who seek to return the American military to focusing exclusively on conventional wars.

<strong>10. Turn – PGS is crucial to credible deterrence – capabilities will be perceived</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Kerber &amp; Stein 09</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Co-Chairs of the Defense Science Board [Dr. Ronald Kerber (Visiting Professor at Darden Business School at the University of Virginia and Masters and Doctorate degrees in engineering science from California Institute of Technology) &amp; Dr. Robert Stein (Raytheon's Director of Advanced Programs), “Time Critical Conventional Strike from Strategic Standoff,” Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, March 2009]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The U.S. strategic deterrence and strike environment has changed as our adversaries and their tactics have changed. Terrorists and rogue nations as well as future potential peers are well aware that asymmetric tactics are proving very effective against our forces. In the past, a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) was a weapon of last resort for virtually all of the Nation’s primary adversaries – it now may be moving closer to the weapon of choice, at least for some. Terrorist leaders are more willing to take risks, tend to place much less value on the life of individuals, have much less to lose, and are somewhat protected by “statelessness.” Avowed tactics included massive targeting of innocents, martyrdom of “soldiers,” and operating within a civilian environment. Operational “fuzziness” makes Indications and Warnings (I&amp;W) much more difficult and/or fleeting. WMD technology is broadly available, and the cost of entry is much lower than for traditional, indigenously developed, nuclear weapons. At the same time rogue nations are aggressively pursuing nuclear weapon capability. Deterrence has become more elusive in terms of identifying and locating adversaries, understanding adversary values, and understanding what of the adversaries the United States (U.S.) can hold at risk. Our future global strategic strike capability must recognize today’s realities, be highly effective, quickly and easily usable, yet in many situations inflict minimal collateral damage while maintaining the threshold for nuclear weapons use at the high level we observe today. This all gives rise to the need for a prompt, conventional strike capability, deliverable to almost anyplace on the globe. Time critical conventional strike from long standoff ranges into restricted or denied territory has been an operational, policy, and acquisition challenge for a long time, and this topic appeared in many studies and reports as a hard problem for which no satisfactory solution appeared to be readily available. In situations in which time is not a factor and/or in which sufficient U.S. forces are deployed nearby, the U.S. has demonstrated its ability to strike at identified threats effectively. However, in situations in which time is a factor and no nearby forces are present, if Courses of Action (COA) are requested, only two options are currently available; nuclear Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Systems (ICBMs)/Submarine/Sea-Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBMs) or no military action. Many circumstances have been postulated in which a standoff strike capability could be critical to defeating a threat to U.S. interests; countering terrorism, countering WMD, countering proliferation, countering an emerging disruptive capability to name a few. While a weapon system or systems may be a critical component for a military option, there are also key enablers that must be effective if a time critical strike from standoff is to be successful. Foremost among the enablers is a robust Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that can provide warning, target identification and target location while functioning within the adversary’s decision cycle to provide positive warning, localization and identification that meets the national decision maker’s threshold to proceed with a strike. An integrated Command, Control, and Communication (C3) is a second key enabler that is critical to effectively providing national leadership with a prompt global strike option. Pg. 1-2 </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">Consider first the most likely case—a conventionally armed ballistic missile launch directed at a country other than Russia or China. Currently,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">there is no reason to believe that any foreign country other than Russia has a warning system that could detect such a launch. Assuming that Russia would detect the launch, the warning system would also likely have sufficient tracking to conclude in a few minutes that the target was not in Russian territory.

Because of flight tests and space launches, Russia</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">, like the United States,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">is accustomed to detecting and monitoring missiles and rockets after launch to establish their trajectories and confirm that whatever they are, they are not attacks directed at their own country.

The warning signs and leading indicators for a catastrophic collision between orbital debrisand satellites<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or manned spacefl1 ight missions </span>are all around us. If significant strides are not made within the next 5 years to clear and remove orbital debris it could result in the loss of satellites and the death of space crew<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span>if something isn‘t done to better protect space assets now it could lead to adversaries exploiting vulnerabilities through various kinetic, nuclear, and cyber attacks causing satellites to become inoperative<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This would lead to the generation of new debris which will further compound the orbital debris problem. The effects of this would be felt worldwide with the disruption of communications, internet access, navigation, military surveillance, environmental research, and the banking industry. </span>The best way to avoid these consequences is to continue to harden satellites, improve space monitoring, and develop backups/alternatives to satellite capabilities.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As mentioned, the US must also continue to partner with other countries to implement solutions of clearing and reducing the proliferation of orbital debris. The world can change the potential alarming future of a catastrophic collision from orbital debris, but the time to act is now.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Natural resources are gradually declining and humans are looking for alternative means, either in the form of resources or in the form of areas to extract from. Space exploration is one of the key subjects in this aspect. Looking for a distant planet which supports human life form is a back up plan, in case the search for alternative resources fail or some catastrophe takes this earth away from us. It is said that practice makes us perfect but that notion seems to be failing in the case of space travel or alternatively it can be put it in a way that the hazards of practice are restricting the very act of space travel. Over the past 40 years since space exploration started, abandoned and obsolete man made objects have been left in orbit around the earth; these objects include rocket stages, redundant satellites, coolants released by nuclear powered engines, paint flakes and even solid rocket fuel slag. Although currently it is a manageable threat, it can seriously hinder space exploration if it is not properly dealt with. Fortunately different kind of steps have been taken to overcome this space pollution and the United States military and NASA both have agencies that are monitoring the space debris and are trying to find out a workable solution to tackle them. </span>Different<span style="background-color: yellow;">schemes for cleaning up space debris have been presented but Russia is the first country to plan a real project and invest $2 billion</span>on this program. Russia’s space corporation,<span style="background-color: yellow;">Energia, announced a program to capture</span>some of the thousands of pieces of dangerous<span style="background-color: yellow;">debris</span>that threaten the future of space technology. A hefty amount of $2 billion will be invested to building<span style="background-color: yellow;">a</span>special<span style="background-color: yellow;">space pod</span>which<span style="background-color: yellow;">will grab around 600 defunct satellites and will push them from the orbit</span>in a hope that they will burn on their own after entering the earth’s atmosphere.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This project will help to reopen the orbits which were previously closed due to severe pollution of debris above. The pod will travel in space through nuclear propulsion and it has an ion drive with which it gently pushes the scrap out of the orbit. The testing of the pod will be completed in 2020 and a further three years will be needed to bring it to a fully functional form. After completion it has a life span of 15 years, which means it can perform the task of cleaning for 15 whole years, effectively reducing the size of space debris. Energia is also working on similar ion technology to build an interceptor aircraft which can identify and encounter the incoming comet by derailing it from its original path by changing its trajectory so that it misses earth and burns in air.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Q. </span>Is it true that launching the Space Shuttle creates a local ozone hole<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and that the Space Shuttle releases more chlorine than all industrial uses worldwide? A. </span>No, that is not true. NASA has studied the effects of exhaust from the Space Shuttle's solid rocket motors on the ozone<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In a 1990 report to Congress, NASA found that the chlorine released annually in the stratosphere (assuming launches of nine Shuttle missions and six Titan IVs -- which also have solid rocket motors -- per year) would be about 0.25 percent of the total amount of halocarbons released annually worldwide (0.725 kilotons by the Shuttle 300 kilotons from all sources). The report concludes that </span>Space Shuttle launches<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the current rate </span>pose no significant threat to the ozone layer and will have no lasting effect on the atmosphere. The exhaust plume from the Shuttle represents a trivial fraction of the atmosphere, and even if ozone destruction occurred within the initial plume, its global impact would be inconsequential<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

The ozone layer that shields us from the sun's harmful rays has depleted by a record 40 percent over the Arctic<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, experts have said. </span>The long, cold winter and lingering CFCs<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (chlorofluorocarbons) </span>in the atmosphere have resulted in its 40 percent plunge<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, they said. </span>The record loss has caused alarm because it allows more harmful ultraviolet (UV) light to reach the Earth's surface, raising the odds of sunburn, skin cancer and eye damage<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Daily Mail reported on its website Wednesday, citing experts. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Wednesday revealed that ozone column loss had reached 40 percent this spring. A WMO spokesperson said: </span>'Depletion of the ozone has reached an unprecedented level over the Arctic this spring because of the continuing presence of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and a very cold winter in the stratosphere. </span>'If the ozone depleted area moves away from the pole and towards lower latitudes one can expect increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation as compared to the normal for the season. 'Some crops and forms of marine life can also suffer adverse effects.'<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The highest ozone loss previously recorded over the Arctic was about 30 percent and occurred in several seasons over the past 15 years, the WMO said. </span>Any increase in UV radiation over lower latitudes away from the Arctic could affect parts of Canada, the Nordic countries, Russia and Alaska in the US. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">UV-B rays have been linked to skin cancer, cataracts and damage to the human immune system. </span>The record ozone loss over the Arctic comes despite the 'very successful' Montreal Protocol aimed at cutting production and consumption of ozone-destroying chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (CFCs) and halons, the Mail reported. The substances were once present in refrigerators, spray cans and fire extinguishers, but have been phased out.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Even considering these weaknesses, </span>near-space assets can form an additional layer of persistence between satellites and air-breathers, complementing both and making the combination of systems more survivable and redundant<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> by their presence. With on-station times proposed to be on the order of months or years, they can stay and stare for much longer than any envisioned airborne asset could ever hope. They get their lift from buoyancy, not from fuel. They move slowly enough and at such high altitudes that overcoming drag requires a minimal draw on their power supplies. Their large footprints are not offset by the extremely fast orbital speeds and short pass times of satellites. </span>They improve upon the long-term persistence traditionally provided by satellites while providing the on-call responsiveness of airborne assets<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. They can be on-station when and where a battlefield commander needs them.

<strong>3. Solvency deficit - Near space technology isn’t ready yet – ORS is key in the interim to prevent preemption</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Third, the Air Force intends to establish a program office in 2008, based on demonstrations of Combat SkySat 9 3 But </span>we should delay establishing such an office for near space until the commercial and civil communities bring the technology to maturity, which will take a number of years<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Since near-space systems in the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap, 2005-2030 operate in the air regime, the Aeronautical Systems Center's Reconnaissance Office would be the best program office-an established organization that manages the Air Force's UAV programs. </span>As stated earlier, AFSPC appears to have an internal competition between near space and ORS. Both initiatives offer significant organic capabilities to the theater commander. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">The fourth recommendation calls for using ORS conferences to vigorously debate the capabilities of near space versus those of tactical satellites. Even with a significant level of support and the potential for early success, it may prove difficult for AFSPC to receive procurement authority for ORS capabilities due to fiscal realities. However, the command must consider the United States' space race with Asia and Europe. Investing in lower-cost access to space as well as lower operations from space offers a much greater return. AFSPC's Detachment 12 can continue as the command's virtual program office, coordinating efforts from the Air Force Research Laboratory and Space Battlelab. Detachment 12 can monitor commercial, civil, and Missile Defense Agency development efforts until a controllable vehicle can operate successfully at altitudes at or above 100,000 feet. </span>It may take five to seven years to attain this level of maturity. Until then the primary focus should remain on ORS lift and operations<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. One finds a good many resource issues with space even in doctrine. Air Staff experts disapproved using the term near space in space-operations doctrine, evidently because they feared that such inclusion, combined with the overselling of its capabilities and potential in the press, might drive unwanted resources decisions. </span>94 Near space must wait for the next decade<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, when the DOD fields sister services' recapitalization and current Air Force investments.</span><br />

<em><strong>10. Turn – Near Space causes tech delays and cost overruns that crowd out other ISR systems, undermining readiness</strong></em><br />

<br />
The need for intelligence gathering and target acquisition is as old as warfare itself. In the last century<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft as well as </span>satellites performed this function<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Having launched new ISR systems such as high-altitude-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles (HAE UAV) during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, the DOD began to realize these key characteristics. </span>However, it also continued to experience C4ISR shortfall<span style="font-size: 8pt;">s, including those involving tactical beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) communications on the move, persistent ISR, redforce tracking, change detection, detection of mines and improvised explosive devices, and all-weather imaging.4 </span>To solve these shortfalls, Gen John P. Jumper<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, former chief of staff of the Air Force (CSAF), tasked</span> Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) with the responsibility of developing, fielding, and executing tactical and operationally responsive space (ORS) capabilities near and through space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. AFSPC created the Joint Warfighting Space (JWS) initiative, based on combatant commanders' feedback that requested improvement in the tailoring and responsiveness of space.5 The JWS team focused on the near-space realm since it offered the prospect of achieving spacelike capabilities at lower cost. Moreover, AFSPC claims that future near-space systems will have BLOS communications and ISR persistence measured in days, weeks, and months.6 The command anticipates solving this need by operating communications and ISR payloads from near-space balloons and airships. 7</span>Will near space be the final solution to persistence<span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Should AFSPC lead the near-space effort? </span>This author urges caution before proceeding. Near space is not a panacea for difficulties with BLOS communications and persistent ISR; in fact, it may actually exacerbate current problems<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. An examination of Iraqi Freedom provides an overview of the current transformation of military operations and the capabilities required by the joint force commander (JFC). Like past transformations, this one demands C4ISR. Lessons learned from Iraqi Freedom also show the need for near-space capabilities. Effects-based operations, network-centric warfare, and rapid maneuver demand BLOS communications and persistent ISR. Admittedly, near space may offer a lower-cost solution than other capabilities. Analysis of the technical and cost challenges of utilizing near space as compared to HAE UAVs provides an estimate of future investment by AFSPC. </span>Despite the numerous potential benefits of near space, the associated technical hurdles are more substantial than those faced by UAVs (thus generating greater development and unit costs). In addition, overselling near-space capabilities before solving these problems could lead to cancellation of other AFSPC programs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This paper compares near-space vehicles with HAE UAVs only for the purpose of evaluating cost and technical concerns. Its focus remains on assessing near space's contribution to BLOS communications and persistent ISR against all parts that comprise those systems. Shortfalls lie more within processing, exploitation, and dissemination. Smaller investments such as training make a greater contribution to solving the &quot;intent&quot; of persistence. Finally, this paper offers recommendations on how AFSPC should pursue near space.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">*Near-space is the relatively unutilized region above where most conventional aircraft fly and below where satellites can operate, generally defined to be 65,000 feet in altitude to the edge of space.

<br />
Because the use of weapons in or from space can lead to the loss or impairment of satellites of all major space powers, all of whom depend on satellites<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for military and economic security, we believe </span>it is possible to craft a regime based on self-interest to avoid turning space into a shooting gallery<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>This outcome is far more difficult to achieve if major space powers engage in the flight-testing and deployment of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> dedicated ASAT </span>weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or space-to-Earth weapons. We therefore argue that </span>it would be most unwise for the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates, as the spacepower with the most to lose from the impairment of its satellites, </span>to initiate these steps<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Similar restraint, however, needs to be exercised by other major spacefaring nations, some of which may feel that the preservation and growth of U.S. spacepower are a threat, or that it is necessary to hold U.S. space assets at risk. The United States is therefore obliged to clarify to others the risks of initiating actions harmful to U.S. satellites without prompting other spacefaring nations to take the very steps we seek to avoid. Consequently, </span>a preservation and growth strategy for U.S. spacepower also requires a hedging strategy because, even if the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>makes prudent decisions in space, others may still make foolish choices. Hedging <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The exercise of restraint from using weapons in space is not easy for the world's most powerful nation or for other nations fearing catastrophic losses that they believe might be averted by disabling U.S. satellites. How, then, might U.S. spacepower influence the decisions of other nations to leave vulnerable satellites alone? We maintain that a prudent space posture would clarify America's ability to respond purposefully if another nation interferes with, disables, disrupts, or destroys U.S. satellites, without being the first to take the actions that we wish others to refrain from taking. Thus, our proposed hedging strategy would not include the flight-testing and deployment of dedicated ASAT or on-orbit weapons because such steps would surely be emulated by others and would increase risks to vital U.S. space assets. Whatever preparations the United States takes to hedge against attacks on its satellites must be calibrated to maximize freedom of action and access in space. Hedging moves that create an environment where the flight-testing and deployment of space weapons would be a common occurrence would thus be contrary to U.S. military and economic security. </span>Responsible hedges by the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>include increased situational awareness, redundancy, and cost-effective hardening of satellites and their links.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The strongest hedge the United States possesses is its superior conventional military capabilities, including long-range strike and special operations capabilities. Since an attack on a satellite can be considered an act of war, the United States could respond to such an attack by targeting the ground links and launch facilities of the offending nation or the nation that harbors a group carrying out such hostile acts. Far more punishing responses might be applicable. A hedging strategy is also likely to include ground-based research and development into space weapons technologies, activities that are under way in major spacefaring nations. The demonstration of dual- or multi-use space technologies that could be adapted, if needed, to respond to provocative acts would constitute another element of a responsible hedging strategy. Such technologies could include on-orbit rendezvous, repair, and refueling technologies and other proximity operations. These activities are also essential for expanded scientific and commercial use of space and would be key enabling technologies for long-duration missions such as the return to the Moon and the exploration of Mars. A prudent hedging strategy would also align U.S. military doctrine and declaratory policy with America's national security and economic interest in preventing weapons in space and ASAT tests. </span>In the context of a proactive Air Force counterspace operations doctrine and official disdain for negotiations that might constrain U.S. military options in space, the hedging strategy we advocate might be perceived as preliminary steps toward the weaponization of space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which we would oppose. </span>Wise hedging strategies would also be accompanied by constructive diplomatic initiatives. The flight-testing of multipurpose technologies, the possession of dominant power projection capabilities, and the growing residual U.S. military capabilities to engage in space warfare should provide a sufficient deterrent posture against a &quot;space Pearl Harbor.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;4 These capabilities would also clarify that the United States possesses the means to defend its interests in a competition that other major space powers claim not to want, as well as to react in a prompt and punishing way against hostile acts against U.S. space assets. If all responsible spacefaring nations adhere to a &quot;no further ASAT test&quot; regime, and an adversary still carries out a &quot;space Pearl Harbor&quot; by using military capabilities designed for other purposes, the United States has the means to respond in kind. U.S. latent or residual space warfare capabilities exceed those of other spacefaring nations and are growing with the advent of ballistic missile defenses. We maintain that the existence of such capabilities constitutes another element of a hedging strategy, while providing further support for our contention that dedicated ASAT tests and deployments are both unwise and unnecessary.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Setting aside such semantic quibbling, the real challenge now facing the United States is how best to deter, deny, and dissuade the Chinese, and other emerging space powers, from hostile actions in space. One approach would involve diplomacy and international discussions. For some time, arms-control advocates have been pushing for agreements to ban weapons in space. More recently, </span>in light of the changed circumstances brought on by China's tests, the focus has shifted to securing &quot;codes of conduct&quot; and devising &quot;rules of the road&quot; to regulate how nation-states behave in space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Sympathetically interpreting China's recent tests as an understandable reaction to U.S. policies, </span>arms-control advocates have characterized American actions in space as dangerous and provocative, and have condemned the United States for refusing to enter into international negotiations. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Only a treaty, they argue, can restrain the Americans' aggressive tendencies. As one arms-control advocate told the Washington Post, the Chinese were responding to U.S. space policies and sending a signal to the Pentagon: &quot;We can play this game, too, and we can play it dirtier than you.&quot; Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, told the Post that the United States must initiate &quot;an international agreement to ban the development, testing, and deployment of space weapons and anti-satellite systems.&quot; This attitude--</span>blaming America for other countries' actions and demanding that the United States preemptively disarm itself--is reminiscent of the old Cold War debates over nuclear weapons<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Also strikingly familiar to students of the Cold War is Beijing's hypocritical hand-wringing over the specter of an arms race in, and the weaponization of, outer space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Michael Pillsbury has pointed out, &quot;</span>While China has publicly assumed a leadership position in international activities to ban space weapons, there is an active group within China not only advocating the weaponization of space but also putting forth specific proposals for implementation of a Chinese space-based weapons program.&quot; Even while the PLA was successfully executing at least two anti-satellite tests, the Chinese diplomatic corps was raging against the supposed weaponization of space by the United States.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At a U.N. conference on space in 2006, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official, Tang Guoqiang, complained about actions in space that could &quot;cause serious consequences&quot;: &quot;The policy of a certain country [i.e., the United States] to test, deploy and use weapons and weapon systems in outer space [is] disconcerting. Outer space is the common heritage of mankind and [the] weaponization of outer space is bound to trigger off [an] arms race in outer space, thus rendering outer space a new arena for military confrontation.&quot; Even after the January 2007 ASAT test, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official insisted that countries &quot;opposed to the weaponization of space&quot; should &quot;join hands to realize this goal.&quot; </span>Existing treaties allow actions to protect and defend national interests in space. Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty forbids signatories <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(including the United States and China) </span>from placing nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on the Moon<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and prohibits the testing of weapons, conduct of maneuvers, or construction of fortifications on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Since October 1967, when the treaty went into force, nearly every U.S. president has interpreted its requirements in such a way as to explicitly allow the development, operation, and maintenance of the space-control capabilities needed to ensure freedom of action in space and to deny such freedom of action to adversaries. During successive administrations of both political parties, the National Security Council has interpreted the treaty as not barring the deployment of space-based missile defenses or other systems to perform space-control missions. Work to draft new treaties continues apace. </span>China and Russia have been spearheading international efforts to construct a framework to govern space. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) process at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament calls for formal negotiations to prohibit the placement of weapons in orbit or on celestial bodies. </span>But whatever shreds of credibility this international process had were destroyed by the recent Chinese tests. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Another diplomatic tack contemplated by those opposed to &quot;weaponizing space&quot; is the adoption of </span>multilateral codes of conduct<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To a certain extent, such norms will develop organically on their own, as the growing interdependence between economic and security interests forces government and commercial satellite operators to cooperate, and as Washington increasingly coordinates its space activities with military and civil space authorities in allied and friendly nations. Over time, new norms for shared space situational awareness, debris mitigation, and orbital traffic management may emerge among responsible space-faring nations. But such norms </span><span style="background-color: yellow;">make no sense if the parties have no</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">t</span> first built up trust. And if such norms are externally imposed, they will be nothing more than unverifiable arms control agreements in camouflage. Absent the ability to ascertain or enforce compliance, a code-of-conduct rule regime will be weak and, more likely than not, ineffectual<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>A rules system for space between potential adversaries that relies on voluntary compliance and lacks viable punitive measures will be a hollowone.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Nor, for that matter, would an international treaty &quot;banning&quot; anti-satellite testing be enforceable or verifiable; the ignominious record of enforcing and verifying treaties prohibiting activities on Earth should be proof enough of that.) </span>The chief failing of the diplomatic approach to dealing with the new reality of space weapons is that it is blind to the reason a potential adversary like China would seek access to space in the first place--namely, the desire to be able to inflict a crippling blow against U.S. military and economic might by decapitating its surveillance and communications abilities. Those pushing for a new treaty or a code of conduct have yet to explain why China would abandon capabilities that threaten the &quot;soft underbelly&quot; of American military power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The Chinese regime clearly aspires to develop such capabilities; there is little reason to believe it would negotiate them away. The United States should resist calls for such futile diplomatic efforts<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">1. Introduction </span>Maritime security has been a hot subject<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the field of maritime arena. People and organizations from all over the world are trying to find methods and apply strategies that will enforce passive or sometimes active measures, in order to ensure maritime safety in both territorial and international waters. Countries, specifically in the Western world, have created internationally recognized organizations and signed worldwide accepted contracts and agreements, to utilize allied strategies to promote maritime security in a global level. </span>Vigilance is a priority, especially when the sea lines of communication<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (SLOC) </span>are the ways<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> where </span>terrorists use in order to transfer any type of Weapons of Mass Destruction, such as biological or radioactive materials.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Therefore, the Naval Postgraduate School’s CENETIX laboratory along with MIO Testbed, is attempting to explore solutions that are going to be pivotal for the global maritime security. </span>In this paper we describe all the possible measures that we can apply through Pico satellite space based solutions in order to improve the reach-back capabilities of our collaborative systems and increase readiness when dealing with the transfer of Weapons of Mass Destruction.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The following analysis will be based on </span>Pico satellite solutions<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that we </span>can<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> use in order to </span>search, identify, track and tag hazardous materials that may cause a potential risk to maritime security.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Maritime situational awareness is an issue that incurs a lot of dynamic discussions worldwide, but </span>until recently there has been no specific resolutions that can be used in a real maritime warfare situation.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The experiments will start and end in the space domain due to the fact that </span>space is by far the most efficient area to apply new technologies that need to be shared worldwide through operation centers.Micro, Nano and Pico satellite solutions will be reported as the primary means of applying reach-back technologies in the maritime domain<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (for example satellites with AIS systems), but at the end the Pico Tubesat satellite will be incorporated on scenarios that are applied in the maritime environment. </span>Tubesat is a new and promising Pico-satellite solution through which we can transfer and share valuable information to ships or network centers.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There are important restrictions and limitations, but all these will be assessed and there will be a final estimation on how easy, fast and cost-effective the use of the commercial and available Pico satellite is to the problem of tracking and tagging WMD materials through the sea lines worldwide. </span>Through these series of space experiments with the Tubesat satellites, we would like to generate the capability of transferring information back and forth, from the scene of action to a central node, so as to provide a key solution to those who deal on a daily basis with maritime warfare and the need to search on board merchant vessels for the existence of illegal trafficking of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Tubesat will be a critical part in our MIO Testbed for conducting the experiments.<br />

<strong>Terrorism causes nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Ayson 10</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Robert, Professor of Strategic Studies, Director of Strategic Studies: New Zealand, Senior Research Associate with Oxford’s Centre for International Studies. “After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects. Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, Volume 33, Issue 7, July 2010, pages 571-593)</span><br />
<br />
Washington's early response to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own soil might also raise the possibility of an unwanted (and nuclear aided) confrontation with Russia and/or China<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, </span>in the noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist nuclear attack, the U.S. president might be expected to place the country's armed forces, including its nuclear arsenal, on a higher stage of alert. In such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, it is just possible that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to use force (and possibly nuclear force) against them<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In that situation, </span>the temptations to preempt such actions might grow<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, although it must be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response. </span>As part of its initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism (as discussed earlier) Washington might decide to order a significant conventional (or nuclear) retaliatory or disarming attack against the leadership of the terrorist group and/or states seen to support that group. Depending on the identity and especially the location of these targets, Russia and/or China might interpret such action as being far too close for their comfort, and potentially as an infringement on their spheres of influence and even on their sovereignty<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One far-fetched but perhaps not impossible scenario might stem from a judgment in Washington that some of the main aiders and abetters of the terrorist action resided somewhere such as Chechnya, perhaps in connection with what Allison claims is the “Chechen insurgents' … long-standing interest in all things nuclear.”42 </span>American pressure on that part of the world would almost certainly raise alarms in Moscow that …might require a degree of advanced consultation from Washington that the latter found itself unable or unwilling to provide<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>Bioweapons break out leads to extinction</strong><br />

<br />
Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. </span>While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. </span>There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. </span>With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Potentially worse than that, </span>bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE. Ironically, the Bush administration has just changed the U.S. nuclear doctrine to allow nuclear retaliation against threats upon allies by conventional weapons. The past doctrine allowed such use only as a last resort when our nation’s survival was at stake. Will the new policy also allow easier use of US bioweapons? How slippery is this slope? Against this tendency can be posed a rational alternative policy. </span>To preclude possibilities of human extinction, &quot;patriotism&quot; needs to be redefined to make humanity’s survival primary and absolute.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Even if we lose our cherished freedom, our sovereignty, our government or our Constitution, where there is life, there is hope. What good is anything else if humanity is extinguished? This concept should be promoted to the center of national debate.. For example, for sake of argument, suppose the ancient Israelites developed defensive bioweapons of mass destruction when they were enslaved by Egypt. Then suppose these weapons were released by design or accident and wiped everybody out? As bad as slavery is, extinction is worse. Our generation, our century, our epoch needs to take the long view. </span>We<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> truly </span>hold in our hands the precious gift of all future life.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Empires may come and go, but who are the honored custodians of life on earth? Temporal politicians? Corporate competitors? Strategic brinksmen? Military gamers? Inflated egos dripping with testosterone? How can any sane person believe that national sovereignty is more important than survival of the species? Now that extinction is possible, our slogan should be &quot;Where there is life, there is hope.&quot; No government, no economic system, no national pride, no religion, no political system can be placed above human survival. The egos of leaders must not blind us. The adrenaline and vengeance of a fight must not blind us. The game is over. If patriotism would extinguish humanity, then patriotism is the highest of all crimes.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Third, </span>the European nations that are party to the Code of Conduct are allies<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and friends </span>of the U.S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is axiomatic that </span>there is no need to negotiate arms limitation agreements with allies and friends. The chief threats to the U.S. regarding space are China and Russia.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> It is clear that in negotiating with the European Union, the Obama Administration will make the Europeans surrogates for China and Russia precisely because the Europeans are not seen as a threat to U.S. interests. As a practical matter, a code of conduct with European nations that limits U.S. military space operations will do so across the board. </span>Neither China nor Russia will be bound by the Code of Conduct, but the U.S. will be by its obligations to the Europeans.In this context, the Code of Conduct will be a one-sided agreement that provides a direct advantage to China and Russia.<br />

<strong>9. The Code Fails – it is too vague and doesn’t have any enforcement</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
Few will argue that addressing debris, avoiding accidents, and managing space traffic are unimportant concerns. Indeed, managing each is important for the continued exploitation of space. When evaluating the Code of Conduct, however, these issues need to be separated from the Code.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The only judgments that matter are whether the Code is the most effective way to address those topics. Because </span>the Code is simply a set of high-level, vague commitments, considerable work is required to operationalize its meanings. In many cases, those discussions already are ongoing and the Code does not necessarily contribute positively to them. In those cases where additional discussion is required, other models to spur international discussion exist and have a proven record of success. The Code is neither essential nor necessarily the most effective way to achieve the desired ends. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Importance of Penalties: Verifying and Enforcing the Code </span>Without punishment, do rules matter? Some proponents of the Code claim the creation of rules is sufficient because their mere existence allows the identification of rule breakers. That is true, but for what purpose? If there is no way to punish a rule-breaker, the regime of rules lacks credibility.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Similarly, rule breakers have to be identified or, put another way, compliance with the Code has to be verifiable. Neither verification nor enforcement is a priority for the EU Code.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yet it should be noted that </span>there are<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> some </span>obstacles to having substantial cooperation in space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. First, as many have noted, </span>collaboration among nations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> does not necessarily contribute to cost savings. Rather, it sometimes</span> causes budget overruns and delays<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even if one can expect cost reductions, space-related activities still entail a lot of costs. </span>Some countries may therefore hesitate to collaborate and prefer continued reliance on the USA or commercial services.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Second, </span>the future of the ongoing reform of the US export control system is uncertain<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> while the domestic political scene in the USA remains cloudy. Lastly, </span>some American lawmakers have voiced concerns that even civil space cooperation with China may strengthen Chinese military capabilities.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">26 These are the issues which need to be considered when promoting international cooperation. </span><br />

The so-called 'Rumsfeld Space Commission' they wrote: &quot;is perhaps most well known for suggesting that unless the United States took threats of space attack seriously, it could not avoid a &quot;Space Pearl Harbor.&quot;* BUSH SIGNED CLAIM TO THE WHOLE UNIVERSE Hardly any of those writers - like most people on earth - know, that when they are watching the sun, the moon* or the universe for instance, they are looking at what the United States claims is its property. Because, after signing away more human rights and laws than ever in history, former US 'emperor' George Bush signed another unbelievable law. On October 18, 2006, 'front man' George Bush for his bosses by law officially was claiming space. The whole universe for the U.S. and its ruling criminal cartel.* This science-fiction claim - violating all treaties concerning space, like the 'Outer Space Treaty of 1967 - was, as Bush said, &quot;to be enforced by a new military service, the U.S. Space Forces.&quot; And again US 'gunboat diplomacy' is to order other nations to support the inhuman US policy, or... And so the moon was bombed.* It will take some time to know what else they have been up to, and what those criminals have done to space this far. But that the universe is used and abused for more power and profit for the criminal cartel is quite clear. This move again fits the malignant global picture, and represents another disturbing step towards total world subjugation by the US' cartel managers. A mentally sick cabal, only motivated by imperialism and global US military expansionism. Dominance of as big a chunk of the world and its population, by fear and through genocides by the cartel's war machine. And they just go on with their arms race in space, as I wrote at that time. And the secret cargo the X-37B has aboard, may be what was earlier described, in August 17, 2005. The source for this 'Mene Tekel' article, is 'Power and Interest News Report' (PINR), which - according to my experience - is an unwashed mouthpiece for the nefarious Pentagon and malignant Washington criminal cartel.* That actually makes the article a 'must read', because it - again - clearly indicates why 'they' and theur sold and bribed Dr. Strangeloves must be stopped at any price, before they kill us all.

While the implementation of space weapons is likely to increase the capability gap between Washington and other powers at first, a broader vision reveals dangers involved in the move that could affect U.S. interests, for it will likely trigger off determined reactions by its competitors. Competitor states could successfully deploy a small number of low cost orbital weapons, thus forcing the U.S. to design an extremely expensive space defense system. At the moment, a space weaponization policy may generate more troubles than advantages for Washington. WASHINGTON'S TURN TOWARD SPACE MILITARIZATION The Pentagon's plans to militarize space have definitely emerged. In mid-May 2005, the U.S. Air Force formally asked President George W. Bush to issue a presidential directive that allows Washington to deploy defensive and offensive weapons into orbit. Formally, the new directive is necessary to replace a precedent decree (PDD-NSC-49 - National Space Policy) issued by the Clinton administration which forbids the indiscriminate militarization of space. While the decree has not yet been issued, speculations over the Pentagon's move already hit the news. After the 2002 unilateral U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, worries were raised about Washington's possible start of such a program, for it could transform space into a new battlefield. The U.S. Air Force request, coupled with the April 2005 launch of the XSS-11 orbital micro-satellite, increased the concerns of observers and world powers. XSS-11 is in fact specifically designed to disturb other states' military/reconnaissance or communication satellites. A discontinuance of U.S. traditional policy about the restricted (e.g. peaceful) use of space could engender a new arms race - which appears economically and technologically challenging and way beyond many states' reach. GLOBAL STRIKE AND RODS FROM GOD On the technological level, the Pentagon's planning is in the advanced stage: some projects - aimed at space weaponization - have already been in place for some time. Among the (partially known) Pentagon's new plans, the two most interesting projects are the &quot;Global Strike&quot; program and the &quot;Rods from God&quot; program. Global Strike involves the employment of military space planes capable of carrying about 500 kg (1100 lbs) of high-precision weapons (with a circular error probability less than 3 meters) with the primary use of striking enemy military bases and command and control facilities in any point of the world. The main strength of military space planes is the ability to reach any spot on the globe within 45 minutes. This is a short period of time that could provide U.S. forces with a formidable quick reaction capability, as opposed to the enemy's subsequent inability to organize any effective defense. Such a weapon's primary target would be the enemy's strategic forces and - according to U.S. Air Force sources widely quoted in the press - the Pentagon is inclined to give priority to this project. One of the main reasons, these sources say, is that the Pentagon itself - after spending over US$100 billion - has finally admitted its failure to create an infallible earth-based anti-missile system to protect the American soil from ballistic strikes. The U.S. Air Force often underscores the space plane's wide operational spectrum. In fact, its utilization encompasses that of a strategic weapon as well as that of its defensive uses of neutralizing nuclear missiles; it would have the ability to target and eliminate militant and terrorist leaders. The space plane could also be employed to suppress long-range air defenses, thanks to its high mobility, hyper-fast deployment and its immunity from the defenses of its opponents. Other uses could be envisaged in the Integrated Air Defense System, as well as surveillance tasks. Moreover, space planes could be easily deployed to support the U.S. Army's rapid reaction force and units of Marines during power projection operations and redeployment phases. RODS FROM GOD &quot;Rods from God&quot; is the evolution of a 1980s program. Basically, it consists of orbiting platforms stocked with metal tungsten rods around 6.1 meters long (20 feet) and 30 cm (one foot) in diameter that could be satellite-guided to targets anywhere on the earth within minutes, for the rods would move at over 11,000 km/hr (6,835 mph). This weapon exploits kinetic energy to cause an explosion the same magnitude of that of an earth-penetrating nuclear weapon, but with no radioactive fall-out. The system would function due to two satellites, one of which would work as a communications platform, while the other would contain an arsenal of tungsten rods. Each of the satellites would be seven meters long (23 feet) and its diameter would be approximately 30 cm (one foot). However, serious problems would arise if the Pentagon begins the operational phase - especially from a financial perspective. Some studies maintain that Rods from God could be fully operational in ten years. The targets of the rods would be much more restricted than those of Global Strike. Their main targets remains ballistic missiles stockpiled in hardened sites, or orbital devices and satellite systems deployed by other powers - according to the counter-space operation doctrine. Rods from God can, however, be employed to strike targets in desert areas - be they hardened sites or concentrated hostile forces. Its devastating striking power does not allow such a weapon to be used for other missions, if unsustainable collateral damage is to be avoided. Other projects - which often look like a revisited version of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative's (S.D.I.) programs - could also be undertaken, such as space mirrors satellites redirecting laser beams from earth against any orbit or surface target and satellites that send out radio waves with a high range in power and breadth. PROBLEMS The White House will face several problems if it wants to pursue the ambitious project of space militarization consisting of both offensive and defensive weapons. The first point is the political issue. </span>International reactions to U.S. plans have already appeared<span style="font-size: 7pt;">: Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov recently evoked an immediate reaction from Moscow, and serious consequences were threatened should an orbital weapon deployment be performed by Washington. Such a reaction could consist of a modified version of the SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of putting into orbit a remarkable quantity of space vehicles - which could even carry military nukes, thus making the U.S. planned intercepting effort much more difficult. It is easy to imagine that </span>space weaponization - once in place - could be employed as well by U.S. rivals at any occasion, as these latter will develop mutual strategic ties just like China and Russia are doing <span style="font-size: 7pt;">in Central Asia.</span><br />

<strong>8. Turn – Aerospace Industry</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>a. Government demand for reconstitution of small satellite constellations is vital to capitalizing the entire aerospace and commercial industrial base</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Rendleman, 10</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> - Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)</span><br />
<br />
Given the importance of a responsive space infrastructure to space assurance, arguments in favor of such capabilities must be improved<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and refocused to show they also satisfy strategic and long-term needs, and serve as good economic investment. </span>Cost-effective access can best be achieved by deploying resilient, more populous, and less-complex satellite constellations<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Leveraging such architecture, individual spacecraft components could be designed and developed to be less capable, and reliable, than systems dependent on a single or small number of satellites. Reliability would be gained through redundancy. Mission and cost savings advantages could be gained through shortened development cycles that allow for spirally-developed block versions of each platform, its payload(s) and other parts of the system. Increasing the numbers of satellites on-orbit would give the economies of scale needed to support spacelift innovation and encourage investment by the commercial sector. </span>Architectures developed for responsive small satellite systems should be able to effectively use rapidly evolving technology and process innovations. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Miniaturization of components in small satellites now offers sophisticated capabilities useful for a wide variety of operational and science and technology missions, and can give the needed flexibility for designing large constellation mission architectures. LEO, multi-plane Walker constellations, insertion of multiple satellites on each launch, selection of mature technology readiness level (TRL) sensor or communication payloads and buses, block acquisition approaches, simplified platforms and busses, and common mission control and ground systems can all be employed. Constellations of simple multi-mission, combined communication-sensor satellites can be developed and deployed to achieve cost-efficient acquisition goals. Commercial and international communities are already deploying smaller, shorter-life, yet capable satellites with streamlined mission control architectures; these approaches are already cost-effectively satisfying mission needs. Acquirers must seize upon the best approaches. National security missions are amenable to LEO and small satellite systems—communications, reconnaissance, missile warning and defense, and weather. As we have seen with GPS, OrbComm, and Iridium systems, </span>large constellations of small satellites can be effectively managed and perform vital missions; they employ well-designed Walker Constellations to provide ubiquitous 24/7 coverage of much of the globe. By operating under a concept of employment that envisions regular, not infrequent or as-needed, replenishment of space systems, decisions makers would potentially have sufficient numbers of systems on hand, or in storage, to sustain rapid reconstitution or augmentation of capabilities in response to an attempted space ‘‘Pearl Harbor’’ or other national emergency<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>LEO could be selected, so that on mission completion systems are de-orbited in a relatively short period of time compared to present systems in higher orbits, reducing space debris problems<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span> Other secondary benefits could be secured with such a sustainment strategy—the U.S. aerospace industrial base, which has been suffering lately, could be re-energized with acquisition strategies that require continuous engineering improvements and innovations to large constellation space systems<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>This could ensure that the United States Government, and industrial and commercial base, is adequately capitalized and led, to be able to ‘‘develop and accelerate programs for rapid launch of satellites, to reconstitute lost systems, or bolster constellations in times of crisis.<span style="font-size: 7pt;">’’88 Costs for responsive space will be difficult to contain, while the underlying industrial base struggles to sustain, re-define, and improve itself.89 Employing large constellation acquisition, operations, and sustainment approach could provide the cost imperatives, effectiveness, resiliency, and opportunity to reconstitute that base. Thus, a responsive infrastructure would also serve as a vital part of a space assurance strategy.</span><br />

<strong>b. Resource wars are inevitable and risk extinction. Creating a viable commercial space sector changes the political calculation to go to war</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>The major source of social friction, including international friction, has<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> surely </span>always been unequal access to resources. People ﬁght to control the valuable resources on and under the land, and in and under the sea. The natural resources of Earth are limited in quantity<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and economically accessible resources even more so. </span>As the population grows<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and demand grows for a higher material standard of living, </span>industrial activity grows exponentially.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The threat of resources becoming scarce has led to the concept of ‘‘Resource Wars’’. Having begun long ago with wars to control the gold and diamonds of Africa and South America, and oil in the Middle East, the current phase is at centre stage of world events today [37]. </span>A particular danger of ‘‘resource wars’’ is that<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, if the general public can be persuaded to support them, </span>they may become impossible to stop as resources become increasingly scarce<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Many commentators have noted the similarity of the language of US and UK government advocates of ‘‘war on terror’’ to the language of the novel ‘‘1984’’ which describes a dystopian future of endless, fraudulent war in which citizens are reduced to slaves. 7.1. Expansion into near-Earth space is the only alternative to endless ‘‘resource wars’’ </span>As an alternative to the ‘‘resource wars’’ already devastating many countries today, opening access to the unlimited resources of near-Earth space could clearly facilitate world peace and security<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The US National Security Space Ofﬁce, at the start of its report on the potential of space-based solar power (SSP) published in early 2007, stated: ‘‘Expanding human populations and declining natural resources are potential sources of local and strategic conﬂict in the 21st Century, and many see energy as the foremost threat to national security’’ [38]. The report ended by encouraging urgent research on the feasibility of SSP: ‘‘Considering the timescales that are involved, and the exponential growth of population and resource pressures within that same strategic period, it is imperative that this work for ‘‘drilling up’’ vs. drilling down for energy security begins immediately’’ [38]. </span>Although the use of extra-terrestrial resources on a substantial scale may still be some decades away, <span style="font-size: 7pt;">it is important to recognise that</span> simply acknowledging its feasibility using known technology is the surest way of ending the threat of resource wars<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. That is, if it is assumed that the resources available for human use are limited to those on Earth, then it can be argued that resource wars are inescapable [22,37]. </span>If, <span style="font-size: 7pt;">by contrast,</span> it is assumed that the resources of space are economically accessible, this <span style="font-size: 7pt;">not only</span> eliminates the need for resource wars, <span style="font-size: 7pt;">it can also preserve the beneﬁts of civilisation which are being eroded today by ‘‘resource war-mongers’’, most notably the governments of the ‘‘Anglo-Saxon’’ countries and their ‘‘neo-con’’ advisers. It is also worth noting that the $1 trillion that these have already committed to wars in the Middle-East in the 21st century is orders of magnitude more than the public investment needed to aid companies sufﬁciently to start the commercial use of space resources. Industrial and ﬁnancial groups which proﬁt from monopolistic control of terrestrial supplies of various natural resources, like those which proﬁt from wars, have an economic interest in protecting their proﬁtable situation. However, these groups’ continuing proﬁts are justiﬁed neither by capitalism nor by democracy: they could be preserved only by maintaining the pretence that use of space resources is not feasible, and by preventing the development of low-cost space travel. Once the feasibility of low-cost space travel is understood, ‘‘resource wars’’ are clearly foolish as well as tragic. A visiting extra-terrestrial would be pityingly amused at the foolish antics of homo sapiens using longrange rockets to ﬁght each other over dwindling terrestrial resources—rather than using the same rockets to travel in space and have the use of all the resources they need! 7.2. High return in safety from extra-terrestrial settlement </span>Investment in low-cost orbital access and other space infrastructure will facilitate the establishment of settlements on the Moon, Mars, asteroids<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and in man-made space structures. In the ﬁrst phase, development of new regulatory infrastructure in various Earth orbits, including property/usufruct rights, real estate, mortgage ﬁnancing and insurance, trafﬁc management, pilotage, policing and other services will enable the population living in Earth orbits to grow very large. Such activities aimed at making near-Earth space habitable are the logical extension of humans’ historical spread over the surface of the Earth. As trade spreads through near-Earth space, settlements are likely to follow, of which the inhabitants will add to the wealth of different cultures which humans have created in the many different environments in which they live. </span>Success of such extra-terrestrial settlements will have the additional beneﬁt of reducing the danger of human extinction due to planet-wide or cosmic accidents<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> [27]. </span>These horrors include<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> both man-made disasters such as </span>nuclear war, plagues or growing pollution, and natural disasters such as super-volcanoes or asteroid impact<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is hard to think of any objective that is more important than preserving peace. </span>Weapons developed in recent decades are so destructive<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and have such horriﬁc, long-term side-effects that</span> their use should be discouraged as strongly as possible <span style="font-size: 7pt;">by the international community. Hence,</span> reducing the incentive to use these weapons by rapidly developing the ability to use space-based resources on a large scale is surely equally important<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> [11,16]. The achievement of this depends on low space travel costs which, at the present time, appear to be achievable only through the development of a vigorous space tourism industry. 8. Summary As discussed above, if space travel services had started during the 1950s, the space industry would be enormously more developed than it is today. Hence the failure to develop passenger space travel has seriously distorted the path taken by humans’ technological and economic development since WW2, away from the path which would have been followed if capitalism and democracy operated as intended. Technological know-how which could have been used to supply services which are known to be very popular with a large proportion of the population has not been used for that purpose, while waste and suffering due to the unemployment and environmental damage caused by the resulting lack of new industrial opportunities have increased. In response, policies should be implemented urgently to correct this error, and to catch up with the possibilities for industrial and economic growth that have been ignored for so long. This policy renewal is urgent because of the growing dangers of unemployment, economic stagnation, environmental pollution, educational and cultural decline, resource wars and loss of civil liberties which face civilisation today. In order to achieve the necessary progress there is a particular need for collaboration between those working in the two ﬁelds of civil aviation and civil space. Although the word ‘‘aerospace’’ is widely used, it is largely a misnomer since these two ﬁelds are in practice quite separate. True ‘‘aerospace’’ collaboration to realise passenger space travel will develop the wonderful profusion of possibilities outlined above. 8.1. Heaven or hell on Earth? As discussed above, </span>the claim that the Earth’s resources are running out is used to justify wars which may never end: present-day rhetoric about ‘‘the long war’’ or ‘‘100 years war’’ in Iraq and Afghanistan are current examples<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. If political leaders do not change their viewpoint, the recent aggression by the rich ‘‘Anglo-Saxon’’ countries, and their cutting back of traditional civil liberties, are ominous for the future.</span> However, this ‘‘hellish’’ vision of endless war is based on an assumption about <span style="font-size: 7pt;">a single number</span>—the future cost of travel to orbit—<span style="font-size: 7pt;">about which a different assumption leads to a ‘‘heavenly’’ vision of peace and ever-rising living standards for everyone. </span>If this cost stays above 10,000 Euros/kg, where it has been unchanged for nearly 50 years, the prospects for humanity are bleak. But if humans make the necessary effort, <span style="font-size: 7pt;">and use the tiny amount of resources needed to develop vehicles for passenger space travel, </span>then this cost will fall <span style="font-size: 7pt;">to 100 Euros/kg, the use of extra-terrestrial resources will become economic,</span> and arguments for resource wars will evaporate entirely<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The main reason why this has not yet happened seems to be lack of understanding of the myriad opportunities by investors and policy-makers. Now that the potential to catch up half a century of delay in the growth of space travel is becoming understood, continuing to spend 20 billion Euro-equivalents/year on government space activities, while continuing to invest nothing in developing passenger space travel, would be a gross failure of economic policy, and strongly contrary to the economic and social interests of the public. Correcting this error, even after such a costly delay, will ameliorate many problems in the world today. </span>As this policy error is corrected, and investment in proﬁtable space projects grows rapidly in coming years, we can look forward to a growing world-wide boom. Viewed as a whole, humans’ industrial activities have been seriously underperforming for decades, due to the failure to exploit these immensely promising ﬁelds of activity<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The tens of thousands of unemployed space engineers in Russia, America and Europe alone are a huge waste. The potential manpower in rapidly developing India and China is clearly vast. The hundreds of millions of disappointed young people who have been taught that they cannot travel in space are another enormous wasted resource. We do not know for certain when the above scenario will be realised. However, it could have such enormous value that considerable expenditure is justiﬁed in order to study its feasibility in detail [5]. At the very least, vigorous investment by both private and public sectors in a range of different sub-orbital passenger vehicle projects and related businesses is highly desirable. Fortunately, the ambitious and rapid investment by the Indian and Chinese governments in growing space capabilities may ﬁnally jolt the space industries of Russia, America, Europe and Japan out of their long economic stagnation, and induce them to apply their accumulated know-how to economically valuable activities—notably supplying widely popular travel services to the general public.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Given the degree to which the United States relies on space systems and supporting infrastructure for national security, we must use a multilayered approach to prevent and deter aggression. We seek to enhance our national capability to dissuade and deter the development, testing, and employment of counterspace systems and prevent and deter aggression against space systems and supporting infrastructure that support U.S. national security. Many elements of this strategy contribute to this approach. We will: support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space; pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint; improve our ability to attribute attacks; strengthen the resilience of our architectures to deny the benefits of an attack; and retain the right to respond, should deterrence fail. </span>DoD and the IC will support the diplomatic and public diplomacy efforts of the Department of State to promote the responsible use of space and discourage activities that threaten the safety, stability, and security of the space domain<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. We will also work with the Department of State and other appropriate U.S. Government agencies to strengthen alliances with other space-faring nations and pursue partnerships with commercial firms and international organizations. </span>We will improve our intelligence posture – predictive awareness, characterization, warning, and attribution – to better monitor and attribute activities in the space domain. Thus, SSA and foundational intelligence will continue to be top priorities, as they underpin our ability to maintain awareness of natural disturbances and the capabilities, activities, and intentions of others<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. We will also enable and develop intelligence professionals who can provide greater scope, depth, and quality of intelligence collection and analysis. </span>We will seek to deny adversaries meaningful benefits of attack by improving cost effective protection and strengthening the resilience of our architectures. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Partnerships with other nations, commercial firms, and international organizations, as well as alternative U.S. Government approaches such as cross-domain solutions, hosted payloads, responsive options, and other innovative solutions, can deliver capability, should our space systems be attacked. This also will enable our ability to operate in a degraded space environment. </span>Finally, the United States will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail. We will use force in a manner that is consistent with<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and </span>the inherent right of self defense.</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">According to GlobalSecurity.org's John Pike, </span>the U.S. military &quot;could<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> even </span>be using the cloak of mystery to deliberately bamboozle and confuse rival militaries.&quot;<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Pike told Space.com that &quot;</span>the X-37B and HTV-2 projects<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> could </span>represent the tip of a space weapons program hidden within the Pentagon's secret 'black budget<span style="font-size: 7pt;">,' or they might be nothing more than smoke and mirrors.&quot; </span>Pike said that current work &quot;leaves plenty of room for misinterpretation or even outright deception, which could be a ploy to distract other nations with military space projects.&quot;<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> &quot;'One of them could be a deception program and the other could be the spitting image of the real thing,' Pike noted.

<strong>4. <span class="Underline">Space Situational awareness is critical to preventing miscalculations – it identifies unintentional incidents like debris</span></strong><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Cartwright 2011 - vice Chair Joint Chiefs of Staff</strong></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> [General James, center for strategic and international studies (csis) the national security space strategy: implications for the department of defense FEBRUARY 16, 2011http://csis.org/files/attachments/110216_spacestrategy_transcript.pdf Accessed July 12]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">GEN. CARTWRIGHT: The concept of commons really was heavily debated in the development of these strategies, because there are legal implications to using the term that have developed over the years. But suffice it to say, the attributes of an area in which multiple nations expect to do commerce, expect to do military activities, et cetera, is in some terms a commons area. And the thought process right now is, we have put structure to the commons that we call the sea. </span><span class="Underline">We have put structure to the commons we call air. That structure gives us confidence that we can do commerce, that we can do military activities in a way that sets a pattern and an expectation of behavior. And the question is, should we be doing the same in space</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">? </span><span class="Underline">And the numbers clearly drive you in that direction. Even if a large part of it is debris, just the management of traffic and avoidance of collisions which take away the – or increase the cost of commerce, the price of doing business, drives you to some sort of pattern. It’s true on the national security side also. To the extent that you can have a standard behavior such that an anomaly can be detected when somebody’s not behaving in a standard way, helps you identify who is causing the problem. It may be willful, it may be a malfunction. You really don’t know until you can assess it. </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">So again, I take you back to</span><span class="Underline"> space situational awareness. It’s got to get down to a level of fidelity that things like attribution, things that are not necessarily willful, can be detected for what they are, </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">acted on in a timely fashion, because every minute that somebody’s not broadcasting a satellite image for television or whatever is revenue to somebody. And it changes the cost factors out there. </span><span class="Underline">That’s the same on the national security side. Every minute that somebody is doing something out there that they shouldn’t is a problem. The sooner that you’re going to be detected, the more difficult it is to hide your actions. </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">And so there is an element of deterrence in this structure that has to be a part of what we do. What we have today, again, is not as robust as we want. We are putting new systems in, new processors. But quite frankly, this is back to partnering. We couldn’t afford to put all the terrestrial sensors up there that we need to do this in minutes and seconds rather than in days and weeks. And so we’ve got to rely on partners. One of the concepts we’re discussing with partners is, would you like to be part of the Combined Space Operations Center? If so, bring your sensors, because we’ve got to find a way to get a global awareness. And there is a terrestrial element to that. You’ve got to be on the land or in an area with things like transfer orbits to geosynchronous. You have to be in the right place to detect these activities. We don’t necessarily own those places, and they’re not necessarily in the commons. And so we have to have partners to start doing this, but the more that anomalous behavior can be detected, the more the cost of operating a space goes down and the more the security issues are better managed.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">On the strength of the carbon nanotube-based space elevator cable S1973 Unfortunately, </span>the presence of even a few vacancies in a single nanotube seems to play a dramatic role, as suggested by quantized fracture mechanics<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (QFM) criteria (Pugno 2002, 2004b, 2006b; Pugno and Ruoff 2004). And </span>in such a huge cable we expect pre-existing defects not only for statistical reasons (Carpinteri and Pugno 2005) but also as a consequence of damage nucleation, e.g., due to micrometeorite or low Earth orbit object impacts and atomic oxygen erosion. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">After a review on the mechanics of the cable, the effect on the strength of the damage types mentioned is considered. Accordingly, different deterministic and statistical models are presented for estimating the strength of a real, thus defective, carbon nanotubebased space elevator cable. All these </span>methods suggest expecting a megacable strength reduced by a factor of at least 70% with respect to the theoretical nanotube strength, corresponding to a mass increment larger than 300%.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Thus, </span>the deduced strength reduction is sufficient to place in doubt the effective feasibility of the space elevator that,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as designed today and according to the author’s analysis and opinion, </span>will undoubtedly break<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Experiments and atomistic simulations, based on molecular or quantum mechanics, for carbon nanotubes confirm our argument. Size effects deduced by in-silicon experiments for carbon nanotube-based ropes confirm the strength reduction mentioned, in agreement with the first observations on the strength of metre-long nanotube-based ropes (Zhang et al 2005). Thus, the general optimism as regards the effective realization of the space elevator (in 15 years for $ 10B; see Edwards (2000, 2003); Edwards and Westling (2003)) is placed in doubt by the role of defects in the cable: as we have not been able to build a large glass cable possessing the strength of a glass whisker, perhaps we will face a similar limit during the practical realization of the space elevator cable, and certainly if the design of the cable is not dramatically reconsidered. Accordingly, a detailed analysis on the role of defects in the cable seems to be crucial: formally, in addition to strength and density, the fracture toughness has to be taken into account and cannot be further neglected. The QFM criteria introduced by the author could help in solving, if a solution exists, the problem of a correct nanostructured megacable design, whereas classical atomistic simulations or experimental analyses remain unrealizable due to the tremendous size of the megacable.</span><br />

<br />
<strong>A) Empiricism is the best model for interpreting IR – provides falsifiability, leads to effective theorizing, and is used by policymakers now</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Fischer 98</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University (Frank, “BEYOND EMPIRICISM: POLICY INQUIRY IN POSTPOSITIVIST PERSPECTIVE”, Published in Policy Studies Journal, Vol. 26. No.1 (Spring, 1998): 129-146) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Neopositivism (or logical empiricism) has supplied the epistemological ideals of the contemporary social and policy sciences (Hawkesworth 1988; </span>A theory of knowledge put forth to explain the concepts and methods of the physical and natural sciences,neopositivism has given shape as well to a social science in pursuit quantitatively replicable causal generalizations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Fay 1975). Most easily recognized as the stuff of the research methodology textbook, </span>neopositivist principles emphasize empirical research designs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>the use of sampling techniques and data gathering procedures<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>the measurement of outcomes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>and the development of causal models with predictive power<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Miller 1993; Bobrow and Dryzek 1987). In the field of policy analysis</span>, such an orientation is manifested in quasi-experimental research designs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>multiple regression analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>survey research<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>input-output studies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>cost-benefit analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>operations research<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>mathematical simulation models<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>and systems analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Putt and Springer, 1989; Sylvia, et al. 1991). </span>The only reliable approach to knowledge accumulation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, according to this epistemology</span>, is empirical falsification through objective hypothesis-testing of rigorously formulated causal generalizations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Popper, 1959: Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith 1992:231; Hofferbert 1990). </span>The goal is to generate a body of empirical generalizations capable of explaining behavior across social and historical contexts, whether communities, societies, or cultures, independently of specific times, places, or circumstances<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Not only are such propositions essential to social and political explanation, they are seen to make possible effective solutions to societal problems.Such propositions are<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> said </span>to supply the cornerstones of theoretical progress. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Underlying this effort is a fundamental positivist principle mandating a rigorous separation of facts and values, the principle of the &quot;fact-value dichotomy&quot; (Bernstein 1976; Proctor 1991). According to this principle, </span>empirical research is to proceed independently of normative context or implications.Because only empirically based causal knowledge can qualify social science as a genuine &quot;scientific&quot; endeavor, social scientists are instructed to assume a &quot;value-neutral&quot; orientation and to limit their research investigations to empirical or &quot;factual&quot; phenomena<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even though adherence to this &quot;fact-value dichotomy&quot; varies in the conduct of actual research, especially at the methodological level, the separation still reigns in the social sciences. </span>To be judged as methodologically valid, research must at least officially pay its respects to the principle<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Fischer 1980). </span>In the policy sciences the attempt to separate facts and values has facilitated a<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> technocratic </span>form of policy analysis that emphasizes the efficiency and effectiveness of means to achieve politically established goals<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Much of policy analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in this respect, </span>has sought to translate inherently normative political and social issues into<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> technically </span>defined ends to be pursued through administrative means<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In an effort to sidestep goal-value conflicts typically associated with policy issues, </span>economic and social problems are interpreted as issues in need of improved management and program design<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span>their solutions are to be found in the technical applications of the policy sciences <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Amy 1987). Often associated </span>with this orientation has been a belief in the superiority of scientific decision-making<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Reflecting a subtle antipathy toward democratic processes, terms such as &quot;pressures&quot; and &quot;expedient adjustments&quot; are used to denigrate pluralistic policymaking. If politics doesn't fit into the methodological scheme, then politics is the problem. </span>Some have<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even </span>argued<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span>the political system<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> itself must </span>be changed to better accommodate policy analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Heineman et al. 1990). In the face of limited empirical successes, </span>neopositivists<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have had to give some ground. Although they </span>continue to stress rigorous empirical research as the long-run solution <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to their failures, they have retreated from their more ambitious efforts. </span>Today their goal is to aim for propositions that are at least theoretically proveable at some future point in time.An argument propped up by the promise of computer advances<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>it serves to keep the original epistemology in tack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But the modification misses the point, as postpositivists are quick to point out. The problem is more fundamentally rooted in the empirical social scientists's misunderstanding of the nature of the social. As we shall see, it is a misunderstanding lodged in the very concept of a generalizable, value-free objectivity that neopositivists seek to reaffirm and more intensively apply.</span><br />

<strong>B) A constructivist framework divorces the neg from empirics and does not lead to shifts away from realism</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Copenhagen school thus emphasizes the need to understand the “speech acts” that accomplish a process of securitization. Their focus is on the linguistic and conceptual dynamics involved, even though they recognize the importance of the institutional setting within which securitization takes place. </span>The concept of securitization offers some important insights for security studies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, it is too epistemologically restricted to contribute to a significant retooling of security studies. On the positive side, </span>it draws attention to the way in which security agendas are constructed by politicians and other political actors. It also indicates the utility of discourse analysis as an additional tool of analysis for security studies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>However, at best, securitization studies can constitute one aspect of security studies. It cannot provide the foundations for a paradigm shift in the subdiscipline. Its greatest weakness is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its epistemological hypochondria, that is, </span>its tendency to reify epistemological problems and push sound observations about knowledge claims to their logical absurdity. Although it is important to understand the discursive moves involved in perceptions of security in, say, the Middle East, it is also necessary to make some assessment of nondiscursive factors like the military balance<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or access to freshwater supplies. For the Copenhagen school, however, </span>these nondiscursive factors are relegated to second place. They are considered only to the extent that they facilitate or impede the speech ac<span style="font-size: 8pt;">t. In this way, </span>the Copenhagen school is in danger of cutting security studies off from serious empirical research and setting it adrift on a sea of floating signifiers.<br />

<strong>4. Uncertainty justifies realism – even under a cooperative framework, the malleability of discourse proves that leaders will always calculate action based on capability</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Copeland 6</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Associate Professor and Director Dept. of Government and Foreign Affairs @ University of Virginia (Dale, “The Constructivist Challenge to Structural Realism: A Review Essay”, Constructivism and International Relations, Alexander Wendt and His Critics)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Notwithstanding </span>Wendt’s<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> important contributions to international relations theory, his </span>critique of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> structural </span>realism<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has inherent flaws. Most important, it </span>does not adequately address a critical aspect of the realist worldview<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span><strong>the problem of uncertainty.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For structural realists, it is </span>states’ uncertainty about the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> present and especially the </span>future intentions of othersthat makes<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the levels and trends in </span>relative power such fundamental causal variables<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Contrary to Wendt’s claim that realism must smuggle in states with differently constituted interests to explain why systems sometimes fall into conflict, neorealists argue that </span>uncertainty about the other’s present interests<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>whether the other is driven by security or nonsecurity motives<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span><strong>can be enough to lead security-seeking states to fight</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This problem is exacerbated by </span>the incentives that actors have to deceive one another, an issue Wendt does not address. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yet even when states are fairly sure that the other is also a security seeker, they know that it might change its spots later on. States must therefore worry about any decline in their power, lest the other turn aggressive after achieving superiority. Wendt’s building of a systemic </span>constructivist theory<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—and his bracketing of unit-level processes—</span>thus presents<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> him with </span>an ironic dilemma<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>It is the very mutability of polities as emphasized by domestic-level constructivists<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>that states may change because of domestic processes independent of international interaction<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>that makes prudent leaders so concerned about the future<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>If diplomacy can have only a limited effect<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on another’s character or regime type,</span> <strong>then leaders must calculate the other’s potential to attack later should it acquire motives for expansion</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In such an environment of future uncertainty, levels and trends in relative power will thus act as a key constraint on state behavior. The problem of uncertainty complicates Wendt’s efforts to show that anarchy has no particular logic, but only three different ideational instantiations in history—as Hobbesian, Lockean, or Kantian cultures, depending on the level of actor compliance to certain behavioral norms. By differentiating these cultures in terms of the degree of cooperative behavior exhibited by states, </span>Wendt’s analysis reinforcesthe very dilemma underpinning the realist argument<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>If the other is acting cooperatively, how is one to know whether this reflects its peaceful character, or is just a façade <strong>masking aggressive desires</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Wendt’s discussion of the different degrees of internalization of the three cultures only exacerbates the problem. </span>What drives behavior at the <strong>lower levels of internalization</strong> is precisely what is not shared between actors—their private incentives to comply for short-term selfish reasons.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This suggests that </span>the neorealist and neoliberal paradigm<span style="font-size: 8pt;">s, both of which emphasize the role of uncertainty when internalization is low or nonexistent, </span>remain strong competitors to constructivism in explaining changing levels of cooperation through history<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And because </span>Wendt provides little empirical evidence to support his view<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in relation to these competitors, the debate over which paradigm possesses greater explanatory power is still an open one. </span><br />
<br />
<strong>The impact is the rise of Hitlerite states – the possibility of deception and different discursive interpretations means constructivist theory could prove fatal</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Copeland 6</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Associate Professor and Director Dept. of Government and Foreign Affairs @ University of Virginia (Dale, “The Constructivist Challenge to Structural Realism: A Review Essay”, Constructivism and International Relations, Alexander Wendt and His Critics)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Second, Wendt’s view is inconsistent with his recognition that </span>states<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often do </span>have<strong>difficulty learning about the other</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The very problem Ego and Alter have in first communicating is that ‘behavior does not speak for itself. It must be interpreted, and ‘<strong>many interpretations are possible’</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (330). This point is reinforced by </span>Wendt’s epistemological point<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of departure: </span>that the ideas held by actors are ‘unobservable’<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (chap. 2). </span>Because leaders cannot observe<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> directly </span>what the other is thinking, they are resigned to making inferences from its behavior. Yet in security affa<span style="font-size: 8pt;">irs, as Wendt acknowledges, </span>mistakes in inferences—assuming the other is peaceful when in fact it has malevolent intentions—could prove ‘<strong>fatal’</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (360). Wendt accepts that the problem facing rational states ‘is making sure that they perceive other actors, and other actors’ perception of them, correctly’ (334, emphasis in original). Yet the book provides no mechanism through which Ego and Alter can increase their confidence in the correctness of their estimates of the other’s type. </span>Simply describing how Ego and Alter shape each other’s sense of self and other is not enough<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.21 </span>Rational choice models<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, using assumptions consistent with structural realism, </span><strong>do much better here</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In games of incomplete information, where states are unsure about the other’s type, actions by security-seeking actors that would be too costly for greedy actors to adopt can help states reduce their uncertainty about present intentions, thus moderating the security dilemma.22 </span>Wendt cannot simply argue that over time states can learn a great deal about other states<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>It is what is not ‘shared’, at least in the area of intentions, that remains the core stumbling block to cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Third, </span>Wendt’s position<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that the problem of other minds is not much of a problem </span>ignores<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a fundamental issue in all social relations, but especially in those between states, namely, </span><strong>the problem of deception</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In making estimates of the other’s present type, </span>states have reason to be suspicious of its diplomatic gestures<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>the other may be trying to deceive them<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Wendt’s analysis is rooted in the theory of symbolic interactionism, but he does not discuss one critical aspect of that tradition: the idea of ‘impression management’. </span>Actors in their relations exploit the problem of other minds <strong>for their own ends.</strong> On the public stage, they present images and play roles that often have little to do with their <strong>true beliefs and interests backstage</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.23 In laying out his dramaturgical view of Ego and Alter co-constituting each other’s interests and identities, Wendt assumes that both Ego and Alter are making genuine efforts to express their true views and to ‘cast’ the other in roles that they believe in. But </span>deceptive actors will stage-manage the situation to create impressions that serve their narrow ends, and other actors, especially in world politics, will understand this<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.24 Thus </span>a prudent security-seeking Ego will have difficulty distinguishing between two scenarios: whether it and Alter do indeed share a view of each other as peaceful, or whether Alter is just pretending to be peaceful in order to make Ego think that they share a certain conception of the world, when in fact they do not<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.25 </span>Wendt’s analysis offers no basis for saying when peaceful gestures should be taken at face value<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and when they should be discounted as deceptions.26 </span>When we consider the implications of a <strong>Hitlerite state deceiving others to achieve a position of military superiority</strong>, we understand why great powers in history have tended to adopt postures of <strong>prudent mistrust.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>7. Turn - Rejecting strategic predictions of threats makes them inevitable – decision makers will rely on preconceived conceptions of threat rather than the more qualified predictions of analysts</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Fitzsimmons, 07</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Michael, Washington DC defense analyst, “The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning”, Survival, Winter 06-07, online)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But handling even this weaker form of uncertainty is still quite challeng- ing. If not sufficiently bounded, a high degree of variability in planning factors can exact a significant price on planning. The complexity presented by great variability strains the cognitive abilities of even the most sophisticated decision- makers.15 And even a robust decision-making process sensitive to cognitive limitations necessarily sacrifices depth of analysis for breadth as variability and complexity grows. </span>It should follow, then, that in planning under conditions of risk, variability in strategic calculation should be carefully tailored to available analytic and decision processes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Why is this important? What harm can an imbalance between complexity and cognitive or analytic capacity in strategic planning bring? </span>Stated simply, where analysis is silent or inadequate, <strong>the personal beliefs of decision-makers</strong> <strong>fill the void</strong>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As political scientist Richard Betts found in a study of strategic sur- prise, in ‘an environment that lacks clarity, abounds with conflicting data, and allows no time for rigorous assessment of sources and validity, ambiguity allows intuition or wishfulness to drive interpretation ... </span>The greater the ambiguity, the greater the impact of preconceptions.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">’16 The decision-making environment that Betts describes here is one of political-military crisis, not long-term strategic planning. </span>But a strategist who sees uncertainty as the central fact of his environ- ment brings upon himself some of the pathologies of crisis decision-making. He invites ambiguity, takes conflicting data for granted and <strong>substitutes a priori scepticism about the validity of prediction</strong> for time pressure as a rationale for discounting the importance of analytic rigour.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is important not to exaggerate the extent to which data and ‘rigorous assessment’ can illuminate strategic choices. Ambiguity is a fact of life, and scepticism of analysis is necessary. Accordingly, the intuition and judgement of decision-makers will always be vital to strategy, and attempting to subordinate those factors to some formulaic, deterministic decision-making model would be both undesirable and unrealistic. All the same, there is danger in the opposite extreme as well. Without careful analysis of what is relatively likely and what is relatively unlikely, what will be the possible bases for strategic choices? </span>A decision-maker with no faith in prediction is left with little more than a set of worst-case scenarios and his existing beliefs about the world to confront the choices before him. Those beliefs may be more or less well founded, but if they are not made explicit and subject to analysis and debate regarding their application to particular strategic contexts, they remain only beliefs and premises, rather than rational judgements.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Even at their best, such decisions are likely to be poorly understood by the organisations charged with their implementation. At their worst, such decisions may be poorly understood by the decision-makers themselves</span><br />

Did the arms race in space begin this week? &quot;Competition between military forces is developing towards the sky and space, it is extending beyond the atmosphere and even into outer space,&quot; said the chief of the Chinese air force<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the Nov. 2 edition of People's Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of China's military. </span><strong>&quot;This development is a historical inevitability and cannot be undone.&quot; What cannot be undone is the effect of General Xu Qiliang's words.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Chinese state media, however, tried to do just that, contending that the foreign media misinterpreted him. Then Chinese diplomats got in on the act. &quot;China has never and will not participate in an outer space arms race in any form,&quot; said Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu on Nov. 5. &quot;The position of China on this point remains unchanged.&quot; </span>China's position--at least up until this week--was that no nation should use space for the purposes of war. In February of last year, Beijing and Moscow introduced a draft space treaty at a disarmament conference in Geneva. The Bush administration opposed it on the sensible ground that a deal would be unverifiable--any object in space can be used as a weapon if it can be maneuvered to arrange a collision, for instance. Moreover, a ground-launched missile can also be used to knock out satellites, space stations or shuttles. The Russians and Chinese, in all probability, were just engaging in a public relations exercise last year because they obviously had no intention of ever allowing the intrusive inspections that would have to be built into any meaningful treaty.Yet<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, minutes after his inauguration, President </span>Obama called Beijing's and Moscow's bluff by coming out in favor of a global agreement to keep weapons out of the heavens. In response<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to Obama's countermove, </span>Beijing--or at least the P<span style="font-size: 8pt;">eople's </span>L<span style="font-size: 8pt;">iberation </span>A<span style="font-size: 8pt;">rmy--</span>has now changed tack and announced its intention to begin the space arms race in earnest. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">General Xu's bold words, interestingly enough, come at the same time that some in Washington are calling for civilian cooperation with the Chinese in space. And why would we do that? The U.S. shuttle fleet will be retired next year. Its replacement, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle, is not slated to make its first crewed flight until 2015, and it may not fly until well after that. In the interim, NASA intends to rely on Russian launch vehicles to get Americans into orbit. The United States, therefore, will be at the complete mercy of Moscow when the last shuttle is grounded--unless we are willing to hitchhike with the only other nation that will be able to put a human into space then. &quot;I think it's possible in principle to develop the required degree of confidence in the Chinese,&quot; said John Holdren, President Obama's science advisor, in April. And he is not alone in this view. According to the just-released report of the Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee, better known as the Augustine report, &quot;China offers significant potential in a space partnership.&quot; In one sense, this statement is correct. After all, China has put a man into space three times. Moreover, the Chinese have said on numerous occasions that they are prepared to work with us. So what is the problem with doing so? First, even though the United States will soon find itself without a way to put humans into orbit, any partnership would essentially be a one-way transfer of technology from us to the Chinese. Second, the Chinese did not respond favorably to past American efforts--made during the administration of George W. Bush--to involve them in cooperative space efforts. Third, there is no such thing as a civilian space program in China. The China National Space Administration is really a military operation. Therefore, we have to ask ourselves a question: Should we transfer technology to a potential adversary so that it can improve its war-fighting capabilities? General Kevin Chilton, the chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, called for a dialogue with his Chinese counterparts the day after General Xu's space-race declaration. &quot;Where they're heading is one of the things a lot of people would like to understand better,&quot; Chilton said. But do we really need to talk to the Chinese to figure out their intentions? </span>In August 2006, the Chinese lasered a<span style="font-size: 8pt;">t </span>least one American satellite with the apparent intention of blinding it, a direct attack on the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates. </span>In the following January, the People's Liberation Army destroyed one of its old weather satellites with a ground-launched missile,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> sending more than 35,000 fragments into low-earth orbit. </span>The Chinese want to dominate space. General Xu did the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>a favor by removing any doubt about where his country stands. <strong>Whether we like it or not, there is now a brutal competition</strong> between the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>and China <strong>to control</strong> the high ground of <strong>space.</strong><br />

<strong>10. Turn – Scenario Planning – calling attention to global affairs prevents crisis driven responses – the alternative makes crisis management a certainty</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Ungar,</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">president – Goucher College, 200</span><strong>5</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[sanford, “compassion fatigue: the next wave?”, winter, www.goucher.edu/x4726.xml</span><span style="color: green; font-size: 8pt;">]</span><br />
<br />
There is a temptation to worry that before long, we will be hit by<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> one more severe case of what has come to be known as </span>“compassion fatigue”—<span style="font-size: 8pt;">a </span>deadening of our sensibilities by the unrelenting bombardment of shallow and sensationalist media coverage of disease, famine, death, and war<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Susan D. Moeller, a well-traveled observer who now teaches at the University of Maryland, has written tellingly of this phenomenon. “Through a choice of language and images,” she says, “the newest event is represented as more extreme than a similar past situation.” When we use the same extreme words to describe very different events, we undermine our ability to differentiate among them. Our sense of tragedy and cataclysm can be ratcheted only so high before we simply become overwhelmed. Some news organizations try to hold our attention by personalizing the events—pointing out, for example, that U.S. citizens perished in the tsunami, or drawing comparisons between this disaster overseas and others closer to home. But eventually, a limit is reached, and our ability to identify and sympathize disappears. Reporting the more troubling events of the world without turning people off is a tricky proposition, even when it’s done well. I recently attended a gathering of higher education leaders that was addressed by a well-regarded political pundit from Washington. He was sharply critical of my alma mater, National Public Radio, for its overcoverage of international problems. “Why, to listen to NPR,” he complained, “you would think that there is trouble everywhere. It’s exhausting.” Visitors from across the country—sufferers all from compassion fatigue, I suppose—nodded their heads in agreement. “</span>Well,”<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I said, as I attempted to confront him later</span>, “there <strong>really is a lot to worry about</strong> in the world, and someone has to call our attention to it.” <span style="font-size: 8pt;">He was not about to be persuaded, preferring instead to focus on the customary agenda of parochial issues facing Americans. </span>There’s a <strong>real danger in that attitude</strong>. If we allowour exhaustion to keep us from thinking about global concerns, we risk ignoring <span style="font-size: 8pt;">some </span>important issues that<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> may </span>deserve a <strong>place in our consciousness</strong> alongside our domestic debates. By now it <strong>should be obvious</strong> that events and conditions around the world can have a profound impact on Main Street America.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> One would think there is </span>plenty of evidence<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to </span>make the point: the crisis- inspired fluctuation in gasoline prices<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the pump; the international shortage of steel and concrete due to the construction boom in China; and the ebb and flow of immigration to the United States on the basis of circumstances in Mexico and Central America, among other places. </span>Not to mention the consequences<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> we have all experienced, in varying ways and to varying degrees, </span>as a result of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>Iraq<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> war. The tsunami has ramifications for Americans beyond what might seem immediately apparent. It has been suggested that American generosity toward these countries with large Muslim populations could have an important restorative effect on the United States’ image throughout the Muslim world. It’s a shame it took a catastrophe like this to get us interested in what’s going on there. </span>Perhaps if we <strong>paid closer attention</strong> to the concerns of others over a sustained period of time, we would gain a better understanding of the global disparities that breed problems like terrorism—and, in the process, go a <strong>long way</strong> toward making the world safer for everyone<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>In the heat of political battle, in the midst of some of our own legitimate preoccupations, it may have become more difficult to sustain the argument that Americans’ lives are meaningfully affected by poverty, disease, and tragedy in distant, hard-to-pronounce places. But we <strong>must not turn our attention away</strong>, and we must demand that those we entrust to report the news be<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not only </span><strong>vigilant, but also responsible</strong>, in their presentation of global events. Otherwise, we will be <strong>doomed to await the tsunamis</strong> of history, literal and figurative, to help us figure out what is really going on.<br />

<strong>A) Educated Hope—Examining larger power relations is the only way to create social change and a more just future</strong><br />
<strong>Giroux 6,</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">CHAIR PROFESSORSHIP – EDUCATION AND CULTURAL STUDIES – PENN STATE [HENRY, ‘DIRTY DEMOCRACY AND STATE OF TERRORISM”, Comparative Studies of South Asia,163-177]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Abstracted from the ideal of public commitment, </span>the new authoritarianism represents a<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> political and economic practice and </span>form of militarism that loosen the connections among substantive democracy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, critical agency, </span>and critical education. In opposition <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to the rising tide of authoritarianism, </span>educators<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> across the globe</span> must make a case for linking learning to progressive social change<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> while struggling to pluralize and critically engage the diverse sites where public pedagogy takes place. In part, this suggests forming alliances that can make sure every sphere of social life is recognized as an important site of the political, social, and cultural struggle that is so crucial to any attempt to forge the knowledge, identifications, effective investments, and social relations that constitute political subjects and social agents capable of energizing and spreading the basis for a substantive global democracy. </span><br />
Such circumstances <strong>require</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span>pedagogy be embraced as a moral <strong>and</strong> political practice<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, one that is directive and not dogmatic, an outgrowth of struggles designed </span>to resist the increasing depoliticization of political culture that is the hallmark of the current Bush revolution. Education is the terrain where consciousness is shaped<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, needs are constructed, </span>and the capacity for<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> individual self-reflection and </span><strong>broad social change</strong> is nurtured<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and produced. Education has assumed an unparalleled significance in shaping the language, values, and ideologies that legitimize the structures and organizations that support the imperatives of global capitalism. Efforts to reduce it to a technique or methodology set aside, education remains a crucial site for the production and struggle over those pedagogical and political conditions that provide the possibilities for people to develop forms of agency that enable them individually and collectively to intervene in the processes through which the material relations of power shape the meaning and practices of their everyday lives. Within the current historical context, struggles over power take on a symbolic and discursive as well as a material and institutional form. The struggle over education is about more than the struggle over meaning and identity; it is also about how meaning, knowledge, and values are produced, authorized, and made operational within economic and structural relations of power. Education is not at odds with politics; it is an important and crucial element in any definition of the political and offers not only the theoretical tools for a systematic critique of authoritarianism but also a language of possibility for creating actual movements for democratic social change and a new biopolitics that affirms life rather than death, shared responsibility rather than shared fears, and engaged citizenship rather than the stripped-down values of consumerism. </span>At stake here is combining symbolic forms <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and processes </span>conducive to democratization with<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> broader social contexts and the </span><strong>institutional formations</strong> of power itself. The <strong>key point</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> here </span>is to <span style="font-size: 8pt;">understand and </span>engage educational<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and pedagogical </span>practices from the point of <span style="font-size: 8pt;">view of </span>how they are bound up with larger relations of power. Educators<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, students, and parents </span>need to be clearer about how power works through<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and in texts, </span>representations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and discourses, </span><strong>while at the same time</strong> recognizing <span style="font-size: 8pt;">that </span>power <strong>cannot be limited</strong> to the study of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> representations and </span>discourses, even at the level of public policy. Changing consciousness is <strong>not the same</strong> as <strong>altering the institutional basis of oppression</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; at the same time, institutional </span>reform c<strong>annot take place</strong> without a change in consciousness capable of recognizing not only injustice but also the <strong>very possibility for reform</strong>, the capacity to reinvent the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> conditions [End Page 176] and </span><strong>practices</strong> that make a <strong>more just future possible</strong>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In addition, it is crucial to raise questions about the relationship between pedagogy and civic culture, on the one hand, and what it takes for individuals and social groups to believe that they have any responsibility whatsoever even to address the realities of class, race, gender, and other specific forms of domination, on the other hand. For too long, the progressives have ignored that the strategic dimension of politics is inextricably connected to questions of critical education and pedagogy, to what it means to acknowledge that education is always tangled up with power, ideologies, values, and the acquisition of both particular forms of agency and specific visions of the future. The primacy of critical pedagogy to politics, social change, and the radical imagination in such dark times is dramatically captured by the internationally renowned sociologist Zygmunt Bauman. He writes, Adverse odds may be overwhelming, and yet a democratic (or, as Cornelius Castoriadis would say, an autonomous) society knows of no substitute for education and self-education as a means to influence the turn of events that can be squared with its own nature, while that nature cannot be preserved for long without &quot;critical pedagogy&quot;—an education sharpening its critical edge, &quot;making society feel guilty&quot; and &quot;stirring things up&quot; through stirring human consciences. The fates of freedom, of democracy that makes it possible while being made possible by it, and of education that breeds dissatisfaction with the level of both freedom and democracy achieved thus far, are inextricably connected and not to be detached from one another. One may view that intimate connection as another specimen of a vicious circle—but it is within that circle that human hopes and the chances of humanity are inscribed, and can be nowhere else.59</span><br />

<strong>B) Reps don't influence reality—they're just descriptive</strong><br />
<strong>Hans Mouritzen, Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of International Studies, 1997,</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">cites Kenneth Waltz, father of structural realism and Ford Professor Emeritus of political science @ University of California (The Future of International Relations, edited by Iver B. Neumann and Ole Wæver. Page 70.)</span><br />
<br />
The doctrine of metaphysical realism asserts that reality exists indepen­dently from our language and theories about it<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(contrast: idealism, relati­vism, instrumentalism)4 It is labelled 'metaphysical' by Popper, since it is not refutable as a scientific theory should be. Arguments can be given in its favour, however:</span>'human language is always essentially descriptive... and an unambiguous description is always of something - of some state of affairs <span style="font-size: 8pt;">which may be real or imaginary...Rationality,</span> language, description, argument, are all about some reality' <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Popper 1973: 41). A corollary of realism is the correspondence theory of truth. 'I accept the commonsense theory... that truth is correspondence with the facts (or with reality)' (Popper 1973: 44) (contrast a coherence theory of truth, which tends to characterize idealists/relativists, and a pragmatic theory of truth, which tends to characterize instrumentalists5). Waltz obviously presupposes meta­physical realism, although this label is never used:</span>A theory, while related to the world about which explanations are wanted, always remains distinct from that world. Theories are not de­scriptions of the real world; they are instruments that we design in order to apprehend some part of it. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(1975: 8) This might for a second bring doubt to one's mind about Waltz's view: Are theories mere instruments that can be more or less useful in virtue of their ability of produce adequate predictions and, hence, guide our practice? The answer is no. They are instruments, but instruments that can make us apprehend some part of the world. Therefore, they are first and foremost about something, an independent real world (see the first sentence). Good theories reveal the causal mechanisms in this world.6 A further corrobora­tion of this interpretation appears from Waltz's occasional reference to the nature of 'subject-matter' as an argument: 'The attempt to follow the general-systems model has been a misfortune, for our subject matter does not fit the model closely enough to make the model useful—One must choose an appropriate to the subject matter' (Waltz 1975: 72). In other words, </span>models/theories may be more or less useful, but that is because of some kind of relation (or lack of relation) with the segment of reality at stake<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.7</span><br />

<br />
Capitalism is not<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a </span>perfect<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> system, and it is not good for everyone all the time. </span>Critics of globalization are good at pointing out individual harms<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—a factory that has closed down, a wage that has been reduced. Such things do happen, </span>but by concentrating solely on individual instances, one may miss the larger reality of how a political or economic system generally works and what fantastic values it confers on the great majority <strong>compared with other alternatives</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Problems are found in <strong>every political and economic system,</strong> but rejecting all systems is not an option<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></strong>Hunting down negative examples of what can happen in a market economy is easy enough. By that method water or fire can be proved to be bad things, because some people drown and some get burned to death, but this isn't the full picture<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></strong>A myopic focus on capitalism's imperfections ignores the freedom and independence that it confers on people who have never experienced anything but oppression<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It also disregards the calm and steady progress that is the basic rule of a society with a market economy. </span>There is nothing wrong with identifying problems and mishaps in a predominantly successful system if one does so with the constructive intent of rectifying or alleviating them. <strong>But someone who condemns the system as such is obligated to answer this question</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span><strong>What political and economic system could manage things better?</strong>Never before in human history has prosperity grown so rapidly and poverty declined so heavily. <strong>Is there any evidence</strong>, either in history or in the world around us, to suggest that another system could do as well?<br />

<strong>Rummel 4</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">– prof. emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Rudolph, The Killing Machine that is Marxism, Online</span><br />
<br />
Of all religions, secular and otherwise, that of Marxism has been by far the bloodiest<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – bloodier than the Catholic Inquisition, the various Catholic crusades, and the Thirty Years War between Catholics and Protestants. In practice, </span>Marxism has meant bloody terrorism, deadly purges, lethal prison camps and murderous forced labor, fatal deportations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, man-made </span>famines, extrajudicial executions and fraudulent show trials, outright mass murder and genocide<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>In total, Marxist regimes murdered nearly 110 million people from 1917 to 1987<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>For perspective on this incredible toll, note that all domestic and foreign wars during the 20th century killed around 35 million.That is, when Marxists control states, Marxism is more deadly then all the wars of the 20th century, including World Wars I and II, and the Korean and Vietnam Wars<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>And what did Marxism<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, this greatest of human social experiments, </span>achieve<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for its poor citizens, at this most bloody cost in lives? </span>Nothing positive<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It left in its wake an economic, environmental, social and cultural disaster. The Khmer Rouge – (</span>Cambodian communists<span style="font-size: 8pt;">) who ruled Cambodia for four years – </span>provide insight into why Marxists believed it necessary and moral to massacre so many of their fellow humans. Their Marxism was married to absolute power. They believed without a shred of doubt that they knew the truth, that they would bring about the greatest human welfare and happiness, and that to realize this utopia, they had to mercilessly tear down the old feudal or capitalist order<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and Buddhist culture, and then totally rebuild a communist society. </span>Nothing could be allowed to stand in the way<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of this achievement. Government – the Communist Party – was above any law. All other institutions, religions, cultural norms, traditions and sentiments were expendable. The Marxists saw the construction of this utopia as a war on poverty, exploitation, imperialism and inequality – and, as in a real war, noncombatants would unfortunately get caught in the battle. There would be necessary enemy casualties: the clergy, bourgeoisie, capitalists, &quot;wreckers,&quot; intellectuals, counterrevolutionaries, rightists, tyrants, the rich and landlords. As in a war, millions might die, but these deaths would be justified by the end, as in the defeat of Hitler in World War II. </span>To the ruling Marxists, the goal of a communist utopia was enough to justify all the deaths<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The irony is that in practice, even after decades of total control, Marxism did not improve the lot of the average person, but usually made living conditions worse than before the revolution<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I</span>t is not by chance that the world's greatest famines have happened within the Soviet Union<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (about 5 million dead from 1921-23 and 7 million from 1932-3, including 2 million outside Ukraine) </span>and communist China<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (about 30 million dead from 1959-61). Overall, in the last century almost 55 million people died in various Marxist famines and associated epidemics – a little over 10 million of them were intentionally starved to death, and the rest died as an unintended result of Marxist collectivization and agricultural policies. What is astonishing is that </span>this &quot;currency&quot; of death by Marxism is not thousands or even hundreds of thousands, but millions of deaths.This is almost incomprehensible<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – </span>it is as though the whole population of the American New England and Middle Atlantic States, or California and Texas, had been wiped out. And that around 35 million people escaped Marxist countries as refugees was an unequaled vote against Marxist utopian pretensions<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Its equivalent would be everyone fleeing California, emptying it of all human beings. There is a supremely important lesson for human life and welfare to be learned from this horrendous sacrifice to one ideology: No one can be trusted with unlimited power. </span>The more power a government has to impose the beliefs of an ideological or religious elite, or decree the whims of a dictator, the more likely human lives and welfare will be sacrificed<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>As a government's power is more unrestrained, as its power reaches into all corners of culture and society, the more likely it is to kill its own citizens<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While multiple sites of power and resistance need to be more clearly theorized than in the past, and while Marxian fixation on class struggle, the primacy of capital-labor relations, and social totality has lost its rationale, the extreme postmodern assault on macro institutions severs the connection between critique and action. Moreover, </span>to the extent that postmodernism embraces a notion of subjectivity that is decentered and fragmented, the very idea of citizenship gets obscured<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Philip Wexler argues, </span>the social, legal, and political requirements of citizen- ship were historically founded upon universal norms of democracy, freedom, and equality, but postmodernism, which blurs everything and dissolves politics into the sphere of culture and everyday life, destroys this foundation. Once the subject melts into a murky cultural diffuse- ness, into a world of images and spectacles, the elements of citizenship simply evaporate<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.56 Various democratic ideals may be kept alive within the official ideology, mainly to legitimate the electoral ritual, but they fail to resonate with the times. AsWexler concludes: ``For now, citizen- ship will remain the appropriate sign of post-modernism and semiotic society ^ a restored sign artifact that may be recycled and used so long as it does not disturb contemporary society's profound need for super- ¢ciality.</span>''57In the splintered, discontinuous world inhabited by Baurdrillard, Fou- cault, and kindred theorists, social bonds are weakened and the link between personal life and the public sphere is fractured. Where truth, language, and ideology are perpetually contested, nothing is settled or taken for granted.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While this ethos corresponds well to an era in which emphasis is placed on local knowledge and identity movements, </span>it is a depoliticizing ethos insofar as it blurs or dismisses macro forms of<span style="font-size: 8pt;">economic and political </span>power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Where the state is either ignored or broken down into a mosaic of localized and partial entities, politics too winds up obliterated. </span>Symbols and images become far more im- portant than concrete struggles involving rival claims to power, eco- nomic interests, and visions of a better society.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">58 </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change. As this ideological quagmire worsens, </span>urgent problems<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that are destroying the fabric of American society </span>will go unsolved<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- perhaps even unrecognized -- only to fester more ominouslyinto the future. And such problems (</span>ecological crisis, poverty, urban decay, spread of infectious cannot be understood outside the larger social and global context diseases,<span style="font-size: 8pt;">technological displacement ofworkers) of internationalized markets, finance, and communications</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span>Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, often inspired by localist sentiment, </span>comes at a time when agendas that ignore or side-step these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impotence<span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to the increasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. </span>By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions.74 In the meantime, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The unyielding truth is that, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited</span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates, </span>it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This last point demands further elaboration. </span>The shrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehow disappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people's lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- an already familiar dynamic in many lesser- developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world, not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat. In this way </span>the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a reassertion of politics in more virulent guise -- or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> what Hobbes anticipated: </span>the embodiment of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> those universal, collec- tive </span>interests that had vanished from civil society<span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">75 </span><br />

<strong>8. Permutation—do the plan and all mutually exclusive parts of the alternative – solves best</strong><br />
<strong>GIROUX,</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">CHAIR PROFESSORSHIP – EDUCATION AND CULTURAL STUDIES – PENN STATE, </span><strong>6</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[HENRY, ‘DIRTY DEMOCRACY AND STATE OF TERRORISM”, Comparative Studies of South Asia,163-177]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Abstracted from the ideal of public commitment, </span>the new authoritarianism represents a<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> political and economic practice and </span>form of militarism that loosen the connections among substantive democracy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, critical agency, </span>and critical education. In opposition <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to the rising tide of authoritarianism, </span>educators<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> across the globe</span> must make a case for linking learning to progressive social change<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> while struggling to pluralize and critically engage the diverse sites where public pedagogy takes place. In part, this suggests forming alliances that can make sure every sphere of social life is recognized as an important site of the political, social, and cultural struggle that is so crucial to any attempt to forge the knowledge, identifications, effective investments, and social relations that constitute political subjects and social agents capable of energizing and spreading the basis for a substantive global democracy. </span><br />
Such circumstances <strong>require</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span>pedagogy be embraced as a moral <strong>and</strong> political practice<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, one that is directive and not dogmatic, an outgrowth of struggles designed </span>to resist the increasing depoliticization of political culture that is the hallmark of the current Bush revolution. Education is the terrain where consciousness is shaped<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, needs are constructed, </span>and the capacity for<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> individual self-reflection and </span><strong>broad social change</strong> is nurtured<span style="font-size: 8pt;">and produced. Education has assumed an unparalleled significance in shaping the language, values, and ideologies that legitimize the structures and organizations that support the imperatives of global capitalism. Efforts to reduce it to a technique or methodology set aside, education remains a crucial site for the production and struggle over those pedagogical and political conditions that provide the possibilities for people to develop forms of agency that enable them individually and collectively to intervene in the processes through which the material relations of power shape the meaning and practices of their everyday lives. Within the current historical context, struggles over power take on a symbolic and discursive as well as a material and institutional form. The struggle over education is about more than the struggle over meaning and identity; it is also about how meaning, knowledge, and values are produced, authorized, and made operational within economic and structural relations of power. Education is not at odds with politics; it is an important and crucial element in any definition of the political and offers not only the theoretical tools for a systematic critique of authoritarianism but also a language of possibility for creating actual movements for democratic social change and a new biopolitics that affirms life rather than death, shared responsibility rather than shared fears, and engaged citizenship rather than the stripped-down values of consumerism.</span>At stake here is combining symbolic forms <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and processes </span>conducive to democratization with<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> broader social contexts and the </span><strong>institutional formations</strong> of power itself. The <strong>key point</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> here </span>is to <span style="font-size: 8pt;">understand and </span>engage educational<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and pedagogical </span>practices from the point of <span style="font-size: 8pt;">view of </span>how they are bound up with larger relations of power. Educators<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, students, and parents </span>need to be clearer about how power works through<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and in texts, </span>representations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and discourses, </span><strong>while at the same time</strong> recognizing <span style="font-size: 8pt;">that </span>power <strong>cannot be limited</strong> to the study of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> representations and </span>discourses, even at the level of public policy. Changing consciousness is <strong>not the same</strong> as <strong>altering the institutional basis of oppression</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; at the same time, institutional </span>reform c<strong>annot take place</strong> without a change in consciousness capable of recognizing not only injustice but also the <strong>very possibility for reform</strong>, the capacity to reinvent the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> conditions [End Page 176] and </span><strong>practices</strong> that make a <strong>more just future possible</strong>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In addition, it is crucial to raise questions about the relationship between pedagogy and civic culture, on the one hand, and what it takes for individuals and social groups to believe that they have any responsibility whatsoever even to address the realities of class, race, gender, and other specific forms of domination, on the other hand. For too long, the progressives have ignored that the strategic dimension of politics is inextricably connected to questions of critical education and pedagogy, to what it means to acknowledge that education is always tangled up with power, ideologies, values, and the acquisition of both particular forms of agency and specific visions of the future. The primacy of critical pedagogy to politics, social change, and the radical imagination in such dark times is dramatically captured by the internationally renowned sociologist Zygmunt Bauman. He writes, Adverse odds may be overwhelming, and yet a democratic (or, as Cornelius Castoriadis would say, an autonomous) society knows of no substitute for education and self-education as a means to influence the turn of events that can be squared with its own nature, while that nature cannot be preserved for long without &quot;critical pedagogy&quot;—an education sharpening its critical edge, &quot;making society feel guilty&quot; and &quot;stirring things up&quot; through stirring human consciences. The fates of freedom, of democracy that makes it possible while being made possible by it, and of education that breeds dissatisfaction with the level of both freedom and democracy achieved thus far, are inextricably connected and not to be detached from one another. One may view that intimate connection as another specimen of a vicious circle—but it is within that circle that human hopes and the chances of humanity are inscribed, and can be nowhere else.59</span><br />
<br />
<strong>This strategy is comparatively better than radical rejection—our modest demand is able to subvert the dominant ideology from within without devolving a paralyzing search for moral purity.</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The dialectical tension between the vulnerability and invulnerability of the system also enables us to denounce the ultimate racist and/or sexist trick, that of &quot;Two birds in the bush instead of a bird in the hand&quot;: when women demand simple equality, quasi-&quot;feminists&quot; often pretend to offer them &quot;much more&quot; (the role of the warm and wise &quot;conscience of society&quot; elevated above the vulgar everyday competition and struggle for domination... )the only proper answer to this offer, of course, is &quot;No thanks! Better is the enemy of the good! We do not want more just equality!&quot; Here, at least, the last lines in Now Voyager (&quot;Why reach for the moon, when we can have the stars?&quot;) are wrong. It is homologous with the Native American who wants to become integrated into the predominant &quot;white&quot; society. And a politically correct progressive liberal endeavors to convince him that he is thereby renouncing his very unique prerogative. The authentic native culture and tradition- no thanks, simple equality is enough. 1 also wouldn't mind my part of consumerist alienation!... </span>A modest demand of the excluded group for the full participation at the society's universal rights is much more threatening for the system than the apparently much more &quot;radical&quot; rejection of the predominant &quot;social values<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; and the assertion of the superiority of one's own culture. For a true feminist, Otto Weininger's assertion that, although women are &quot;ontologically false,&quot; lacking the proper ethical stature, they should be acknowledged the same rights as men in public life is infinitely more acceptable than the false elevation of women that makes them too good for the banality of men's rights. Finally, </span>the point about inherent transgression is not that every opposition, every attempt at subversion, is automatically &quot;co-opted.&quot; On the contrary, the very fear of being co-opted that makes us search for more and more &quot;radical&quot;, &quot;pure&quot; attitudes, is the supreme strategy of suspension or marginalization<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The point is rather that </span>the true subversion is not always where it seems to be<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Sometimes. _a </span>small distance is much more explosive for the system than an ineffective radical rejection. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In religion, a small heresy can be more threatening than an outright atheism or passage to another religion; </span>for a hard-line Stalinist, a Trotskyite is infinitely more threatening than a bourgeois liberal or a social democrat<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as le Carre put it, </span>one true revisionist in the central committee is worth more than a thousand dissidents outside it<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span> It was easy to dismiss<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Gorbachev </span>for aiming only at proving the system, making it more efficient- he nonetheless set in motion its disintegration. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">So one should also bear in mind the obverse of the inherent transgression: one is tempted to paraphrase Freud's claim from The Ego and the Id that man is not only much more immoral than he believes, but also much more moral than he knows- </span>the system is not only infinitely more resistant than invulnerable than it may appear (it can co-opt apparently subversive strategies, they can serve as its support). It is also infinitely more vulnerable (a small revision etc. can have a larger unforeseen catastrophic consequences)<br />

Marx utilizes the Hegelian dialectic in his attempt to prove that capitalism will inevitably collapse from the crisis of overproduction and the class conflict caused by enmiseration and alienation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Capitalism, he felt, would inevitably be replaced by socialism. Marx died waiting for this revolution to come about, and it never has. </span>Even the Russian and Chinese revolutions cannot be viewed as results of capitalism collapsing,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nor can they be seen as socialist states because they retain post-revolution ary class structures and are not radical democracies. While Rosa Luxemberg wrote that while the capitalism will inevitably consume itself and that socialism is a possible option</span>, I go so far as to question the Marxist logic that capitalism is doomed to collapse. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The capitalist that Marx evokes in his work is only a caricature of the behavior of capitalists and does not reflect reality as history has shown it to be. </span>Successful capitalists are smart enough to plan for long-term profits in addition to the short-term.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Like anyone else, </span>they will make mistakes and learn from them.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There is a Darwinian process to capitalism, and those unable to account for factors beyond their short-term profits will be replaced by those who can. How many buffalo-fur coat business es do we see? </span>Despite the various crises of the past century, capitalism thrives and shows no major signs of strain. Despite Marx's predictions, capitalism is perfectly capable of inventing new markets to replace saturated ones<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If stereo manufacturers can no longer find a market for their goods, they close down and invest their money in a new industry, such as cable television or computers. </span>The crisis of overproduction will never happen because capitalism is flexible and will sacrifice it's short t rm goals to achieve its long term ones. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Marx also never took into account the effect government regulation and welfare would have on the capitalist system. </span>Any business naturally desires monopolies over its markets, but when that is achieved, the consequences are disastrous. The final stage of capitalism, in which trusts and monopolies prevent the economy from running naturally and efficiently, has been prevented by legislation and unionization<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. None of the problems Marx predicted are unavoidable as long as we do not sink to the level of sharks.</span><br />

The<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> average </span>quality of life for humans, particularly for women and children, has improved in the past hundred years, and many of the advances are causally related to capitalism<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>There are three categories of objective improvement of quality of life: material, moral, and political. Material Improvements Include physical changes in life and work, such as changes in<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the amount and strenuousness of physical labor, </span>the availability of food, clean water, and decent shelter the degree of violence suffered, as well as the disease burden. By moral advances I mean the degree to which human individuals are treated in a dignified and decent manner<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as worthy of respect in their own right, and as responsible, autonomous self-owners. </span>By political advances I mean the degree to which individuals have a voice in the government of their communities and nations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These three categories encompass the objective list of interests that I claim all humans have. While it is not possible to quantify or measure each of these categories, I can make some generalizations about the progress m quality of life over the past century. </span>For virtually every interest, the quality of life has improved under capitalism<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<strong>Reasons to Prefer:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A) Empiricism is the best model for interpreting IR – provides falsifiability, leads to effective theorizing, and is used by policymakers now</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Fischer 98</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University (Frank, “BEYOND EMPIRICISM: POLICY INQUIRY IN POSTPOSITIVIST PERSPECTIVE”, Published in Policy Studies Journal, Vol. 26. No.1 (Spring, 1998): 129-146) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Neopositivism (or logical empiricism) has supplied the epistemological ideals of the contemporary social and policy sciences (Hawkesworth 1988; </span>A theory of knowledge put forth to explain the concepts and methods of the physical and natural sciences,neopositivism has given shape as well to a social science in pursuit quantitatively replicable causal generalizations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Fay 1975). Most easily recognized as the stuff of the research methodology textbook, </span>neopositivist principles emphasize empirical research designs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>the use of sampling techniques and data gathering procedures<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>the measurement of outcomes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>and the development of causal models with predictive power<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Miller 1993; Bobrow and Dryzek 1987). In the field of policy analysis</span>, such an orientation is manifested in quasi-experimental research designs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>multiple regression analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>survey research<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>input-output studies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>cost-benefit analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>operations research<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>mathematical simulation models<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>and systems analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Putt and Springer, 1989; Sylvia, et al. 1991). </span>The only reliable approach to knowledge accumulation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, according to this epistemology</span>, is empirical falsification through objective hypothesis-testing of rigorously formulated causal generalizations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Popper, 1959: Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith 1992:231; Hofferbert 1990). </span>The goal is to generate a body of empirical generalizations capable of explaining behavior across social and historical contexts, whether communities, societies, or cultures, independently of specific times, places, or circumstances<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Not only are such propositions essential to social and political explanation, they are seen to make possible effective solutions to societal problems.Such propositions are<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> said </span>to supply the cornerstones of theoretical progress. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Underlying this effort is a fundamental positivist principle mandating a rigorous separation of facts and values, the principle of the &quot;fact-value dichotomy&quot; (Bernstein 1976; Proctor 1991). According to this principle, </span>empirical research is to proceed independently of normative context or implications.Because only empirically based causal knowledge can qualify social science as a genuine &quot;scientific&quot; endeavor, social scientists are instructed to assume a &quot;value-neutral&quot; orientation and to limit their research investigations to empirical or &quot;factual&quot; phenomena<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even though adherence to this &quot;fact-value dichotomy&quot; varies in the conduct of actual research, especially at the methodological level, the separation still reigns in the social sciences. </span>To be judged as methodologically valid, research must at least officially pay its respects to the principle<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Fischer 1980). </span>In the policy sciences the attempt to separate facts and values has facilitated a<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> technocratic </span>form of policy analysis that emphasizes the efficiency and effectiveness of means to achieve politically established goals<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Much of policy analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in this respect, </span>has sought to translate inherently normative political and social issues into<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> technically </span>defined ends to be pursued through administrative means<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In an effort to sidestep goal-value conflicts typically associated with policy issues, </span>economic and social problems are interpreted as issues in need of improved management and program design<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span>their solutions are to be found in the technical applications of the policy sciences <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Amy 1987). Often associated </span>with this orientation has been a belief in the superiority of scientific decision-making<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Reflecting a subtle antipathy toward democratic processes, terms such as &quot;pressures&quot; and &quot;expedient adjustments&quot; are used to denigrate pluralistic policymaking. If politics doesn't fit into the methodological scheme, then politics is the problem. </span>Some have<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even </span>argued<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span>the political system<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> itself must </span>be changed to better accommodate policy analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Heineman et al. 1990). In the face of limited empirical successes, </span>neopositivists<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have had to give some ground. Although they </span>continue to stress rigorous empirical research as the long-run solution <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to their failures, they have retreated from their more ambitious efforts. </span>Today their goal is to aim for propositions that are at least theoretically proveable at some future point in time.An argument propped up by the promise of computer advances<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>it serves to keep the original epistemology in tack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But the modification misses the point, as postpositivists are quick to point out. The problem is more fundamentally rooted in the empirical social scientists's misunderstanding of the nature of the social. As we shall see, it is a misunderstanding lodged in the very concept of a generalizable, value-free objectivity that neopositivists seek to reaffirm and more intensively apply.</span><br />

<strong>B) A constructivist framework divorces the neg from empirics and does not lead to shifts away from realism</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Copenhagen school thus emphasizes the need to understand the “speech acts” that accomplish a process of securitization. Their focus is on the linguistic and conceptual dynamics involved, even though they recognize the importance of the institutional setting within which securitization takes place. </span>The concept of securitization offers some important insights for security studies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, it is too epistemologically restricted to contribute to a significant retooling of security studies. On the positive side, </span>it draws attention to the way in which security agendas are constructed by politicians and other political actors. It also indicates the utility of discourse analysis as an additional tool of analysis for security studies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>However, at best, securitization studies can constitute one aspect of security studies. It cannot provide the foundations for a paradigm shift in the subdiscipline. Its greatest weakness is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its epistemological hypochondria, that is, </span>its tendency to reify epistemological problems and push sound observations about knowledge claims to their logical absurdity. Although it is important to understand the discursive moves involved in perceptions of security in, say, the Middle East, it is also necessary to make some assessment of nondiscursive factors like the military balance<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or access to freshwater supplies. For the Copenhagen school, however, </span>these nondiscursive factors are relegated to second place. They are considered only to the extent that they facilitate or impede the speech ac<span style="font-size: 8pt;">t. In this way, </span>the Copenhagen school is in danger of cutting security studies off from serious empirical research and setting it adrift on a sea of floating signifiers.<br />

<strong>3. Turn – Uncertainty justifies realism – even under a cooperative framework, the malleability of discourse proves that leaders will always calculate action based on capability</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Copeland 6</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Associate Professor and Director Dept. of Government and Foreign Affairs @ University of Virginia (Dale, “The Constructivist Challenge to Structural Realism: A Review Essay”, Constructivism and International Relations, Alexander Wendt and His Critics)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Notwithstanding </span>Wendt’s<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> important contributions to international relations theory, his </span>critique of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> structural </span>realism<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has inherent flaws. Most important, it </span>does not adequately address a critical aspect of the realist worldview<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span><strong>the problem of uncertainty.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For structural realists, it is </span>states’ uncertainty about the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> present and especially the </span>future intentions of othersthat makes<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the levels and trends in </span>relative power such fundamental causal variables<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Contrary to Wendt’s claim that realism must smuggle in states with differently constituted interests to explain why systems sometimes fall into conflict, neorealists argue that </span>uncertainty about the other’s present interests<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>whether the other is driven by security or nonsecurity motives<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span><strong>can be enough to lead security-seeking states to fight</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This problem is exacerbated by </span>the incentives that actors have to deceive one another, an issue Wendt does not address. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yet even when states are fairly sure that the other is also a security seeker, they know that it might change its spots later on. States must therefore worry about any decline in their power, lest the other turn aggressive after achieving superiority. Wendt’s building of a systemic </span>constructivist theory<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—and his bracketing of unit-level processes—</span>thus presents<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> him with </span>an ironic dilemma<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>It is the very mutability of polities as emphasized by domestic-level constructivists<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>that states may change because of domestic processes independent of international interaction<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>that makes prudent leaders so concerned about the future<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>If diplomacy can have only a limited effect<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on another’s character or regime type,</span> <strong>then leaders must calculate the other’s potential to attack later should it acquire motives for expansion</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In such an environment of future uncertainty, levels and trends in relative power will thus act as a key constraint on state behavior. The problem of uncertainty complicates Wendt’s efforts to show that anarchy has no particular logic, but only three different ideational instantiations in history—as Hobbesian, Lockean, or Kantian cultures, depending on the level of actor compliance to certain behavioral norms. By differentiating these cultures in terms of the degree of cooperative behavior exhibited by states, </span>Wendt’s analysis reinforcesthe very dilemma underpinning the realist argument<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>If the other is acting cooperatively, how is one to know whether this reflects its peaceful character, or is just a façade <strong>masking aggressive desires</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Wendt’s discussion of the different degrees of internalization of the three cultures only exacerbates the problem. </span>What drives behavior at the <strong>lower levels of internalization</strong> is precisely what is not shared between actors—their private incentives to comply for short-term selfish reasons.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This suggests that </span>the neorealist and neoliberal paradigm<span style="font-size: 8pt;">s, both of which emphasize the role of uncertainty when internalization is low or nonexistent, </span>remain strong competitors to constructivism in explaining changing levels of cooperation through history<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And because </span>Wendt provides little empirical evidence to support his view<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in relation to these competitors, the debate over which paradigm possesses greater explanatory power is still an open one. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Second, Wendt’s view is inconsistent with his recognition that </span>states<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often do </span>have<strong>difficulty learning about the other</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The very problem Ego and Alter have in first communicating is that ‘behavior does not speak for itself. It must be interpreted, and ‘<strong>many interpretations are possible’</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (330). This point is reinforced by </span>Wendt’s epistemological point<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of departure: </span>that the ideas held by actors are ‘unobservable’<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (chap. 2). </span>Because leaders cannot observe<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> directly </span>what the other is thinking, they are resigned to making inferences from its behavior. Yet in security affa<span style="font-size: 8pt;">irs, as Wendt acknowledges, </span>mistakes in inferences—assuming the other is peaceful when in fact it has malevolent intentions—could prove ‘<strong>fatal’</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (360). Wendt accepts that the problem facing rational states ‘is making sure that they perceive other actors, and other actors’ perception of them, correctly’ (334, emphasis in original). Yet the book provides no mechanism through which Ego and Alter can increase their confidence in the correctness of their estimates of the other’s type. </span>Simply describing how Ego and Alter shape each other’s sense of self and other is not enough<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.21 </span>Rational choice models<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, using assumptions consistent with structural realism, </span><strong>do much better here</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In games of incomplete information, where states are unsure about the other’s type, actions by security-seeking actors that would be too costly for greedy actors to adopt can help states reduce their uncertainty about present intentions, thus moderating the security dilemma.22 </span>Wendt cannot simply argue that over time states can learn a great deal about other states<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>It is what is not ‘shared’, at least in the area of intentions, that remains the core stumbling block to cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Third, </span>Wendt’s position<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that the problem of other minds is not much of a problem </span>ignores<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a fundamental issue in all social relations, but especially in those between states, namely, </span><strong>the problem of deception</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In making estimates of the other’s present type, </span>states have reason to be suspicious of its diplomatic gestures<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>the other may be trying to deceive them<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Wendt’s analysis is rooted in the theory of symbolic interactionism, but he does not discuss one critical aspect of that tradition: the idea of ‘impression management’. </span>Actors in their relations exploit the problem of other minds <strong>for their own ends.</strong> On the public stage, they present images and play roles that often have little to do with their <strong>true beliefs and interests backstage</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.23 In laying out his dramaturgical view of Ego and Alter co-constituting each other’s interests and identities, Wendt assumes that both Ego and Alter are making genuine efforts to express their true views and to ‘cast’ the other in roles that they believe in. But </span>deceptive actors will stage-manage the situation to create impressions that serve their narrow ends, and other actors, especially in world politics, will understand this<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.24 Thus </span>a prudent security-seeking Ego will have difficulty distinguishing between two scenarios: whether it and Alter do indeed share a view of each other as peaceful, or whether Alter is just pretending to be peaceful in order to make Ego think that they share a certain conception of the world, when in fact they do not<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.25 </span>Wendt’s analysis offers no basis for saying when peaceful gestures should be taken at face value<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and when they should be discounted as deceptions.26 </span>When we consider the implications of a <strong>Hitlerite state deceiving others to achieve a position of military superiority</strong>, we understand why great powers in history have tended to adopt postures of <strong>prudent mistrust.</strong><br />

<strong>5. Turn - Rejecting strategic predictions of threats makes them inevitable – decision makers will rely on preconceived conceptions of threat rather than the more qualified predictions of analysts</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Fitzsimmons, 07</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Michael, Washington DC defense analyst, “The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning”, Survival, Winter 06-07, online)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But handling even this weaker form of uncertainty is still quite challeng- ing. If not sufficiently bounded, a high degree of variability in planning factors can exact a significant price on planning. The complexity presented by great variability strains the cognitive abilities of even the most sophisticated decision- makers.15 And even a robust decision-making process sensitive to cognitive limitations necessarily sacrifices depth of analysis for breadth as variability and complexity grows. </span>It should follow, then, that in planning under conditions of risk, variability in strategic calculation should be carefully tailored to available analytic and decision processes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Why is this important? What harm can an imbalance between complexity and cognitive or analytic capacity in strategic planning bring? </span>Stated simply, where analysis is silent or inadequate, <strong>the personal beliefs of decision-makers</strong> <strong>fill the void</strong>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As political scientist Richard Betts found in a study of strategic sur- prise, in ‘an environment that lacks clarity, abounds with conflicting data, and allows no time for rigorous assessment of sources and validity, ambiguity allows intuition or wishfulness to drive interpretation ... </span>The greater the ambiguity, the greater the impact of preconceptions.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">’16 The decision-making environment that Betts describes here is one of political-military crisis, not long-term strategic planning. </span>But a strategist who sees uncertainty as the central fact of his environ- ment brings upon himself some of the pathologies of crisis decision-making. He invites ambiguity, takes conflicting data for granted and <strong>substitutes a priori scepticism about the validity of prediction</strong> for time pressure as a rationale for discounting the importance of analytic rigour.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is important not to exaggerate the extent to which data and ‘rigorous assessment’ can illuminate strategic choices. Ambiguity is a fact of life, and scepticism of analysis is necessary. Accordingly, the intuition and judgement of decision-makers will always be vital to strategy, and attempting to subordinate those factors to some formulaic, deterministic decision-making model would be both undesirable and unrealistic. All the same, there is danger in the opposite extreme as well. Without careful analysis of what is relatively likely and what is relatively unlikely, what will be the possible bases for strategic choices? </span>A decision-maker with no faith in prediction is left with little more than a set of worst-case scenarios and his existing beliefs about the world to confront the choices before him. Those beliefs may be more or less well founded, but if they are not made explicit and subject to analysis and debate regarding their application to particular strategic contexts, they remain only beliefs and premises, rather than rational judgements.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Even at their best, such decisions are likely to be poorly understood by the organisations charged with their implementation. At their worst, such decisions may be poorly understood by the decision-makers themselves</span><br />

<strong>Ungar,</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">president – Goucher College, 200</span><strong>5</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[sanford, “compassion fatigue: the next wave?”, winter, www.goucher.edu/x4726.xml</span><span style="color: green; font-size: 8pt;">]</span><br />
<br />
There is a temptation to worry that before long, we will be hit by<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> one more severe case of what has come to be known as </span>“compassion fatigue”—<span style="font-size: 8pt;">a </span>deadening of our sensibilities by the unrelenting bombardment of shallow and sensationalist media coverage of disease, famine, death, and war<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Susan D. Moeller, a well-traveled observer who now teaches at the University of Maryland, has written tellingly of this phenomenon. “Through a choice of language and images,” she says, “the newest event is represented as more extreme than a similar past situation.” When we use the same extreme words to describe very different events, we undermine our ability to differentiate among them. Our sense of tragedy and cataclysm can be ratcheted only so high before we simply become overwhelmed. Some news organizations try to hold our attention by personalizing the events—pointing out, for example, that U.S. citizens perished in the tsunami, or drawing comparisons between this disaster overseas and others closer to home. But eventually, a limit is reached, and our ability to identify and sympathize disappears. Reporting the more troubling events of the world without turning people off is a tricky proposition, even when it’s done well. I recently attended a gathering of higher education leaders that was addressed by a well-regarded political pundit from Washington. He was sharply critical of my alma mater, National Public Radio, for its overcoverage of international problems. “Why, to listen to NPR,” he complained, “you would think that there is trouble everywhere. It’s exhausting.” Visitors from across the country—sufferers all from compassion fatigue, I suppose—nodded their heads in agreement. “</span>Well,”<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I said, as I attempted to confront him later</span>, “there <strong>really is a lot to worry about</strong> in the world, and someone has to call our attention to it.” <span style="font-size: 8pt;">He was not about to be persuaded, preferring instead to focus on the customary agenda of parochial issues facing Americans. </span>There’s a <strong>real danger in that attitude</strong>. If we allowour exhaustion to keep us from thinking about global concerns, we risk ignoring <span style="font-size: 8pt;">some </span>important issues that<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> may </span>deserve a <strong>place in our consciousness</strong> alongside our domestic debates. By now it <strong>should be obvious</strong> that events and conditions around the world can have a profound impact on Main Street America.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> One would think there is </span>plenty of evidence<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to </span>make the point: the crisis- inspired fluctuation in gasoline prices<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the pump; the international shortage of steel and concrete due to the construction boom in China; and the ebb and flow of immigration to the United States on the basis of circumstances in Mexico and Central America, among other places. </span>Not to mention the consequences<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> we have all experienced, in varying ways and to varying degrees, </span>as a result of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>Iraq<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> war. The tsunami has ramifications for Americans beyond what might seem immediately apparent. It has been suggested that American generosity toward these countries with large Muslim populations could have an important restorative effect on the United States’ image throughout the Muslim world. It’s a shame it took a catastrophe like this to get us interested in what’s going on there. </span>Perhaps if we <strong>paid closer attention</strong> to the concerns of others over a sustained period of time, we would gain a better understanding of the global disparities that breed problems like terrorism—and, in the process, go a <strong>long way</strong> toward making the world safer for everyone<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>In the heat of political battle, in the midst of some of our own legitimate preoccupations, it may have become more difficult to sustain the argument that Americans’ lives are meaningfully affected by poverty, disease, and tragedy in distant, hard-to-pronounce places. But we <strong>must not turn our attention away</strong>, and we must demand that those we entrust to report the news be<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not only </span><strong>vigilant, but also responsible</strong>, in their presentation of global events. Otherwise, we will be <strong>doomed to await the tsunamis</strong> of history, literal and figurative, to help us figure out what is really going on.<br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Indeed, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">analysts increasingly criticise </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">the political consequences of an Euro-American mode of </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">representing China as a threat;<strong>10</strong></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">since Chinese security discourse is rarely analysed it is now necessary to explore the political consequences of China’s modes of self-representation and how ‘China threat theory’ is produced in the PRC. Indeed, this example will add to the critical examination of two of the main research themes of security studies: strategic culture and threat perception. To put it another way, the emergence of China is not simply an issue of international diplomacy and national security. It has important intertextual overlaps with other discourses that frame questions about China and the world, such as the dynamic between domestic and international politics, economics and politics, dangers and opportunities – as they produce Western and Chinese identity. A recent article in the popular Chinese news magazine, Liaowang, explains how China’s ‘peaceful rise’ is intimately linked with ‘China threat’ in an overlap of domestic and international politics:11 The world knows about the achievements of China’s reform and opening. But since the beginning of the 1990s, ‘China threat theory’ has been churned out from some corners of the world . . . to smear China’s image and to contain China’s rise. With the appearance of ‘peaceful rise theory’ international opinion suddenly realises the weaknesses of ‘China threat theory’. . . . Peaceful rise is the formula that sums up the essence of domestic policy and foreign relations in reform China. Indeed, the articles in this Forum likewise speak of dangers when they discuss China’s opportunities. This suggests that as in the popular Chinese phrase ‘weijicrisis’, danger (wei) and opportunity (ji) are not separate, but are intimately linked. To understand the opportunities of China, it is necessary to see how the mirror-image of peaceful rise – the China threat – shapes the image of rising China not just abroad, but within China itself. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Many writers take the</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> meaning of ‘</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">China threat’</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> as self-evident, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">and then proceed to either agree or disagree with it</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This introduction will examine the production of ‘China threat theory’ in order to provide a critical background for the discussion of China’s place in the world examined in the remaining articles. First, it will examine Western warnings of a China threat, and Chinese responses to them. Some commentators frame this as a geopolitical debate in Sino-US public diplomacy, and warn that it risks spinning out of control in a security dilemma. While I do not disagree with this concern, the essay will show that because the Chinese reaction is much stronger than the American action, something else is going on. The main purpose for these Chinese language texts is not to correct foreign misunderstandings; the key audience for ‘China threat theory’ is domestic, for identity construction in the PRC. I will argue that Chinese texts gather together a diverse and contradictory set of criticisms of the PRC and use ‘China threat theory’ discourse to collectively label them as foreign. By then refuting the ‘China threat theory’ criticisms as fallacies spread by ill-intentioned foreigners, the texts assert ‘peaceful rise’ as the proper way to understand China’s emergence on the world stage. Thus in a curious way, the negative images of the PRC that are continually circulated in Chinese texts serve to construct Chinese identity through a logic of estrangement that separates the domestic self from the foreign other. Although Chinese </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">discussions of ‘China threat theory’</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> are successful in generating national feeling within China, the discourse </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">actually tend</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> to reproduce China as a threatening power abroad because refutations of ‘China threat theory’ end up generating a new set of foreign threats.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Hence </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">rather than engaging in critical security studies to question the international order, these refutations of ‘China threat theory’ actually buttress the existing geopolitical framework of international relations</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In the conclusion, I argue that we need to question how Realism has colonised the ‘rise of China’ debate by deliberately using theory to open up critical space for the issues discussed in this Forum’s consideration of China’s rise. </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">8. Our argument is not that China <em>is</em> a threat – it’s that we should avoid either simplistic, reifying extreme. We instead point to context. </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The argument</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of this essay </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is not that China is a threat</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Rather, it has examined the productive linkages that knit together the image of China as a peacefully rising power and the discourse of China as a threat to the economic and military stability of East Asia. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It would be easy to join the chorus of those who denounce ‘China threat theory’ as</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">misguided </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">product of the Blue Team, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">as do many in China and the West. But that would be a mistake, because depending on circumstances anything –</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> from rising powers to civilian aircraft – </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">can be interpreted as a threat. Thepurpose is not to argue that interpretations are false in relation to some reality</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (such as that China is fundamentally peaceful rather than war-like), </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">but that it is necessary to unpack the</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> political and historical </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">context of each perception of threat.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Indeed, ‘China threat’ has never described a unified American understanding of the PRC: it has always been one position among many in debates among academics, public intellectuals and policymakers. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Rather than inflate extremist positions </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">(in both the West and China) into irrefutable truth, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">it is more interesting to examine the debates that produced the </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">threat/opportunity</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> dynamic</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This essay has examined how ‘China threat theory’ is enthusiastically reproduced and circulated beyond the Beltway in Chinese texts to show how Chinese elites engage in their own threat interpretations and national identity productions. Thus it underlines how ‘</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">China threat’ and ‘China opportunity’ are not </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">diametrically opposed as </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">sites of total truth or falsity;</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> threat and opportunity are intimately related as complementary opposites that entail each other. </span><br />

<strong>3. Their critique devalues life; rejecting technological thought also rejects technological innovation and dooms us to extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Heaberlin, 4</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – nuclear engineer, led the Nuclear Safety and Technology Applications Product Line at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Scott, </span>A Case for Nuclear-Generated Electricity<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, p. 31-40) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Well, then let's not do that, huh? Well, no, not hardly, </span>because without that use of fertilizers we couldn't produce the food to feed the population. We just couldn't do it.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Here are some comparisons.&quot; </span>If you used no fertilizers or pesticides you could get 500 kilograms of grain from a hectare in a dry climate and as much as 1000 kilograms in a humid cli­mate. If you got organic and used animal manure as fertilizer, assuming you could find enough, you might get as much as 2000 <span style="font-size: 5pt;">kilograms per hectare. </span>For a sense of scale, the average in the United States, <span style="font-size: 5pt;">where recall we only get half the food value to hectare as the intensively farmed Chinese crop land, </span>we get about 4500 kilograms per hectare on the average. In serious cornfields with fertilizer, irrigation, and pesticides, the value is 7000<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> kilograms per hectare. </span>Modern mechanized, chemically supported agriculture produces 7 to 14 times the food that you would get without those advantages. Even the best organic farming would produce only 30 to 45% of the food value<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> you would get from the same sized chemically fertilized farm, </span>and that is assuming you could get the manure you needed to make it work. In very stark terms, without the chemically enhanced farming we would have probably something like one-fifth the food supply we have now. That means four-fifths the population would not be fed<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, at least as we are organized now. So, no, just giving up on fertilizers is not in the deal. However, we could get the hydrogen and energy from sources other than natural gas. Nuclear energy could be used to provide electricity to extract hydrogen from water and produce the process heat required to combine the hydrogen and nitrogen from the air. That is just a thought to stick in your mind. While we are looking at energy use in agriculture, here are a few more numbers for you.10 If you look at the energy input into agriculture and the energy you get out, you see some interesting facts. By combining the energy used to make fertilizers and pesticides, power irrigation, and run the farm machinery in the United States, we use about 0.7 kcal of fossil fuel energy for each 1 kcal of food we make. This doesn't include the energy needed to process and transport the food. In Europe where they farm more intensely, the amount of energy out is just about the same as energy in. In Germany and Italy the numbers are 1.4 and 1.7 kcal energy input to each 1 kcal output respectively. The point is you need energy to feed people, well at least a lot of people. Which gets us back to Cohen and his question. One of the studies he examined looked at a &quot;self-sustaining solar energy system.&quot; For the United States, this would replace all fossil energy and provide one-fifth to one-half the current energy use. The conclusion of the study was that this would either produce&quot; a significant reduction in our standard of living ... even if all the energy conservation measures known today were adopted&quot; or if set at the current standard of living, &quot;then the ideal U.S. population should be targeted at 40-100 million people.&quot; The authors of that study then cheerfully go on to point out that we do have enough fossil fuel to last a least a century, as long as we can work out the pesky environmental problems. So, </span>you can go to a &quot;self-sustaining&quot; energy economy as long as you are willing to shoot between 2 out of 3<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> and 6 out of 7 </span>of your neighbors<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. And this is a real question. The massive use of fossil fuel driven agriculture to provide the fertilizers and pesticides, and power the farm equipment, is a) vitally important to feed everyone, and b) something we just can't keep up in a business-as-usual fashion. Sustainable means you can keep doing it. Fossil energy supplies are finite; you will run out some time. Massive use of fossil energy and the greenhouse gases they produce also may very well tip the planet into one of those extinction events in which a lot of very bad things happen to a lot of the life on the earth. O.K. to Cohen's big question, how many people can the earth support? What it comes down to is that the &quot;Well, it depends&quot; answer depends on • what quality of life you will accept, • what level of technology you will use, and • what level of social integration you will accept. We have seen some of the numbers regarding quality of life. Clearly if you are willing to accept the Bangladesh diet, you can feed 1.8 times more people than if you chose the United States diet. If you choose the back-to-nature, live like our hearty forefathers, level of technology, you can feed perhaps one-fifth as many people as you can with modern chemical fertilized agriculture. The rest have to go. And here is the tough one. You can do a lot better, get a lot more people on the planet, if you just force a few things. Like, no more land wasted in growing grapes for wine or grains for whiskey and beer. No cropland used for tobacco. No more grain wasted on animals for meat, just grain for people. No more rich diets for the rich countries, share equally for everyone. No more trade barriers; too bad for the farmers in Japan and France, those countries would just have to accept their dependence on other countries for their food. It is easy to see that at least some of those might actually be a pretty good thing; however, the kicker is how do you get them to happen? After all, Mussolinill did make the trains run on time. How could you force these things without a totalitarian state? Are you willing to give up your ability to choose for yourself for the common good? It is not pretty, is it? </span>Cohen looked at all the various population estimates and concluded that most fell into the range of 4 to 16 billion<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Taking the highest value when researchers offered a range, Cohen calculated a high median of 12 billion and taking the lower part of the range a low median of 7.7 billion. The good news in this is 12 billion is twice as many people as we have now. The bad news is that the projections for world population for 2050 are between 7.8 and 12.5 billion. That means </span>we have got no more than 50 years before we exceed the nominal carrying capacity of the earth.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Cohen also offers a qualifying observation by stating the &quot;First Law of Information,&quot; which asserts that 97.6% of all statistics are made up. This helps us appreciate that application of these numbers to real life is subject to a lot of assumptions and insufficiencies in our understanding of the processes and data. However, we can draw some insights from all of this. </span>What it comes down to is that if you choose the fully sustainable, non-fossil fuel long-term options with only limited social integration, the various estimates Cohen looked at give you a number like 1 billion or less people that the earth can support. That means 5 out of 6 of us have got to go, plus no new babies without an offsetting death. On the other hand, if you let technology continue to do its thing and perhaps get even better, the picture need not be so bleak. We haven't made all our farmland as productive as it can be.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Remember, the Chinese get twice the food value per hectare as we do in the United States. </span>There is also a lot of land that would become arable if we could get water to it. And, of course<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, in case you need to go back and check the title of this book, </span>there are alternatives to fossil fuels to provide the energy to power that technology. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">So given a positive and perhaps optimistic view of technology, we can look to some of the high technology assumption based studies from Cohen's review. From the semi-credible set of these, we can find estimates from 19 to 157 billion as the number of people the earth could support with a rough average coming in about 60 billion. This is a good time to be reminded of the First Law of Information. The middle to lower end of this range, however, might be done without wholesale social reprogramming. Hopefully we would see the improvement in the quality of life in the developing countries as they industrialize and increase their use of energy. Hopefully, also this would lead to a matching of the reduction in fertility rates that has been observed in the developed countries, which in turn would lead to an eventual balancing of the human population. The point to all this is </span>the near-term future of the human race depends on technology. If we turn away from technology, a very large fraction of the current and future human race will starve. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">If we just keep on as we are, with our current level of technology and dependence on fossil fuel resources, in the near term it will be a race between fertility decrease and our ability to feed ourselves, with, frankly, disaster the slight odds-on bet. In a slightly longer term, dependence on fossil fuels has got to lead to either social chaos or environmental disaster. There are no other end points to that road. It doesn't go anywhere else. </span>However, if we accept that it is technology that makes us human, that technology uniquely identifies us as the only animal that can choose its future, we can choose to live, choose to make it a better world for everyone and all life. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">This means more and better technology. It means more efficient technology that is kinder to the planet but also allows humans to support large numbers in a high quality of life. That road is not easy and has a number of ways to screw up. However, it is a road that can lead to a happier place, a better place. Two Concluding Thoughts on the Case for Technology Two more points and I will end my defense of technology. First, I want to bring you back from all the historical tour and all the numbers about population to something more directly personal. Let me ask you two questions. What do you do for a living? What did you have for breakfast? Don't see any connection between these questions or of their connection to•the subject of technology? Don't worry, the point will come out shortly. I am just trying to bring the idea of technology back from this grand vision to its impact on your daily life. Just as a wild guess, your answer to the first question was something that, say 500 years ago, didn't even exist. If we look 20,000 years ago, the only job was&quot; get food.&quot; Even if you have a really directly socially valuable job like a medical doctor, 20,000 years ago you would have been extraneous. That is, the tribe couldn't afford you. What, no way! A doctor could save lives, surely a tribe would value such a skill. Well, sure, but the tribe could not afford taking one of their members out of the productive <em>/I</em> getting the food&quot; job for 20 years while that individual learned all those doctor skills. If you examine the &quot;what you do for a living&quot; just a bit I think you will see a grand interconnectedness of all things. I personally find it pretty remarkable that we have a society that values nuclear engineers enough that I can make a living at it. Think about it. Somehow what I have done has been of enough value that, through various taxpayer and utility ratepayers, society has given me enough money for food and shelter. The tribe 20,000 years ago wouldn't have put up with me for a day. You see, that is why we as humans are successful, wildly successful in fact. We work together. &quot;Yeah, sure we do,&quot; you reply, &quot; read a newspaper lately?&quot; Well, <em>O.K.,</em> we fuss and fight a good deal and some of us do some pretty stupid and pretty mean things. But the degree of cooperation is amazing if you just step back a bit. O.K., what did you have for breakfast: orange juice, coffee, toast, maybe some cereal and milk? Where do these things come from? Orange juice came from Florida or California. Coffee came from South America. Bread for the toast came perhaps from Kansas; cereal, from the Mid-West somewhere. The jam on the toast may have come from Oregon, or maybe Chile. Milk is probably the only thing that came from within a hundred miles of your breakfast table. Think about it. There were hundreds of people involved in your breakfast. Farmers, food-processing workers, packaging manufacturers, transportation people, energy producers, wholesale and retail people. Perhaps each one only spent a second on their personal contribution to your personal breakfast, but they touch thousands of other people's breakfasts as well. In turn, you buying the various components of your breakfast supported, in your part, all those people. They in turn, in some way or another, bought whatever you provide to society that allowed you to buy breakfast. Pretty amazing, don't you think? Now when you look at all that, </span>think about what ties all the planetwide interconnection,<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Yep, you guessed it: technology.</span> Without technology, you get what is available within your personal reach, and what you produce is available only to those who are near enough that you can personally carry it to them on your own two feet. Technology makes our world work. It gives you personally a productive and socially valuable way to make both a living and to provide your contribution to the rest of us<strong>.</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;"> I want you to stop a minute and really think about that. </span>What would your life be like without technology? Could you do what you currently do? Would anyone be able to use what you do? Would anyone pay you for that?<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> &quot;But I am a school teacher,&quot; you say, &quot;of course, they would pay me!&quot; Are you sure? Why do you need schools if there is no technology? All I need is to teach the kid how to farm and how to hunt. Sons and daughters can learn that by working in the fields along with their parents. See what I mean? Now, I have hopefully reset your brain. Sure, you are still going to be hit with daily &quot;technology is bad&quot; messages. </span>Hopefully, you are<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> a bit more shielded against that din, and you have been given some perspective to balance that message and are </span>prepared to see the true critical value of technology to human existence.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> The point is that </span>technology is what makes us human. Without it, we are just slightly smarter monkeys. You may feel that 6 billion of us are too many, and that may very well be<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>I<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> personally </span>don't know how to make that value decision<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>Which particular person does one select as being one of the excess ones<span style="font-size: 5pt;">? </span>However, the fact is that there are 6 billion of us, and it looks like we are headed for 10 to 12 billion in the next 50 years<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, </span>Without not only the technology we have, but significantly better and more environmentally friendly technology, the world is going to get ugly<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> as we approach these numbers, On the other hand, </span>with the right technologies we can not only support those numbers, we can do it while we close the gap between the haves and have-nots. We can make it a better place for everyone. It takes technology and the energy to drive it.Choosing technology is what we have to do to secure the evolutionary selection of us as a successful species<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, Remember, some pages back in discussing the unlikely evolutionary path to us, I said </span>weare not the chosen, unless. Unless we choose us<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. This is what I meant. We are totally unique in all of evolutionary history. </span>We humans have the unique ability and opportunity to choose either our evolutionary success or failure. A choice of technology gives us a chance. A choice rejecting technology dooms us as a species and gives the cockroaches the chance in our place<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>Nature doesn't care what survives<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, algae seas, dinosaurs, humans, cockroaches, or whatever is successful. </span>If we care, we have to choose correctly.<span style="font-size: 5pt;">As an aside, let me address a point of philosophy here. If any of this offends your personal theology, I offer this for your consideration. Genesis tells us God gave all the Earth to humanity and charged us with the stewardship thereof. So it is ours to use as well as we can. That insightful social philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli put it this way in 1501: &quot;What remains to be done must be done by you; since in order not to deprive us of our free will and such share of glory as belongs to us, God will not do everything Himself.&quot; <em>O.K.,</em> you are saying, &quot;I give.&quot; You have beaten the socks off me. Technology is good; technology is the identifying human trait and our only hope. But what is this stuff about choosing technology or not? Technology just happens doesn't it? I mean, technology always advances, it always has, so why the big deal? </span>Well, that is my last point on technology. It doesn't always just happen, and people have chosen to turn away from technology. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">In what might have seemed at the time to be a practical social decision, huge future implications were imposed on many generations to come. It has happened. Let me take you on one more trip through history. I think you will find it enlightening. In <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel,</em> Jared Diamond explores the question of why the European societies came to be dominate over all the other human cultures on earth. It is a fascinating story and provides a lot of insight into how modern societies evolved. In moving through history, he comes across a very odd discontinuity. He observes that if you came to earth from space in the year 1400 A.D., looked around, and went home to write your research paper on the probable future of the earth, you would clearly conclude the Chinese would run the entire planet shortly. Furthermore, you could conclude they would do it pretty darn well. If those same extraterrestrial researchers were to pop into their time machine and come back to earth in any year from say 1800 to now, they would be totally amazed to see China as a large, but relatively backward, country, struggling to catch up with their European and American peers. To understand the significance of this, you have to go on that research trip with the extraterrestrials and look at China before 1400. In <em>The Lever af Riches,</em> Joel Mokyr dedicates one chapter looking at the comparisons of technology development in China to that in Europe. He lists the following as technology advantages China had in the centuries before 1400: • Extensive water control projects, alternately draining and irrigating land, significantly boosting agricultural production • Sophisticated iron plow introduced sixth century B.C. • Seed drills and other farm tools, introduced around 1000 <em>A.D.</em> • Chemical and organic fertilizers and pesticides used • Blast furnaces and casting of iron as early as 200 B.C., not known in Europe until fourteenth century • Advanced use of power sources in textile production, not seen in Europe until the Industrial Revolution • Invention of compass around 960 A.D. • Major advances in maritime technology (more in a bit on this) • Invention of paper around 100 A.D. (application as toilet paper by <em>590 A.D.).</em> In the year 1400 AD., China was a world power, perhaps the only true world power. Their technology in agriculture, textiles, metallurgy, and maritime transportation were far in advance of any other country. They had a strong central government and a very healthy economy. Their naval strength provides a real insight into the degree of this dominance. Dr. Diamond sends us to an extremely readable book <em>When China Ruled the Seas-The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne 1405-1433</em> by Dr. Louise Levathes. Dr. Levathes takes us on an inside tour of the Chinese empire during these years. She focuses on the great treasure fleets that China set forth in these early years of the fifteenth century. In her book she has a wonderful graphic that overlays a Chinese vessel of the treasure fleet (-1410) with Columbus's <em>St. Maria</em> (1492). At 85 feet in length and three masts, the <em>St. Maria</em> is dwarfed by the nine-masted, 400-foot-long Chinese vessel. The Chinese sailed fleets of these magnificent vessels throughout oceans of South Asia, to India, and even as far as the eastern coast of Africa. With this naval domination China claimed tribute from Japan, Korea, the nations of the Malay Archipelago, and various states within what is now India. Through both trade and the occasional application of military force, China provided an enlightened and progressive direction for all the nations within this sphere of influence. If two princes in India were fighting over a throne, it was the recognition, or lack thereof, from the Chinese emperor that decided who would rule. Setting a policy of religious inclusion and tolerance, the Chinese engaged the Arabian traders and calmed religious disputes within Asia. </span>With applications of power sources in textiles and advanced metallurgy, the Chinese were in the same position in 1400 as the British were in 1750<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, ready to launch into the Industrial Revolution. They traded with nations thousands of miles from home with vast, sophisticated shipping fleets. They were poised to extend this trade all the way to Europe and perhaps find the New World by going east instead of the European's going west in search of the rich Chinese markets. </span>But <span style="font-size: 5pt;">if we pop into that extraterrestrial time machine and drop into China</span> in 1800, we find a technologically backward nation, humbled by a relatively small force of Europeans <span style="font-size: 5pt;">with &quot;modern&quot; military technology who wantonly imposed their will on the Chinese. The Chinese have been struggling to catch up with European and American technology ever since and so far not quite being able to do that. The domination of China by the Japanese during World War II shows how complete the turnaround was. In 1400 Japan was but one of many vassal states huddled about the feet of the Imperial Chinese throne. In 1940 the Japanese military crushed the Chinese government while marching on to control much of South Asia. </span>What could have happened to turn this clear champion of technology, <span style="font-size: 5pt;">trade, enlightened leadership with all its advantages over both its neighbors and yet-distant foreign competitors</span> into such a weak, backward giant? <span style="font-size: 5pt;">Mokyr goes through a pretty complete list of potential causes. He looks at diet, climate, and inherent philosophical mindset rejecting each as a credible actor mainly on the bases that all of these conditions were present during the period of technological and economic growth as well as the subsequent stagnation. Therefore, these were not determining factors in the turnabout. In the end he concludes, as does Diamond and Levathes, that </span>it was just politics<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. Yep, that is right. It was good, old human politics. Dr. Levathes gives us a delightful insider's view of the personalities and politics of Imperial progressions during this critical time period. To make a short story of it, </span>the party that had been in control <span style="font-size: 5pt;">during the expansionist period</span> supported the <span style="font-size: 5pt;">great treasure fleets, commerce with foreign nations,</span> use and expansion of technology, <span style="font-size: 5pt;">and a rather harsh control of the rival party. </span>The rival party was based on Confucian philosophy that preached a rigid, inward-looking, controlled existence. When the Confucian party gained control of the throne, they had their opportunity to push back on the prior ruling party <span style="font-size: 5pt;">that had oppressed them so harshly for so long. And they did. They wanted nothing to do with foreigners; we have all we need at home, here in China, they said. The fleet was disbanded and the making of ocean-going vessels forbidden. </span>Technology was no longer &quot;encouraged.&quot;<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Again, their position was what we have is good enough, stop with all this new nonsense. Over a period of just a few years, the course of the entire nation was shifted from what would have appeared to be a bright future as the leading power in the world to a large, but relatively insignificant, backwater, rich in history and culture, but all backward looking to a former glory. That was it. A shift in the political agenda. At the time, to the leaders in control, one that made sense. Focus at home, use what you have now, create order, discipline, control. In 50 years Japanese pirates controlled the coast of China, and the former ruler of the seas from Asia to Africa could not get out of their harbors safely. </span>So, you see if the &quot;technology is bad&quot; message gets incorporated into too many of our daily decisions, we can turn from our bright future into something else<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The difference is that this time </span>the stakes are much higher<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> than they were in fifteenth century China. </span>If we,<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> in the developed nations, </span>make the wrong choices, we doom all of humanity by our folly<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. It is not just that we miss the potential bright future</span>, we miss the chance to avoid the combined human population growth and resources exhaustion disaster coming at us like a runaway train. Technology is the only way to prevent that train wreck<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. </span>We can hear the siren's call of anti-technology, come back to nature and let the train run us down in a bloody mess, or we can try our best to use technology wisely and win free to make a better life for everyone.<br />

<strong>7. Pragmatic political action to prevent nuclear war is a prerequisite to ontological investigations</strong><br />
<strong>Santoni</strong><strong>85</strong> <span style="font-size: 5pt;">- Maria Theresa Barney Chair Emeritus of Philosophy at Denison University (Ronald, “Nuclear War: Philosophical Perspectives” p 156-157)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">To be sure, Fox sees the need for our undergoing “certain fundamental changes” in our “thinking, beliefs, attitudes, values” and </span>Zimmerman calls for a “paradigm shift” in our thinking about ourselves, other, and the Earth. But it is not clear that<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> what either offers as </span>suggestions<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> for what we can, must, or should do in the face of a runaway arms race </span>are sufficient to “wind down” the arms race before it leads to omnicide<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. In spite of the importance of Fox’s analysis and reminders it is not clear that “admitting our (nuclear) fear and anxiety” to ourselves and “identifying the mechanisms that dull or mask our emotional and other responses” represent much more than examples of basic, often. stated principles of psychotherapy. Being aware of the psychological maneuvers that keep us numb to nuclear reality may well be the road to transcending them but it must only be a “first step” (as Fox acknowledges), during which we Simultaneously act to eliminate nuclear threats, break our complicity with the ams race, get rid of arsenals of genocidal weaponry, and create conditions for international goodwill, mutual trust, and creative interdependence. Similarly, </span>in respect to Zimmerman: in spite of the challenging Heideggerian insights<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> he brings out regarding what motivates the arms race, </span>many questions may be raised about his prescribed “solutions.” Given our need for a paradigm shift in our (distorted) understanding of ourselves and the rest of being, are we merely left “to prepare for a possible shift in<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> our </span>self-understanding?<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> (italics mine)? </span>Is this all we can do? Is it necessarily the case that such a shift “cannot come as a result of our own will?”<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> – and work – </span>but only from “a destiny outside our control?” Does this mean we leave to God the matter of bringing about a paradigm shift?<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Granted our fears and the importance of not being controlled by fears, as well as our “anthropocentric leanings,” should we be as cautious as Zimmerman suggests about out disposition “to want to do something” or “to act decisively in the face of the current threat?” </span>In spite of the importance of our taking on the anxiety of our finitude and our present limitation, does it follow that “we should be willing for<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> the worst (i.e. </span>an all-out nuclear war) to occur”? Zimmerman wrongly<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, I contend, </span>equates “resistance” with “denial” when he says that “as long as we resist and deny the possibility of nuclear war, that possibility will persist and grow stronger.” He also wrongly perceives “resistance” as presupposing a clinging to the “order of things that now prevails.” Resistance connotes opposing, and striving to defeat a prevailing state of affairs that would allow or encourage the “worst to occur.”<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> I submit, against Zimmerman, that </span>we should not<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, in any sense,</span>be willing for nuclear war or omnicide to occur<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. (This is not to suggest that we should be numb to the possibility of its occurrence.) Despite Zimmerman’s elaborations and refinements </span>his Heideggerian notion of “letting beings be” continues to be too permissive<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> in this regard. In my judgment, </span>an individual’s decision not to act against and resist his or her government’s preparations for nuclear holocaust is<span style="font-size: 5pt;">, as I have argued elsewhere, to be </span>an early accomplice to the most horrendous crime against life imaginable – its annihilation<span style="font-size: 5pt;">. The Nuremburg tradition calls not only for a new way of thinking, a “new internationalism” in which we all become co-nurturers of the whole planet, but for resolute actions that will sever our complicity with nuclear criminality and the genocidal arms race, and work to achieve a future which we can no longer assume. </span>We must<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> not only “come face to face with the unthinkable in image and thought” (Fox) but must </span>act<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> now - with a “new consciousness” and conscience - to prevent the unthinkable, by cleansing the earth of nuclear weaponry. </span>Only when that is achieved will ultimate violence be removed as the final arbiter of our planet’s fate.<br />

<strong>8.</strong> <strong>There are no prior questions to problem oriented IR - empirical validity is a sufficient justification for action. Ontology focus destroys any chance of effectively describing the world and guiding action</strong><br />
<strong>Owen, 2</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – (David Owen, Reader of Political Theory at the Univ. of Southampton, Millennium Vol 31 No 3 2002 p. 655-7)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Commenting on the ‘philosophical turn’ in IR, Wæver remarks that </span>‘[a] frenzy for words like “epistemology” and “ontology” often signals this philosophical turn’<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, although he goes on to comment that these terms are often used loosely.4 However, loosely deployed or not, it is clear that debates concerning ontology and epistemology play a central role in the contemporary IR theory wars. In one respect, this is unsurprising since it is a characteristic feature of the social sciences that periods of disciplinary disorientation involve recourse to reflection on the philosophical commitments of different theoretical approaches, and there is no doubt that such reflection can play a valuable role in making explicit the commitments that characterise (and help individuate) diverse theoretical positions. </span>Yet, such a philosophical turn is not without its dangers <span style="font-size: 7pt;">and I will briefly mention three before turning to consider a confusion that has, I will suggest, helped to promote the IR theory wars by motivating this philosophical turn. The first danger with the philosophical turn is that </span>it has an inbuilt tendency to prioritise issues of ontology and epistemology over explanatory and/or interpretive power as if the latter two were merely a simple function of the former. But while the explanatory and/or interpretive power of a theoretical account is not <span style="font-size: 7pt;">wholly independent of its ontological and/or epistemological commitments (otherwise criticism of these features would not be a criticism that had any value), it is by no means clear that it is, in contrast, </span>wholly dependent on these philosophical commitments.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Thus, for example, one need not be sympathetic to rational choice theory to recognise that it can provide powerful accounts of certain kinds of problems, such as the tragedy of the commons in which dilemmas of collective action are foregrounded.</span> It may, of course, be the case that the advocates of rational choice theory cannot give a good account of why this type of theory is powerful <span style="font-size: 7pt;">in accounting for this class of problems (i.e., how it is that the relevant actors come to exhibit features in these circumstances that approximate the assumptions of rational choice theory) and, </span>if this is the case, it is a philosophical weakness—but this does not undermine the point that, for a certain class of problems, rational choice theory may provide the best account available to us. In other words, while the critical judgement of theoretical accounts in terms of their ontological and/or epistemological sophistication is one kind of critical judgement, it is not the only or even necessarily the most important kind<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The second danger run by the philosophical turn is </span>that because prioritisation of ontology and epistemology promotes theory-construction from philosophical first principles, it cultivates a theory-driven rather than problem-driven approach to IR. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Paraphrasing Ian Shapiro, the point can be put like this:</span> since it is the case that there is always a plurality of possible true descriptions of a given action, event or phenomenon, the challenge is to decide which is the most apt in terms of getting a perspicuous grip on the action, event or phenomenon in question given the purposes of the inquiry; yet, from this standpoint, ‘theory-driven work is part of a reductionist program’ in that it ‘dictates always opting for the description that calls for the explanation that flows from the preferred model or theory’.5 The justification<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> offered for this strategy </span>rests on the mistaken belief that it is necessary for social science because general explanations are required to characterise the classes of phenomena studied in similar terms. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">However, as Shapiro points out,</span> this is to misunderstand the enterprise of science since ‘whether there are general explanations for classes of phenomena is a question for social-scientific inquiry, not to be prejudged before conducting that inquiry’.6 Moreover, this strategy easily slips into the promotion of the pursuit of generality over that of empirical validity. The third danger is that the preceding two combine to encourage the formation of a particular image of disciplinary debate in IR—what might be called (only slightly tongue in cheek) ‘the Highlander view’—namely, an image of warring theoretical approaches<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> with each, despite occasional temporary tactical alliances, dedicated to the strategic achievement of sovereignty over the disciplinary field. It encourages this view because </span>the<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> turn to, and </span>prioritisation of, ontology and epistemology stimulates the idea that there can only be one theoretical approach which gets things right, namely, the theoretical approach that gets its ontology and epistemology right. This image feeds back into IR exacerbating the first and second dangers, and so a potentially vicious circle arises.<br />

<strong>10. Heidegger’s critique is impossible to actualize – the rule of modern technology is fundamentally a part of humans</strong><br />
<strong>Riis 11</strong><span style="font-size: 5pt;">—Carlsberg Research Fellow and Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Science Studies at Roskilde University, Ph.D. from Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg (Søren, 8 February 2011, “Towards the origin of modern technology: reconfiguring Martin Heidegger’s thinking,” RBatra)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Martin Heidegger’s radical critique of technology has fundamentally stigmatized modern technology and paved the way for a comprehensive critique of contemporary Western society. However,</span> the following reassessment of Heidegger’s most elaborate and influential interpretation of technology, ‘‘The Question Concerning Technology,’’ sheds a very different light on his critique. In fact, Heidegger’s phenomenological line of thinking concerning technology <strong>also implies a radical critique of ancient technology and the fundamental being-in-the-world of humans</strong>. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">This revision of Heidegger’s arguments claims that ‘‘The Question Concerning Technology’’ indicates a previous unseen ambiguity with respect to the origin of the rule of das Gestell.</span> The following inquiry departs from Heidegger’s critique of modern technology and connects it to a reassessment of ancient technology and Aristotle’s justification of slavery. <span style="font-size: 5pt;">The last part of the paper unfolds Heidegger’s underlying arguments in favor of continuity within the history of technology</span>. According to these interpretations, <strong>humans have always strived to develop ‘‘modern’’ technology and to become truly ‘‘modern’’ in the Heideggerian sense</strong>. The danger stemming from the rule of das Gestell is thus not only transient and solely directed toward contemporary Western society, but also I will argue that <strong>humans can only be humans as the ones challenged by the rule of das Gestell.</strong><br />

<strong>3. Permutation do both – the idea of the frontier is inevitable, it’s only a question of how we interpret it – the perm uses history as a basis to guide serious political action</strong><br />
<strong>Limerick, 94</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Department of History University of Colorado, Boulder (Patricia, “What is the Cultural Value of Space Exploration?,” What is the Value of Space Exploration?

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thus, it might be best for the space community to abandon the frontier analogy. “</span>The image and idea of the frontier is an enormously persistent and determining pattern of thought…. Debunk it, and it is instantly back in the bunk. The idea of the frontier is clearly here to stay in the minds of space enthusiasts.” Given this reality, she said, what the space community should do is “keep the frontier comparison, but try taking it seriously.” “What would happen if those who have been eager to refer to space as the next frontier, the ﬁ nal frontier, the last frontier, actually thought about the lessons of Western history?”<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> she asked. “</span>Leaving home and going West proved to be a very ineffective way of leaving…problems behind and an even less effective way of solving those problems…. The American West proved to be no escape at all from ethnic and racial tensions, from urban and industrial conﬂ icts, from the…depletion of natural resources…or from frustration and failure.” Advocates promote space exploration as an escape from Earthly problems, colonization as a safety valve for social stresses,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “technical solutions for all dilemmas.” The problem is that they run the risk of believing their own hype. “</span>Space boosters promise a wide and open distribution of beneﬁ ts [but] in situations of colonization and settlement, occasions in which everyone gains and no one loses have been extremely rare,” Limerick pointed out<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “What would happen if those who have been eager to refer to space as the next frontier, the ﬁ nal frontier, the last frontier, actually thought about the lessons of Western history?” she asked. “Leaving home and going West proved to be a very ineffective way of leaving…problems behind and an even less effective way of solving those problems….

One would not expect the American Civil Liberties Union to prosper on the space frontier.” “</span>Based on the frontier analogy, the space program was guaranteed an awkward middle age<span style="font-size: 8pt;">…. In its rapid pacing and absorbing intensity, the Apollo…initiative resembled very closely fevered phases of Western expansion like the California gold rush. Like the gold rush, the Apollo program was perfectly designed to breed nostalgia and a sense of loss and decline,” she said. “Explorers, the history of expansion shows, have a way of aging badly,” she added, citing ﬁ gures such as Christopher Columbus and his ilk. The great explorers “did not have the word or concept ‘enough’ in their vocabularies, but they certainly had the word ‘more’.” Thus, she concluded, “the frontier comparison does a great deal to explain…the current dilemmas of NASA. “</span>However the frontier analogy does carry the encouraging lesson that slowing down can carry real advantages…. Used in the conventional…way,<span style="font-size: 8pt;">” she said, “</span>the frontier comparison condemns caution and demands frenzied and precipitate action.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As Sacvan Bercovitch has demonstrated, prior to the Civil War American was engaged in the rhetoric, ritual, and ideology of consen- sus, resulting in a &quot;culture </span>bound by an extraordinary ideological he- gemony<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot;'9 He argues that between the </span>Revolution and the Civil War America was characterized by &quot;a venture in exegesis,&quot;<span style="font-size: 8pt;">20 based on the New England Puritan concept of an errand into the wilderness, in its turn justified by the biblical myth of exodus and conquest. Using the term &quot;myth of America&quot; to refer to this ideology, Bercovitch notes that it changed the meaning of the &quot;frontier&quot; from dividing line to a prophetic summons to expand- &quot;. .. the Westward movement came to provide a sort of serial enactment of the ritual of consensus.&quot;21 But, according to Bercovitch, this story reached its climax in 1860, and the outcome has been cultural schizophrenia.22 The ideology of consen- sus which drew its strength from the biblical myths began to collapse after the Civil War, the effort of change began to be felt, and a vacuum developed at the point where ideology and everyday reality met. Every domain of cultural expression reflected frustration with this uncertainty, chaos, and optimism, but several emerging themes in the modern myth found expression in new symbolic forms, especially those tied to mass communication and the mass media. Three ideolog- ical themes dominated the several variants of the modern myth: the Romantic, the Rational, and the Reactionary. All three grew out of the larger social and intellectual currents prevalent in Europe, Britain, and the United States, such as: Social Darwinism; the hypocrisy, patri- archy, and deep paradoxes of the Victorian era; the impact of technol- ogy on all classes of people in developments such as print, mass media, the camera, the factory; and the overall effects of a growing conscious- ness of society as society.23 The three themes mixed together in what seems a rather promiscu- ous manner appropriate to the era. In various combinations, scholar- ship, religion, science, politics, mass media, the workplace, theology, and recreation blended the themes into their discourse and folklorists drew upon these themes to formulate their own position. The </span>Roman- tic theme expressed nostalgia for another time and place, a longing for a beauty, integrity, and purity that was lost in the misty past. Ro- mantic folklorists, writers, and other scholars emphasized antiquities, survivals, a national heritage, the noble savage, the strong peasant. The Past or an Earlier Stage of Man was clearly superior to the present in morality, integrity, honesty, and responsibility, and the efforts of the Romantic were devoted to the recapture and restoration of that earlier purity<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Just the opposite was the Rational approach, which em- phasized<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> empiricism and science and the belief that improvement in the human condition was dependent upon the future, on </span>new and in- novative thinking<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that would shed the burdensome baggage of the past. </span>The roots of modernism, technology, and the Belief in Science as the Hope for Mankind were found in the Rational, which scorned the old and traditional in favor of new, enlightened approaches. Focused on the present, the Reactionary praised the status quo and opposed social change. This theme infused political and social conditions with a moral authority and stressed the superiority of the White Male Anglo- Saxon Protestant and the inferiority of women and the &quot;darker races.&quot;<br />

<strong>5. Turn - the frontier can be used for positive narratives too</strong><br />
<strong>Abbott, 5</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – (Carl, “Homesteading on the Extraterrestrial Frontier,” Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 32, No. 2 (Jul., 2005), pp. 240-26, JSTOR)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Western American Past in the Human Future. </span>It is a truism that Americans often see the future, and especially the extraterrestrial future, as a frontier. That Americans in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have looked upward for &quot;high&quot; frontiers is obvious<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Space exploration as a frontier of scientific and economic gain is a cliche, and sf writers since Edgar Rice Burroughs in the 1910s have been mining the American West for visual metaphors for wild planets. </span>Because these stories of the West are so powerful in the American imagination, they echo and re-echo in imaginative writing about the future.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In Wilderness Visions, David Mogen has clearly analyzed many of the ways in which </span>popular understandings of the western American frontier pervade American science fiction. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Drawing the distinction between sf as extrapolation and sf as analogy and metaphor, Mogen emphasizes the importance for the latter of American founding myths-with The Martian Chronicles as a case in point. Because the imagery and mythology of the western frontier so pervade American culture, science fiction repeatedly internalizes the stories that Americans tell about the development of the West and writes them forward for places and times yet unknown. On close examination, however, </span>any notion of a single frontier experience breaks down into multiple and changing narratives, each of which encompasses part of the larger story. Over the past two centuries, Americans have con- structed a powerful set of stories to explain how their nation expanded across the western half of North America and to describe the sorts of societies that expansion created<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Although the terminology is a bit unfashionable, historians of North America have often written about &quot;frontiers&quot; in the plural-fur-trading frontier, mining frontier, lumberjack's frontier, cattleman's frontier, farming frontier. This emphasis on the development of distinct sets of resources dates back to Frederick Jackson Turner in the United States and Harold Innis in Canada. More recent writing has added the experiences of labor union organizers, city makers, civil engineers, federal bureaucrats, Asian and Mexican immigrants, utopian colonists, hippies, and modern survivalists to those of explorers, mountain men, and forty-niners. </span>Each of these frontiers had its own internal logic that has traced a distinct narrative, and each of these narrative frameworks manifests or expresses one part of the encompassing myth of frontier renewal. Each specific story-such as the narrative of homesteading by families and small communities-can serve as a template for multiple works of science fiction. The results are bodies of fiction that link specific aspects of nineteenth- and twentieth-century America to the twenty-first century and beyond.' In effect, the ways in which we remember and talk about the past of the American West make it possible to imagine certain futures and difficult to imagine others.<br />

<strong>7. No link - The affirmative has moved past the frontier myth – focusing on the technological spinoffs of space exploration is more practical than the romantic myths of earlier exploration</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Born in the era when many North American lands were still relatively unknown to Euro-Americans, and nurtured by decades of fiction, painting, and movies</span>, the folklore of the frontier is still current; indeed, it flourishes after nearly <span style="font-size: 7pt;">30</span> years of the U.S. space program<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In the mid 1970s, O'Neill's </span>expansive vision<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, in which huge satellites would convert sunlight to electrical power beamed to Earth and space colonies were just around the corner</span>, reflected high optimism about the future of humans in space<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.25 We had just come off the Apollo high, were well into development of the space shuttle, and the visionaries were looking for new realms to conquer</span>. Today, the mood of the space program is cautious, if not dour, especially since the tragic loss of the space shuttle Challenger<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in January 1986. </span>The focus of the civilian program has shifted from the longterm benefits of electric power beamed from beyond the atmosphere and colonizing space-prospects that some heralded as the next step just a few years ago-to the more pragmatic matter of deriving shortterm economic benefits from space technology.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Compared to the Apollo days, we might even recall the popular song: &quot;The thrill is gone.&quot; To invite an historic parallel from the settlement of the West, it is as if we have passed from the era of exploration and have become farmers. </span>To make use of outer space for the genuine benefit of humans will require plain hard work and substantial ingenuity.<br />

Whether or not this occurred is a cloudier issue, and an area where the realities of space as a hostile environment begin to infringe on the frontier myth. </span>One obvious expansion of state capacities is<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the advent of satellite capabilities. David Whalen identifies </span>reconnaissance, navigation, weather, and communications<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> as space applications operationalized by the United States.50 He writes: “Applications satellites are not as glamorous as Moon landings . . . but </span>they have made a huge difference in the world we live in: financially, culturally, and in the areas of safety and security<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. They have created the global village.” His analysis suggests that these capabilities may have been developed by the Defense Department on its own, but it was the existence of NASA that facilitated their availability for public use, particularly communications satellites.51 What, however, of the manned spaceflight supported by Kennedy? Some have argued, like Alex Roland did in 1989, that “over the past quarter century, two-thirds of our space dollars have been invested in manned spaceflight, with little to show for the investment save circus.”52 Philip Scranton, a historian from Rutgers University, concludes otherwise: Beneath the satellites, probes, and human spaceflights, for a generation or more extensive innovations in process, materials, and instrumentation have flowed outward from NASA projects and resonated through the industrial economy. Their scope can be more readily realized than their scale can be measured, but their significance is evident.53 James Vedda has found that space exploration has had a significant role in the emergence of globalization: </span>Present-day globalization is reaping the benefits of space applications <span style="font-size: 7pt;">created and disseminated in a Cold War in an environment </span>that kept major threats at bay and allowed global markets to flourish<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Government space efforts aimed at national security, national prestige, and technology development have led us to a point where civil and commercial space applications are fundamental—though often transparent—in a globalizing world.54 </span>Food standards developed by NASA even shaped U.S. food safety standards<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. According to Jennifer Ross-Nazzal the American food industry relies on risk prevention systems developed by NASA originally for the Gemini and Apollo programs.55 Somewhat intangible but certainly important is the inspirational role played by Kennedy’s rhetoric and policies. </span>A generation of students went into math and science inspired by dreams of spaceflight. It was a generation that included some of the future leaders of the information revolution that would bring technological breakthroughs and billions of dollars in economic growth<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span></em><br />

<strong>Reasons to Prefer:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A) Empiricism is the best model for interpreting IR – provides falsifiability, leads to effective theorizing, and is used by policymakers now</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Fischer 98</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University (Frank, “BEYOND EMPIRICISM: POLICY INQUIRY IN POSTPOSITIVIST PERSPECTIVE”, Published in Policy Studies Journal, Vol. 26. No.1 (Spring, 1998): 129-146) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Neopositivism (or logical empiricism) has supplied the epistemological ideals of the contemporary social and policy sciences (Hawkesworth 1988; </span>A theory of knowledge put forth to explain the concepts and methods of the physical and natural sciences,neopositivism has given shape as well to a social science in pursuit quantitatively replicable causal generalizations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Fay 1975). Most easily recognized as the stuff of the research methodology textbook, </span>neopositivist principles emphasize empirical research designs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>the use of sampling techniques and data gathering procedures<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>the measurement of outcomes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>and the development of causal models with predictive power<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Miller 1993; Bobrow and Dryzek 1987). In the field of policy analysis</span>, such an orientation is manifested in quasi-experimental research designs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>multiple regression analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>survey research<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>input-output studies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>cost-benefit analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>operations research<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>mathematical simulation models<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>and systems analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Putt and Springer, 1989; Sylvia, et al. 1991). </span>The only reliable approach to knowledge accumulation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, according to this epistemology</span>, is empirical falsification through objective hypothesis-testing of rigorously formulated causal generalizations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Popper, 1959: Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith 1992:231; Hofferbert 1990). </span>The goal is to generate a body of empirical generalizations capable of explaining behavior across social and historical contexts, whether communities, societies, or cultures, independently of specific times, places, or circumstances<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Not only are such propositions essential to social and political explanation, they are seen to make possible effective solutions to societal problems.Such propositions are<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> said </span>to supply the cornerstones of theoretical progress. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Underlying this effort is a fundamental positivist principle mandating a rigorous separation of facts and values, the principle of the &quot;fact-value dichotomy&quot; (Bernstein 1976; Proctor 1991). According to this principle, </span>empirical research is to proceed independently of normative context or implications.Because only empirically based causal knowledge can qualify social science as a genuine &quot;scientific&quot; endeavor, social scientists are instructed to assume a &quot;value-neutral&quot; orientation and to limit their research investigations to empirical or &quot;factual&quot; phenomena<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even though adherence to this &quot;fact-value dichotomy&quot; varies in the conduct of actual research, especially at the methodological level, the separation still reigns in the social sciences. </span>To be judged as methodologically valid, research must at least officially pay its respects to the principle<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Fischer 1980). </span>In the policy sciences the attempt to separate facts and values has facilitated a<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> technocratic </span>form of policy analysis that emphasizes the efficiency and effectiveness of means to achieve politically established goals<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Much of policy analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in this respect, </span>has sought to translate inherently normative political and social issues into<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> technically </span>defined ends to be pursued through administrative means<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In an effort to sidestep goal-value conflicts typically associated with policy issues, </span>economic and social problems are interpreted as issues in need of improved management and program design<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span>their solutions are to be found in the technical applications of the policy sciences <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Amy 1987). Often associated </span>with this orientation has been a belief in the superiority of scientific decision-making<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Reflecting a subtle antipathy toward democratic processes, terms such as &quot;pressures&quot; and &quot;expedient adjustments&quot; are used to denigrate pluralistic policymaking. If politics doesn't fit into the methodological scheme, then politics is the problem. </span>Some have<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even </span>argued<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span>the political system<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> itself must </span>be changed to better accommodate policy analysis<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Heineman et al. 1990). In the face of limited empirical successes, </span>neopositivists<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have had to give some ground. Although they </span>continue to stress rigorous empirical research as the long-run solution <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to their failures, they have retreated from their more ambitious efforts. </span>Today their goal is to aim for propositions that are at least theoretically proveable at some future point in time.An argument propped up by the promise of computer advances<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>it serves to keep the original epistemology in tack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But the modification misses the point, as postpositivists are quick to point out. The problem is more fundamentally rooted in the empirical social scientists's misunderstanding of the nature of the social. As we shall see, it is a misunderstanding lodged in the very concept of a generalizable, value-free objectivity that neopositivists seek to reaffirm and more intensively apply.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Copenhagen school thus emphasizes the need to understand the “speech acts” that accomplish a process of securitization. Their focus is on the linguistic and conceptual dynamics involved, even though they recognize the importance of the institutional setting within which securitization takes place. </span>The concept of securitization offers some important insights for security studies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, it is too epistemologically restricted to contribute to a significant retooling of security studies. On the positive side, </span>it draws attention to the way in which security agendas are constructed by politicians and other political actors. It also indicates the utility of discourse analysis as an additional tool of analysis for security studies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>However, at best, securitization studies can constitute one aspect of security studies. It cannot provide the foundations for a paradigm shift in the subdiscipline. Its greatest weakness is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its epistemological hypochondria, that is, </span>its tendency to reify epistemological problems and push sound observations about knowledge claims to their logical absurdity. Although it is important to understand the discursive moves involved in perceptions of security in, say, the Middle East, it is also necessary to make some assessment of nondiscursive factors like the military balance<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or access to freshwater supplies. For the Copenhagen school, however, </span>these nondiscursive factors are relegated to second place. They are considered only to the extent that they facilitate or impede the speech ac<span style="font-size: 8pt;">t. In this way, </span>the Copenhagen school is in danger of cutting security studies off from serious empirical research and setting it adrift on a sea of floating signifiers.<br />

<strong>2. Permutation—do the plan from a feminist IR perspective - we can redeploy realism for feminist goals—their depiction of conventional IR doesn’t account for alternative explanations</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Caprioli, 4</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Department of Political Science, University of Tennessee (Mary, “Feminist IR Theory and Quantitative Methodology: A Critical Analysis,” International Studies Review Vol. 6, No. 2 (Jun., 2004), pp. 253-269, JSTOR)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Conventional </span>feminist IR scholars misrepresent the field of international relations in arguing that IR scholarship<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as popularly accepted </span>excludes alternative explanations of state behavior<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, including feminist inquiry, </span>that go beyond structural, state-focused models<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Feminist IR theorists, among others, critique the IR field for its state-centric approach and argue that &quot;a world of states situated in an anarchical international system leaves little room for analyses of social relations, including gender relations&quot; (Tickner 2001:146). As a result, </span>they appear to set up a straw man by refusing to recognize the variety within &quot;conventional&quot; IR research<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Indeed, as Jack Levy (2000) has observed, </span>a significant shift to societal-level variables<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has occurred, partly in response to the decline in the systemic imperatives of the bipolar era. Certainly the democratic peace literature, particularly its normative explana- tion (Maoz and Russett 1993; Dixon 1994), among other lines of inquiry, recognizes the role of social relations in explaining state behavior. The normative explanation for the democratic peace thesis emphasizes the societal level values of human rights, support for the rule of law, and peaceful conflict resolution in explaining the likelihood of interstate conflict. Furthermore, dyadic tests of the democratic peace thesis rely &quot;on an emerging theoretical framework that may prove capable of incorporating the strengths of the currently predom- inant realist or neorealist research program, and moving beyond it&quot; (Ray 2000:311). In addition, theorizing and research in the field of ethnonationalism has highlighted connections that domestic ethnic discrimination and violence have with state behavior at the international level (Gurr and Harff 1994; Van Evera 1997; Caprioli and Trumbore 2003a, 2003b). Contrary to the argument that conventional IR theory excludes feminist inquiry, </span>space exists within the field of international relations for feminist inquiry even allowing for a state-centric focus, just as room exists for scholars interested in exploring the democratic peace and ethnonationalism. International relations feminists make the same mistake that they accuse IR scholars of making: narrowing the space for various worldviews<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, thereby </span>creating competition and a sense of exclusion among the so-called others. If the role of &quot;feminist theory is to explain women's subordination<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or the unjustified asymmetry between women's and men's social and economic positions, and to seek prescriptions for ending it&quot; (Tickner 2001:11), </span>then feminist IR scholarship ought to allow for an explanation of how women's subordination or inequality has an impact on state behavior, assuming a state- centric focus<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while at the same time challenging the predetermination of a struc- tural analysis. If domestic inequality does affect state behavior, or even perpetuates the existence of states, then </span>policy prescriptions should be sought<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>3. Turn – Essentialism – feminist IR reproduces the stereotypes they criticize</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Witworth 94,</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">prof of political science and female studies @ York U (Feminism and International Relations, pg 20, 1994)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even when not concerned with mothering as such, </span>much of the politics that emergefrom radical feminism within IR depend on a ‘re-thinking’ from the perspective of women<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What is left </span>unexplained is how simply thinking differently will alter the material realities of relations of domination between men and women<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Structural (patriarchal) relations are acknowledged, but not analysed in radical feminism’s reliance on the experiences, behaviours and perceptions of ‘women’. As Sandra Harding notes, </span>the essential and universal ‘man’, long the focus of feminist critiques, has merely been replaced here with the essential and universal ‘woman’.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And indeed, </span>that notion of ‘woman’ not only ignores important differences amongst women, but it also reproduces exactly the stereotypical vision of women and men, masculine and feminine, that has been produced under patriarchy. Those women who do not fit the mould<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – who, for example, take up arms in military struggle – </span>are quickly dismissed as expressing ‘negative’ or ‘inauthentic’ feminine value<span style="font-size: 12pt;">s</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (the same accusation is more rarely made against men). In this way, it comes as no surprise when mainstream IR theorists such as Robert Reohane happily embrace the tenets of radical feminism. It requires little in the way of re-thinking or movement from accepted and comfortable assumptions about stereotypes. </span>Radical feminists find themselves defending the same account of women as nurturing, pacifist, submissive mothers as men do under patriarchy, anti-feminists and the New Right.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As some writers suggest, this in itself should give feminists pause to reconsider this position.</span><br />

To make a major impact on thinking about international relations<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however,</span>it will not be sufficient explicitly to point out that women have been marginalised in the state, and in interstate politics. This reality is well-known<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even if conventional international relations theory has tended to ignore it. Feminist empiricism will be most significant, it seems to me, if it is used in conjunction with feminist standpoint reconceptualisations to re-examine central concepts of international relations theory by asking about their values for empirical research.</span>Feminist empiricism, guided by feminist reconceptualisation, could go beyond the question of the role of women in international relations' to a critical analysis of the extent to which contemporary international relations theory helps us to understand what is happening in world politics today. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">As indicated above,</span>'postmodernism' <span style="font-size: 8pt;">is a puzzling label that</span>seems to denote a variety of positions, One version of it, however, denies the possibility of having a single epistemology<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even one with slightly different variants. As Mary E. Hawkesworth puts it,</span>'postmodernist insights counsel that Truth be abandoned because it is a hegemonic and, hence, destructive illusion'<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. According to these postmodernists, 'feminist empiricism is committed to untenable beliefs about the nature of knowledge and process of knowing' and feminist standpoint theories 'remain committed to an overly simplistic model of knowledge that tends to assume a &quot;collective singular subject&quot;:'.2l</span>In this view, we cannot agree on an epistemological basis for substantive discussions: that is, on standards against which we can evaluate knowledge claims. It seems to me that this postmodernist project is a <strong>dead-end in the study</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>international relations</strong> - and that it would be <strong>disastrous</strong> for feminist international relations theory to pursue this path. Of course I am aware that social knowledge is always value-laden, and that objectivity is an aspiration rather than an accomplishment. But I object to the notion that because social science cannot attain any perfectly reliable knowledge, it is justified for students of society to 'obliterate the validity of reality'<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.24</span>I also object to the notion that we should happily accept the existence of multiple incommensurable epistemologies, each equally valid. Such a view seems to me to lead away from our knowledge of the external world, and ultimately to a sort of nihilism.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Hawkesworth argues that</span>'the world is more than a text'<span style="font-size: 8pt;">and that</span>feminists should avoid 'the postmodernist tendency to reject all reasons'<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,B I would go further and say that</span>agreement on epistemological essentials constitutes a valuable scientific asset that should not be discarded lightly. With such agreement, people with different substantive views or intuitions can talk to each other in commensurable terms can perhaps come to an agreement with the aid of evidence.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As philosophers of science such as Imre Lakatos have argued,</span>the invalidity of naive falsificationism does not destroy the possibility of establishing standards for scientific research: participants in the scientific process apply criteria having to do with resolution of <span style="font-size: 8pt;">anomalies, discovery of new facts, and what Lakatos calls</span>'the requirement of continuous growth'<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,26</span> A major aim of science, even social science, is to provide us with a common set of epistemological tools, in a discipline, for ascertaining the nature of reality and therefore testing the adequacy of theories. This is not to pretend that any knowledge is perfectly 'objective'<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: clearly Olif values, our upbringing, our bodily experiences and our positions in society - gender, class, culture, race - all affect what we believe. But</span>science has the value of narrowing gaps in belief by providing common standards to test beliefs, and therefore disciplining our minds, protecting us to some extent from bias. The very difficulty of achieving social scientific knowledge is an argument for cherishing rather than discarding social science and the aspiration <span style="font-size: 8pt;">for a more or less unified epistemology.</span>I fear that many feminist theorists of international relations may follow the currently fashionable path of fragmenting epistemology, denying the possibility of social science. But I think <strong>this would be an intellectual and moral disaster</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Linda A1coff points out, 'post-structuralist critiques of subjectivity pertain to the construction of all subjects or they pertain to none . . . Nominalism threatens to wipe out feminism itself'.27 That is,</span>feminist theory cannot be without a positive standpoint - it cannot be <em>only</em> adversarial. Retreating to postmodern adversarial analysis would foreclose the relations that could be regarded as valuable by people outside the feminist circle. Scientifically, it would lead away from<span style="font-size: 8pt;">what I think feminist theory should do:</span>generate novel hypotheses that could then be evaluated with evidence, in a way that could lead to convincing results<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Politically<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as Hawkesworth declares,</span><strong>'should postmodernism's seductive text gain ascendancy, it will not be an accident that power remains in the hands</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the white males who currently possess it. In a world</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>radical inequality, relativist resignation reinforces the status quo'.</strong><br />

<strong>6. Uncertainty justifies realism – even under a cooperative framework, the malleability of discourse proves that leaders will always calculate action based on capability</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Copeland 6</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Associate Professor and Director Dept. of Government and Foreign Affairs @ University of Virginia (Dale, “The Constructivist Challenge to Structural Realism: A Review Essay”, Constructivism and International Relations, Alexander Wendt and His Critics)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Notwithstanding </span>Wendt’s<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> important contributions to international relations theory, his </span>critique of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> structural </span>realism<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has inherent flaws. Most important, it </span>does not adequately address a critical aspect of the realist worldview<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span><strong>the problem of uncertainty.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For structural realists, it is </span>states’ uncertainty about the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> present and especially the </span>future intentions of othersthat makes<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the levels and trends in </span>relative power such fundamental causal variables<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Contrary to Wendt’s claim that realism must smuggle in states with differently constituted interests to explain why systems sometimes fall into conflict, neorealists argue that </span>uncertainty about the other’s present interests<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>whether the other is driven by security or nonsecurity motives<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span><strong>can be enough to lead security-seeking states to fight</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This problem is exacerbated by </span>the incentives that actors have to deceive one another, an issue Wendt does not address. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yet even when states are fairly sure that the other is also a security seeker, they know that it might change its spots later on. States must therefore worry about any decline in their power, lest the other turn aggressive after achieving superiority. Wendt’s building of a systemic </span>constructivist theory<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—and his bracketing of unit-level processes—</span>thus presents<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> him with </span>an ironic dilemma<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>It is the very mutability of polities as emphasized by domestic-level constructivists<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>that states may change because of domestic processes independent of international interaction<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>that makes prudent leaders so concerned about the future<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>If diplomacy can have only a limited effect<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on another’s character or regime type,</span> <strong>then leaders must calculate the other’s potential to attack later should it acquire motives for expansion</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In such an environment of future uncertainty, levels and trends in relative power will thus act as a key constraint on state behavior. The problem of uncertainty complicates Wendt’s efforts to show that anarchy has no particular logic, but only three different ideational instantiations in history—as Hobbesian, Lockean, or Kantian cultures, depending on the level of actor compliance to certain behavioral norms. By differentiating these cultures in terms of the degree of cooperative behavior exhibited by states, </span>Wendt’s analysis reinforcesthe very dilemma underpinning the realist argument<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>If the other is acting cooperatively, how is one to know whether this reflects its peaceful character, or is just a façade <strong>masking aggressive desires</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Wendt’s discussion of the different degrees of internalization of the three cultures only exacerbates the problem. </span>What drives behavior at the <strong>lower levels of internalization</strong> is precisely what is not shared between actors—their private incentives to comply for short-term selfish reasons.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This suggests that </span>the neorealist and neoliberal paradigm<span style="font-size: 8pt;">s, both of which emphasize the role of uncertainty when internalization is low or nonexistent, </span>remain strong competitors to constructivism in explaining changing levels of cooperation through history<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And because </span>Wendt provides little empirical evidence to support his view<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in relation to these competitors, the debate over which paradigm possesses greater explanatory power is still an open one. </span><br />

<strong>The impact is the rise of Hitlerite states – the possibility of deception and different discursive interpretations means constructivist theory could prove fatal</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Second, Wendt’s view is inconsistent with his recognition that </span>states<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often do </span>have<strong>difficulty learning about the other</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The very problem Ego and Alter have in first communicating is that ‘behavior does not speak for itself. It must be interpreted, and ‘<strong>many interpretations are possible’</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (330). This point is reinforced by </span>Wendt’s epistemological point<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of departure: </span>that the ideas held by actors are ‘unobservable’<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (chap. 2). </span>Because leaders cannot observe<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> directly </span>what the other is thinking, they are resigned to making inferences from its behavior. Yet in security affa<span style="font-size: 8pt;">irs, as Wendt acknowledges, </span>mistakes in inferences—assuming the other is peaceful when in fact it has malevolent intentions—could prove ‘<strong>fatal’</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (360). Wendt accepts that the problem facing rational states ‘is making sure that they perceive other actors, and other actors’ perception of them, correctly’ (334, emphasis in original). Yet the book provides no mechanism through which Ego and Alter can increase their confidence in the correctness of their estimates of the other’s type. </span>Simply describing how Ego and Alter shape each other’s sense of self and other is not enough<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.21 </span>Rational choice models<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, using assumptions consistent with structural realism, </span><strong>do much better here</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In games of incomplete information, where states are unsure about the other’s type, actions by security-seeking actors that would be too costly for greedy actors to adopt can help states reduce their uncertainty about present intentions, thus moderating the security dilemma.22 </span>Wendt cannot simply argue that over time states can learn a great deal about other states<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>It is what is not ‘shared’, at least in the area of intentions, that remains the core stumbling block to cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Third, </span>Wendt’s position<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that the problem of other minds is not much of a problem </span>ignores<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a fundamental issue in all social relations, but especially in those between states, namely, </span><strong>the problem of deception</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In making estimates of the other’s present type, </span>states have reason to be suspicious of its diplomatic gestures<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span>the other may be trying to deceive them<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Wendt’s analysis is rooted in the theory of symbolic interactionism, but he does not discuss one critical aspect of that tradition: the idea of ‘impression management’. </span>Actors in their relations exploit the problem of other minds <strong>for their own ends.</strong> On the public stage, they present images and play roles that often have little to do with their <strong>true beliefs and interests backstage</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.23 In laying out his dramaturgical view of Ego and Alter co-constituting each other’s interests and identities, Wendt assumes that both Ego and Alter are making genuine efforts to express their true views and to ‘cast’ the other in roles that they believe in. But </span>deceptive actors will stage-manage the situation to create impressions that serve their narrow ends, and other actors, especially in world politics, will understand this<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.24 Thus </span>a prudent security-seeking Ego will have difficulty distinguishing between two scenarios: whether it and Alter do indeed share a view of each other as peaceful, or whether Alter is just pretending to be peaceful in order to make Ego think that they share a certain conception of the world, when in fact they do not<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.25 </span>Wendt’s analysis offers no basis for saying when peaceful gestures should be taken at face value<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and when they should be discounted as deceptions.26 </span>When we consider the implications of a <strong>Hitlerite state deceiving others to achieve a position of military superiority</strong>, we understand why great powers in history have tended to adopt postures of <strong>prudent mistrust.</strong><br />

<strong>7. Theorizing gender as a social construction doesn’t actually change IR—it’s disempowering</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Caprioli, 4</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Department of Political Science, University of Tennessee (Mary, “Feminist IR Theory and Quantitative Methodology: A Critical Analysis,” International Studies Review Vol. 6, No. 2 (Jun., 2004), pp. 253-269, JSTOR)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Beyond a female-centric analysis, </span>some<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> scholars (for example, Carver 2002) </span>argue that feminist research must offer a critique of gender as a set of power relations. Gender categories, however, do exist and have very real implications for individuals, social relations, and international affairs. Critiquing the social construction of gender is important, but it fails to provide new theories of international relations or to address the implications of gender for what happens in the world. Sylvester<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (2002a) </span>has wondered<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> aloud </span>whether feminist research should be focused primarily on critique, warning that feminists should avoid an exclusive focus on highlighting anomalies, for such a focus does not add to feminist IR theories<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">While Hoffmann might well be correct, </span>these days one can neither begin nor conclude empirical research without first discussing epistemological orientations and ontological assumptions.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Like a vortex, </span>metatheory has engulfed us all and the question of &quot;theory&quot; which was once used as a guide to research is now the object of research.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Indeed, for a discipline whose purview is ostensibly outward looldng and international in scope, and </span>at a time of ever encroaching globalization and transnationalism, International Relations has become increasingly<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> provincial and </span>inward looking<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Rather than grapple with the numerous issues that confront peoples around the world, since the early 1980s the discipline has tended more and more toward obsessive self-examination.3 These days </span>the politics of famine, environmental degradation, underdevelopment, or ethnic cleansing, let alone the cartographic machinations in Eastern Europe and the reconfiguration of the geo-global political-economy, seem scarcely to concern theorists of international politics who define the urgent task of our time to be one of metaphysical reflection and epistemological investigation.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Arguably</span>, theory is no longer concerned with the study of international relations so much as the &quot;manner in which international relations as a discipline, and international relations as a subject matter, have been constructed<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.&quot;4 To be concerned with the latter is to be &quot;on the cutting edge,&quot; where novelty has itself become &quot;an appropriate form of scholarship.&quot;5 </span><br />

<strong>2. Permutation – Do both – this rejects the false dichotomy of rationality and Taoism – only the permutation can cause further reappraisals by sowing the seeds of rethinking in Rationalism. The Kritik concedes the unbridgeable divide</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Pettman, 2005 prof of history, philosophy, Political Science and International Relations, Victoria University</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> [International Relations of the Asia-Pacific, Volume 5 2005, Taoism and the concept of global security. Ralph Pettman. Proquest. Pp 71-72</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">So let us be clear. </span>Rationalism, which is the doctrine within which most thinking and practice about the concept of global security is currently done, prioritizes reason as an end in itself. Taoism,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> which is the doctrine I am trying to bring to bear upon the rationalist construction of this concept, </span>is a way of thinking and practice that does not<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It prioritizes sacral (and in this instance, Taoist) insights instead. </span>These two are seemingly incommensurable<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. They would seem to represent </span>an unbridgeable epistemological divide<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Their protagonists not only talk different analytical languages, they talk past each other as well, which </span>is just what I want to prevent, <span style="font-size: 7pt;">not just because I do not like dialogues of the deaf, but more importantly, </span>because I think it is to capitulate to rationalism. From the rationalist perspective, Taoism looks anti-rational<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As such, it is at best interesting. It is not reliable knowledge. F</span>rom the Taoist perspective, however, rationalism is what one does with the rational part of one’s mind. It is only part of what Taoists do, nor need it be the larger part<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, since it includes the injunction to live in a state of sacral spontaneity. I noted above that rationalism is compromised at its root by the kind of self that is required if rationalism is to succeed. I argued that the individuated self – at one mind’s remove from the community – is objectifying. This self is created in turn by learning to be mentally distanced from the communalist context into which ‘one’ was born. Rationalism valorizes this individuated self, typically turning it into a primary normative purpose. Because this bias is built into rationalism itself, and because it limits and distorts so thoroughly what rationalism can do, we have to go outside rationalism to compensate for it. Otherwise, whenever we use rationalism, we will get the world right, but we will also get the world wrong. </span>The most straightforward compensation procedure<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> I know </span>is<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> one that enjoins us </span>to get close to listen, and to take part, that is, to actively eschew the objectifying mind-gaze to participate in what one wants to understand<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Anthropologists do this when they immerse themselves in a society not their own. The compensation bid need not stop there, however. </span>It can be carried over from the social ground to the<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> sacral one (and in this case the </span>Taoist one),thus providing the kind of insight not otherwise available to rationalists because of how they choose to know. Those rationalists who get this far will no doubt want to follow their Taoist insights up by considering them rationally, but at least they will have Taoist insights to follow up. At least, having accepted immersion in the “shallow” or meditative end of the experiential pool, or even beyond, they may have learned what otherwise they would not have been able to. The rationalist may even want to follow this up with further attempts to take part, and further rationalist reappraisals. By which point we will have constructed a cycle of knowing that is already rolling rationalism forward across the epistemological divide<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. We are still faced with fundamental uncertainty about the ground on which we stand (though most natural scientists will remain oblivious, and many social scientists likewise.) </span>By eternally returning to both rationalism and Taoism, however, we no longer have to set the one up in opposition to the other. We do not have to abandon our regard for rigor, or our preference for specified indicies of comparison or the reassessing sacral insights in non sacral ways<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. But </span>nor do we have to abandon the idea that Taoism has something meaningful to say about the concept of global security. The two are no longer placed in contention,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> since to place them thus is to cleave to the rationalist line as the surest way to know what is true, and to ignore the way the ontological character of rationalism compromises an such surety. While we are sued to having sacral illusion dispelled by analytic clarity, we are not so used to having analytic illusion dispelled by sacral clarity. That is the task before us, however, and it is a task with normative implications considerably more extensive than those rationalists would valorize. </span><br />

<strong>4. Turn – their alternative collapses into tautology – they ask you to stop trying to fix the world, and enjoy what is. But Students are uncomfortable with Doing Nothing – the alternative undermines Our happiness and value to life.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Kirkland, 1996, Associate Professor of Religion (and Asian Studies),</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> [Russell Kirkland “The Book of the Way,” 24-29, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/DAODE.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://kirkland.myweb.uga.edu/rk/pdf/pubs/DAODE.pdf</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Once upon a time, several years ago, I had the opportunity to engage in a variety of team teaching enterprises at Stanford University. At one time, my colleague Lee </span>Yearley sought to impress upon students the differences between the thought of the Confucian thinker<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Mencius </span>and the thought of the Taoist thinker<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Chuang-tzu. The starting point was Mencius' famous insistence that human nature is such that none of us would fail to be moved if we saw an infant facing imminent death, such as by falling into an open well; Chuang-tzu, meanwhile, presumably believed that humans are incapable of comprehending the true meaning of the events that constitute the context of our lives, and urged us to refrain from the delusion that we can correctly analyze those events and correctly govern the events that occur to us. To stimulate students' ruminations on these issues, Lee Yearley gave our students an assignment, to write a paper beginning with the following proposition: Mencius and Chuang-tzu are sitting together on a riverbank, when an infant was descried floating precariously on the river, apparently on its way to its death from drowning. </span>The students' assignment was to describe what each man, in that situation, would do, and why. His assumption was that as students wrestled with the thought content of each of the thinkers in question, students would have to grapple with the morally difficult imperative of Chuang-tzu's thought, which would ask us to forego intervention in the processes<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> at work around us, even if such restraint should mean that innocent children should perish as a result. This presumed moral dilemma was intended to challenge students to wrestle meaningfully with the dilemma of the human condition: that is, that humans live with moral imperatives to do what seems to us to be good, at the same time that we realize that we cannot fully control the events that take place around us, and can probably not fully effect our will, despite our best intentions. Such, at least, was the apparent moral quandary into which Lee Yearley worked to lead the students in our class. One of my own students, however, quickly answered the assigned question, in an unexpectedly easy fashion. The assignment was to explain what Mencius and Chuang-tzu each would do, and why, so this student simply explained that Mencius would jump up to save the baby, for the obvious reasons, and that Chuang-tzu would do nothing whatsoever, because he had no reason to do so: Mencius was already out there saving the baby, so there was really nothing more for him to do. This example came to my mind when I began to ponder what the Taoists of ancient China would say about the ecological problems of the late twentieth century. If, so to speak, planet Earth is drifting precariously in the direction of presumable disaster, what would be the action that Chuang Chou and his contemporaries would have us take? In other words, </span>would &quot;Taoism,&quot; in that sense, provide a solution to the apparent moral dilemma that faces our planet in our own day and age<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and if so, what form might that solution take? As some of the other presenters gathered here seem already to have suggested, it is commonly believed by some hopeful minds that Taoism provides a pretty solution to the presumed problems of the planet. But more careful thought suggests that </span>Taoism might not offer happy solutions to the problems of the modern world<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. What if, for instance, the issue in the foregoing example was not a human baby floating in a river, but rather the species of the whooping crane, its continuance threatened by the encroachment of human civilization. If Chuang Chou were sitting by watching earth's species threatened with extinction, what would he really do, and why? </span>The answer, I fear, is not certain to fill our hearts with sanguine certainty of the future of the cranes, or with sanguine happiness that Chuang Chou shares our desire to preserve them<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In fact, the only logical answer to this latter-day challenge to Taoist values would seem to be that Chuang Chou would, as it were, watch the whooping cranes float down the river on their way to apparent extinction, and would do nothing whatsoever to interfere with the natural operations of the world. The only logical answer to this situation is that </span>the Taoist sees no action to be required, for he trusts that the world is already operating as it is supposed to be operating<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and all human activity — no matter how well-intentioned — can add nothing of value to such operation, and can logically only interfere with the course of nature as it is already unfolding. Just as Chuang-tzu would not dive into a river to save a floating baby, he would not take deliberate action to save the world from apparent destruction. It is, in fact, on this basis that one can, in fact, distinguish classical Taoists from classical Confucians: like modern Westerners, the Confucians generally assume that the world inherently tends toward chaos and requires the redemptive activity of human society, individually and collectively. But Taoists, as a rule, do not share the Confucian (or Western) fear of the natural processes of life, and consequently do not fear the extinction of the whooping cranes, nor do Taoists enjoin deliberate action to save the cranes, or even Earth as a whole, from extinction.</span><br />

<strong>5. We defend our epistemology – there is value to life. Our status as beings inheres an affirmation of life in the face of extinction and nonbeing.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bernstein 2002</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Richard J., Vera List Prof. Phil. – New School for Social Research, “Radical Evil: A Philosophical Interrogation”, p. 188-192)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">This is precisely what </span>Jonas<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> does in The Phenomenon of Life, his rethinking of the meaning of organic life. He tealizes that his philosophical project goes against many of the deeply embedded prejudices and dogmas of contemporary philosophy. He </span>challenges two well-entrenched dogmas: that there is no metaphysical truth, and that there is no path from the &quot;is&quot; to the &quot;ought&quot;. To escape from ethical nihilism, we must show that there is a metaphysical ground of ethics, an objective basis for value<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and purpose in being itself. These are strong claims; and, needless to say, they are extremely controversial. In defense of Jonas, it should be said that he approaches this task with both boldness and intellectual modesty. He frequently acknowledges that he cannot &quot;prove&quot; his claims, but he certainly believes that his &quot;premises&quot; do &quot;more justice to the total phenomenon of man and Being in general&quot; than the prevailing dualist or reductionist alternatives. &quot;But in the last analysis my argument can do no more than give a rational grounding to an option it presents as a choice for a thoughtful person — an option that of course has its own inner power of persuasion. Unfortunately I have nothing better to offer. Perhaps a future metaphysics will be able to do more.&quot; 8 To appreciate how Jonas's philosophical project unfolds, we need to examine his philosophical interpretation of life. This is the starting point of his grounding of a new imperative of responsibility. It also provides the context for his speculations concerning evil. In the foreword to The Phenomenon of Life, Jonas gives a succinct statement of his aim. Put at its briefest, this volume offers an &quot;existential&quot; interpretation of biological facts. Contemporary existentialism, obsessed with man alone, is in the habit of claiming as his unique privilege and predicament much of what is rooted in organic existence as such: in so doing, it withholds from the organic world the insights to be learned from the awareness of self. On its part, scientific biology, by its rules confined to the physical, outward facts, must ignore the dimension of inwardness that belongs to life: in so doing, it submerges the distinction of &quot;animate&quot; and &quot;inanimate.&quot; A new reading of the biological record may recover the inner dimension — that which we know best -- for the understanding of things organic and so reclaim for psycho-physical unity of life that place in the theoretical scheme which it had lost through the divorce of the material and the mental since Descartes. p. ix) </span>Jonas<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, in his existential interpretation of bios, </span>pursues &quot;this underlying theme of all of life<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in its development </span>through the ascending order of organic powers<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and functions: </span>metabolism, moving and desiring, sensing and perceiving, imagination, art, and mind <span style="font-size: 7pt;">— a progressive scale of freedom and peril, culminating in man, who may understand his uniqueness anew when he no longer sees himself in metaphysical isolation&quot; (PL, p. ix). The way in which Jonas phrases this theme recalls the Aristotelian approach to bios, and it is clear that Aristotle is a major influence on Jonas. There is an even closer affinity with the philosophy of nature that Schelling sought to elaborate in the nineteenth century. Schelling (like many post- Kantian German thinkers) was troubled by the same fundamental dichotomy that underlies the problem for Jonas. The dichotomy that Kant introduced between the realm of &quot;disenchanted&quot; nature and the realm of freedom leads to untenable antinomies. Jonas differs from both Aristotle and Schelling in taking into account Darwin and contemporary scientific biology. A proper philosophical understanding of biology must always be compatible with the scientific facts. But at the same time, it must also root out misguided materialistic and reductionist interpretations of those biological facts. In this respect, Jonas's naturalism bears a strong affinity with the evolutionary naturalism of Peirce and Dewey. At the same time, Jonas is deeply skeptical of any theory of evolutionary biology that introduces mysterious &quot;vital forces&quot; or neglects the contingencies and perils of evolutionary development.' Jonas seeks to show &quot;that it is in the dark stirrings of primeval organic substance that a principle of freedom shines forth for the first time within the vast necessity of the physical universe&quot; (PL 3). Freedom, in this broad sense, is not identified exclusively with human freedom; it reaches down to the first glimmerings of organic life, and up to the type of freedom manifested by human beings. &quot; </span>'Freedom' must denote an objectively discernible mode of being<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, i.e., a manner of executing existence, distinctive of the organic per se and thus shared by all members but by no nonmembers of the class: an ontologically descriptive term which can apply to mere physical evidence at first&quot; (PL 3). This coming into being of freedom is not just a success story. &quot;The privilege of freedom carries the burden of need and means precarious being&quot; (PL 4). It is with biological metabolism that this principle of freedom first arises. </span>Jonas goes &quot;so far as to maintain that metabolism<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, the basic stratum of all organic existence, already displays freedom — indeed that it </span>is the first form freedom takes<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.&quot; 1 ° With &quot;metabolism — its power and its need — not-being made its appearance in the world as an alternative embodied in being itself; and thereby being itself first assumes an emphatic sense: intrinsically qualified by the threat of its negative it must affirm itself, and existence affirmed is existence as a concern&quot; (PL 4). This broad, ontological understanding of freedom as a characteristic of all organic life serves Jonas as &quot;an Ariadne's thread through the interpretation of Life&quot; (PL 3). The way in which Jonas enlarges our understanding of freedom is indicative of his primary argumentative strategy. He expands and reinterprets categories that are normally applied exclusively to human beings so that we can see that they identify objectively discernible modes of being characteristic of everything animate. Even inwardness, and incipient forms of self; reach down to the simplest forms of organic life. 11 Now it may seem as if Jonas is guilty of anthropomorphism, of projecting what is distinctively human onto the entire domain of living beings. He is acutely aware of this sort of objection, but he argues that even the idea of anthropomorphism must be rethought. 12 We distort Jonas's philosophy of life if we think that he is projecting human characteristics onto the nonhuman animate world. Earlier I quoted the passage in which Jonas speaks of a &quot;third way&quot; — &quot;one by which the dualistic rift can be avoided and yet enough of the dualistic insight saved to uphold the humanity of man&quot; (GEN 234). We avoid the &quot;dualistic rift&quot; by showing that there is genuine continuity of organic life, and that such categories as freedom, inwardness, and selfhood apply to everything that is animate. These categories designate objective modes of being. But we preserve &quot;enough dualistic insight&quot; when we recognize that </span>freedom, inwardness, and selfhood manifest themselves in human beings in a distinctive manner<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. I do not want to suggest that Jonas is successful in carrying out this ambitious program. He is aware of the tentativeness and fallibility of his claims, but he presents us with an understanding of animate beings such that we can discern both continuity and difference.' 3 It should now be clear that Jonas is not limiting himself to a regional philosophy of the organism or a new &quot;existential&quot; interpretation of biological facts. His goal is nothing less than to provide a new metaphysical understanding of being, a new ontology. And he is quite explicit about this. Our reflections [are] intended to show in what sense the problem of life, and with it that of the body, ought to stand in the center of ontology and, to some extent, also of epistemology. . . The central position of the problem of life means not only that it must be accorded a decisive voice in judging any given ontology but also that any treatment of itself must summon the whole of ontology. (PL 25) The philosophical divide between Levinas and Jonas appears to be enormous. For Levinas, as long as we restrict ourselves to the horizon of Being and to ontology (no matter how broadly these are conceived), there is no place for ethics, and no answer to ethical nihilism. For Jonas, by contrast, unless we can enlarge our understanding of ontology in such a manner as would provide an objective grounding for value and purpose within nature, there is no way to answer the challenge of ethical nihilism. But despite this initial appearance of extreme opposition, there is a way of interpreting Jonas and Levinas that lessens the gap between them. In Levinasian terminology, we can say that Jonas shows that there is a way of understanding ontology and the living body that does justice to the nonreducible alterity of the other (l'autrui). 14 Still, we might ask how Jonas's &quot;existential&quot; interpretation of biological facts and the new ontology he is proposing can provide a metaphysical grounding for a new ethics. Jonas criticizes the philosophical prejudice that there is no place in nature for values, purposes, and ends. Just as he maintains that </span>freedom, inwardness, and selfhood are objective modes of being,so<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> he argues that </span>values and ends are objective modes of being<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>There is a basic value inherent in organic being, a basic affirmation, &quot;The Yes' of Life<span style="font-size: 7pt;">&quot; (IR 81). 15 &quot;</span>The self-affirmation of being becomes emphatic in the opposition of life to death. Life is the explicit confrontation of being with not-being. . . . The 'yes' of all striving is here sharpened by the active `no' to not-being<span style="font-size: 7pt;">&quot; (IR 81-2). Furthermore — and this is the crucial point for Jonas — </span>this affirmation of life that is in all organic being has a binding obligatory force upon human beings. This blindly self-enacting &quot;yes&quot; gains obligating force in the seeing freedom of man,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> who as the supreme outcome of nature's purposive labor is no longer its automatic executor but, with the power obtained from knowledge, can become its destroyer as well. </span>He must adopt the &quot;yes&quot; into his will and impose the &quot;no&quot; to not-being on his power<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. But precisely this transition from willing to obligation is the critical point of moral theory at which attempts at laying a foundation for it come so easily to grief. Why does now, in man, that become a duty which hitherto &quot;being&quot; itself took care of through all individual willings? (IR 82). We discover here the transition from is to &quot;ought&quot; — from the self-affirmation of life to the binding obligation of human beings to preserve life not only for the present but also for the future. But why do we need a new ethics? The subtitle of The Imperative of Responsibility — In Search of an Ethics for the Technological Age — indicates why we need a new ethics. </span>Modern technology has transformed the nature and consequences of human ac-tion so radically that the underlying premises of traditional ethics are no longer valid<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For the first time in history human beings possess the knowledge and the power to destroy life on this planet, including human life. </span>Not only is there the new possibility of total nuclear disaster; there are the<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> even more invidious and threatening possibilities that result from the unconstrained </span>use of technologies that can destroy the environment required for<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> life. The major transformation brought about by modern technology is that the consequences of our actions frequently exceed by far anything we can envision. Jonas was one of the first philosophers to warn us about the unprecedented ethical and political problems that arise with the rapid development of biotechnology. He claimed that this was happening at a time when there was an &quot;ethical vacuum,&quot; when there did not seem to be any effective ethical principles to limit ot guide our ethical decisions. In the name of scientific and technological &quot;progress,&quot; there is a relentless pressure to adopt a stance where virtually anything is permissible, includ-ing transforming the genetic structure of human beings, as long as it is &quot;freely chosen.&quot; </span>We need<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, Jonas argued, </span>a new categorical imperative that might be formulated as follows: &quot;Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life&quot;;<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> or expressed negatively: &quot;</span>Act so that the effects of your action are not destructive of the future possibility of such a life&quot;<span style="font-size: 7pt;">; or simply: &quot;</span>Do not compromise the conditions for an indefinite continuation of humanity on earth<span style="font-size: 7pt;">&quot;; or again turned positive: &quot;In your present choices, include the future wholeness of Man among the objects of your will.&quot; (IR 11)</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">EXPLANATION AND TECHNOLOGY: </span>Humans<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (and transhumans) </span>are marked by a persistent desire to<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> understand and </span>control their environment <span style="font-size: 7pt;">and experience. </span>Before the development of the scientific method,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> deductive and inductive logic, game theory, sophisticated epistemic principles and so on, </span>humans resorted to superficial causal explanations based on observation for common phenomena<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and theistic explanation for unusual events. </span>Deities were invoked<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> to explain unusual or destructive phenomena, and to try to provide a comforting model of the uncertainties and uncontrollable events in life. Storms, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, </span>epidemics and madness could not be tolerated without some belief about their cause<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In the absence of scientific explanation a religious or theistic explanation was almost inevitable. </span>Along with pre-scientific attempts at understanding came a crude attempt at a technology. A tension is evident here: On the one hand religions have frequently declared events to be determined by a divine plan and so have held attempts at changing things to be futile<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (this is common in Eastern religions, as well as other religions involving predestination</span>). On the other hand, religions have offered certain limited and carefully circumscribed means of changing and controlling events, such as through prayer, ritual, and magic. The overall result has been entropic and anti-progressive since religious technology is ineffective (with the occasional exception of psychosomatic effects).<br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Next </span>there are philosophical reasons for the anti-science movements, formulated by thinkers who<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> bring their full logical prowess to </span>show that a framework based on logic alone is untenable. They<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> explore the flaws in the foundations of scientific thinking, and </span>question science's claim to hold monopoly for a correct interpretation of the natural world<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. These are interesting perspectives in the academic arena, but </span>when they spill over to the general public and uproot the public's respect for science, they can cause serious damage to the framework of reason and rationality in which science operates in its interpretation of the world.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> When reason and rationality are devalued or are equated with unreason in our pursuit to explain the world, </span>superstition and mindless magic can take over with serious adverse impacts on society<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The prospect of posth</span>umanity is feared for at least two reasons. One is that the state of being posthuman might in itself be degrading,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> so that by becoming posthuman we might be harming ourselves. </span>Another is that posthumans might pose a threat to ‘ordinary’ humans.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (I shall set aside a third possible reason, that the development of posthumans might offend some supernatural being.) The most prominent bioethicist to focus on the first fear is Leon Kass: Most of the given bestowals of nature have their given speciesspecified natures: they are each and all of a given sort . Cockroaches and humans are equally bestowed but differently natured. To turn a man into a cockroach – as we don’t need Kafka to show us – would be dehumanizing. To try to turn a man into more than a man might be so as well. We need more than generalized appreciation for nature’s gifts. We need a particular regard and respect for the special gift that is our own given nature 3 </span>Transhumanists counter that nature’s gifts<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> are sometimes poisoned and </span>should not always be accepted<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong>Cancer, malaria, dementia, aging, starvation, unnecessary suffering, and cognitive shortcomings are all among the presents that we would wisely refuse</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>Our own species-specified natures are a rich source of much of the thoroughly<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> unrespectable and unacceptable – susceptibility for </span>disease, murder, rape, genocide, cheating, torture, racism<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>The horrors of nature<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in general, and of our own nature in particular, </span>are so well documented <span style="font-size: 7pt;">4 that it is astonishing that somebody as distinguished as Leon Kass should still in this day and age be tempted to rely on the natural as a guide as to what is desirable or </span>normatively right.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> We should be grateful that our ancestors were not swept away by the Kassian sentiment, or we would still be picking lice off each other’s backs. </span>Rather than deferring to the natural order, transhumanists maintain that we can legitimately reform ourselves and our natures in accordance with humane values and personal aspirations.<br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Shouldn’t we concentrate on current problems such as improving the situation of the poor, rather than putting our efforts into planning for the “far” future? We should do both. Focusing solely on current problems would leave us unprepared for the new challenges that we will encounter. </span>Many of the technologies and trends that transhumanists discuss are already reality<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Biotechnology and information technology have transformed large sectors of our economies. </span>The relevance of transhumanist ethics is manifest in such contemporary issues as stem cell research, genetically modified crops, human genetic therapy, embryo screening, end of life decisions, enhancement medicine, information markets, and research funding priorities<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The importance of transhumanist ideas is likely to increase as the opportunities for human enhancement proliferate. </span>Transhuman technologies will tend to work well together and create synergies with other parts of human society.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> For example, one important factor in healthy life expectancy is access to good medical care. </span>Improvements in medical care will extend healthy, active lifespan<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – “healthspan” – and research into healthspan extension is likely to benefit ordinary care. </span>Work on amplifying intelligence has obvious applications in education, decision-making, and communication. Better communications would facilitate trade and understanding between peopl<span style="font-size: 7pt;">e. As more and more people get access to the Internet and are able to receive satellite radio and television broadcasts, di</span>ctators and totalitarian regimes may find it harder to silence voices of dissent<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and to control the information flow in their populations. And with the Internet and email, people discover they can easily form friendships and business partnerships in foreign countries. </span>A world order characterized by peace, international cooperation, and respect for human rights would much improve the odds that the potentially dangerous applications of some future technologies can be controlled and would also free up resources currently spent on military armaments, some of which could then hopefully be diverted to improving the condition of the poor. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Nanotechnological manufacturing promises to be both economically profitable and environmentally sound. Transhumanists do not have a patent solution to achieve these outcomes, any more than anybody else has, but </span>technology has a huge role to play<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. An argument can be made that </span>the most efficient way of contributing to making the world better is by participating in the transhumanist project. This is so because the stakes are enormous<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – </span>humanity’s entire future may depend on how we manage the coming technological transitions – and because relatively few resources are at the present time being devoted to transhumanist efforts. Even one extra person can still make a significant difference here.<br />

<br />
<strong>Owen, 2</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – (David Owen, Reader of Political Theory at the Univ. of Southampton, Millennium Vol 31 No 3 2002 p. 655-7)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Commenting on the ‘philosophical turn’ in IR, Wæver remarks that </span>‘[a] frenzy for words like “epistemology” and “ontology” often signals this philosophical turn’<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, although he goes on to comment that these terms are often used loosely.4 However, loosely deployed or not, it is clear that debates concerning ontology and epistemology play a central role in the contemporary IR theory wars. In one respect, this is unsurprising since it is a characteristic feature of the social sciences that periods of disciplinary disorientation involve recourse to reflection on the philosophical commitments of different theoretical approaches, and there is no doubt that such reflection can play a valuable role in making explicit the commitments that characterise (and help individuate) diverse theoretical positions. </span>Yet, such a philosophical turn is not without its dangers <span style="font-size: 7pt;">and I will briefly mention three before turning to consider a confusion that has, I will suggest, helped to promote the IR theory wars by motivating this philosophical turn. The first danger with the philosophical turn is that </span>it has an inbuilt tendency to prioritise issues of ontology and epistemology over explanatory and/or interpretive power as if the latter two were merely a simple function of the former. But while the explanatory and/or interpretive power of a theoretical account is not <span style="font-size: 7pt;">wholly independent of its ontological and/or epistemological commitments (otherwise criticism of these features would not be a criticism that had any value), it is by no means clear that it is, in contrast, </span>wholly dependent on these philosophical commitments.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Thus, for example, one need not be sympathetic to rational choice theory to recognise that it can provide powerful accounts of certain kinds of problems, such as the tragedy of the commons in which dilemmas of collective action are foregrounded.</span> It may, of course, be the case that the advocates of rational choice theory cannot give a good account of why this type of theory is powerful <span style="font-size: 7pt;">in accounting for this class of problems (i.e., how it is that the relevant actors come to exhibit features in these circumstances that approximate the assumptions of rational choice theory) and, </span>if this is the case, it is a philosophical weakness—but this does not undermine the point that, for a certain class of problems, rational choice theory may provide the best account available to us. In other words, while the critical judgement of theoretical accounts in terms of their ontological and/or epistemological sophistication is one kind of critical judgement, it is not the only or even necessarily the most important kind<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The second danger run by the philosophical turn is </span>that because prioritisation of ontology and epistemology promotes theory-construction from philosophical first principles, it cultivates a theory-driven rather than problem-driven approach to IR. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Paraphrasing Ian Shapiro, the point can be put like this:</span> since it is the case that there is always a plurality of possible true descriptions of a given action, event or phenomenon, the challenge is to decide which is the most apt in terms of getting a perspicuous grip on the action, event or phenomenon in question given the purposes of the inquiry; yet, from this standpoint, ‘theory-driven work is part of a reductionist program’ in that it ‘dictates always opting for the description that calls for the explanation that flows from the preferred model or theory’.5 The justification<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> offered for this strategy </span>rests on the mistaken belief that it is necessary for social science because general explanations are required to characterise the classes of phenomena studied in similar terms. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">However, as Shapiro points out,</span> this is to misunderstand the enterprise of science since ‘whether there are general explanations for classes of phenomena is a question for social-scientific inquiry, not to be prejudged before conducting that inquiry’.6 Moreover, this strategy easily slips into the promotion of the pursuit of generality over that of empirical validity. The third danger is that the preceding two combine to encourage the formation of a particular image of disciplinary debate in IR—what might be called (only slightly tongue in cheek) ‘the Highlander view’—namely, an image of warring theoretical approaches<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> with each, despite occasional temporary tactical alliances, dedicated to the strategic achievement of sovereignty over the disciplinary field. It encourages this view because </span>the<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> turn to, and </span>prioritisation of, ontology and epistemology stimulates the idea that there can only be one theoretical approach which gets things right, namely, the theoretical approach that gets its ontology and epistemology right. This image feeds back into IR exacerbating the first and second dangers, and so a potentially vicious circle arises.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">4. Motions and Resolutions.</span> A motion is a proposal that the assembly take certain action, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or that it express itself as holding certain views. It is made by a member's obtaining the floor as already described and saying, &quot;I move that&quot; (which is equivalent to saying, &quot;I propose that&quot;), and then stating the action he proposes to have taken. Thus a member &quot;moves&quot; (proposes) that a resolution be adopted, or amended, or referred to a committee, or that a vote of thanks be extended, etc.; or &quot;That it is the sense of this meeting (or assembly) that industrial training,&quot; etc. Every resolution should be in writing, and the presiding officer has a right to require any main motion, amendment, or instructions to a committee to be in writing. When a main motion is of such importance or length as to be in writing it is usually written in the form of a resolution, that is,</span> beginning with the words, &quot;Resolved,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> That,&quot; the word &quot;Resolved&quot; being underscored (printed in italics) and followed by a comma, and the word &quot;That&quot; beginning with a capital &quot;T.&quot; If the word &quot;Resolved&quot; were replaced by the words &quot;I move,&quot; the resolution would become a motion. A resolution is always a main motion. In some sections of the country the word &quot;resolve&quot; is frequently used instead of &quot;resolution.&quot; In assemblies with paid employees, instructions given to employees are called &quot;orders&quot; instead of &quot;resolutions,&quot; and the enacting word, &quot;Ordered&quot; is used instead of &quot;Resolved.&quot; [He Continues…..] 7. Debate. After a question has been stated by the chair, it is before the assembly for consideration and action. All resolutions, reports of committees, communications to the assembly, and all amendments proposed to them, and all other motions except the Undebatable Motions mentioned in 45, may be debated before final action is taken on them, unless by a two-thirds vote the assembly decides to dispose of them without debate.

<strong>3. Turn – their alternative causes barbarism and genocide. Humanism has eliminated torture, slavery, and slaughter of defeated enemies</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">When the inclination is to wallow in the dark side of humanity, </span>it is worth emphasizing that the legacy of the enlightenment has provided us with a high standard of moral and ethical responsibility. The twentieth century has witnessed appalling atrocities and relapses into barbarism and genocide. Yet though the scale of degradation experienced in modern society may have been greater than in earlier times, it is only in our era that such events would have been popularly regarded with moral opprobrium. Torture, slavery, the slaughter of defeated enemies – before the modern era such activities were generally considered legitimate and went without question.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Autocracy, hierarchy, elitism were considered to be features of a natural order vested with divine authority. </span>It is only with the emergence of modern society, with its concepts of democracy and equality, that the possibility of progress and the improvement of humanity in both a material and moral sense arises.<br />

<br />
<span class="CardUnderlinedChar">Liberal humanism</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in my view</span><span class="CardUnderlinedChar">, offers a more cogent critique of capitalist society because it generally accepts capitalism as an economic system that is more productive and efficient than the alternatives. Yet liberal humanism seeks to limit capitalism's social and cultural effects by preserving certain spheres - politics, art, education - as having a limited autonomy from the imperatives of the market. This attitude of partial acceptance and partial critique is much more realistic and effective, for example, in protesting the commercialization of the university, or in preserving artistic standards, than the total rejection of &quot;late-capitalist society&quot; that is common among academic pseudoradicals. Total opposition is more readily co-opted by the system because it forms a mirror image. If the system is all-powerful, how can Theorists explain the possibility or acceptability of their own opposition to it?</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This problem is usually evaded; but when it is confronted, a doctrine of &quot;necessary complicity&quot; is often evoked. If you disbelieve in your own autonomy as an individual, you must be liable in dark moments to suspect that you are actually working <em>for</em> the system. Resistance to the system is part of the system. </span><span class="CardUnderlinedChar">Total rejection flips into total acceptance and opens the way for a personal exploitation of the academic system</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<strong>6. Turn – Humanism is key to all emancipatory struggles – any rejection of humanism and arguments about rationalism treat people as ahistorical subjects and denies humanity to non-Western Others</strong><br />
<br />
Malik '96<span style="font-size: 8pt;">- senior visting fellow at the Department of Political, International and Policy Studies at the University of Surrey (Kenan, &quot;The Mirror of Race: Postmodernism and the Celebration of Difference,&quot; in &quot;In Defense of History,&quot; Ed. by E. Meiskins Wood &amp; John Foster, p.121-127,)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10pt;">Whether liberal or Marxist, underlying all humanistic strands is a belief in human emancipation—the idea that humankind can rationally transform society through the agency of its own efforts. Indeed, no emancipatory philosophy is possible without a humanist perspective, for any antihuman-istic outlook is forced to look outside of humanity for the agency of salva­tion</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">—if earthly salvation is possible at all. Antihumanistic strands developed from the Enlightenment on, largely in opposition to the idea of rational human emancipation. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10pt;">Just as there have been a number of different strands of humanism, so there have been a number of different strands of antihumanism,</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> ranging from the conserva­tism of Burke, the Catholic reaction of de Maistre, to the nihilism of Nietzsche and the Nazism of Heidegger. All rejected Enlightenment ration­alism and the idea of social progress because they despaired of the capacity of humankind for such rational progress, a despair that was in general an expression of either fear of or contempt for the masses, who were seen as irrational, atavistic, and a threat to civilized society. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10pt;">Antihumanism rejected ideas of equality and human unity, celebrating instead difference and divergence and exalting the particular and the &quot;authentic&quot; over the universal</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Antihumanism developed therefore as a central component of elite theo­ries. In the postwar era, however, antihumanism came to represent a very different tradition—the liberal, indeed radical, anticolonialist and antiracist outlook. In the hands of such critics of Western society as Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Louis Althusser, among others, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10pt;">antihumanism became a central thread of structuralist and poststructural­ist theories</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and a key weapon in the interrogation of racist and imperialist discourses. Even Jean-Paul Sartre, in his famous preface to Fanon's <em>The Wretched of the Earth,</em> wrote that &quot;Humanism is nothing but an ideology of lies, a perfect justification for pillage; its honeyed words, its affectations of sensibility were only alibis for our aggression.&quot; Elsewhere he claimed that .&quot;Humanism is the counterpart of racism: it is a practice of exclusion.&quot;17 How did a philosophical outlook which originated within conservative anti-emancipatory politics, and which was a key component of racial theory, become a central motif of radical antiracist, anti-imperialist doctrines? And how did philosophers such as Nietzsche and Heidegger, whose work had previously been seen as paving the way for twentieth century racist and fascist ideologies, become icons of antiracist discourse? There were two main strands to postwar radical antihumanism. One developed out of anticolonial struggles, the other through Western (and in particular French) academic philosophy and was subsequently elaborated by the &quot;new social movements&quot; such as feminism and environmentalism. In <em>The Wretched of the Earth,</em> Fanon gave voice to the rage of colonial peoples against their inhuman treatment at the hands of the imperialist powers. The humanist idea of &quot;Man,&quot; wrote Fanon, which lay at the heart of the Western post-Enlightenment tradition, was achieved through dehu­manizing the non-Western Other. Europeans only became human, Fanon suggested, by denying humanity to their colonial Other. To maintain a belief in humanism while treating non-European peoples as animals, Europeans declared that non-Europeans were in fact subhuman. Herein lay the source of racial theory in humanism. At the same time, argued Fanon, humanists salved their consciences by inviting the subhuman colonial Other to become human by imitating &quot;European Man.&quot; The category &quot;human&quot; is empty of meaning, the critics asserted, because it is ahistorical. The invocation of a common human nature hides the fact that human nature is socially and historically constructed. According to the anthropologist James Clifford, &quot;[I]t is a general feature of humanist com­mon denominators that they are meaningless, since they bypass local cultural codes that make personal experience articulate.&quot; When human­ists assert the universality of human nature, what they are really talking about are the particular human values expressed in European society. Third world critics, however—and some European critics like Sartre too— did not reject humanism in its entirety. Fanon, for instance, recognized that the contradiction lay not in humanism itself but in the disjuncture between the ideology of humanism and the practice of colonialism: All the elements of a solution to the great problems of humanity have, at different times, existed in European thought. But Europeans have not carried out in practice the mission which fell to them, which consisted of bringing their whole weight to bear violently upon these elements, of modifying their arrangement and their nature, of changing them and, finally, of bringing the problem of mankind to an infinitely higher plane.19 Fanon called therefore for a new humanism stripped of its racist, Euro­centric aspects: Let us decide not to imitate Europe; let us combine our muscles and our brains in a new direction. Let us try to create the whole man, whom Europe has been incapable of bringing to triumphant birth.20 For Fanon, then, the humanist idea of &quot;the whole man&quot; was key to emancipation. Despite the critique of Western humanism as a camouflage for the dehumanization of non-Western peoples, humanism remained a central component of the ideology of third world liberation struggles of the postwar era, virtually all of which drew on the emancipatory logic of uni­versalism. Indeed, Western radicals were often shocked by the extent to which anticolonial struggles adopted what the radicals conceived of as tainted ideas. As Claude Levi-Strauss noted ruefully, the doctrine of cultural relativism &quot;was challenged by the very people for whose moral benefit the anthropologists had established it in the first place.&quot; The willingness of third world radicals to maintain at least a residual support for a humanistic outlook stemmed from their continued engage­ment in the project of liberation. Postwar radicals in the West, however, increasingly rejected humanism, not simply in its guise as a cover for racism and colonialism but in its entirety. For postwar European intellectuals the most pressing problem was not that of establishing the ideological founda­tions of liberation struggles but rather of coming to terms with the demise of such struggles in Western democracies. Western intellectuals had, on the one hand, to excavate the social and intellectual roots of the Nazi experi­ence, an experience that more than any other weighed upon the European intellectual consciousness in the immediate postwar period; and on the other, to explain why the possibilities of revolutionary change, which had seemed so promising in the early part of the century, appeared to have been extinguished. For many the explanation seemed to lie in some deep-seated malaise in European culture.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10pt;">Postwar radicals asked themselves why it was that Germany, a nation with deep philosophical roots in the Enlightenment project and a strong and vibrant working class movement, should succumb so swiftly and so com­pletely to Nazism. The answer seemed to be that it was the logic of Enlight­enment rationalism itself and the nature of democratic politics that had given rise to such barbarism</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer put it in their seminal work, <em>The Dialectic of Enlightenment,</em> &quot;Enlightenment is totalitarian.&quot;22 Adorno and Horkheimer develop the two motifs—a cri­tique of Enlightenment rationality and social progress, on the one hand, and of mass society, on the other—which became central themes of the Frankfurt school and which were to become immensely influential in shap­ing postwar discourse. The idea that the Holocaust—and indeed all Western barbarism—had its roots in Enlightenment rationalism and humanism became a central tenet of postwar radicalism. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10pt;">The Enlightenment ambition of mastering nature, of setting humanity above nature, inevitably had destructive consequences for humanity itself. A humanity which could enslave nature was quite capable of enslaving fellow human beings.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As David Goldberg has put it, &quot;Subjuga­tion ... defines the order of the Enlightenment: subjugation of nature by human intellect, colonial control through physical and cultural domination, and economic superiority through mastery of the laws of the market.&quot;23 Mastery of nature and the rational organization of society, which in the nineteenth century was seen as the basis of human emancipation, now came to be regarded as the source of human enslavement. The idea that technological and social progress could be the cause of barbarism has led many critics to find evidence not simply of humanism but the whole project of &quot;modernity&quot; behind the Holocaust. Zygmunt Bau-man has suggested that the Final Solution was the &quot;product&quot; not the &quot;failure&quot; of modernity and that &quot;it was the rational world of modern civili­sation that made the Holocaust thinkable&quot;: The truth is that every ingredient of the Holocaust—all those many things that rendered it possible—was normal ... in the sense of being fully in keeping with everything we know about our civilisation, its guiding spirit, its priorities, its immanent vision of the world—and of the proper ways to pursue human happiness together with a perfect society.24 Bauman's argument that the Holocaust became thinkable only in the conditions of modernity may fall short of actually blaming that horror on Enlightenment principles of rationality; but his hint that &quot;civilisation&quot; itself may have been responsible for the barbarism of the &quot;Final Solution&quot; is made explicit by Richard Rubinstein who (in a phrase approvingly quoted by Bauman) argues that the Holocaust &quot;bears witness to the advance of civili­sation&quot;: The world of death camps and the society it engenders reveals the pro­gressively intensifying night side of Judeo-Christian civilization. Civiliza­tion means slavery, wars, exploitation, and death camps. It also means medical hygiene, elevated religious ideas, beautiful art, and exquisite music. It is an error to imagine that civilization and savage cruelties are antithesis... Both creation and destruction are inseparable parts of what we call civilization.25</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10pt;">This comes very close to saying not just that modernity makes death camps possible but that it makes them necessary and inevitable. This proposition is deeply questionable in many ways</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, but for our purposes, the first question that comes to mind is this: what does it mean to suggest that barbarism is a product of civilization? </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10pt;">To suggest that &quot;the advance of civilization&quot; inevitably leads to &quot;slavery, wars, exploitation, and death camps&quot; can only mean that barbarism is an ineradicable part of human nature. Yet is this not to posit a concept of a human nature that is as ahistorical as that supposedly held by humanists? Condemning civilization as forever imbricated with inhumanity is certainly an argument that sits uneasily with a critique of humanism which claims that an ahistoric notion of &quot;Man&quot; has been used to deny humanity to the West's Others. To argue that humanism and rationalism (or &quot;modernity&quot;) are the causes of the Holocaust is to turn logic on its head. The discourse of race was a product not of Enlightenment universalism and humanism but of its deg­radation. Scientific racism was not the application of science and reason to the question of human difference but the use of the discourse of science to give legitimacy to irrational, unscientific arguments. The &quot;Final Solution&quot; was implicit in the racial policies pursued by the Nazis. To engage in mass extermination it was necessary to believe that the objects of that policy were less than human. But to say that it was a rationally conceived plan is to elevate the prejudices of the Third Reich to the status of scientific knowl­edge—in other words to accept as true the very claims of racial discourse.</span><br />

<strong>8. Turn – Their critique devalues life – rejecting technological thought also rejects technological innovation and dooms us to extinction</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Heaberlin, 4</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – nuclear engineer, led the Nuclear Safety and Technology Applications Product Line at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Scott, </span>A Case for Nuclear-Generated Electricity<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, p. 31-40) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Well, then let's not do that, huh? Well, no, not hardly, </span>because without that use of fertilizers we couldn't produce the food to feed the population. We just couldn't do it.<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Here are some comparisons.&quot; </span>If you used no fertilizers or pesticides you could get 500 kilograms of grain from a hectare in a dry climate and as much as 1000 kilograms in a humid cli­mate. If you got organic and used animal manure as fertilizer, assuming you could find enough, you might get as much as 2000 <span style="font-size: 6pt;">kilograms per hectare. </span>For a sense of scale, the average in the United States, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">where recall we only get half the food value to hectare as the intensively farmed Chinese crop land, </span>we get about 4500 kilograms per hectare on the average. In serious cornfields with fertilizer, irrigation, and pesticides, the value is 7000<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> kilograms per hectare. </span>Modern mechanized, chemically supported agriculture produces 7 to 14 times the food that you would get without those advantages. Even the best organic farming would produce only 30 to 45% of the food value<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> you would get from the same sized chemically fertilized farm, </span>and that is assuming you could get the manure you needed to make it work. In very stark terms, without the chemically enhanced farming we would have probably something like one-fifth the food supply we have now. That means four-fifths the population would not be fed<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, at least as we are organized now. So, no, just giving up on fertilizers is not in the deal. However, we could get the hydrogen and energy from sources other than natural gas. Nuclear energy could be used to provide electricity to extract hydrogen from water and produce the process heat required to combine the hydrogen and nitrogen from the air. That is just a thought to stick in your mind. While we are looking at energy use in agriculture, here are a few more numbers for you.10 If you look at the energy input into agriculture and the energy you get out, you see some interesting facts. By combining the energy used to make fertilizers and pesticides, power irrigation, and run the farm machinery in the United States, we use about 0.7 kcal of fossil fuel energy for each 1 kcal of food we make. This doesn't include the energy needed to process and transport the food. In Europe where they farm more intensely, the amount of energy out is just about the same as energy in. In Germany and Italy the numbers are 1.4 and 1.7 kcal energy input to each 1 kcal output respectively. The point is you need energy to feed people, well at least a lot of people. Which gets us back to Cohen and his question. One of the studies he examined looked at a &quot;self-sustaining solar energy system.&quot; For the United States, this would replace all fossil energy and provide one-fifth to one-half the current energy use. The conclusion of the study was that this would either produce&quot; a significant reduction in our standard of living ... even if all the energy conservation measures known today were adopted&quot; or if set at the current standard of living, &quot;then the ideal U.S. population should be targeted at 40-100 million people.&quot; The authors of that study then cheerfully go on to point out that we do have enough fossil fuel to last a least a century, as long as we can work out the pesky environmental problems. So, </span>you can go to a &quot;self-sustaining&quot; energy economy as long as you are willing to shoot between 2 out of 3<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> and 6 out of 7 </span>of your neighbors<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. And this is a real question. The massive use of fossil fuel driven agriculture to provide the fertilizers and pesticides, and power the farm equipment, is a) vitally important to feed everyone, and b) something we just can't keep up in a business-as-usual fashion. Sustainable means you can keep doing it. Fossil energy supplies are finite; you will run out some time. Massive use of fossil energy and the greenhouse gases they produce also may very well tip the planet into one of those extinction events in which a lot of very bad things happen to a lot of the life on the earth. O.K. to Cohen's big question, how many people can the earth support? What it comes down to is that the &quot;Well, it depends&quot; answer depends on • what quality of life you will accept, • what level of technology you will use, and • what level of social integration you will accept. We have seen some of the numbers regarding quality of life. Clearly if you are willing to accept the Bangladesh diet, you can feed 1.8 times more people than if you chose the United States diet. If you choose the back-to-nature, live like our hearty forefathers, level of technology, you can feed perhaps one-fifth as many people as you can with modern chemical fertilized agriculture. The rest have to go. And here is the tough one. You can do a lot better, get a lot more people on the planet, if you just force a few things. Like, no more land wasted in growing grapes for wine or grains for whiskey and beer. No cropland used for tobacco. No more grain wasted on animals for meat, just grain for people. No more rich diets for the rich countries, share equally for everyone. No more trade barriers; too bad for the farmers in Japan and France, those countries would just have to accept their dependence on other countries for their food. It is easy to see that at least some of those might actually be a pretty good thing; however, the kicker is how do you get them to happen? After all, Mussolinill did make the trains run on time. How could you force these things without a totalitarian state? Are you willing to give up your ability to choose for yourself for the common good? It is not pretty, is it? </span>Cohen looked at all the various population estimates and concluded that most fell into the range of 4 to 16 billion<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Taking the highest value when researchers offered a range, Cohen calculated a high median of 12 billion and taking the lower part of the range a low median of 7.7 billion. The good news in this is 12 billion is twice as many people as we have now. The bad news is that the projections for world population for 2050 are between 7.8 and 12.5 billion. That means </span>we have got no more than 50 years before we exceed the nominal carrying capacity of the earth.<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Cohen also offers a qualifying observation by stating the &quot;First Law of Information,&quot; which asserts that 97.6% of all statistics are made up. This helps us appreciate that application of these numbers to real life is subject to a lot of assumptions and insufficiencies in our understanding of the processes and data. However, we can draw some insights from all of this. </span>What it comes down to is that if you choose the fully sustainable, non-fossil fuel long-term options with only limited social integration, the various estimates Cohen looked at give you a number like 1 billion or less people that the earth can support. That means 5 out of 6 of us have got to go, plus no new babies without an offsetting death. On the other hand, if you let technology continue to do its thing and perhaps get even better, the picture need not be so bleak. We haven't made all our farmland as productive as it can be.<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Remember, the Chinese get twice the food value per hectare as we do in the United States. </span>There is also a lot of land that would become arable if we could get water to it. And, of course<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, in case you need to go back and check the title of this book, </span>there are alternatives to fossil fuels to provide the energy to power that technology. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">So given a positive and perhaps optimistic view of technology, we can look to some of the high technology assumption based studies from Cohen's review. From the semi-credible set of these, we can find estimates from 19 to 157 billion as the number of people the earth could support with a rough average coming in about 60 billion. This is a good time to be reminded of the First Law of Information. The middle to lower end of this range, however, might be done without wholesale social reprogramming. Hopefully we would see the improvement in the quality of life in the developing countries as they industrialize and increase their use of energy. Hopefully, also this would lead to a matching of the reduction in fertility rates that has been observed in the developed countries, which in turn would lead to an eventual balancing of the human population. The point to all this is </span>the near-term future of the human race depends on technology. If we turn away from technology, a very large fraction of the current and future human race will starve. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">If we just keep on as we are, with our current level of technology and dependence on fossil fuel resources, in the near term it will be a race between fertility decrease and our ability to feed ourselves, with, frankly, disaster the slight odds-on bet. In a slightly longer term, dependence on fossil fuels has got to lead to either social chaos or environmental disaster. There are no other end points to that road. It doesn't go anywhere else. </span>However, if we accept that it is technology that makes us human, that technology uniquely identifies us as the only animal that can choose its future, we can choose to live, choose to make it a better world for everyone and all life. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">This means more and better technology. It means more efficient technology that is kinder to the planet but also allows humans to support large numbers in a high quality of life. That road is not easy and has a number of ways to screw up. However, it is a road that can lead to a happier place, a better place. Two Concluding Thoughts on the Case for Technology Two more points and I will end my defense of technology. First, I want to bring you back from all the historical tour and all the numbers about population to something more directly personal. Let me ask you two questions. What do you do for a living? What did you have for breakfast? Don't see any connection between these questions or of their connection to•the subject of technology? Don't worry, the point will come out shortly. I am just trying to bring the idea of technology back from this grand vision to its impact on your daily life. Just as a wild guess, your answer to the first question was something that, say 500 years ago, didn't even exist. If we look 20,000 years ago, the only job was&quot; get food.&quot; Even if you have a really directly socially valuable job like a medical doctor, 20,000 years ago you would have been extraneous. That is, the tribe couldn't afford you. What, no way! A doctor could save lives, surely a tribe would value such a skill. Well, sure, but the tribe could not afford taking one of their members out of the productive <em>/I</em> getting the food&quot; job for 20 years while that individual learned all those doctor skills. If you examine the &quot;what you do for a living&quot; just a bit I think you will see a grand interconnectedness of all things. I personally find it pretty remarkable that we have a society that values nuclear engineers enough that I can make a living at it. Think about it. Somehow what I have done has been of enough value that, through various taxpayer and utility ratepayers, society has given me enough money for food and shelter. The tribe 20,000 years ago wouldn't have put up with me for a day. You see, that is why we as humans are successful, wildly successful in fact. We work together. &quot;Yeah, sure we do,&quot; you reply, &quot; read a newspaper lately?&quot; Well, <em>O.K.,</em> we fuss and fight a good deal and some of us do some pretty stupid and pretty mean things. But the degree of cooperation is amazing if you just step back a bit. O.K., what did you have for breakfast: orange juice, coffee, toast, maybe some cereal and milk? Where do these things come from? Orange juice came from Florida or California. Coffee came from South America. Bread for the toast came perhaps from Kansas; cereal, from the Mid-West somewhere. The jam on the toast may have come from Oregon, or maybe Chile. Milk is probably the only thing that came from within a hundred miles of your breakfast table. Think about it. There were hundreds of people involved in your breakfast. Farmers, food-processing workers, packaging manufacturers, transportation people, energy producers, wholesale and retail people. Perhaps each one only spent a second on their personal contribution to your personal breakfast, but they touch thousands of other people's breakfasts as well. In turn, you buying the various components of your breakfast supported, in your part, all those people. They in turn, in some way or another, bought whatever you provide to society that allowed you to buy breakfast. Pretty amazing, don't you think? Now when you look at all that, </span>think about what ties all the planetwide interconnection,<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Yep, you guessed it: technology.</span> Without technology, you get what is available within your personal reach, and what you produce is available only to those who are near enough that you can personally carry it to them on your own two feet. Technology makes our world work. It gives you personally a productive and socially valuable way to make both a living and to provide your contribution to the rest of us<strong>.</strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> I want you to stop a minute and really think about that. </span>What would your life be like without technology? Could you do what you currently do? Would anyone be able to use what you do? Would anyone pay you for that?<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> &quot;But I am a school teacher,&quot; you say, &quot;of course, they would pay me!&quot; Are you sure? Why do you need schools if there is no technology? All I need is to teach the kid how to farm and how to hunt. Sons and daughters can learn that by working in the fields along with their parents. See what I mean? Now, I have hopefully reset your brain. Sure, you are still going to be hit with daily &quot;technology is bad&quot; messages. </span>Hopefully, you are<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> a bit more shielded against that din, and you have been given some perspective to balance that message and are </span>prepared to see the true critical value of technology to human existence.<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> The point is that </span>technology is what makes us human. Without it, we are just slightly smarter monkeys. You may feel that 6 billion of us are too many, and that may very well be<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>I<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> personally </span>don't know how to make that value decision<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Which particular person does one select as being one of the excess ones<span style="font-size: 6pt;">? </span>However, the fact is that there are 6 billion of us, and it looks like we are headed for 10 to 12 billion in the next 50 years<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, </span>Without not only the technology we have, but significantly better and more environmentally friendly technology, the world is going to get ugly<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> as we approach these numbers, On the other hand, </span>with the right technologies we can not only support those numbers, we can do it while we close the gap between the haves and have-nots. We can make it a better place for everyone. It takes technology and the energy to drive it.Choosing technology is what we have to do to secure the evolutionary selection of us as a successful species<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, Remember, some pages back in discussing the unlikely evolutionary path to us, I said </span>weare not the chosen, unless. Unless we choose us<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. This is what I meant. We are totally unique in all of evolutionary history. </span>We humans have the unique ability and opportunity to choose either our evolutionary success or failure. A choice of technology gives us a chance. A choice rejecting technology dooms us as a species and gives the cockroaches the chance in our place<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>Nature doesn't care what survives<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, algae seas, dinosaurs, humans, cockroaches, or whatever is successful. </span>If we care, we have to choose correctly.<span style="font-size: 6pt;">As an aside, let me address a point of philosophy here. If any of this offends your personal theology, I offer this for your consideration. Genesis tells us God gave all the Earth to humanity and charged us with the stewardship thereof. So it is ours to use as well as we can. That insightful social philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli put it this way in 1501: &quot;What remains to be done must be done by you; since in order not to deprive us of our free will and such share of glory as belongs to us, God will not do everything Himself.&quot; <em>O.K.,</em> you are saying, &quot;I give.&quot; You have beaten the socks off me. Technology is good; technology is the identifying human trait and our only hope. But what is this stuff about choosing technology or not? Technology just happens doesn't it? I mean, technology always advances, it always has, so why the big deal? Well, that is my last point on </span>technology<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. It </span>doesn't always just happen, and people have chosen to turn away from technology.<span style="font-size: 6pt;">In what might have seemed at the time to be a practical social decision, huge future implications were imposed on many generations to come. It has happened. Let me take you on one more trip through history. I think you will find it enlightening. In <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel,</em> Jared Diamond explores the question of why the European societies came to be dominate over all the other human cultures on earth. It is a fascinating story and provides a lot of insight into how modern societies evolved. In moving through history, he comes across a very odd discontinuity. He observes that if you came to earth from space in the year 1400 A.D., looked around, and went home to write your research paper on the probable future of the earth, you would clearly conclude the Chinese would run the entire planet shortly. Furthermore, you could conclude they would do it pretty darn well. If those same extraterrestrial researchers were to pop into their time machine and come back to earth in any year from say 1800 to now, they would be totally amazed to see China as a large, but relatively backward, country, struggling to catch up with their European and American peers. To understand the significance of this, you have to go on that research trip with the extraterrestrials and look at China before 1400. In <em>The Lever af Riches,</em> Joel Mokyr dedicates one chapter looking at the comparisons of technology development in China to that in Europe. He lists the following as technology advantages China had in the centuries before 1400: • Extensive water control projects, alternately draining and irrigating land, significantly boosting agricultural production • Sophisticated iron plow introduced sixth century B.C. • Seed drills and other farm tools, introduced around 1000 <em>A.D.</em> • Chemical and organic fertilizers and pesticides used • Blast furnaces and casting of iron as early as 200 B.C., not known in Europe until fourteenth century • Advanced use of power sources in textile production, not seen in Europe until the Industrial Revolution • Invention of compass around 960 A.D. • Major advances in maritime technology (more in a bit on this) • Invention of paper around 100 A.D. (application as toilet paper by <em>590 A.D.).</em> In the year 1400 AD., China was a world power, perhaps the only true world power. Their technology in agriculture, textiles, metallurgy, and maritime transportation were far in advance of any other country. They had a strong central government and a very healthy economy. Their naval strength provides a real insight into the degree of this dominance. Dr. Diamond sends us to an extremely readable book <em>When China Ruled the Seas-The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne 1405-1433</em> by Dr. Louise Levathes. Dr. Levathes takes us on an inside tour of the Chinese empire during these years. She focuses on the great treasure fleets that China set forth in these early years of the fifteenth century. In her book she has a wonderful graphic that overlays a Chinese vessel of the treasure fleet (-1410) with Columbus's <em>St. Maria</em> (1492). At 85 feet in length and three masts, the <em>St. Maria</em> is dwarfed by the nine-masted, 400-foot-long Chinese vessel. The Chinese sailed fleets of these magnificent vessels throughout oceans of South Asia, to India, and even as far as the eastern coast of Africa. With this naval domination China claimed tribute from Japan, Korea, the nations of the Malay Archipelago, and various states within what is now India. Through both trade and the occasional application of military force, China provided an enlightened and progressive direction for all the nations within this sphere of influence. If two princes in India were fighting over a throne, it was the recognition, or lack thereof, from the Chinese emperor that decided who would rule. Setting a policy of religious inclusion and tolerance, the Chinese engaged the Arabian traders and calmed religious disputes within Asia. </span>With applications of power sources in textiles and advanced metallurgy, the Chinese were in the same position in 1400 as the British were in 1750<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, ready to launch into the Industrial Revolution. They traded with nations thousands of miles from home with vast, sophisticated shipping fleets. They were poised to extend this trade all the way to Europe and perhaps find the New World by going east instead of the European's going west in search of the rich Chinese markets. </span>But <span style="font-size: 6pt;">if we pop into that extraterrestrial time machine and drop into China</span> in 1800, we find a technologically backward nation, humbled by a relatively small force of Europeans <span style="font-size: 6pt;">with &quot;modern&quot; military technology who wantonly imposed their will on the Chinese. The Chinese have been struggling to catch up with European and American technology ever since and so far not quite being able to do that. The domination of China by the Japanese during World War II shows how complete the turnaround was. In 1400 Japan was but one of many vassal states huddled about the feet of the Imperial Chinese throne. In 1940 the Japanese military crushed the Chinese government while marching on to control much of South Asia. </span>What could have happened to turn this clear champion of technology, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">trade, enlightened leadership with all its advantages over both its neighbors and yet-distant foreign competitors</span> into such a weak, backward giant? <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Mokyr goes through a pretty complete list of potential causes. He looks at diet, climate, and inherent philosophical mindset rejecting each as a credible actor mainly on the bases that all of these conditions were present during the period of technological and economic growth as well as the subsequent stagnation. Therefore, these were not determining factors in the turnabout. In the end he concludes, as does Diamond and Levathes, that </span>it was just politics<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Yep, that is right. It was good, old human politics. Dr. Levathes gives us a delightful insider's view of the personalities and politics of Imperial progressions during this critical time period. To make a short story of it, </span>the party that had been in control <span style="font-size: 6pt;">during the expansionist period</span> supported the <span style="font-size: 6pt;">great treasure fleets, commerce with foreign nations, </span>use and expansion of technology, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">and a rather harsh control of the rival party. </span>The rival party was based on Confucian philosophy that preached a rigid, inward-looking, controlled existence. When the Confucian party gained control of the throne, they had their opportunity to push back on the prior ruling party <span style="font-size: 6pt;">that had oppressed them so harshly for so long. And they did. They wanted nothing to do with foreigners; we have all we need at home, here in China, they said. The fleet was disbanded and the making of ocean-going vessels forbidden. </span>Technology was no longer &quot;encouraged.&quot;<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Again, their position was what we have is good enough, stop with all this new nonsense. Over a period of just a few years, the course of the entire nation was shifted from what would have appeared to be a bright future as the leading power in the world to a large, but relatively insignificant, backwater, rich in history and culture, but all backward looking to a former glory. That was it. A shift in the political agenda. At the time, to the leaders in control, one that made sense. Focus at home, use what you have now, create order, discipline, control. In 50 years Japanese pirates controlled the coast of China, and the former ruler of the seas from Asia to Africa could not get out of their harbors safely. </span>So, you see if the &quot;technology is bad&quot; message gets incorporated into too many of our daily decisions, we can turn from our bright future into something else<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. The difference is that this time </span>the stakes are much higher<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> than they were in fifteenth century China. </span>If we,<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> in the developed nations, </span>make the wrong choices, we doom all of humanity by our folly<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. It is not just that we miss the potential bright future</span>, we miss the chance to avoid the combined human population growth and resources exhaustion disaster coming at us like a runaway train. Technology is the only way to prevent that train wreck<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span>We can hear the siren's call of anti-technology, come back to nature and let the train run us down in a bloody mess, or we can try our best to use technology wisely and win free to make a better life for everyone.<br />

In a major setback to India’s lunar programme, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) on Tuesday offloaded this country from a joint unmanned mission to the moon designated as MoonRise. The offloading comes six months after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President Barack Obama announced the strengthening of Indo-US space collaboration in a joint declaration in New Delhi in November 2010. MoonRise, as well as another Nasa mission to Venus, were rejected in favour of a flight to an asteroid called the “Origins Spectral-Interpretation-Resource-Identification-Security-Regolith-Explorer”,’ in which the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is not involved. The MoonRise plan envisaged Isro partnering with Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) which was announced by Isro chairman K Radhakrishnan in New Delhi on 12 February 2011. The tie-up was given the go-ahead by the Space Commission. At a media meet after the commission meeting, Radhakrishnan said: “We will have to send a Chandrayaan-1 like probe that will orbit the moon for about four-to-five years. The 400-500 kg satellite around the moon could carry some scientific experiments of Isro,’’ he said. He said that the proposal was an outcome of Indo-US space cooperation announced during the visit of President Obama in November 2010. India’s contribution to the MoonRise project would have been about $150 million. As a part of this lunar project, Nasa had asked Isro to build an orbiter for providing communication between the rover operating on the lunar surface and the ground stations. Isro had even initiated preliminary studies on the project, and exchange of information was in progress between Isro and JPL when the project was scrubbed on Tuesday. According to those in the know, Isro’s involvement has more than technical significance. If the project had materialised, it would have underlined a change in Indo-US security relations. Until now US labs and companies were prohibited from exchanging technologies with Isro in an attempt to limit their use for military purposes. It was a sample return mission, which means Nasa would have brought back samples from the moon for analysis. MoonRise would have focused on the giant South Pole Aitken Basin located on the far side of the moon. Though Isro officially declined to comment on the rejection, other space agency officials expressed disappointment at Nasa’s decision, calling it a serious setback to India moon dreams. They were shocked at Nasa’s decision because it has come six months after Manmohan Singh and Obama announced the strengthening of Indo-US space collaboration in a joint declaration in New Delhi. Isro and Nasa had collaborated in India’s maiden mission to the moon, Chandrayaan-1. There were two Nasa payloads on this mission, the Moon Minerology Mapper and Mini-Sar. Nasa was hoping to participate in Chandrayaan-2, too—a joint Indo-Russian venture. But, as of now Isro has no plans of including foreign participation other than Russia. The rejection by Nasa of Isro’s participation in MoonRise could not have come at a worse time for Isro because the Chandrayaan-2 flight has been delayed because of uncertainties in the rocket, the three-stage Geo Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). Originally, it was slated for liftoff in 2012. It got postponed to 2013 and is now tentatively scheduled for 2014. “Even this date is uncertain because we are having a lot of problems with the GSLV,’’ a top Isro official said.<br />

India hopes to join the United States on a sample return mission to the moon, according to K. Radhakrishnan, chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He announced that India's policy group, the Space Commission, decided on 12 February to give the go-ahead for work on a possible contribution to MoonRise, a U.S. effort to land a probe on the moon's surface, scoop up 1 kilogram of material, and return it to Earth for analysis. India would provide an orbiter similar to its observation satellite Chandrayaan-1, which in 2009 helped clinch evidence of water's presence on the moon. The new Indian instrument would circle the moon for a few years and aid in communications and imaging. ISRO hopes to invest $38 million on developing this 400 to 500 kg instrument, which would travel into space on a U.S. Atlas rocket. The mission leader, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is planning for a launch in 2016, but has not yet selected the MoonRise instruments. The goal is to learn more about the geology and origins of the moon. According to NASA, the mission will &quot;focus on the giant South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin on the far side, which lies between the moon's South Pole and Aitken crater. ... The SPA basin is the oldest, deepest observable impact basin on the moon and ranks among the largest recognized impact structures in the solar system,&quot; (shown in the image). ISRO's involvement has more than technical significance: It would underline a change in Indo-U.S. security relations. Until recently, U.S. labs and companies were prohibited from exchanging technologies with ISRO, in an attempt to limit their use for military purposes. But the two countries have been moving closer in recent years, and barriers have been coming down. In November, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and U.S. President Barack Obama met in New Delhi and agreed to become strategic partners. The countries may be ready to join hands on a major space mission.<br />

We’ll isolate a few scenarios –<br />
<br />
First, Increased Indo-US relations are key to prevent India and Pakistan from getting into it<br />
<br />
Dugger 2’ (Celia W., journalist, “Wider Military Ties with India Offer U.S. Diplomatic Leverage,” THE NEW YORK TIMES, June 10, 2002, p. A1)<br />
<br />
Military cooperation between India and the United States has remarkably quickened since Sept. 11, with a burst of navy, air force and army joint exercises, the revival of American military sales to India and a blur of high-level visits by generals and admirals. The fledgling relationship between American and Indian military leaders will be important to Mr. Rumsfeld in talks intended to put to rest fears of war between India and Pakistan. &quot;We can hope this translates into some influence and trust, though I don't want to overstate it,&quot; a senior American defense official said in an interview on Thursday. &quot;I don't want to predict this guarantees success.&quot; The American diplomatic efforts yielded their first real gains on Saturday when India welcomed a pledge by Pakistan's military ruler to stop permanently the infiltration of militants into Kashmir. India indicated that it would soon take steps to reduce tensions, but a million troops are still fully mobilized along the border -- a situation likely to persist for months -- and the process of resolving the crisis has just begun. India has linked the killing of civilians in Kashmir to a Pakistan-backed insurgency there and has presented its confrontation with Pakistan as part of the global campaign against terrorism. India itself made an unstinting offer of support to the United States after Sept. 11, and Washington responded by ending the sanctions placed on India after its 1998 nuclear tests. With that, the estrangement that prevailed between the world's two largest democracies during the cold war, when India drew close to the Soviet Union and the United States allied with Pakistan, has eased. India, for decades a champion of nonalignment, seeks warmer ties with the United States in hopes of gaining access to sophisticated military technology and help in dealing with Pakistan. From the start of President Bush's term, some influential officials in his administration saw India as a potential counterweight to that other Asian behemoth, China, whose growing power was seen as a potential strategic threat. But since Sept. 11, the priority has been terrorism.The United States is hoping its deeper military and political ties with India will give it some measure of leverage to prevent a war between India and Pakistan that could lead to a nuclear holocaust and would play havoc with the hunt for Al Qaeda in Pakistan. The military relationship has certainly accelerated in recent months. &quot;We've moved from crawling to walking and we're preparing to run,&quot; said an American military official. American warships have been docking in the Indian cities of Bombay, Cochin and Madras. The first major sale of military equipment to India -- $140 million of artillery-finding radar made by Raytheon -- has been approved by Congress. Aircraft engines, submarine combat systems and helicopter parts are in the pipeline. In the largest-ever joint ground and air operations, American and Indian paratroopers jumped last month from the same aircraft over the city of Agra. Later this year, for the first time, Indian troops will venture to the United States for exercises in Alaska. American and Indian naval ships are jointly patrolling the Strait of Malacca to protect commercial shipping, while the number of Indian military officers training in the United States has jumped to 150 this year from 25 in 1998. A parade of military brass has been marching through each other's capitals. &quot;The current level of military to military cooperation between our nations is unprecedented,&quot; Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said upon arriving in New Delhi in February.<br />

The foreign policy of the United States in South Asia should move from the lackadaisical and distant (with India crowned with a unilateral veto power) to aggressive involvement at the vortex. The most dangerous place on the planet is Kashmir, a disputed territory convulsed and illegally occupied for more than 53 years and sandwiched between nuclear-capable India and Pakistan. It has ignited two wars between the estranged South Asian rivals in 1948 and 1965, and a third could trigger nuclear volleys and a nuclear winter threatening the entire globe. The United States would enjoy no sanctuary. This apocalyptic vision is no idiosyncratic view. The Director of Central Intelligence, the Department of Defense, and world experts generally place Kashmir at the peak of their nuclear worries. Both India and Pakistan are racing like thoroughbreds to bolster their nuclear arsenals and advanced delivery vehicles. Their defense budgets are climbing despite widespread misery amongst their populations. Neither country has initialed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or indicated an inclination to ratify an impending Fissile Material/Cut-off Convention.<br />

A strong democratic India is an important partner for the United States. We anticipate that India will play an increasingly important leadership role in 21st century Asia, working with us to promote democracy, economic growth, stability and peace in that vital region. By cooperating with India now, we accelerate the arrival of the benefits that India's rise brings to the region and the world. By fostering ever-closer bilateral ties, we also eliminate any possibility that our two nations might overlook their natural affinities and enter into another period of unproductive estrangement, as was so often the case in the past half century. Today, for the first time since bilateral relations were established in 1947, the United States and India are bound together by a strong congruence of interests, values, and a large and successful Indian-American community. Consequently we find an especially receptive partner in New Delhi, one no longer bound by Cold War politics or dogma. The Indian Government has demonstrated its firm desire to enhance our bilateral relationship. The United States now has a window of opportunity to seize the initiative with India, to build bonds and habits of cooperation that will stand the test of time. It is incumbent upon us, therefore, to undertake ambitious actions that correct our mutual history with India of missed opportunities and advance our common interests in the century ahead. We seek to work with India to win the global War on Terrorism, prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, enhance peace and stability in Asia, protect trade routes and sea lines of communication, and advance the spread of democracy. India and the United States now find ourselves on the same side on all of these critical strategic objectives. Our challenge, then, is to translate our converging interests into shared goals and compatible strategies designed to achieve those aims. In this context, the wide range of initiatives agreed to by President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this July, including our agreement to promote civilian nuclear energy cooperation, represents a unique chance to build trust between the United States and India because of the resonance all these programs have for both countries.<br />
<br />
Asian instability and proliferation spurs global nuclear war<br />
<br />
Cirincione, director of the Non-Proliferation Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 2K [Joseph, Foreign Policy, March 22, p. lexis]<br />
<br />
The blocks would fall quickest and hardest in Asia, where proliferation pressures are already building more quickly than anywhere else in the world. If a nuclear breakout takes place in Asia, then the international arms control agreements that have been painstakingly negotiated over the past 40 years will crumble. Moreover, the United States could find itself embroiled in its fourth war on the Asian continent in six decades--a costly rebuke to those who seek the safety of Fortress America by hiding behind national missile defenses. Consider what is already happening: North Korea continues to play guessing games with its nuclear and missile programs; South Korea wants its own missiles to match Pyongyang's; India and Pakistan shoot across borders while running a slow-motion nuclear arms race; China modernizes its nuclear arsenal amid tensions with Taiwan and the United States; Japan's vice defense minister is forced to resign after extolling the benefits of nuclear weapons; and Russia--whose Far East nuclear deployments alone make it the largest Asian nuclear power--struggles to maintain territorial coherence. Five of these states have nuclear weapons; the others are capable of constructing them. Like neutrons firing from a split atom, one nation's actions can trigger reactions throughout the region, which in turn, stimulate additional actions. These nations form an interlocking Asian nuclear reaction chain that vibrates dangerously with each new development.<br />

<br />
The new strategic partnership between the United States and India has the potential be the turning point around which a new geopolitical balance of power will form. A key element in this partnership— U.S.-India space cooperation—will most likely become the defining relationship for space cooperation around which other space-faring nations will posture their international space cooperation strategies. To the Indian space program, partnership with the United States will be the jewel in the crown of their space cooperation activities. In a reciprocal manner, cooperation in space with India will sparkle with opportunity for the United States. The central position of India in the Asian continent—its burgeoning economic growth and its wealth of human capital— will be crucial assets in achieving U.S. objectives in space and in broader objectives in global security. India is the second most populous nation, and the world’s largest democracy. It is undergoing rapid economic growth and is already a nuclear power and space faring nation. India also is facing many challenges. ‘‘Despite impressive gains in economic investment and output, India faces pressing problems such as the ongoing dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir, massive overpopulation, environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and ethnic and religious strife.’’1 ‘‘Privatization of government-owned industries has proceeded slowly, and continues to generate political debate; continued social, political, and economic rigidities hold back needed initiatives.’’ As the world enters the 21st century with its revolutionary global economy and the threat of transnational terrorism, U.S.-India relations are transforming:2 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Bush today declare there resolve to transform the relationship between their countries and establish a global partnership. As leaders of nations committed to the values of human freedom, democracy and the rule of law, the new relationship between India and the United States will promote stability, democracy, prosperity, and peace throughout the world. It will enhance our ability to work together to provide global leadership in areas of mutual concern and interest. This bold new course for U.S.-India relations was first initiated in November of 2001 when President Bush and PrimeMinister Vajpayee committed their countries to a strategic partnership.3 In January 2004, they furthered their commitment by itemizing specific areas of cooperation in their agreement on Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP): civilian nuclear activities, civilian space programs, and high-technology trade.4 This new imperative provides an opportunity to expand U.S.-India space cooperation to include not only civil and commercial space activities but also space cooperation for common security and defense. To best auger the way forward, U.S. policy makers must first understand the strategic context for both nations, understand the current state and upward trajectory of the Indian space program, and then consider cooperative activities that extend beyond traditional military operations to include the broad spectrum of security affairs such as building common interest, providing disaster response, supporting peacekeeping operations, and enabling the growth of freedom and democracy. 160 R. R. Correll Strategic Context During the cold war, U.S.-India relations were often strained; India was leaning towards the Soviet sphere and often at odds with the U.S. foreign policy agenda. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, India has migrated back towards the west, which has likewise been more receptive. Most significantly, ‘‘in the wake of the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, India took the immediate and unprecedented step of offering to the United States full cooperation for counterterrorism operations. The offer reflected the sea change that has occurred in recent years in the U.S.-India relationship, which for decades was mired in the politics of the Cold War.’’5 This relationship has recently become of great strategic interest to the United States, which views India as a natural ally in promoting democracy, freedom, prosperity, and security in the region. This new strategic context for U.S.-Indian cooperation in space is aptly expressed by the Indian Foreign Secretary, Shyam Saran, in his remarks of December 21, 2005 to an audience in Washington, D.C.:6 Indo-U.S. relations are at a crossroads. We have two clear choices before us. One is the road that we have traveled before—one that will maintain the status quo and the distance between our two democracies. The other, not without its challenges, recognizes the enormous changes of the last decade, appreciates the resulting opportunities, and is prepared to depart from established positions to realize a genuine strategic partnership. Its realization could make Indo-U.S. ties one of the principal relationships of the international system. Notice that Foreign Secretary Saran used the word ‘‘crossroads.’’ This newly envisioned strategic partnership is not yet firmly established. It will take a vigorous program of engagement with cooperative efforts and tangible results to establish a firm and vital foundation. Engagement in cooperative activities builds common interest resulting in enhanced security. It provides an important complement to arms control, which in itself is a limited form of engagement. Where arms control restricts, cooperative programs and activities build an active bond of shared effort and common purpose extending far beyond the diplomatic corps. U.S.-India Space Partnership 161 Vogue descriptions of the flattening of the world’s economy7— which alludes to the fact that the information age technology has broken through traditional barriers to participation in the global economy—typically feature India as representative of the new world order. But even as the geocommercial landscape is shifting and leveling, the ‘‘flat world’’ metaphor should not be used to intimate that the balance of power between nations and alliances will be neutralized. As large, less-developed nations grow in economic and national power, the existing powers will be threatened and possibly weakened. Regional rivals will emerge where formerly global superpowers dominated, and new conflicts and tensions will arise. It is quite likely that the increasing activity of space-faring nations will make space less secure in the near term. Already certain states and transnational groups have engaged in the jamming or highjacking of satellite communications, intent on blocking or broadcasting propaganda and strategic messages. Yet once this space infrastructure is integrated into the security apparatus of strong international partners, the peace and security of the world should be significantly enhanced. India’s star is rising. It is the challenge of U.S. and Indian leadership to assure that their two great nations will never be far from a harmonious conjunction regarding world affairs. The Indian space program provides a convenient starting point for the United States to cultivate this relationship.<br />

The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying — its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic.It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe ’s stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that ’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world ’s great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China ’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene — even if it remained the world’s most powerful nation — could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe — if it adopted what some call a strategy of “offshore balancing” — this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, “offshore” role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more “even-handed” policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel ’s aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn ’t change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn ’t changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to “normal” or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again.<br />

Manipal, India — Once in office, U.S. President Barack Obama apparently decided to abandon his own policy preferences in favor of those of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Given the reluctance of the former president and the current secretary of state to agree to an equal partnership with India, it is no surprise that the past year has seen the killing-off of the tiny shoots of U.S.-India high-tech cooperation promised by former President George W. Bush. This is despite the eagerness of NASA for joint projects with India. The U.S. space agency is aware that it will continue to be commercially outclassed by the European Union unless it ties up with India's Space Research Organization. The Indians can undertake space launches that are 40 percent cheaper than the EU. Were NASA to outsource some of its hardware and software needs to India, the agency would outclass the Europeans in almost every segment of space research and exploration. This is why successive NASA administrators have – on record – pushed for closer cooperation with India. However, the death-grip between Washington and Islamabad has thus far sabotaged all such efforts, even though NASA and ISRO have numerous complementarities, such as in hardware and software. On several occasions, pressure from the White House and the State Department aborted efforts by Taiwan, Malaysia and a Middle Eastern country to put payloads into orbit through ISRO rockets. Taiwan withdrew its request to use Indian launch capabilities more than a decade ago, but it has been scarcely five years since Malaysia called off its launch less than an hour before liftoff. The Malaysians were up front in privately telling the Indians that pressure to abort came directly from the White House, and hence could not be refused.<br />

Cooperation in space between India and the United States today is principally at a lower level because of some lingering doubts as to the utility or attractiveness of deepening strategic cooperation, as well as concerns with possible reactions across the rest of Asia. While cooperation among European countries in space is quite common, there is nothing similar across Asian countries, where India, Japan, and China all have active space programs. Thus, increased space cooperation between the United States and India has to take into account potential concerns of others in the region. In addition, the respective bureaucracies are still not fully familiar with each other and are in a “learning phase” in working with each other. It will take time to build trust between the two governments. But with both countries having so much in common, and India already being one of the largest suppliers of foreign technical students in the United States, there is no reason to believe that India and the United States will not gain the level of familiarity and trust needed, provided both countries are committed in the endeavor to take the partnership to a higher orbit.<br />

Cooperation over India on space is key – that spills over into codes of conducts for space<br />

Inderfurth 9’ (Karl, et al., professor at George Washington University, “Put space at the heart of US-India relations”, The Financial Times (Nov 23, 2009): p11)<br />
<br />
President Obama will receive Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow for the first official state visit of his administration, a visit befitting India's emergence as a major global actor. It also signals America's commitment to a strong partnership. For more than a decade, the US India relationship has been deepening. This visit provides the chance to focus on a big idea that could lift relations to a higher orbit - literally. Mr Obama and Mr Singh should unveil a long-term bilateral initiative to work together to secure the threatened common spaces of our planet - our global commons - including the seas, atmosphere, outer space and the digital domain. The two leaders should underscore this by launching a major venture in outer space. The Obama administration and Singh government are both in their first year of tenure and have the political capital to push through a major advance. A similar moment in July 2005 led to the launch of a challenging civil nuclear initiative and its passage against great odds in both capitals. Today, the conventional wisdom is that the two leaders will not match the scale of the nuclear bargain and should limit themselves to consolidating recent gains. We disagree. They should aim higher and focus on strategic co-operation in outer space. They can bring lasting benefits to national space programmes and lay out the framework for an international code of conduct in outer space. Besides influencing a range of international issues, from energy security to global warming, space co-operation could define a new template for the management of the global commons. As Washington looks for new partners in the management of the global commons, India is a natural choice. After the end of the Soviet Union, the US has had no real peers in outer space. Today as the US reviews its civilian and military space objectives amid shrinking resources, there is a broad consensus within the space community that Washington needs enduring partnerships, both bilateral and multilateral, in outer space. What does Delhi bring to the table? As a rising space power with real and potential technical skills, India can help the US pursue more ambitious goals in outer space and at a lower cost. India's contribution to advances in outer space are impressive, such as the discovery of water molecules on the surface of the moon by its lunar explorer, Chandrayaan-1. The US partnered with India on this mission, with two Nasa payloads on board. Four broad areas of bilateral space co-operation present themselves. First, advanced launch technologies. The greatest limitation on space-ventures is the cost of launching objects into space. The two countries should partner in basic scientific research, such as advanced materials and combustion science that could enable a new generation of spacecraft, while avoiding the proliferation of dangerous ballistic missile capabilities. Second, lunar exploration and beyond. With interest in both countries for exploring the moon and its resources, the US and India should exploit synergies between their moon programmes and consult on an ambitious human exploration of the moon and inter-planetary space. Lunar resources could be used to lower the costs of sustaining human and robotic outposts beyond the earth. Third, climate change. The two countries should use the massive American and growing Indian space assets for earth observation to provide comprehensive and credible assessments of climate change. Fourth, space governance. The US and India should work to forge a consensus on limiting space debris, improving &quot;space situational awareness&quot; for avoiding hazards, and ensuring unhindered operation of the space assets of all nations. Creating a new voluntary code of conduct in outer space could mark the start of an effort to bring order to the global commons. An Obama-Singh space initiative could become the defining feature of an expansive US-India collaboration, especially in science and technology. It could also create the basis for securing our global commons and offer incentives to other major powers to join this vital undertaking.<br />

That prevents miscalculation by reducing threatening behavior and heads off an arms race. It is enforceable and preserves US hegemony – empirical examples prove.<br />

Krepon 2007 – Stimson Center [Co-founder and contributor 3/5, Michael, “Will the Bush Administration Endorse a Space Code of Conduct?”, Space News, http:www.stimson.org/pub.cfm?id=402, accessed June 21, 2011)<br />
<br />
Support is growing for a specific kind of multilateral space agreement that borrows heavily from the Bush administration’s own preferences. The mechanism in question is a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations that could either take the form of political compacts or executive agreements among like-minded states that wish to continue to enjoy the national security and economic benefits that satellites provide. Like the Bush administration’s Proliferation Security Initiative, a Code of Conduct for space could be designed by a core group of states to clarify responsible and irresponsible behavior. The core group might then invite any other spacefaring nation that wishes to abide by these high standards to join the group.  The European Union has now joined Canada in endorsing a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations. The commercial satellite industry also has expressed a strong interest in “rules of the road” for space. The Bush administration has further distanced itself from America’s friends and allies by continuing to insist that new multilateral agreements related to space are “unnecessary and counterproductive.” No other nation in the world has adopted such a negative stance. Saying “hell no” to new multilateral agreements for space seems particularly questionable after China’s irresponsible test of an anti-satellite (A-Sat) weapon that endangers spaceflight in low Earth orbit for decades to come. George Washington’s farewell address warned against indulging in “habitual hatred” resulting in a slavish animosity that leads the United States to “stray from its duty and interest.” Rejecting a Code of Conduct for space because it smacks of arms control would seem to violate Washington’s sound admonition. The Bush administration has not yet taken a position towards a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations. Because rules of the road for space make so much sense, and because the Bush administration has championed other codes of conduct to prevent proliferation, it might still join in the emerging consensus on this issue. The administration’s reasoning against new multilateral agreements for space boils down to five arguments, none of which applies to the Code of Conduct.  First, administration officials argue that there is no likelihood of an arms race in space, therefore, there is no need for new multilateral arrangements. It is true that an arms race is unlikely, since arms racing has now been replaced by asymmetric warfare. But an arms race is not needed to do lasting damage to space, as the Chinese A-Sat test demonstrated. We can now see clearly that it takes very few kinetic energy kill tests and A-Sat weapons to result in significant damage to low Earth orbit. New diplomatic initiatives are needed precisely because an arms race isn’t needed to prevent the peaceful uses of outer space. The second argument advanced by the Bush administration is that arms control is a vestige of the Cold War and not terribly relevant to contemporary security concerns. Again, there is partial truth in this argument, because classic arms control arrangements dealt with a superpower competition that ended with the demise of the Soviet Union.  What used to be known as arms control has now morphed into cooperative threat reduction agreements, including rules of the road clarifying responsible behavior. Semantic arguments aside, the administration has itself championed multilateral agreements in the form of codes of conduct to prevent proliferation, such as The Hague Code of Conduct, as well as the Proliferation Security Initiative. We do not have to argue over whether these codes of conduct constitute arms control to conclude that these creative arrangements were sensible initiatives.  A Code of Conduct for space also would be quite useful in making the Chinese kinetic-kill ASAT test the very last of its kind. If codes of conduct relating to missiles and exports make sense for preventing proliferation – and do not, in the Bush administration’s vocabulary, constitute arms control – then surely a code of conduct also makes sense for activities in space. After all, troubling activities in space also could prompt vertical and horizontal proliferation on the ground.  The third argument that the Bush administration advances against new diplomatic initiatives for space activity is that there can be no agreed to definition of what constitutes “space weapons.” Moreover, verification is extremely problematic. Consequently, no multilateral agreement can be negotiated barring such weapons.  The administration is correct in pointing to the difficulties in defining and verifying space weapons. A code of conduct, however, focuses on activities, not on definitions of what constitutes a space weapon. For example, one key element of a Code of Conduct would surely be that responsible spacefaring nations do not engage in activities that deliberately produce persistent space debris, such as the Chinese A-Sat test.  This key element makes it unnecessary to define space weapons, since actions, not definitions, lie at the core of a rules of the road approach. Verification of noncompliance with this key element is quite straightforward, since it is very hard to hide the deliberate generation of persistent space debris.  The fourth argument advanced by the Bush administration to oppose new diplomatic initiatives for space is that the United States must preserve its right to self-defense – including the right to defend space assets. This argument is certainly valid, but it doesn’t justify rejecting a Code of Conduct. With such a code, the United States still would possess more capabilities than ever before to deter and, if necessary, punish states that take actions against U.S. satellites. The right of self-defense, however, is more likely to be invoked, and will be more difficult to execute, if there are no agreed rules of the road for outer space.  Lastly, the Bush administration contends that new diplomatic initiatives are unwise because U.S. freedom of action in space must not be constrained. By this standard, the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Outer Space Treaty, President Ronald Reagan’s Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and President George H. W. Bush’s Strategic Arms Reduction treaties were all dreadful errors in judgment, since every one of these agreements limit the U.S. military’s freedom of action in some key respects. Using the Bush administration’s reasoning, the Geneva Conventions for U.S. armed forces also are unwise, as are codes of conduct long in place for the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and gravity-bound Air Force. If freedom of action were the topmost U.S. national security objective, we would ditch all of these treaties and codes of conduct. Of course, no responsible political leader or public official would consider doing this. So why should we use this standard to oppose new diplomatic initiatives in space?<br />

Arms race risks accidental nuclear war, undermines arms control, and makes space unusable<br />

Many people believe that a deployed anti-satellite capability and an ability to attack targets on or near the Earth’s surface from space would create a global climate of insecurity both by enhancing current risks and by creating new problems. These new and increased risks would be the byproducts not only of systems to be deployed by the United States but also of the subsequent arms race in space which could be expected to result thanks to responses by China, Russia, the European Union, and perhaps Japan. Perhaps the most consequential impact would be increasing the probability of accidental nuclear war. Space-based weapons could shorten the road to armed conflict, whether nuclear or conventional. In the event that a space asset of one nation was attacked by another (on purpose or by accident), an immediate military response would be triggered, shortening the diplomatic process while escalating the armed conflict. Once employed regularly, anti-satellite systems and space weapons would litter LEO with debris, which in turn would permanently compromise our collective ability to explore the heavens and use space for constructive commercial purposes. The weaponization of space and the deployment of ASAT systems would undermine existing international arms control treaties that are already under stress. In addition, they would fly in the face of the collective will of the international community, which has demanded a ban on weapons in space for two decades and repeatedly been blocked by the United States. For those who share these concerns, one thing is certain: the time for international negotiations on a treaty to ban weapons in space is long overdue. Within a very few years, this potential development could become a reality.<br />

China appears to be pulling away from the pack in Asia’s space race after announcing plans to launch its second lunar probe, Chang’e-2, on October 1–China’s National Day. If the mission succeeds, it will put China another step ahead of India in the race to become the second nation, after the United States, to land an astronaut on the moon. China has pledged to do that by 2025 and India by 2020–setting up a 21st Century Asian version of the Cold War space race between the U.S. and Soviet Union. Chang’e-2 will carry a laser altimeter and a high-resolution 3-D camera to find a landing spot for another probe, Chang’e-3, which is designed to make China’s first unmanned landing on the moon in 2013. The probe has already been installed on a Long March 3C launch vehicle and underwent pre-launch drills on Saturday at Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China’s western province of Sichuan, according to state media reports. Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of China’s lunar exploration team, was quoted by the Global Times newspaper saying the countdown had begun and the only remaining task was to add fuel to the rocket. The Chang’e program, named after a mythical Chinese goddess who flew to the moon, embodies China’s aspirations to outstrip Asian rivals and contend with the U.S. as a global superpower. The U.S. is the only country to have achieved manned lunar missions, making six trips from 1969 to 1972, but President Obama has cut plans for further manned missions. The Soviet Union canceled its program after a string of failures. China became the world’s third nation to put a man in space independently — after the United States and Russia – when Yang Liwei piloted the one-man Shenzhou-5 space mission in 2003. China then launched Chang’e-1, which orbited the moon and took high-resolution pictures of the lunar surface, in October 2007. In September 2008, a Chinese astronaut – also known as a “taikonaut” after “taikong,” the Mandarin word for space –carried out China’s first space walk. China also hopes to bring a moon rock sample back to earth in 2017, and ultimately to build an observatory on the surface of the moon, according to state media. India is not far behind, having launched its first unmanned lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, in 2008, and drawn up plans to launch a second one, Chandrayaan-2, next year. India got the jump on China when Chandrayaan-1 fired a moon impact probe, carrying an Indian tricolor national flag, down to the lunar surface in October 2008. The Indian Space Research Organization has said it hopes to launch India’s first manned space flight by 2014, and its first manned lunar mission by 2020. Japan, meanwhile, launched its first lunar satellite in June last year, and announced a plan this year to send a robot to the moon in five years and to construct an unmanned base there in 10 years.<br />

China is looking to develop space weapons and surpass the US - The only way to stop it is through cooperation with other nations<br />

<br />
The Shenzhou 7 mission and spacewalk should serve as a reminder that China is building space capabilities that could surpass U.S. technological advances and boost China's diplomatic and economic ties with its allies, a panel of experts said here Oct. 8. China's success this decade with three human spaceflight missions, including Shenzhou 7 in September, as well as the development of remote-sensing and satellite navigation systems, two satellite export deals and the January 2007 use of an antisatellite weapon to shoot down one of its own satellites punctuate China's broader national interest to become a &quot;comprehensive power,&quot; the panelists said. They warned that China's space program is dominated by young aerospace engineers who could help propel the nation's advancements past the United States, which faces difficulty replacing its aging aerospace work force. China's wide reach into manned space missions, satellite navigation and communications, and Earth monitoring could help the nation gain a foothold in an already competitive commercial space market, the panelists said. &quot;A newcomer like China [is] going to take a slice of a very stable pie, which means there are going to be other losers. Will it be the U.S., Europe, Russia? It's going to be something difficult that we'll have to contend with,&quot; said Kevin Pollpeter, China program manager for the Defense Group Inc.'s Center for Intelligence, Research and Analysis in Washington. &quot;China's rise in space power is a negative sum consequence for the United States.&quot; China has closely guarded its space budget, in large part because it is dominated by the military, panelists said. Chinese leaders reported that the Chang'e lunar program cost &quot;no less than building a mile of subway in Beijing,&quot; Pollpeter said. While concerns linger about China's January 2007 shootdown of one of its own weather satellites with an antisatellite missile, or A-Sat, China primarily sees space as a diplomatic tool. China prefers jamming and dazzling satellites rather than more aggressive action, said Dean Cheng, senior Asia analyst with CNA Corp. in Alexandria, Va. Jamming is intentional interference with satellite signals; dazzling is illuminating a satellite with a laser in order to blind it. Themes that can be found throughout the writings concerning China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) indicate China is focused on space deterrence, Cheng said, describing how a country's military capabilities, economy and communications could be affected by space warfare. &quot;We do not at this time have a very good sense of how the PLA would necessarily operate in space in order to secure space dominance,&quot; Cheng said. &quot;What we do find in PLA writings are certain key themes: the ability to provide information support, the ability to take on both offensive and defensive positions in space and ? space deterrence.&quot; United States policy documents, however, appear more focused than China on national security applications, prompting a &quot;bad-guy image&quot; globally, Pollpeter said. &quot;There's a perception of overemphasizing national security applications,&quot; he said. &quot;Even though we are not the ones developing space weapons, China is the one developing space weapons, we are the ones who bear the brunt of that criticism.&quot; One way to mitigate the perception would be to emphasize the peaceful uses of space and cooperation with other nations, Pollpeter said. Panelists also said the U.S. space industry should relate its relevance to people the way China's space officials routinely discuss the economic, diplomatic and political benefits of a strong space program. &quot;Space ultimately isn't about space,&quot; Cheng said. &quot;But too often here our conversations are stovepiped within the space community focusing on the space budget and [don't] really connect the space program to people's everyday lives even though it touches every aspect of people's everyday lives.&quot;<br />

The US needs India to balance China – we have no other option<br />

However, the leading nations will continue to feel the pressure to achieve and maintain economic, military and technological dominance – and that is precisely where the United States will be at a disadvantage vis-a-vis China. All demographic indicators are in favor of China -- population size, age-structure of the population, the sheer size of the working population, and the numbers of trained scientists and technologists produced every year. Every single indicator relevant to this analysis favors China, and works against the United States. Of the seven superpowers of the 21st century I named at the outset, China is the only aggressive competitor of the United States – and more, it is determined to win that competition, come what may! So, the corollary – is the US doomed to play second fiddle to China? My answer is, NO. Qualify that – not if existing levels of US-India cooperation extend intensively into the coming decades. India’s importance lies in the fact that it brings to the partnership table exactly the attributes the US lacks, and desperately needs, in this competition with China. Look at the list: India’s demographics are even more favorable than China’s. For starters – as then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee pointed out in his August 15, 2003 address from the Red Fort, India boasts over 600 million people in the working age group. This working force will overtake China's by 2025, and decisively so by 2050. Perhaps even more significantly, India edges China handily when it comes to intellectual capital. Its ability to produce first rate scientific, technological and managerial manpower equals, even exceeds, that of China, with the added plus of being able to &quot;think&quot; in English! To sum up – India has exactly what the US lacks. And most importantly, from the US point of view, India can never be, will never be, an aggressive competitor the way China is. China has, for well over a decade now, bent its collective will to one single strategic objective, which it chases with trademark ruthlessness – namely, to dethrone the US from its current position as the world’s sole acknowledged economic, technological and military superpower. One fact is obvious – given the demographic disadvantage the US suffers, it can never win this competition; not if it tries to fly solo. From that fact, emerges another – the only way the US can in fact win, is by teaming up with India. IT HAS NO OTHER OPTION. A US-India partnership, by whatever name it's called, is a winner; it is, in fact, the only possible partnership with the ability to offset the surge in China's geo-political and economic powers.<br />

Chinese space superiority would damage US power projection and capabilities which are key to stop a Taiwan conflict<br />
<br />
Smith 2006 (Steven A. Smith, 2/16/2006 Lt Col, USAF, “CHINESE SPACE SUPERIORITY? CHINA’S MILITARY SPACE CAPABILITIES AND THE IMPACT OF THEIR USE IN A TAIWAN CONFLICT” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:10888:http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc/smith.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc/smith.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc/smith.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:10888 -->)<br />
<br />
Given the Chinese space systems in the previous chapter, how might the Chinese use their space capabilities in a scenario involving a conflict with the U.S. over Taiwan? Would the contributions from these systems be sufficient enough to give China space superiority and if so, what would be the impact of that space superiority on the U.S. military? A crucial element of U.S. strategy during a Taiwan conflict will be projecting power into the region with the intent of opposing Chinese military actions. Unless we can apply military power at the point of engagement, Taiwan and the surrounding theater, our military forces will have little ability to impact the situation. Thus, when looking at the impact of the Chinese space capabilities, the paper will pay particular attention to the impact on U.S. power projection capabilities with particular attention to naval and air power. Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institute senior analyst, stated, “Given trends in military reconnaissance, information processing and precision strike technologies, large assets such as aircraft carriers and land bases, on which the United States depends, are likely to be increasingly vulnerable to attack in the years ahead.”107 These attacks could be enabled by Chinese space capabilities. The U.S. intelligence community believes China will use a sea-denial strategy aimed at U.S. aircraft carriers and other naval forces approaching Taiwan.108 Thus, a key component of a Chinese campaign against Taiwan would be to keep the U.S. aircraft carriers out of striking range of Taiwan with a critical task of finding and sinking carriers. ELINT systems, like those demonstrated on the Shenzhou, could track U.S. carriers operating in the western Pacific or Indian Oceans.109 In addition, some of their anti-naval weapons could use space-based information. Specifically, one of China’s primary weapons to strike U.S. naval assets will be the supersonic, sea-skimming SS-N-26 missile. In recent years, China has purchased the Russian SS-N-26 anti-ship cruise missiles; however, without space-based ELINT data which can locate and track naval assets, the Chinese ability to effectively use the SS-N-26 is undermined.110 Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institute senior analyst, states, “To attack a U.S. carrier, one needs not only periodic localization of the carrier, but real-time tracking and dissemination of that information to a missile that is capable of reaching the carrier and defeating its defenses.”111 Space systems are only one of the means to locate and track U.S. carriers, and it is unclear if China’s current reconnaissance satellites have the capability to locate and target U.S. aircraft carriers.112 However, as shown in the previous chapter, China has launched and operated ELINT systems in the past. If they did acquire a space-based ELINT system, how would they use it and the rest of their suite of space capability against U.S. naval forces? Chinese ballistic and cruise missile attacks on airfields would not look to destroy the U.S. facilities, but suppress their ability to provide air and missile defense. Rear Admiral Eric A. McVadon (USN, Ret.), former Defense Attaché at the American Embassy in Beijing and expert on China’s military, stated that once the Chinese suppressed U.S. air and missile defenses, it would conceptually “permit follow-on attacks, in relative safety, by the several new types of Chinese aircraft using very modern cruise missiles.”125 This scenario is a great concern for the Asia-Pacific region. As one wing commander at Guam said, “[Chinese planes and missiles] would keep coming … I fear them numbers-wise,” and one analyst predicts, “We can’t expect that we can completely protect a carrier battle group when it got into theater.”126 Not only would these forces be looking to target carriers, they would look to target items which enable U.S. air power, and this targeting would be assisted by imagery derived from space systems. A former high-ranking Chinese official once said to be victorious in future combat, “We will have to gain air and sea superiority, but win information superiority first.”127 Gaining this information superiority, on the way to winning air and sea superiority, would be enabled by Chinese space systems.<br />

<br />
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.<br />

Marquez said US President Barack Obama has discussed with the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on issues related to space cooperation between the two countries. &quot;Cooperation with India is vitally important to as we go forward in a variety of areas -- not just in the civil space -- you know, in NASA area where we have had cooperation, but also in the climate change and earth observation area,&quot; he said. &quot;We will look for greater cooperation there. We do understand there may be areas in national security where we're going to have discussions with India,&quot; he said in response to a question. Meanwhile, a senior Administration official said the United States consulted with several countries including India on its new space policy. &quot;I think we're in the early stages right now, but we look very much forward to beginning a dialogue with India and other emerging space nations,&quot; the official told reporters. In a statement after the White House unveiled the basic contours of the new space policy, Obama said, &quot;This policy is about the boundless possibilities of the future.&quot; &quot;That is why we seek to spur a burgeoning commercial space industry, to rapidly increase our capabilities in space while bolstering America's competitive edge in the global economy&quot;, he said. He said the administration is proposing improved observation of the earth, to gain new insights into the environment and the planet. Another senior Administration official noted that there has been a healthy dialogue with India already and the goal would be to continue that. &quot;So with respect to specific programmes or what have you that we might consider, that's something that we would need to discuss. &quot;But I think the idea is to build in the foundation that already exists,&quot; he said in response to a question.<br />

A top National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) laboratory called Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) approached the Indian space agency with a proposal to collaborate for a moon mission. The mission is aimed at getting back a kilogram of rocks from the lunar surface. This is the first step to a collaborative research after getting the US lifting sanctions on Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). The mission, if selected is scheduled to be launched in 2016. On January 24th 2011 USA has removed nine Indian space and defence-related companies, including those from Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), from its export control &quot;Entity List&quot;. The step was taken to enhance the cooperation between US and India in an attempt to expand high-technology trade and strategic cooperation with India. The iconic JPL which has sent missions to Mars and Venus wants Isro to put a satellite around the moon to be a link between its lunar lander probe and the earth. The mission would be similar to the Chandrayaan-I mission. The Space Commission, India’s apex space policy body, has given Isro the go-ahead to partner with JPL for the project named ‘Moon Rise’, which could be launched by the Nasa under its New Frontiers Programme announced in 2009. India’s contribution to the project could amount to about $150 million. As part of the project, JPL plans to drop a robotic lander into a basin at the moon’s South Pole to send lunar rocks back to Earth for study. The 400-500 kg satellite is being planned to have a life of up to five years and could also carry some scientific experiments of Isro. He said the proposal was an outcome of India-US cooperation announced during the visit of President Barack Obama to India last year. The mission is part of a joint proposal with JPL which will be put up before Nasa. Forward of the proposal and work out a detailed plan would be started after Nasa selects the proposal. Nasa has selected three proposals as candidates for the agency’s next space venture to another celestial body in the solar system. The final project selected in mid-2011 may provide a better understanding of Earth’s formation or perhaps the origin of life on Earth.<br />

In a major setback to India’s lunar programme<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (</span>Nasa<span style="font-size: 7pt;">) on Tuesday </span>offloaded this country from<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a joint unmanned mission to the moon designated as </span>MoonRise<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>The offloading comes six months after <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President Barack </span>Obama announced the strengthening of Indo-US space collaboration in a joint declaration in New Delhi in November 2010<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>MoonRise, as well as another Nasa mission to Venus, were rejected in favour of a flight to an asteroid<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> called the “Origins Spectral-Interpretation-Resource-Identification-Security-Regolith-Explorer”,’ in </span>which<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the Indian Space Research Organisation (</span>Isro) is not involved<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The MoonRise plan envisaged Isro partnering with Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) which was announced by Isro chairman K Radhakrishnan in New Delhi on 12 February 2011. The tie-up was given the go-ahead by the Space Commission. At a media meet after the commission meeting, Radhakrishnan said: “We will have to send a Chandrayaan-1 like probe that will orbit the moon for about four-to-five years. The 400-500 kg satellite around the moon could carry some scientific experiments of Isro,’’ he said. He said that the proposal was an outcome of Indo-US space cooperation announced during the visit of President Obama in November 2010. </span>India’s contribution to the MoonRise project would have been about $150 million<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As a part of this lunar project, Nasa had asked Isro to build an orbiter for providing communication between the rover operating on the lunar surface and the ground stations. Isro had even initiated preliminary studies on the project, and exchange of information was in progress between Isro and JPL when the project was scrubbed on Tuesday. </span>According to those in the know, Isro’s involvement has more than technical significance. If the project had materialised, it would have underlined a change in Indo-US security relations.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Until now US labs and companies were prohibited from exchanging technologies with Isro in an attempt to limit their use for military purposes. It was a sample return mission, which means Nasa would have brought back samples from the moon for analysis. MoonRise would have focused on the giant South Pole Aitken Basin located on the far side of the moon. Though </span>Isro officiallydeclined to comment on the rejection<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>other space agency officials expressed disappointment at Nasa’s decision, calling it a serious setback to India moon dreams<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>They were shocked at Nasa’s decision because it has come six months after<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Manmohan </span>Singh and Obamaannounced the strengthening of Indo-US space collaboration<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in a joint declaration in New Delhi. Isro and Nasa had collaborated in India’s maiden mission to the moon, Chandrayaan-1. </span>There were two Nasa payloads on this mission<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, the Moon Minerology Mapper and Mini-Sar. Nasa was hoping to participate in Chandrayaan-2, too—a joint Indo-Russian venture. But, </span>as of now Isro has no plans of including foreign participation other than Russia<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>The rejection by Nasa of Isro’s participation in MoonRise could not have come at a worse time<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> for Isro because the </span>Chandrayaan-2<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> flight has been delayed because of uncertainties in the rocket, the three-stage Geo Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). Originally, it was slated for liftoff in 2012. It </span>got postponed to 2013 and is now tentatively scheduled for 2014<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. “Even this date is uncertain because we are having a lot of problems with the GSLV,’’ a top Isro official said.</span><br />

India hopes to join the United States on a sample return mission to the moon<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, according to K. Radhakrishnan, </span>chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO<span style="font-size: 7pt;">). He announced that India's policy group, the Space Commission, decided on 12 February to give the go-ahead for work on </span>a possible contribution to MoonRise<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, a U.S. effort to land a probe on the moon's surface, scoop up 1 kilogram of material, and return it to Earth for analysis. India would provide an orbiter similar to its observation satellite Chandrayaan-1, which in 2009 helped clinch evidence of water's presence on the moon. The new Indian instrument would circle the moon for a few years and aid in communications and imaging. ISRO hopes to invest $38 million on developing this 400 to 500 kg instrument, which would travel into space on a U.S. Atlas rocket. The mission leader, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is planning for a launch in 2016, but has not yet selected the MoonRise instruments. The goal is to learn more about the geology and origins of the moon. According to NASA, the mission will &quot;focus on the giant South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin on the far side, which lies between the moon's South Pole and Aitken crater. ...

<strong>Dugger 2’</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Celia W., journalist, “Wider Military Ties with India Offer U.S. Diplomatic Leverage,” THE NEW YORK TIMES, June 10, 2002, p. A1)</span><br />
<br />
Military cooperation between India and the United States has remarkably quickened since Sept. 11,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> with a burst of navy, </span>air force and army joint exercises, the revival of American military sales to India and a blur of high-level visits by generals and admirals.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The fledgling relationship between American and Indian military leaders will be important to Mr. Rumsfeld in talks intended to put to rest fears of war between India and Pakistan. &quot;We can hope </span>this translates into some influence and trust, though I don't want to overstate it<span style="font-size: 7pt;">,&quot; a senior American defense official said in an interview on Thursday. &quot;I don't want to predict this guarantees success.&quot; </span>The American diplomatic efforts yielded their first real gains <span style="font-size: 7pt;">on Saturday </span>when India welcomed a pledge by Pakistan's military ruler to stop permanently the infiltration of militants into Kashmir. India indicated that it would soon take steps to reduce tensions, but a million troops are still fully mobilized along the border -- a situation likely to persist for months -- and the process of resolving the crisis has just begun. India<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> has linked the killing of civilians in Kashmir to a Pakistan-backed insurgency there and has presented its confrontation with Pakistan as part of the global campaign against terrorism. India itself made an unstinting offer of support to the United States after Sept. 11, and Washington responded by ending the sanctions placed on India after its 1998 nuclear tests. With that, </span>the estrangement that prevailed between the world's two largest democracies during the cold war, when India drew close to the Soviet Union and the United States allied with Pakistan, has eased. India, for decades a champion of nonalignment, seeks warmer ties with the United States in hopes of gaining access to sophisticated military technology and help in dealing with Pakistan. From the start of President Bush's term, some influential officials in his administration saw India as a potential counterweight to that other Asian behemoth, China, whose growing power was seen as a potential strategic threat. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">But since Sept. 11, the priority has been terrorism</span>.The United States is hoping its deeper military and political ties with India will give it some measure of leverage to prevent a war between India and Pakistan that could lead to a nuclear holocaust and would play havoc with the hunt for Al Qaeda in Pakistan<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The military relationship has certainly accelerated in recent months. &quot;We've moved from crawling to walking and we're preparing to run,&quot; said an American military official. American warships have been docking in the Indian cities of Bombay, Cochin and Madras. The first major sale of military equipment to India -- $140 million of artillery-finding radar made by Raytheon -- has been approved by Congress. Aircraft engines, submarine combat systems and helicopter parts are in the pipeline. In the largest-ever joint ground and air operations, American and Indian paratroopers jumped last month from the same aircraft over the city of Agra. Later this year, for the first time, Indian troops will venture to the United States for exercises in Alaska. American and Indian naval ships are jointly patrolling the Strait of Malacca to protect commercial shipping, while the number of Indian military officers training in the United States has jumped to 150 this year from 25 in 1998. A parade of military brass has been marching through each other's capitals. &quot;The current level of military to military cooperation between our nations is unprecedented,&quot; Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said upon arriving in New Delhi in February.</span><br />

It is incumbent upon us<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, therefore, </span>to undertake ambitious actions that correct our mutual history with India of missed opportunities and advance our common interests<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in the century ahead. </span>We seek to work with India to win the<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> global </span>War on Terrorism, prevent the spread of w<span style="font-size: 7pt;">eapons of </span>m<span style="font-size: 7pt;">ass </span>d<span style="font-size: 7pt;">estruction, </span>enhance peace and stability in Asia, protect trade routes and sea lines of communication, and advance the spread of democracy<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. India and the United States now find ourselves on the same side on all of these critical strategic objectives. Our challenge, then, is to translate our converging interests into shared goals and compatible strategies designed to achieve those aims. In this context, </span>the<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> wide range of </span>initiatives agreed to by<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> President </span>Bush and<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Prime Minister Manmohan </span>Singh<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> this July, </span>including our agreement to promote civilian nuclear energy cooperation, represents a unique chance to build trust between the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>and India because of the resonance all these programs have for both countries.<br />

<strong>Asian instability spurs global nuclear war</strong> <br />

The blocks would fall quickest and hardest in Asia, where proliferation pressures are already building more quickly than anywhere else in the world. If a nuclear breakout takes place in Asia, then<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the international</span> arms control<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> agreements that have been painstakingly negotiated over the past 40 years </span>will crumble. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Moreover, </span>the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>could find itself embroiled in its fourth war on the Asian continent<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in six decades--a costly rebuke to those who seek the safety of Fortress America by hiding behind national missile defenses. Consider what is already happening: </span>North Korea continues to play guessing games with its nuclear and missile programs; South Korea wants its own missiles<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> to match Pyongyang's; </span>India and Pakistan shoot across borders while running a slow-motion nuclear arms race; China modernizes its nuclear arsenal amid tensions with Taiwan<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and the United States; Japan's vice defense minister is forced to resign after extolling the benefits of nuclear weapons; </span>and Russia--whose Far East nuclear deployments alone make it the largest Asian nuclear power--struggles to maintain territorial coherence<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Five of these states have nuclear weapons; the others are capable of constructing them. </span>Like neutrons firing from a split atom, one nation's actions can trigger reactions throughout the region<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>which<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in turn, </span>stimulate additional actions. These nations form an interlocking Asian nuclear reaction chain that vibrates dangerously with each new development.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Both nations have suffered at the hands of terrorists. And the breeding ground of this threat is India’s neighbour, Pakistan. Thus, when South Asia, described as the world’s most dangerous place and where India, </span>Pakistan and Afghanistan are<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> situated, is </span>boiling<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>who can be the stabilizer? It can only be India which has a Muslim population that is almost five times that of Afghanistan and almost equals Pakistan’s.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> When Obama calls for an inclusive world community and a “new beginning” with Muslims, India is the example that he may like to cite. It is where secularism is in resplendent display despite a few aberrations. It is a secular democracy that elected three Muslim Presidents. Its current Vice President is another distinguished Muslim and the newly constituted Council of Ministers of Manmohan Singh has five of them. </span>The Indian society could give Muslims the world over, the hope of achieving their highest potential without any threat to their religious belief<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> or material betterment even outside a theocracy. </span><strong>The U.S. has much to lose if its relations with India suffer</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>The Af-Pak policy can only succeed with the active cooperation of stable India<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>which stands like a rock in a tumultuous sea of extremism and intolerance<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>Especiallywhenan overstretched U.S. leaves the region<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>there needs to be an Asian power to promote stability and peace in the region<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For the Bush administration, the forging of a strategic partnership with India was an important priority. A ten-year defence framework agreement and numerous joint military exercises to achieve interoperability were among the unprecedented steps taken to strengthen the sinews of the strategic partnership. For the first time since independence, India is also looking to the U.S. for big ticket defence items--a rather bold step for a nation used to the virtually unquestioned reliability of Russia as its main defence supplier. Since 2006, the U.S. has sold defence items valued at around U.S. $ 3.2 billion and is in the race for what could be the mother of all contracts, one that would be worth over U.S. $ 10 billion (around Rs. 48000 crores) for the supply of the 126 fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force. But these are only baby steps. </span>When India, whose economy is expected to be the second largest in three decades, is poised to play a major role in the “post-U.S.” order, further strengthening of the India-U.S. partnership would contribute immensely to international security<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>India is placed strategically in the Indian Ocean region which is critically important for world trade. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">This geographical location makes it easier for its expanding navy to keep these waterways free for trade and commerce. At a time when the U.S. is feeling the heat of the economic meltdown, it may have greater stakes in keeping China in good humour. </span>But there is a limit to how much the U.S. can depend on a nation whose core values are at variance with its liberal democratic tenets and whose motive behind promoting a greater military capability is already baffling Washington, as it is many others<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong>Whether it is to combat climate change or pandemics, nothing can be achieved without India</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>Its population of 1.1 billion is too large to be ignored. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">With an economy that has largely defied the economic meltdown, it could grow at a rate of 8 to 9 per cent in 2009-102. India’s rise is inevitable and can benefit both nations. </span>The purchasing power of India’s swelling middle class could provide an attractive market that the U.S. sorely needs<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. India-U.S. trade in goods has also more than doubled in the four years from 2004-08. Interestingly it increased by more than a quarter in percentage points than Sino-U.S. trade in the same period. And if this growth in trade is any indication, then there is more promise in the relationship between the two democracies. </span>India and the U.S. are “natural allies”. Both are secular democracies with the rule of law and the inalienable rights of man at the centre of the foundation of both nations. In fact, the cause for a stable world order would be better served when helped by a durable strategic partnership between the two nations that have so much in common.<br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">S</span>trong centrifugal forces have always bedevilled the stability and unity of Pakistan, and,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in the context of the new world situation, </span>the country could be faced with civil wars and popular fundamentalist uprisings, probably including a military-fundamentalist coup d'état<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Fundamentalism is deeply rooted in Pakistan society. The fact that in the year following 9/11, the most popular name given to male children born that year was &quot;Osama&quot; (not a Pakistani name) is a small indication of the mood. </span>Given the weakening base of the traditional, secular opposition parties, conditions would be ripe for a coup d'état by the fundamentalist wing of the Army and ISI, leaning on the radicalised masses to take power<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Some form of radical, military Islamic regime, where legal powers would shift to Islamic courts and forms of shira law would be likely. Although, even then, this might not take place outside of a protracted crisis of upheaval and civil war conditions, mixing fundamentalist movements with nationalist uprisings and sectarian violence between the Sunni and minority Shia populations. The nightmare that is now Iraq would take on gothic proportions across the continent. The prophesy of an arc of civil war over Lebanon, Palestine and Iraq would spread to south Asia, stretching from Pakistan to Palestine, through Afghanistan into Iraq and up to the Mediterranean coast. Undoubtedly, </span>this would also spill over into India both with regards to the Muslim community and Kashmir. Border clashes, terrorist attacks, sectarian pogroms and insurgency would break out. A new war, and possibly nuclear war, between Pakistan and India could not be ruled out.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Atomic Al Qaeda </span>Should Pakistan break down completely, a Taliban-style government with strong Al Qaeda influence is a real possibility<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>Such deep chaos would,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of course, </span>open a &quot;Pandora's box&quot; for the region and the world. With the possibility of unstable clerical and military fundamentalist elements being in control of the Pakistan nuclear arsenal, not only their use against India, but Israel becomes a possibility, as well as the acquisition of nuclear<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and other deadly </span>weapons secrets by Al Qaeda<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Invading Pakistan would not be an option for America. Therefore </span>a nuclear war would now again become a real strategic possibility. <strong>This would bring a shift in the tectonic plates of global relations</strong>.

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Manipal, India — Once in office, U.S. President Barack </span>Obama<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> apparently </span>decided to abandon his own policy preferences in favor of those of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Given the reluctance of the former president and the current secretary of state to agree to an equal partnership with India, it is no surprise that the past year has seen the killing-off of the tiny shoots of U.S.-India high-tech cooperation<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> promised by former President George W. Bush. This is </span>despite the eagerness of NASA for joint projects with India. The U.S. space agency is aware that it will continue to be commercially outclassed by the European Union unless it ties up with India's Space Research Organization. The Indians can undertake space launches that are 40 percent cheaper than the EU. Were NASA to outsource some of its hardware and software needs to India, the agency would outclass the Europeans in almost every segment of space research and exploration. This is why successive NASA administrators have – on record – pushed for closer cooperation with India. <strong>However</strong>, the death-grip between Washington and Islamabad has thus far sabotaged all such efforts,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> even though NASA and ISRO have numerous complementarities, such as in hardware and software. </span>On several occasions, pressure from the White House and the State Department aborted efforts by Taiwan, Malaysia and a Middle Eastern country to put payloads into orbit through ISRO rockets. Taiwan withdrew its request to use Indian launch capabilities more than a decade ago, but it has been scarcely five years since Malaysia called off its launch less than an hour before liftoff. The Malaysians were up front in privately telling the Indians that pressure to abort came directly from the White House, and hence could not be refused.<br />

<strong>Cooperation in space is low now – the only way to strengthen cooperation is buying taking it to a higher orbit</strong><br />

Cooperation in space between India and the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span>today is principally at a lower level because of some lingering doubts as to the utility or attractiveness of deepening strategic cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as well as concerns with possible reactions across the rest of Asia. </span>While cooperation among European countries in space is quite common, there is nothing similar across Asian countries<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, where India, Japan, and China all have active space programs. Thus, increased space cooperation between the United States and India has to take into account potential concerns of others in the region.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">President Obama will receive Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow for the first official state visit of his administration, a visit befitting India's emergence as a major global actor. It also signals America's commitment to a strong partnership. </span>For more than a decade, the US India relationship has been deepening. This visit provides the chance to focus on a big idea that could lift relations to a higher orbit - literall<span style="font-size: 7pt;">y. Mr Obama and Mr Singh should unveil a long-term bilateral initiative to work together to secure the threatened common spaces of our planet - our global commons - including the seas, atmosphere, outer space and the digital domain. </span><strong>The two leaders should underscore this by launching a major venture in outer space</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Obama administration and Singh government are both in their first year of tenure and have the political capital to push through a major advance. A similar moment in July 2005 led to the launch of a challenging civil nuclear initiative and its passage against great odds in both capitals. </span>Today, the conventional wisdom is that the two leaders will not match the scale of the nuclear bargain and should limit themselves to consolidating recent gain<span style="font-size: 7pt;">s</span><strong>. We disagree</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><strong>They should aim higher and focus on strategic co-operation in outer space</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>They can bring lasting benefits to national space programmes and lay out the framework for an international code of conduct in outer space<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Besides influencing a range of international issues, from energy security to global warming, space co-operation could define a new template for the management of the global commons. </span>AsWashington looks for new partners in the management of the global commons, India is a natural choice.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> After the end of the Soviet Union, the US has had no real peers in outer space. </span>Today as the US reviews its civilian and military space objectives amid shrinking resources, there is a broad consensus within the space community that Washington needs enduring partnerships<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, both bilateral and multilateral, </span>in outer space<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. What does Delhi bring to the table? </span>As a rising space power with real and potential technical skills, India can help the US pursue more ambitious goals in outer space and at a lower cost. India's contribution to advances in outer space are impressive, such as the discovery of water molecules on the surface of the moon by its lunar explorer, Chandrayaan-1<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The US partnered with India on this mission, with two Nasa payloads on board. Four broad areas of bilateral space co-operation present themselves. First, advanced launch technologies. The </span>greatest limitation on space-ventures is the cost of launching objects into space.The two countries should partner in basic scientific research, such as advanced materials and combustion science that could enable a new generation of spacecraft<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, while avoiding the proliferation of dangerous ballistic missile capabilities. Second, lunar exploration and beyond. With interest in both countries for exploring the moon and its resources, the US and India should exploit synergies between their moon programmes and consult on an ambitious human exploration of the moon and inter-planetary space. Lunar resources could be used to lower the costs of sustaining human and robotic outposts beyond the earth. Third, climate change. The two countries should use the massive American and growing Indian space assets for earth observation to provide comprehensive and credible assessments of climate change. Fourth, space governance. The US and India should work to forge a consensus on limiting space debris, improving &quot;space situational awareness&quot; for avoiding hazards, and ensuring unhindered operation of the space assets of all nations. Creating a new voluntary code of conduct in outer space could mark the start of an effort to bring order to the global commons. </span><strong>An Obama-Singh space initiative could become the defining feature of an expansive US-India collaboration, especially in science and technology. It could also create the basis for securing our global commons and offer incentives to other major powers to join this vital undertaking.</strong><br />

<strong>Krepon 2007 – Stimson Center</strong> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">[Co-founder and contributor 3/5, Michael, “Will the Bush Administration Endorse a Space Code of Conduct?”, Space News, http:www.stimson.org/pub.cfm?id=402, accessed June 21, 2011)</span><br />
<br />
Support is growing for a<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> specific kind of multilateral space agreement that borrows heavily from the Bush administration’s own preferences. The mechanism in question is a </span>Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations that could either take the form of political compacts or executive agreements among like-minded states that wish to continue to enjoy the national security and economic benefits that satellites provide<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Like the Bush administration’s Proliferation Security Initiative, a Code of Conduct for space could be designed by a core group of states to clarify responsible and irresponsible behavior. The core group might then invite any other spacefaring nation that wishes to abide by these high standards to join the group. </span> The European U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nion </span>has now joined Canada in endorsing a Code of Conduct<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> for responsible spacefaring nations. </span>The commercial satellite industry also has expressed a strong interest in “rules of the road” for space. The Bush administration has further distanced itself from America’s friends and allies by continuing to insist that new multilateral agreements related to space are “unnecessary and counterproductive.” No other nation in the world has adopted such a negative stanc<span style="font-size: 7pt;">e. Saying “hell no” to new multilateral agreements for space seems particularly questionable after China’s irresponsible test of an anti-satellite (A-Sat) weapon that endangers spaceflight in low Earth orbit for decades to come. George Washington’s farewell address warned against indulging in “habitual hatred” resulting in a slavish animosity that leads the United States to “stray from its duty and interest.” Rejecting a Code of Conduct for space because it smacks of arms control would seem to violate Washington’s sound admonition. The Bush administration has not yet taken a position towards a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations. Because rules of the road for space make so much sense, and because the Bush administration has championed other codes of conduct to prevent proliferation, it might still join in the emerging consensus on this issue. The administration’s reasoning against new multilateral agreements for space boils down to five arguments, none of which applies to the Code of Conduct.  First, administration officials argue that there is no likelihood of an arms race in space, therefore, there is no need for new multilateral arrangements. It is true that an arms race is unlikely, since arms racing has now been replaced by asymmetric warfare. But an arms race is not needed to do lasting damage to space, as the Chinese A-Sat test demonstrated. We can now see clearly that it takes very few kinetic energy kill tests and A-Sat weapons to result in significant damage to low Earth orbit. New diplomatic initiatives are needed precisely because an arms race isn’t needed to prevent the peaceful uses of outer space. The second argument advanced by the Bush administration is that arms control is a vestige of the Cold War and not terribly relevant to contemporary security concerns. Again, there is partial truth in this argument, because classic arms control arrangements dealt with a superpower competition that ended with the demise of the Soviet Union.  What used to be known as </span>arms control has now morphed into cooperative threat reduction agreements, including rules of the road clarifying responsible behavior.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Semantic arguments aside, the administration has itself championed multilateral agreements in the form of codes of conduct to prevent proliferation, such as The Hague Code of Conduct, as well as the Proliferation Security Initiative. We do not have to argue over whether these codes of conduct constitute arms control to conclude that these creative arrangements were sensible initiatives. </span> A Code of Conduct for space<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> also </span>would be quite useful in making the Chinese kinetic-kill ASAT test the very last of its kind.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> If codes of conduct relating to missiles and exports make sense for preventing proliferation – and do not, in the Bush administration’s vocabulary, constitute arms control – then surely a code of conduct also makes sense for activities in space. After all, troubling activities in space also could prompt vertical and horizontal proliferation on the ground.  The third argument that the Bush administration advances against new diplomatic initiatives for space activity is that there can be no agreed to definition of what constitutes “space weapons.” Moreover, verification is extremely problematic. Consequently, no multilateral agreement can be negotiated barring such weapons. </span> The administration is correct in pointing to the difficulties in defining and verifying space weapons. A code of conduct, however, focuses on activities, not on definitions of what constitutes a space weapon. For example, one key element of a Code of Conduct would surely be that responsible spacefaring nations do not engage in activities that deliberately produce persistent space debris, such as the Chinese A-Sat test<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span> This key element makes it unnecessary to define space weapons, since actions, not definitions, lie at the core of a rules of the road approach. Verification of noncompliance with this key element is quite straightforward, since it is very hard to hide the deliberate generation of persistent space debris<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.  The fourth argument advanced by the Bush administration to oppose new diplomatic initiatives for space is that the United States must preserve its right to self-defense – including the right to defend space assets. This argument is certainly valid, but it doesn’t justify rejecting a Code of Conduct. </span>With such a code, the United States still would possess more capabilities than ever before to deter and, if necessary, punish states that take actions against U.S. satellites.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The right of self-defense, however, is more likely to be invoked, and will be more difficult to execute, if there are no agreed rules of the road for outer space.  Lastly, the Bush administration contends that new diplomatic initiatives are unwise because U.S. freedom of action in space must not be constrained. By this standard, the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Outer Space Treaty, President Ronald Reagan’s Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and President George H. W. Bush’s Strategic Arms Reduction treaties were all dreadful errors in judgment, since every one of these agreements limit the U.S. military’s freedom of action in some key respects. Using the Bush administration’s reasoning, the Geneva Conventions for U.S. armed forces also are unwise, as are codes of conduct long in place for the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and gravity-bound Air Force. If freedom of action were the topmost U.S. national security objective, we would ditch all of these treaties and codes of conduct. Of course, no responsible political leader or public official would consider doing this. So why should we use this standard to oppose new diplomatic initiatives in space?</span><br />

<strong>Arms race risks accidental nuclear war, undermines arms control, and makes space unusable</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Many people believe that a </span>deployed anti-satellite capability and an ability to attack targets on or near the Earth’s surface from space would create a global climate of insecurity both by enhancing current risks and by creating new problems.These new and increased risks would be the byproducts not only of systems to be deployed by the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>but also of the subsequent arms race in space which could be expected to resultthanks to responses by China, Russia, the European Union, and perhaps Japan.Perhaps the most consequential impact would be increasing the probability of accidental nuclear war.Space-based weapons could shorten the road to armed conflict, whether nuclear or conventional. In the event that a space asset of one nation was attacked by another<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (</span>on purpose or by accident<span style="font-size: 7pt;">), </span>an immediate military response would be triggered, shortening the diplomatic process while escalating the armed conflict.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Once employed regularly, </span>anti-satellite systems and space weapons would litter LEO with debris,which in turn would permanently compromise our collective ability to explore<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the heavens </span>and use space<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> for constructive commercial purposes. The </span>weaponization of space<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and the deployment of ASAT systems </span>would undermine existing international arms control treaties that are already under stress.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In addition, </span>they would fly in the face of the collective will of the international community, which has demanded a ban on weapons in space for two decades and repeatedly been blocked by the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates. For those who share these concerns, one thing is certain: </span>the time for international negotiations on a treaty to ban weapons in space is long overdue.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Within a very few years, this potential development could become a reality.</span><br />

China appears to be pulling away from the pack in Asia’s space race after announcing plans to launch its second lunar probe,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Chang’e-2, on October 1–China’s National Day. </span>If the mission succeeds, it will put China another step ahead of India in the race to become the second nation, after the United States, to land an astronaut on the moon.China has pledged to do that by 2025 and India by 2020–setting up a 21st Century Asian version of the Cold War space race between the U.S. and Soviet Union<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Chang’e-2 will carry a laser altimeter and a high-resolution 3-D camera to find a landing spot for another probe, Chang’e-3, which is designed to make China’s first unmanned landing on the moon in 2013. The probe has already been installed on a Long March 3C launch vehicle and underwent pre-launch drills on Saturday at Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China’s western province of Sichuan, according to state media reports. Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of China’s lunar exploration team, was quoted by the Global Times newspaper saying the countdown had begun and the only remaining task was to add fuel to the rocket. </span>The Chang’e program, named after a mythical Chinese goddess who flew to the moon, embodiesChina’s aspirations to outstrip Asian rivals and contend with the U.S. as a global superpower.The U.S. is the only country to have achieved manned lunar missions, making six trips from 1969 to 1972, but President Obama has cut plans for further manned missions.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Soviet Union canceled its program after a string of failures. China became the world’s third nation to put a man in space independently — after the United States and Russia – when Yang Liwei piloted the one-man Shenzhou-5 space mission in 2003. China then launched Chang’e-1, which orbited the moon and took high-resolution pictures of the lunar surface, in October 2007. In September 2008, a Chinese astronaut – also known as a “taikonaut” after “taikong,” the Mandarin word for space –carried out China’s first space walk. </span>China also hopes to bring a moon rock sample back to earth in 2017, and ultimately to build an observatory on the surface of the moon, according to state media.India is not far behind, having launched its first unmanned lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, in 2008, and drawn up plans to launch a second one, Chandrayaan-2, next year. India got the jump on China when Chandrayaan-1 fired a moon impact probe, carrying an Indian tricolor national flag, down to the lunar surface in October 2008.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Indian Space Research Organization has said it hopes to launch India’s first manned space flight by 2014, and its first manned lunar mission by 2020. Japan, meanwhile, launched its first lunar satellite in June last year, and announced a plan this year to send a robot to the moon in five years and to construct an unmanned base there in 10 years. </span><br />

<strong>China is looking to develop space weapons and surpass the US - The only way to stop it is through cooperation with other nations</strong> <br />

The Shenzhou 7 mission and spacewalk should serve as a reminder that China is building space capabilities that could surpass U.S. technological advances and boost China's diplomatic and economic ties with its allies<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, a panel of experts said here Oct. 8. </span>China's success this decade with three human spaceflight missions,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> including Shenzhou 7 in September, as well as the development of remote-sensing and satellite navigation systems, two satellite export deals and the January 2007 </span>use of an antisatellite weapon to shoot down one of its own satellites punctuateChina's broader national interest to become a &quot;comprehensive power,&quot;<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the </span>panelists<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> said. They </span>warned that China's space program<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> is dominated by young aerospace engineers who </span>could<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> help </span>propel the nation's advancements past the United States, which faces difficulty replacing its aging aerospace work force. China's wide reach into manned space missions<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, satellite navigation and communications, and Earth monitoring </span>could help the nation gain a foothold in an already competitive commercial space market<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, the panelists said. &quot;A newcomer like China [is] going to take a slice of a very stable pie, which means there are going to be other losers. Will it be the U.S., Europe, Russia? It's going to be something difficult that we'll have to contend with,&quot; said Kevin Pollpeter, China program manager for the Defense Group Inc.'s Center for Intelligence, </span>Research and Analysis in Washington. &quot;China's rise in space power is a negative sum consequence for the United States.&quot;China has closely guarded its space budget, in large part because it is dominated by the military<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, panelists said. Chinese leaders reported that the Chang'e lunar program cost &quot;no less than building a mile of subway in Beijing,&quot; Pollpeter said. While concerns linger about China's January 2007 shootdown of one of its own weather satellites with an antisatellite missile, or A-Sat, </span>China primarily sees space as a diplomatic tool<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China prefers jamming and dazzling satellites rather than more aggressive action, said Dean Cheng, senior Asia analyst with CNA Corp. in Alexandria, Va. Jamming is intentional interference with satellite signals; dazzling is illuminating a satellite with a laser in order to blind it. </span>Themes that can be found throughout the writings concerning China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) indicate China is focused on space deterrence<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, Cheng said, describing how a country's military capabilities, economy and communications could be affected by space warfare. &quot;We do not at this time have a very good sense of how the PLA would necessarily operate in space in order to secure space dominance,&quot; Cheng said. &quot;What we do find in PLA writings are certain key themes: the ability to provide information support, the ability to take on both offensive and defensive positions in space and ? space deterrence.&quot; </span>United States policy documents, however, appear more focused than China on national security applications, prompting a &quot;bad-guy image&quot; globally, Pollpeter said. &quot;There's a perception of overemphasizing national security applications,&quot; he said.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> &quot;</span>Even though we are not the ones developing space weapons, China is the one developing space weapons<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, we are the ones who bear the brunt of that criticism.&quot; </span>One way to mitigate the perception would be to emphasize the peaceful uses of space and cooperation with other nations<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, Pollpeter said. </span>Panelists also said the U.S. space industry should relate its relevance to people the way China's space officials routinely discuss the economic, diplomatic and political benefits of a strong space program.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> &quot;Space ultimately isn't about space,&quot; Cheng said. &quot;But too often here our conversations are stovepiped within the space community focusing on the space budget and [don't] really connect the space program to people's everyday lives even though it touches every aspect of people's everyday lives.&quot; </span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: #282a21;">The newest evidence confirms – China’s weaponizing and its military doctrine focuses on denying the US access through offensive actions</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="color: #282a21;">In addition, China’s improving space capabilities, coupled with its steadily advancing conventional capabilities, will provide the increased ability to seek space superiority or space dominance</span><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;"> (zhitian quan) </span><span style="color: #282a21;">through a combination of space offensive and defensive operations. In discussing Chinese space offensive and defensive operations, it is important to note that, while many of the tasks associated with these efforts align with what American military planners consider “counterspace” activities, the Chinese themselves do not employ such a term.</span><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;"> Moreover, Chinese writings on offensive and defensive space operations are not limited to, or even primarily focused on, attacking systems in orbit. Indeed, </span><span style="color: #282a21;">establishing space dominance entails sustaining the entire structure of terrestrial and space systems, including orbiting satellites, space-related terrestrial facilities, and the data, communications, and telemetry links that tie all of these systems together.[6] Thus, the improvements in the PLA’s broader conventional portfolio are also important because they might be used to debilitate portions of the overall American space infrastructure.</span><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;"> For example, </span><span style="color: #282a21;">Chinese descriptions of space offensive operations include not only applying hard-kill capabilities against satellites, but also attacking launch bases and tracking, telemetry, and control facilities.[7] They also discuss soft-kill techniques, such as jamming and dazzling satellites to minimize the generation of debris and the attendant physical and diplomatic consequences. </span><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;">Offensive operations will also likely involve cyber attacks against the various data and communications links that transfer information and commands used to control satellites in orbit. Similarly, </span><span style="color: #282a21;">Chinese writings on space defensive operations incorporate</span><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;"> a range of information denial measures. These include passive steps, such as </span><span style="color: #282a21;">camouflage and deception, to prevent an opponent from using space-based systems to gather accurate information. Information denial also includes preventing an opponent from attacking Chinese space-related systems, which would mean efforts to neutralize and suppress the enemy’s space infrastructure. These include both kinetic and electronic means directed at space-based systems</span><span style="color: #282a21; font-size: 8pt;">, terrestrial facilities, and the data and communications links among them. </span><span style="color: #282a21;">This is all consistent with what may be a guiding concept for China’s space operations, “unified operations, key point is space dominance.” Unified operations refer to applying all types of capabilities, terrestrial and space-based, active and passive measures, hard-kill and soft-kill. These operations would focus on ensuring that the PLA can exploit space at key, decisive times and places of its choosing, while preventing an opponent from doing so.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">However, </span>the leading nations will continue to feel the pressure to<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> achieve and </span>maintaineconomic, military and tech<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nological </span>dominance<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – and </span>that is precisely where the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>will be at a disadvantage vis-a-vis China<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>All demographic indicators are in favor of China <span style="font-size: 7pt;">-- population size, age-structure of the population, the sheer size of the working population, and the numbers of trained scientists and technologists produced every year. </span>Every single indicator relevant to this analysis favors China<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and works against the United States. Of the seven superpowers of the 21st century I named at the outset, China is the only aggressive competitor of the United States – and more, it is determined to win that competition, come what may! So, the corollary – </span>is the US doomed to play second fiddle to China? <span style="font-size: 7pt;">My answer is, </span>NO<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Qualify that – </span><strong>not if existing levels of US-India cooperation extend intensively into the coming decades. India’s importance lies in the fact that it brings to the partnership table exactly the attributes the US lacks, and desperately needs,</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in this competition with China. Look at the list: </span>India’s demographics are even more favorable than China’s.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> For starters – as then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee pointed out in his August 15, 2003 address from the Red Fort, India boasts over 600 million people in the working age group. This working force will overtake China's by 2025, and decisively so by 2050. Perhaps even more significantly, </span>India edges China handily when it comes to intellectual capital<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>Its ability to produce first rate scientific, technological and managerial manpower equals, even exceeds, that of China, with the added plus of being able to &quot;think&quot; in English!<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> To sum up – </span>India has exactly what the US lacks<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. And most importantly, from the US point of view, India can never be, will never be, an aggressive competitor the way China is. China has, for well over a decade now, bent its collective will to one single strategic objective, which it chases with trademark ruthlessness – namely, to dethrone the US from its current position as the world’s sole acknowledged economic, technological and military superpower. One fact is obvious – </span>given the demographic disadvantage the US suffers, it can never win this competition; not if it tries to fly solo<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. From that fact, emerges another – </span>the only way the US can in fact win, is by teaming up with India. <strong>IT HAS NO OTHER OPTION</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>A US-India partnership<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, by whatever name it's called, </span>is a winner; it is,<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in fact, </span>the only possible partnership with the ability to offset the surge in China's geo-political and economic powers.<br />

<strong>Chinese space superiority would damage US power projection and capabilities which are key to stop a Taiwan conflict</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Given the Chinese space systems in the previous chapter</span>, how might the Chinese use their space capabilities in a scenario involving a conflict with the U.S. over Taiwan<span style="font-size: 7pt;">? Would the contributions from these systems be sufficient enough to give China space superiority and if so, what would be the impact of that space superiority on the U.S. military? </span>A crucial element of U.S. strategy during a Taiwan conflict will be projecting power into the region with the intent of opposing Chinese military actions<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>Unless we can apply military power at the point of engagement, Taiwan and the surrounding theater, our military forces will have little ability to impact the situation<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Thus, when looking at </span>the impact of the Chinese space capabilities<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>the paper will pay particular attention to the impact on U.S. power projection capabilities with particular attention to naval and air power. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institute senior analyst, stated, “</span>Given trends in military reconnaissance, information processing and precision strike technologies, large assets such as aircraft carriers and land bases, on which the United States depends, are likely to be increasingly vulnerable to attack in the years ahead<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.”107 </span>These attacks could be enabled by Chinese space capabilities<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The U.S. intelligence community believes </span>China will use a sea-denial strategy aimed at U.S. aircraft carriers and other naval forces approaching Taiwan<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.108 </span>Thus, a key component of a Chinese campaign against Taiwan would be to keep the U.S. aircraft carriers out of striking range of Taiwan with a critical task of finding and sinking carriers.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> ELINT systems, like those demonstrated on the Shenzhou, could track U.S. carriers operating in the western Pacific or Indian Oceans.109 In addition, some of their </span>anti-naval weapons could use space-based information. Specifically, one of China’s primary weapons to strike U.S. naval assets will be the supersonic, sea-skimming SS-N-26 missile.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In recent years, Ch</span>ina has purchased the Russian SS-N-26 anti-ship cruise missiles; however, without space-based ELINT data which can locate and track naval assets, the Chinese ability to effectively use the SS-N-26 is undermined<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.110 Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institute senior analyst, states, </span>“To attack a U.S. carrier, one needs not only periodic localization of the carrier, but real-time tracking and dissemination of that information to a missile that is capable of reaching the carrier and defeating its defenses.”<span style="font-size: 7pt;">111 Space systems are only one of the means to locate and track U.S. carriers, and it is unclear if China’s current reconnaissance satellites have the capability to locate and target U.S. aircraft carriers.112 However, as shown in the previous chapter, China has launched and operated ELINT systems in the past. </span>If they did acquire a space-based ELINT system<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, how would they use it and the rest of their suite of space capability against U.S. naval forces? </span>Chinese ballistic and cruise missile attacks on airfields would not look to destroy the U.S. facilities, but suppress their ability to provide air and missile defense.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Rear Admiral Eric A. McVadon (USN, Ret.), former Defense Attaché at the American Embassy in Beijing and expert on </span>China’s military, stated that once the Chinese suppressed U.S. air and missile defenses, it would conceptually “permit follow-on attacks, in relative safety, by the several new types of Chinese aircraft using very modern cruise missile<span style="font-size: 7pt;">s.”</span>125 This scenario is a great concern for the Asia-Pacific region. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">As one wing commander at Guam said, “[Chinese planes and missiles] would keep coming … I fear them numbers-wise,” and one analyst predicts, “We can’t expect that we can completely protect a carrier battle group when it got into theater.”126 No</span>t only would these forces be looking to target carriers, they would look to target items which enable U.S. air power, and this targeting would be assisted by imagery derived from space systems. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">A former high-ranking Chinese official once said to be victorious in future combat, “We will have to gain air and sea superiority, but win information superiority first.”127 Gaining this information superiority, on the way to winning air and sea superiority, would be enabled by Chinese space systems.</span><br />

A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential <strong>to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, therefore, </span>many countries<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> other than the primary actors </span>could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and GreatBritain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>and China are the<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> two </span>most dominant<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> members. </span>If China were<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> able </span>to<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> successfully </span>annex Taiwan<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, </span>which could inturn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In any case, </span>if China and the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> economically and/or militarily </span>affected<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.</span><br />

The mission is aimed at getting back a kilogram of rocks from the lunar surface. </span>This is the first step to a collaborative research after getting the US lifting sanctions on Indian Space Research Organisation<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Isro). </span>The mission<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>if selected is scheduled to be launched in 2016<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. On January 24th 2011 USA has removed nine Indian space and defence-related companies, including those from Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), from its export control &quot;Entity List&quot;. The step was taken to enhance the cooperation between US and India in an attempt to expand high-technology trade and strategic cooperation with India. The iconic JPL which has sent missions to Mars and Venus wants Isro to put a satellite around the moon to be a link between its lunar lander probe and the earth. </span>The mission would be similar to the Chandrayaan-I mission<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>The Space Commission<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, India’s apex space policy body, </span>has given Isro the go-ahead to partner with JPL for the project named ‘Moon Rise’, which could be launched by the Nasa<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> under its New Frontiers Programme announced in 2009. </span>India’s contribution to the project could amount to about $150 million<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As part of the project, </span>JPL plans to drop a robotic lander into a basin at the moon’s South Pole to send lunar rocks back to Earth for study<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The 400-500 kg satellite is being planned to have a life of up to five years and could also carry some scientific experiments of Isro. He said </span>the proposal was an outcome of India-US cooperation announced during the visit of<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> President Barack </span>Obama to India last year<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>The mission is part of a joint proposal with JPL which will be put up before Nasa<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Forward of the proposal and work out a detailed plan would be started after Nasa selects the proposal. Nasa has selected three proposals as candidates for the agency’s next space venture to another celestial body in the solar system. </span>The final project selected in mid-2011 may provide a better understanding of Earth’s formation or perhaps the origin of life on Earth<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>b. Increase requires a preexisting policy</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Buckley et al, 06 -</strong> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">attorney (Jeremiah, Amicus Curiae Brief, Safeco Ins. Co. of America et al v. Charles Burr et al, </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/06-84/06-84.mer.ami.mica.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/06-84/06-84.mer.ami.mica.pdf</a>)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">First, the court said that the ordinary meaning of the word “increase” is “to make something greater,” which it believed should not “be limited to cases in which a company raises the rate that an individual has previously been charged.” 435 F.3d at 1091. Yet the definition offered by the Ninth Circuit compels the opposite conclusion. </span>Because “increase” means “to make something greater,” there must necessarily have been an existing premium<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, to which Edo’s actual premium may be compared, </span>to determine whether an “increase” occurred<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Congress could have provided that “ad-verse action” in the insurance context means charging an amount greater than the optimal premium, but instead chose to define adverse action in terms of an “increase.” That def-initional choice must be respected, not ignored. See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392-93 n.10 (1979) (“[a] defin-ition which declares what a term ‘means’ . . . excludes any meaning that is not stated”). Next, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that because the Insurance Prong includes the words “existing or applied for,” Congress intended that an “increase in any charge” for insurance must “apply to all insurance transactions – from an initial policy of insurance to a renewal of a long-held policy.” 435 F.3d at 1091. This interpretation reads the words “exist-ing or applied for” in isolation. Other types of adverse action described in the Insurance Prong apply only to situations where a consumer had an existing policy of insurance, such as a “cancellation,” “reduction,” or “change” in insurance. Each of these forms of adverse action presupposes an already-existing policy, and </span>under usual canons of statutory construction the term “increase<span style="font-size: 7pt;">” also </span>should be construed to apply to increases of an already-existing policy<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 101 (2004) (“a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it”) (citation omitted). </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Former </span>NASA astronautTom Henricks<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a veteran of four space shuttle missions, </span>agreed<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. He said that </span>the future in space will require much more collaboration between countries<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> than there's been in the past. </span><strong>&quot;I don't think any major effort in space will again be done by a single nation,&quot;</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Henricks said. &quot;They may each have individual sub goals, but it's a human endeavor to go to Mars, and I think that's the way it needs to be approached.&quot;</span><br />

This paper aims to analyze the new US National Space Policy<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (NSP) and examine its relevance to Asia. President Barack </span>Obama announced the new NSP in June 2010<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, after inviting wide speculation on how the new administration wanted to define its NSP.

Also, as one of the goals of its national space programs, emphasis is placed on the expansion of international cooperation. In the inter-sectoral guidelines there is a special section on international cooperation, which stipulates the need to strengthen US space leadership, identify areas for potential international cooperation, and develop transparency and confidence-building measures (TCBMs). According to a senior administration official, who played a central role in shaping the document, </span>enhancing international cooperation and collaboration in space is positioned as a “key cornerstone” in Obama’s NSP<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.2</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Columbia was lost just two days before NASA was slated to deliver its FY2004 budget proposal to Capitol Hill, so that proposal has gotten very little attention during the course of the accident investigation. However, </span>that budget<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> contains significant shifts in focus for NASA.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If chosen as the next New Frontiers mission, </span>the MoonRise probe<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> would launch from the Kennedy Space Center in October 2016, for a slow, spiral trajectory that would take it to the moon by March 2017. The portion of MoonRise containing the lunar sample would return to Earth in August 2017. India's role in the mission would be to launch a lunar orbiter similar to the Chandrayaan-I. The lunar orbiter would provide an overall analysis of the MoonRise landing site as well as conduct a further remote examination of the Moon during a planned five year mission. The NASA portion of the mission </span>is designed to cost no more than $700 million<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>exclusive of launch costs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The Indian lunar orbiter would cost about $150 million<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>2. Counterplan links to politics –</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>a. Links to politics or means the plan doesn't happen</strong> <br />
<strong>Klein 10</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Ezra Klein, awesome political blogger, “Sins of Commission,” February 19, 2010, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/02/sins_of_commission.html" rel="nofollow">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/02/sins_of_commission.html</a></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There's nothing magic about </span>a commission<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Like a congressional committee, it </span>puts together legislation that Congress later votes to accept, reject or delay<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And as of now, there's simply no reason to believe that the votes exist for any serious compromise. </span>Republican leaders<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for instance, </span>are arguing that the commission simply shouldn't consider tax increases, which makes a deal impossible. That was their rationale for filibustering the very formation of a commission<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>which is why Obama had to do this through an executive order<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But elites still like the idea, in part because elites can see the outlines of a deal that elites would make. Greg Mankiw for instance, thinks Republicans should demand that the commission include a value-added tax and a carbon tax. I would support that. The problem is that </span>the Republican Party opposes both policies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and there's no reason to believe they're going to change their minds. </span><br />
<br />
<strong>b. Even if the commission is unanimous in its recommendation, it still links to politics because the GOP will assume Senate Democrats will go beyond the commission’s recommendations</strong> <br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Hennessey 10</span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;"> – Keith Hennessey, economic policy analyst, January 20, 2010, “Error of Commission,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://keithhennessey.com/2010/01/20/error-of-commission/g" rel="nofollow">http://keithhennessey.com/2010/01/20/error-of-commission/</a></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The President’s commission does not create any binding fast-track process. Leader Reid cannot unilaterally bind 100 Senators to an up-or-down vote and no amendments. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Even if a commission were to produce unanimous recommendations, Republicans </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">should </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">fear that a Democratic Senate majority would use those recommendations as a starting point, substitute</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even more tax increases for whatever spending cuts are in the recommendations, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">and then pass the bill</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Scott Brown’s election as the 41st vote has little effect on this dynamic, since the changes would probably happen in committee. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Any commission</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> created by Executive Order </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">has this weakness: it cannot bind Congress. Only Congress can tie itself to the mast.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>4. Congress says no – Commission recommendations don’t get adopted unless there’s already consensus about what policy changes need to be made</strong> <br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">The second question is whether the BRAC model can succeed in other policy areas, where Congress has been similarly unable to act.

In an agreement which cuts costs<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, </span>while combining the talents of two major space agencies in an effort that will allow both to pioneer potentially ground-breaking science<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in a mysterious unsampled area of the Moon’s farside, forever hidden from direct view from Earth, </span>this announcement is very encouraging<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. But there are some hurdles that must be overcome, notably the current budget crisis in the United States that could potentially force NASA to cancel or post pone this long-desired mission. Meanwhile </span>scientists<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in both countries </span>are proceeding with<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the design and planning stages in the hopes that </span>Moonrise<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> will fly as projected in 2016, five years from now. </span>The target area is the<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> so-called “</span>South Pole-Aitken Basin<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, the deepest impact basin on the Moon, some 8 km below the Moon’s mean surface level at the basin’s center.

A U.S.-India Joint Working Group on Civil Space Cooperation was established in March 2005<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The inaugural meeting was held in Bangalore, home of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), in June of that year. </span>This forum is meant to provide a mechanism for enhanced cooperation in areas including joint satellite activities and launch<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, space exploration, increased interoperability among existing and future civil space-based positioning and navigation systems, and collaboration on various Earth observation projects. The next meeting is slated to take place in Washington, D.C., by spring 2006. 43 </span>The July 18 Joint Statement calls for closer ties in space exploration, satellite navigation and launch, and in the commercial space arena. U.S. proponents aver that increased civil space cooperation with India can lead to practical solutions to everyday problems related to communication, navigation, the environment, meteorology, and other areas of scientific inquiry.Immediate benefits could include launching U.S. instruments on a planned Indian moon mission and working to include an Indian astronaut in the U.S. astronaut training program<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The two nations also express a readiness to expand cooperation on the Global Positioning System. 44 While current cooperative plans may be considered noncontroversial, there have in the past been U.S. efforts to prevent India from obtaining technology and know-how which could allow New Delhi to advance its military missile programs. 45 </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While the potential of our bilateral relationship is limitless, I want to assure you that my remarks this afternoon are not. So let me conclude simply by re-emphasizing the central, transformational fact about our relations in the years ahead: </span>India and the United States have reached the stage where our individual success at home and abroad depends on our cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That is what is different about our relationship today. That is the promise unlocked by the civil nuclear agreement, and all the advances of recent years. That is the &quot;big idea&quot; that can animate our partnership for decades to come. And </span>that is the challenge before us,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> symbolized by the inauguration of the first-ever Strategic Dialogue</span>: how to widen the arc of our cooperation, how to build systematic habits of collaboration, how to turn the transformational accomplishment of the civil nuclear accord into partnership across a much broader front<br />

<strong>11. Turn – Consulting Russia is a Bad Idea – they violate treaties and promote rogue states who fight against the US</strong><br />
<strong>The Heritage Foundation 10</strong>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Conservative foreign policy think tank, “ Top 10 Reasons Not to Trust Russia” 6-29-10, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Factsheets/Top-10-Reasons-Not-to-Trust-Russia" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Research/Factsheets/Top-10-Reasons-Not-to-Trust-Russia</a> NEH) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The current regime in </span>Russia has a terrible record as a reliable partner<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, yet President Obama wants the nuclear treaty he negotiated with the Kremlin fast-tracked for Senate approval. That makes no sense. </span>Here are 10 reasons why. <strong>1. A Long History of Arms Control Violations</strong>: Russia repeatedly violated the 1991<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (</span>START<span style="font-size: 8pt;">) all the way to its expiration in December 2009, </span>as <span style="font-size: 8pt;">clearly </span>stated in 2005 and 2010 State Department compliance reports<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Specifically, </span>Russia tested an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile with<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Multiple Individually Targeted Re-entry Vehicles (</span>warheads<span style="font-size: 8pt;">) </span>while START was in force. Such activities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span>were explicitly banned<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong>2. The West Is Still Their #1 Threat</strong>: Russia regards the U.S. and NATO as its principal adversaries and configures its forces for large-scale conventional theater operations with them. The<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> recent </span>discovery of the Russian spy network inside the U.S.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and their celebration upon return to Russia, courtesy of President Obama, </span>indicates that Russia is set in a Cold War mentality. <strong>3. Helping Iran and North Korea</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: According to U.S. intelligence, </span>Russia violated nonproliferation agreements by providing ballistic missile technology to Iran and North Korea<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which have continually threatened America and its allies. </span><strong>4. Still Building a Nuclear Arsenal</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: Nearly 20 years after the end of the Cold War, </span>Russia still designs, builds, and modernizes nuclear weapons and their delivery systems<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Russia’s new military doctrine maintains a low threshold for nuclear first strikes. In fact, </span>Moscow plans to use tactical nuclear weapons in Europe if ever confronted with a conventional threat. In 2009, Russia conducted a military exercise that simulated a nuclear attack on Poland. <strong>5. Not in Compliance on Other Treaties</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: The U.S. believes </span>Russia <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to be </span>in non-compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In 2009, the Strategic Posture Commission told Congress: “Russia is no longer in compliance with its PNI [Presidential Nuclear Initiatives] commitments.” </span>Moscow’s tactical nuclear weapons arsenal may be 10 times larger than that of the U.S. <strong>6. No Regard for Georgia Independence</strong>: Russia has repeatedly broken its promises to withdraw military forces from Georgia and Moldova<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>When Russia invaded Georgia in 2008<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, it rewrote the rules of post–World War II European security. </span>It repudiated the Helsinki Pact of 1975, which recognized the security of European borders, and violated the sovereignty of a NATO aspirant<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and member of the Council of Europe. </span><strong>7. Responds Offensively to Defensive Measures</strong>: In response to U.S. plans for a defensive missile shield in Europe to protect against Iranian missile threats, Moscow has repeatedly threatened to deploy Iskander short-range and nuclear-capable missiles to target U.S. allies in Eastern Europe. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Reports show that the Baltic Fleet is armed with nuclear weapons that can be used against Europe. </span><strong>8. Ties to Terrorist Organizations</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span>Russia cultivates ties with terrorist organizations Hamas and Hezbollah and provides military and diplomatic support for anti-American “rogue states” such as Syria, Iran, and Venezuela. Russia<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> voted with the U.S. at the U.N. Security Council to </span>pass sanctions on Iran<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—but </span>only after working hard to water them down to practically nothing<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong>9. Natural Gas as a Political Weapon</strong>: The Kremlin uses<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its neighbors and </span>Europe’s dependence on Russian natural gas as a foreign policy tool to pressure states. In 2009, Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine and to Europe by extension<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, causing the International Energy Agency to deem them an unreliable supplier. </span><strong>10. An Authoritarian Regime</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: The current model of leadership under President Dmitry </span>Medvedev and<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Prime Minister Vladimir </span>Putin has become increasingly authoritarian<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Despite numerous commitments under international law, </span>the government has tightened controls on political life, civil society, and the media. Disruption of political opposition’s activities, restricting access to state-controlled TV, human right violations (such as the beating of demonstrators who “support” the Russian constitution), murder of journalists and anti-corruption activists, disappearance and torture, abuse of the legal system for monetary and political gain—all illustrate this negative trend.<br />

<strong>2. The thesis behind the link is wrong – relations won’t spillover to a transfer of weapons or to ICBM development</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Bommakanti, 08</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Kartik, Research Assistant at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi, “Are MIRVs and Satellite Integration and Dispensation Mutually Inclusive? An Analysis of India’s Capabilities”, 4/10/08, <span style="font-size: 11pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/IndiaMIRV.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/IndiaMIRV.pdf</a></span>) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Given the dual-use nature of space technology, </span>what can one make of the claims that increased civilian space cooperation between the United States and India will result in transfer of technology that may bring integration and delivery capabilities warheads into India’s arsenal<span style="font-size: 8pt;">? The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is poised to send two instruments aboard India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) in 2008. </span>Raising concerns about India-U.S. civilian space cooperation, one analyst, Jennifer Kline, reached the suggestive conclusion that technical “know-how” about satellite integration capabilities will enable India to MIRV its ballistic missiles<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span>This point is often regurgitated<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and incidentally became one reason for suspending American commercial satellite launches from Chinese space launch vehicles in the late 1990s. Just as there was no substantive reason for suspending cooperation with China then, </span><strong>there is nothing to be concerned</strong> about current or expanded India-U.S. space cooperation either<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A brief retrospective would help clarify some issues. In 1998, controversy erupted in the United States over the telecom giant Motorola’s alleged transfer to China of the Iridium Smart Dispenser. Motorola’s Smart Dispenser releases multiple satellites into orbit, which some alleged enabled the Chinese to develop a MIRV capability.12 But as the House Select Subcommittee report on China’s space and missile forces, also known as the Cox report, noted in 1998, “The PRC [People’s Republic of China, or China] has demonstrated all of the techniques that are required for developing a MIRV bus, and that the PRC could develop a MIRV dispensing platform within a short period of time after making a decision to proceed.”13 This statement is reinforced by two additional facts. As early as 1981, China had dispensed three satellites from a single platform which gave “it an incipient multiple-warhead capability.”14 Secondly, Motorola did not transfer design information of the Iridium dispenser; instead, the company laid out specific technological parameters based on which Chinese engineers developed through indigenous effort a satellite dispenser to Motorola’s needs.</span>15 The obvious conclusion one immediately derives is that China already wielded the technological precursors for the development of a MIRV capability and no real net technology transfer actually accrued to China’s MIRV development program<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As China expert Michael Swaine noted in 1998, “</span>Among those who look at Chinese military capabilities, there’s a fairly strong degree of skepticism about the extent to which China’s relationship with U.S. commercial satellite makers has resulted in significant advances in its long-range military missile capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”16 </span><strong>This applies to India as well</strong>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The technical fallacy is that the two NASA instruments will be fixed to one of the satellites. As Subrata Ghoshroy, a former analyst with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), has pointed out: Thus </span>the concern that NASA’s engineers might transfer “tacit” knowledge<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in efforts to mate two lunar instruments </span>with India<span style="font-size: 8pt;">’s PSLV, </span>which would enable India’s space engineers to learn warhead-missile integration techniques, does not stand the test of technical evidence.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In the analysis to follow, we will explore why more substantive issues would help qualify the syllogistic and misleading argument that satellite integration would automatically lead to a MIRV capability. Some media reports suggest India’s Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) has already initiated tentative efforts to develop a MIRV capability for India’s Agni-III intermediate range ballistic missiles. Note that </span>the launch of India’s Chandrayaan moon mission<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that would carry two of NASA’s instruments isn’t scheduled until June or July of this year.18 </span>This would pretty much refute the allegation that Indian engineers would spin off information from its civilian space sector to its missile program<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nevertheless, </span>even if one were to dismiss this position as unverifiable and assert that the DRDO’s quest to develop MIRVs could still in some way be assisted through American transfers in the realm of civilian space cooperation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>it does not square with the fact that several countries have launched their instruments and satellites from Indian boosters and that India has had the capacity to integrate and dispense multiple satellite payloads since 1999.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The European Space Agency (ESA) is launching its own instruments aboard the same Indian Space Launch Vehicle (SLV) that would host NASA’s M3 and Mini-SAR instruments. Additionally, in 1999, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched three satellite payloads, the IRS-P4, and two foreign microsatellites (the Korean KITSAT-3 and Germany’s TUBSAT) simultaneously on a single PSLV rocket.19 In May 2005, India launched the Cartosat-1 and Hamsat satellites from another version of the PSLV. In January 2007, ISRO went one step further, simultaneously launching the satellites, India’s CARTOSAT-2, Indonesia’s LAPAN-TUBSAT and Argentina’s PEHUENSAT-1 and the Space Recovery Experiment-1 (SRE-1) Capsule.20 In April 2007, India registered its first successful commercial launch on a PSLV C8 – the 352-kilogram Italian satellite AGILE along with a non-commercial 185-kilogram craft known as the Advanced Avionics Module (AAM) in order to “test advanced launch vehicle avionics systems like mission computers, navigation and telemetry systems.”21 As recently as Jan. 28, 2008, the C10 version of the PSLV launched an Israeli spy satellite.22 </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But </span>does placing multiple satellites in orbit require the same level of precision as delivering MIRVs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">? </span>John Pike<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of GlobalSecurity.org </span>explained<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in 1998: Satellite operators generally set standards for launch vehicles, placing their satellites into some proximity of the destination orbit. But the margin for error in the real world is normally many miles. And since satellites always carry their own maneuvering propellant, it's left to the satellite rather than the launcher to reach the ultimate destination. And </span>in the case of deploying multiple satellites<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, this </span>deployment can take place over a period of hours or daysrather than the minutes found in the case of a multiple warhead missile<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The warheads carried on missiles have no such supplementary guidance or propulsion capability, and rely entirely on the missile and equality of the re-entry vehicle body to reach their terrestrial destination.37 The answer is no, delivering satellites on orbit does not require the same accuracy that is needed in a MIRV, but Pike’s statement is still conditional. There is a definitional issue of accuracy. In India’s case, the demands on accuracy are contingent, in that missile accuracy is not completely geared to striking military targets, necessitating extensive testing to achieve high levels of precision. There are differences between the needs of India, China and the United States when it comes to missile precision. During the Cold War, accuracy through counterforce attacks was a premium for the United States. The objective was to fight and win a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.38 But India’s nuclear doctrine represents a significant departure from Cold War thinking because it implicitly emphasizes countervalue targeting as a retributive measure, obviating the need to optimize accuracy through precision nuclear attacks against the adversary’s retaliatory forces. In fact, speaking in the context of China’s targeting posture, Pike himself maintains it makes little difference where exactly ground zero is for Chinese missiles, if their target is another country’s city.39 This point applies equally in India’s case. As one influential member of India’s nuclear policymaking establishment noted, </span>India’s nuclear doctrine and force posture rejects the “spurious doctrines of counterforce<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”40 To that extent, accuracy is unlikely to be the definitive or stringent criterion for India, since it has the luxury of settling for moderate accuracy as opposed to high accuracy, and eases some technical strictures or precision necessary under a counterforce doctrine. </span>Technology in this instance is likely to interact with doctrine<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But there is another conditional issue with Pike’s statement. </span>A multiple satellite ejection does not necessarily have to occur over a period of hours and days<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span>the process can happen in the space of a few minutes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In fact, the 2007 launch discussed above ejected all satellites within a few minutes.41 Nevertheless, </span>even if this analysis has shown India’s mastery of the techniques of multiple satellite dispensation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>the conversion of that into a credible MIRV capability requires more exacting standards<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>because there are other conditional variables<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>7. India can’t develop weapons – hurdles</strong> <br />

Three hurdles will confront India’s MIRV efforts: warhead miniaturization<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>warhead guidance and re-entry technology<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The challenge for India is not per se about weapon yield if the objective is merely to develop simple fission-based warheads of 5-20 kiloton yield, which it can do. </span>The real problem lies in sufficiently miniaturizing and making the warheads light so as to enable<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> their successful </span>integration into a MIRV platform<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. MIRV design and development in the United States benefited from significant parallel advances in electronics that enabled warhead miniaturization and substantial qualitative progress in yield-to-weight ratios. If high yield does not count, then weight and compactness (size and dimensions) certainly do. In the case of simple fission devices, it is reasonable to assume that India’s nuclear scientists since the 1998 nuclear tests have made some progress in fabricating new weapons designs or made improvements on older ones.42 Whether these designs are small and light enough to be compatible with a MIRV configuration is unknown, but MIRVed ballistic missiles are finely balanced projectiles. As Greenwood notes, “</span>The entire package must be made small enough and light enough to meet the severe volume and weight constraints of the missile’s overall design<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”43 In India’s case, reducing size and weight could compromise the yield of even 15- to 20- kiloton warheads. </span>Indian missile engineers and nuclear scientists working in concert will have to harmonize these three demands<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If not, they may have to settle for 5- to 10- kiloton yields to develop compact and lighter warheads. </span>Whether India’s strategic and military elites are prepared to do that is open to conjecture<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>8. Turn – Cooperative space efforts encourage peaceful use of space</strong><br />

<strong>Huntly, Bock, and Weingartner, 2010</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Wade, US Naval Postgraduate School; Joseph, Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies; Miranda, Weingartner Consulting; “Planning the Unplannable: Scenarios on the future of space”, Space Policy, Vol. 26, No. 1, Science Direct, accessed: 6/21/11)</span><br />
<br />
The Obama administration seems set to take US space policy in different directions, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">but reflecting convergent concerns. As a candidate, the future president explicitly opposed “the stationing of weapons in space and the development of anti-satellite weapons” but simultaneously recognized the need “to protect [US] assets in space” and supported programs “to make US systems more robust and less vulnerable.”11 Shortly after his inauguration, President </span>Obama reaffirmed this position by declaring his intention to seek a ban on space weapons; but White House policy emphasized barring weapons that could interfere with US satellites, thereby linking the policy directly to securing US space-based capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.12 The new directions of the present administration encourage long-standing advocates of more multilateral approaches to space security challenges</span>. However, these directions are ambivalent on the deeper presumption of the inevitability of space-based conflict, if not weaponization<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Recent interest among US military strategists in the prerequisites for establishing and maintaining “space deterrence”13 reflect continuity in this vein of thinking. Driven in large measure by concerns over US intentions, most other countries categorically oppose weaponization of space and have supported efforts to expand the Outer Space Treaty (OST) to control and limit future military expansions into space.14 </span>Evolving coalitions of states have consistently endorsed negotiation of a further Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS<span style="font-size: 8pt;">) </span>agreement<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the past decade, Russia and China have led these efforts; but at times many significant US allies (such as Canada) have joined the call.15 </span>Notably, many supporters of establishing treaty-based control of future military-related space activities share the judgment that technological advancement is creating genuine security implications rendering existing space regulation increasingly insufficient,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and encouraging the expectation that, absent stronger controls, weaponization may indeed be inevitable. Here also, China's ASAT-testing satellite shoot-down has been taken as a demonstration of these conclusions.16 Whereas space nationalists and space globalists differ markedly on prescriptions, the underlying diagnoses of contemporary forces and prospects are more convergent. This observation casts light on the common view that ambitions to create a binding space governance regime merely reflect idealist aspirations for global cooperation. But states supporting treaty-based restraints on space weapons development typically have made appraisals of their national space security interests just as realist as those by the USA. The different responses to these concerns by these countries reflect the differences in the content of their interests and in their relative capabilities to pursue them. </span>The USA, as the dominant military space actor, often expresses a familiar “great power” response to space security developments. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Other countries' perspectives may differ along three dimensions. First, they face the consequences of possessing less – or no – capacity to redress their space security concerns by their own resources.17 Second, their interests may include more relative attention to civil and commercial space activities, with space security concerns limited to the prerequisite of a peaceful space environment in which to conduct those activities. Finally, they may worry that, because of their smaller role, their interests may be abused not only from others' malice but from their ignorance and neglect. States for which these differences hold take the perspective of “lesser powers” with respect to space security. Each of these differences motivates lesser powers to pursue their interests through some form of structured relationship, which may include either exclusive alliances or inclusive regimes.18 </span>The particular nature of space-related issues exaggerates these tendencies. All states have an equivalent “proximity” to space, and many, as consumers of space-based communications and imaging products, tend to perceive immediate interests in activities there. For this reason, weaker states tend to view the consequences of conflict in space in absolute rather than proximate terms<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even if their capacity to influence events in space is particularly limited – akin to weaker states' outlooks on nuclear conflict. </span>This convergence between particular and generalized interests induces these states to perceive broadly shared interests; in turn, the absolute nature of the consequences of space conflict increases the perceived utility of broad-based multilateral collaboration<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (versus exclusive alliances). Hence, advocacy of shared international principles and multilateral agreements by such states reflects a realistic response to the particular circumstances they face. </span>The “realism” of the appeal among lesser-powered states of treaty-based regime solutions to space weaponization concerns underscores the observation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>noted above, that “great” and “lesser” powers share a similar diagnosis of the underlying space security condition: namely, that inevitable technological advancement combined with the anarchic rivalry of states will, in the absence of restraint, lead ineluctably to the weaponization of space.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> These outlooks vary less on the nature of the political forces driving current circumstances than on the possibility and desirability of containing those forces. Hence, the alternative to weaponization is sometimes presented as the preservation of space as a peaceful “sanctuary”, holding at bay the terrestrial pressures that would otherwise invade the pristine space environment.19 This presumption that weaponry and warfare in space can be prevented only by restraining the endemic forces of human conflict suggests a limitation of vision. The concept is one of straightforward negation, as in a dike holding back a surging sea or a wall resisting encroaching hordes. Negation goals omit the prospect that the underlying pressures themselves may be in some manner relieved. With respect to space security, this means addressing whether the security dynamics generating potential for weaponization and conflict in space might be redressed at a deeper, more self-sustaining level than dependence upon static treaty structures allows. That deeper level involves the dynamic nature of state interests themselves. </span>Most proposals for international cooperation in space security activities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, whether a full-fledged formal PAROS-like treaty, or more modest arrangements to fashion “rules of the road”, </span>emphasize the potential to realize states' existing common interests<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Such </span>cooperation, even when institutionalized, may endure only so long as the underlying interest convergence persists; and given the energetic expansion and evolving nature of the human presence in space, the persistence of interest convergence cannot be assumed.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As circumstances move tectonically, the energies required to keep intact the structures built upon those foundations increase to a point of unsustainability. Conflict's trumping of regimes remains, in some sense, inevitable.20 Few space security analysts have focused on the possibilities for cooperation to function more organically as an element of the evolution of human space activities, rather than simply as a structure applied to that evolution. </span><strong>The more organic possibility reflects the potential over time for cooperative agreements and institutions to change state interests themselves. Processes facilitating such evolution include strategic interest convergence, information creation and sharing, “spillover” and “feedback” effects, issue scope expansion and integration, and the facilitation of transnational linkages.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Interacting synergistically with the interests they are influencing, such cooperation evolves dynamically as well. </span>As such cooperation deepens its roots among all parties, it can begin to endure self-sustainably<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.21 </span>The potential for more organic principles and cooperative institutions to shape the nature of political relations themselves suggests a more expansive concept of the underlying nature of interstate relations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – one that need not always resemble the realist image of a Hobbesian “war of all against all”. Hedley Bull's “anarchical society” and Daniel Deudney's “negarchy,” for example, capture the past and present existence of international political orders that, despite the absence of hierarchical government, have functioned as qualitatively distinct governance systems.22 Application of concepts of qualitatively distinct political ordering principles to developing governance conditions of the future human presence in space is as yet largely unexplored.23 The fluidity of interests and capabilities with respect to space activities suggests a relatively large potential for organized cooperation to influence their evolution. </span>Such cooperative principles and institutions would then become intrinsic to the dynamic political forces shaping the expanding human presence in space, growing and evolving with them, rather than acting as exogenous static structures seeking to constrain those forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.24 The rate and uncertainty of change in both the technological and political dimensions of expanding human space activities complicates this task. Herein lies the value of “realistic visions”. Rigorous articulations of the interplay of the wide variety of constraints, tradeoffs, uncertainties, and values entailed in human expansion into space can facilitate evaluation of the applicability of alternative governance concepts to human space activities in the context of dynamic change.</span><br />

<br />
Krepon 2007 – Stimson Center [Co-founder and contributor 3/5, Michael, “Will the Bush Administration Endorse a Space Code of Conduct?”, Space News, http:www.stimson.org/pub.cfm?id=402, accessed June 21, 2011)<br />
<br />
Support is growing for a specific kind of multilateral space agreement that borrows heavily from the Bush administration’s own preferences. The mechanism in question is a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations that could either take the form of political compacts or executive agreements among like-minded states that wish to continue to enjoy the national security and economic benefits that satellites provide. Like the Bush administration’s Proliferation Security Initiative, a Code of Conduct for space could be designed by a core group of states to clarify responsible and irresponsible behavior. The core group might then invite any other spacefaring nation that wishes to abide by these high standards to join the group. <br />
The European Union has now joined Canada in endorsing a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations. The commercial satellite industry also has expressed a strong interest in “rules of the road” for space. The Bush administration has further distanced itself from America’s friends and allies by continuing to insist that new multilateral agreements related to space are “unnecessary and counterproductive.” No other nation in the world has adopted such a negative stance. Saying “hell no” to new multilateral agreements for space seems particularly questionable after China’s irresponsible test of an anti-satellite (A-Sat) weapon that endangers spaceflight in low Earth orbit for decades to come. George Washington’s farewell address warned against indulging in “habitual hatred” resulting in a slavish animosity that leads the United States to “stray from its duty and interest.” Rejecting a Code of Conduct for space because it smacks of arms control would seem to violate Washington’s sound admonition. The Bush administration has not yet taken a position towards a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations. Because rules of the road for space make so much sense, and because the Bush administration has championed other codes of conduct to prevent proliferation, it might still join in the emerging consensus on this issue. The administration’s reasoning against new multilateral agreements for space boils down to five arguments, none of which applies to the Code of Conduct. <br />
First, administration officials argue that there is no likelihood of an arms race in space, therefore, there is no need for new multilateral arrangements. It is true that an arms race is unlikely, since arms racing has now been replaced by asymmetric warfare. But an arms race is not needed to do lasting damage to space, as the Chinese A-Sat test demonstrated. We can now see clearly that it takes very few kinetic energy kill tests and A-Sat weapons to result in significant damage to low Earth orbit. New diplomatic initiatives are needed precisely because an arms race isn’t needed to prevent the peaceful uses of outer space. The second argument advanced by the Bush administration is that arms control is a vestige of the Cold War and not terribly relevant to contemporary security concerns. Again, there is partial truth in this argument, because classic arms control arrangements dealt with a superpower competition that ended with the demise of the Soviet Union. <br />
What used to be known as arms control has now morphed into cooperative threat reduction agreements, including rules of the road clarifying responsible behavior. Semantic arguments aside, the administration has itself championed multilateral agreements in the form of codes of conduct to prevent proliferation, such as The Hague Code of Conduct, as well as the Proliferation Security Initiative. We do not have to argue over whether these codes of conduct constitute arms control to conclude that these creative arrangements were sensible initiatives. <br />
A Code of Conduct for space also would be quite useful in making the Chinese kinetic-kill ASAT test the very last of its kind. If codes of conduct relating to missiles and exports make sense for preventing proliferation – and do not, in the Bush administration’s vocabulary, constitute arms control – then surely a code of conduct also makes sense for activities in space. After all, troubling activities in space also could prompt vertical and horizontal proliferation on the ground. <br />
The third argument that the Bush administration advances against new diplomatic initiatives for space activity is that there can be no agreed to definition of what constitutes “space weapons.” Moreover, verification is extremely problematic. Consequently, no multilateral agreement can be negotiated barring such weapons. <br />
The administration is correct in pointing to the difficulties in defining and verifying space weapons. A code of conduct, however, focuses on activities, not on definitions of what constitutes a space weapon. For example, one key element of a Code of Conduct would surely be that responsible spacefaring nations do not engage in activities that deliberately produce persistent space debris, such as the Chinese A-Sat test. <br />
This key element makes it unnecessary to define space weapons, since actions, not definitions, lie at the core of a rules of the road approach. Verification of noncompliance with this key element is quite straightforward, since it is very hard to hide the deliberate generation of persistent space debris. <br />
The fourth argument advanced by the Bush administration to oppose new diplomatic initiatives for space is that the United States must preserve its right to self-defense – including the right to defend space assets. This argument is certainly valid, but it doesn’t justify rejecting a Code of Conduct. With such a code, the United States still would possess more capabilities than ever before to deter and, if necessary, punish states that take actions against U.S. satellites. The right of self-defense, however, is more likely to be invoked, and will be more difficult to execute, if there are no agreed rules of the road for outer space. <br />
Lastly, the Bush administration contends that new diplomatic initiatives are unwise because U.S. freedom of action in space must not be constrained. By this standard, the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Outer Space Treaty, President Ronald Reagan’s Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and President George H. W. Bush’s Strategic Arms Reduction treaties were all dreadful errors in judgment, since every one of these agreements limit the U.S. military’s freedom of action in some key respects. Using the Bush administration’s reasoning, the Geneva Conventions for U.S. armed forces also are unwise, as are codes of conduct long in place for the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and gravity-bound Air Force. If freedom of action were the topmost U.S. national security objective, we would ditch all of these treaties and codes of conduct. Of course, no responsible political leader or public official would consider doing this. So why should we use this standard to oppose new diplomatic initiatives in space?<br />

<br />
Established and agree-upon rules in space will increase security for all nations. If there are understood acceptable behaviors of satellites it will be easier to identify when nations break such rules. It will also be politically easier to form coalitions to respond to such breaches. It will encourage nations to invest in the peaceful uses of space and to develop spacecraft that are potentially transformational, such as autonomous satellites, but not strategically provocative since they will adhere to responsible behaviors. Rules of the road which prevent dangerous actions will increase space assurance and therefore a nation’s ability to operate in space. In short, rules of the road increase the freedom of action of nations as opposed to limit it. A Code of Conduct would enhance, not restrict, a space-faring nation’s benefits and capabilities in space. It would not preclude prohibited actions – no legal code can prevent illegal acts – but the code would clarify illicit behavior as well as promote good behavior. In the case that a nation or actor breaks such rules, states will have the political and military means to take action. Most space faring nations have residual capabilities that could be ground-tested for anti-satellite missions, and can act as a hedge against unwise choices of other nations. This is in addition to already demonstrated jamming capabilities and an ability to target ground stations with conventional weapons. We live by codes of conduct that govern most walks of life, from traffic codes to penal codes. Most nations, including the United States, also support codes of conduct to ensure the safe operation of military forces on the ground and at sea in addition to codes which support the non-proliferation of missiles and weapons of mass destruction materials. A Code of Conduct for space would not have to be negotiated like a treaty at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, which requires its 66-member body to reach consensus to even begin negotiations. Interested space faring nations can agree to a code on a bilateral or multilateral basis in any combination of countries they choose. Furthermore, these codes can also be at the executive level, not requiring a formal ratification process such as the one required in the United States. Outer space deserves rules of the road and those concerned with the safety and security of satellites should work hard to convince nations of this important goal. International cooperation, scientific achievement, and economic growth all depend on a robust and safe environment in space. As new technologies are developed that increase the capabilities and opportunities of this realm, we would be wise to consider and implement responsible rules for how such technologies should be used.<br />

[ ] Independently – strategic dialogue reduces the risk of miscalculation and secures a cooperative relationship. Even if China says no, initiating the process creates a new political relationship that prevents miscalculation and strengthens deterrence<br />
<br />
Manzo, 2008 - CDI Research Assistant (Vince, “U.S. Policy Brief: The Need for a Strategic Dialogue with China,” 8/28, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:10910:http://www.cdi.org/pdfs/StrategicDialoguePolicy.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/pdfs/StrategicDialoguePolicy.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/pdfs/StrategicDialoguePolicy.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:10910 -->)<br />
<br />
A strategic dialogue between the United States and China is a necessary component of any effort to prevent the scenario described in the previous section. It will also reduce the risks of miscalculation and escalation if the U.S.-Chinese strategic balance does evolve along those lines, or along a different, less-predictable route. Therefore, prudence requires that the United States and China engage in serious discussions about their strategic capabilities now, before relations deteriorate or a crisis situation emerges.<br />
The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union are a useful example. It demonstrates that a sustained dialogue can help rival countries mitigate the inherent risks posed by the convergence of new weapon systems and uncertain bilateral relations. As Aaron Friedberg points out, “What the SALT process can do is help the competing superpowers mark some channels of cooperation in what must for the foreseeable future remain a sea of conflict. These channel markers can serve to restrain the flow of the strategic arms competition,deflecting its path periodically and warning the participants away from especially hazardous waters.”31 Career U.S. Foreign Service Officer Avis Bohlen offers a similar assessment of SALT. After acknowledging that SALT failed to resolve U.S.-Soviet political differences and dampen the arms race, she explains why SALT was still worthwhile:<br />
“[I]t nonetheless produced modest gains in transparency and predictability valued by military planners. Over time, the frontiers of the dialogue expanded, as the Soviets became more open to exchanging data and discussing their strategic systems. To this extent, it made a modest contribution to regulating the arms race, while the institutionalization of the dialogue served to reinforce the reality of deterrence.”32<br />
The United States and China have yet to participate in a similar process, and face a risk of miscalculation and escalation as a result. For instance, Roberts observes that United States and Chinese national security officials lack a shared conceptual framework: “American and Chinese experts do not have the common vocabulary or experience...akin to that which evolved in the U.S.-Soviet/Russian relationship.”33 China experts at NDU’s post-ASAT roundtable discussion made similar comments: “China does not share the U.S.-Soviet experience with arms control, deterrence, mutual satellite reconnaissance, or dealing with incidents at sea. The U.S. military has internalized these norms into its doctrine and operations, but China does not necessarily accept or share them.”34<br />

Diplomacy and Arms Control One important drawback of current U.S. space policy is its explicit rejection of space arms control. The U.S. literally was alone in the UN and elsewhere on space arms control issues, which eroded our international leadership in this area with our allies and allowed Russia and China to credibly mischaracterize our stance as provocative and hostile. The Bush administration was interested in voluntary steps on code of conduct, rules of road, and especially space debris, which was commendable but needed more emphasis than it received. My colleague Michael Krepon has done fine work on the code of conduct issue over the years; I highly recommend it to this Subcommittee and believe it offers a good early opportunity for U.S. diplomatic leadership in space. The space dependence of our military power suggests we could gain from diplomatic attempts to limit space threats, yet we have done little. The choice was never arms control vs. unilateral programmatic and other steps to protect our space assets: we need both approaches, and more. Recall that the Reagan Administration was quite successful in its dual track strategy of combining military programs with arms control, and there is no reason to think such a strategy would not continue to be a useful guide to policy today. While diplomacy and arms control cannot by themselves solve our space security problems, they can help mitigate our risks. Our space arms control allergy should end, and U.S. diplomacy should have a stronger role in the future.<br />

[An essential element of space assurance is the strengthening of existing norms against the flight-testing and deployment of space weapons. Many norms for responsible space-faring nations already exist, including prohibiting the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space under the aforementioned Outer Space Treaty, helping astronauts in distress, registering space objects, accepting liability for damage caused by national endeavors in space, and acknowledging that the exploration and use of outer space should be carried out for the benefit of all countries and humankind. The scope of existing norms needs to be expanded if space assurance is to be reinforced. Traditionally, the forum in which international norms are codified is the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva. This 65-nation body operates by consensus, however, and at best requires many years to reach agreement on treaty texts, which might then be stalled further in the process of ratification, as is now the case with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. This reason is not sufficient to block or reject negotiations in the CD relating to the prevention of space weapons, but it does suggest the wisdom of reinforcing existing norms in quicker ways. The development of a code of conduct establishing agreed “rules of the road” for responsible space-faring nations can expedite international efforts to prevent the weaponization of space. Many codes of conduct already exist in the form of bilateral or multilateral executive agreements. During the Cold War, the United States entered into executive agreements with the Soviet Union to prevent dangerous military practices at sea, on the ground, and in the air. The Bush Administration champions codes of conduct to prevent ballistic missile proliferation and terrorism. A similar approach could reinforce space assurance.<br />

A Code of Conduct for space would also be quite useful in ending the practice of kinetic-kill ASAT tests. If Codes of Conduct relating to missiles and exports make sense for preventing proliferation then surely a Code of Conduct also makes sense for activities in space. After all, troubling activities in space could also prompt proliferation on the ground.<br />

Johnson-Freese makes the case for a comprehensive U.S. space strategy that fosters cooperation with major space powers; this in turn requires moving away from a U.S. military doctrine of space control and reinforcing the peaceful uses of outer space. She acknowledges the possibility that the United States might need space weapons one day but concludes that the case for such weapons is not now compelling. This argument assumes, as Johnson-Freese believes, that China is willing to accept her vision of a cooperative future in space. The one scenario that stands most prominently in the way of this vision is a potential confrontation between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan. Johnson-Freese argues persuasively that national security is not the only driver for China’s space policy; other drivers are economic development and national pride. The United States and Soviet Union managed to carve out a zone of cooperation in space, but this was possible only during upswings in bilateral relations. U.S. space cooperation with China may well be possible under similar circumstances. Johnson-Freese advocates legally binding agreements to manage the security dilemma in space. In the interim, Johnson-Freese does not envision an arms race in space between the United States and China, since Beijing will pursue asymmetric responses to U.S. military plans. Consequently, if the Bush administration’s policies continue unabated, the United States will be ‘‘racing against itself.’’ But Beijing will be ‘‘hedging its bets’’ against the development of space weapons by the Pentagon. Johnson-Freese did not predict ASAT testing as part of this hedging strategy; neither did she rule this out. She resorts to occasional overstatement, as when referring to space weapons as ‘‘bright, shiny objects that the Bush administration seems fixated upon.’’ But overall, her book makes an informed and well-defended case that the Bush administration’s space policies could benefit from course corrections. Mike Moore’s book, Twilight War: The Folly of U.S. Space Dominance, is also written with lay readers in mind. Moore, a former editor of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, writes with clarity and passion against the policy preferences of U.S. ‘‘space warriors.’’ Moore is interested primarily in the military uses of space, a narrower focus than Space as a Strategic Asset, but one that leaves room for many digressions about the history of airpower and U.S. exceptionalism, which he believes is one of the root causes of unwise U.S. military space policy. Some readers may take issue with the extent of these digressions; this reviewer learned from them. Moore doesn’t mince words. His central thesis is that the Bush administration’s space policy is not only ‘‘headed in the wrong direction,’’ but that the pursuit of space dominance is ‘‘a lulu of a mistake,’’ and that the initiation of military strikes in space by the United States ‘‘will guarantee conflict and, possibly, a new cold war.’’ He argues for ‘‘a new and unrelentingly tough space treaty’’ to ensure that no nation could dominate space. Moore contends that such a treaty, ‘‘if it is hardheaded enough’’ and if it is negotiated by ‘‘the most skeptical realists,’’ can be fully verifiable. It must also, in his view, contain ‘‘tough and certain’’ sanctions against violators. To enforce the treaty, he argues that signatories must be ‘‘unfailingly willing’’ to destroy the spaceports of states that violate treaty provisions.<br />

&quot;The problem now, which the U.S. military has said multiple times, is that space is the Wild West,&quot; Weeden told SPACE.com. &quot;Outside of a few existing treaties, it's pretty much do whatever you want.&quot; Part of the solution to that problem comes from setting some rules. The U.S. space strategy throws its weight behind a European Union proposal for a code of conduct in space, which would define responsible behaviors and best practices for space-faring countries. Getting such agreement is also crucial for the encouraging commercial development and innovation in the growing space industry, Weeden pointed out.

Lake 2011 [2/8/11, Washington Times Reporter [Eli, Washington Times, Report calls for restraints in space activity; Critics highlight Pentagon limits, Lexis Nexis, Accessed 7/12/11]<br />
<br />
The Obama administration is working on setting up international rules for space launches and satellite operations that critics say will limit the Pentagon's ability to deploy military systems to protect satellites from space weapons being developed by nations such as China. According to a strategy report produced jointly by U.S. intelligence agencies and the Defense Department, the administration is seeking &quot;responsible&quot; rules for space operations. The National Security Space Strategy (NSSS), made public Friday, states that &quot;the United States will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and norms of behavior for responsible space operations.&quot; &quot;We believe setting pragmatic guidelines for safe activity in space can help avoid collisions and other debris-producing events, reduce radio frequency interference, and promote security and stability in the space domain - all of which are in the interests of all nations,&quot; the 14-page report states. The administration has signaled that it is preparing to accept the European Union's draft Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities with minimal changes to the document. An administration interagency review concluded last month that the code of conduct - aimed at reducing the amount of space debris that could collide into satellites - would not damage U.S. national interests in space or limit research and development into classified programs.<br />

<br />
That's right: Moscow can actually raise the number of its launch/delivery platforms under new START. In other words, the &quot;reduction&quot; in START applies mostly to us . . . * US conventional warheads on ICBMs are counted toward the treaty's nuclear-warhead limit. This would strangle Prompt Global Strike -- a new ICBM armed with a non-nuclear payload that could be used globally on short notice. That sort of quick, reach-out-and-touch-you capability would sure be nice if you knew where Osama bin Laden was going to be in an hour but didn't have any forces nearby. The same is true for other quick-turnaround military scenarios that don't require nukes, such as taking out a WMD-armed ballistic missile ready for launch or vaporizing some counterspace weapons before they strike your satellites.<br />

<br />
Development of responsive space may in turn enable new concepts. We could use a highly responsive and inexpensive space-launch capability to precisely deliver conventional ordnance anywhere in the world (a Prompt Global Strike system). Low-cost spacecraft could enable space systems to provide direct support to the operational and tactical levels of warfare, as envisioned by the Air Force's concept document on joint war-fighting space. (16) Development of quick-response spacecraft capable of augmenting existing capabilities might allow transition to an expeditionary space forces concept whereby we deploy the full system capability only when needed. Counterspace missions will benefit from improvements to small spacecraft and responsive-launch technologies associated with ORS. Ultimately, technologies that improve the responsiveness of new missions and small spacecraft will transform the way we perform traditional space missions.<br />

C. The Impact - PGS kills nonproliferation efforts leading to Taiwanese conflict.<br />

<br />
The PGS capability also raises serious non-proliferation issues. First, it is likely to lead to a new arms race in ballistic missiles and countermeasures as other countries seek to match the US system and/or seek to protect their sovereignty by building weapon systems to counter US capabilities. It seems likely, for example, that other nuclear powers, such as China and Russia, would embark on similar SLBM and ICBM conversion projects. This could in turn ratchet up the potential for major armed conflict in areas, such as the Taiwan Straits, where tensions already run high. Second, PGS clearly undermines ballistic missile non-proliferation efforts, such as the 2002 Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation, which calls for greater restraint in developing, testing, using, and spreading ballistic missiles.22 At the signing of the Code, John Bolton, then US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, affirmed US support for it, but also highlighted a number of qualifying factors and reservations. One such reservation concerning pre-launch notifications was that the United States ‘reserves the right in circumstances of war to launch ballistic missile and space-launch vehicles without prior notification’.23 If the US administration is also asserting its ‘right’ to pre-emptive launch of a PGS capability the Code is as good as dead and buried. Third, it will lower the threshold of use for such weapons. And as Steve Andreason, a former US Nation Security Council staffer has pointed out: “Long-range ballistic missiles have never been used in combat in 50 years”. But once the United States starts indicating that it views these missiles as no different than any other weapon, “other nations will adopt the same logic”, he said.24 4<br />

<br />
At the same time, simply replacing nuclear with conventional offensive capabilities will not by itself lead to greater stability or strategic reassurance, and could if not properly implemented paradoxically lead to the reverse, for several reasons: • Moving from nuclear to conventional strategic capabilities while maintaining identical strategic objectives may lower the threshold for offensive military action. Without the inseparable and significant downsides to strategic nuclear use, choosing a conventional offensive option to dealing with an identified strategic threat may become more attractive and skew the decisionmaking process against other potential options for action. 2 • The external perception of this lowered threshold may alter potential adversaries' judgment of US actions and reactions in directions not favorable to US security and global strategic stability. • Allied perceptions of US commitments to extended deterrence may skew negatively if the judgment is that the United States has not sufficiently accounted for allied security and stability when reducing its reliance on nuclear weapons and moving to emphasize conventional capabilities. In short, while attempts to devalue nuclear weapons in US strategic planning may open the door to significant downgrading of the offensive US nuclear enterprise, persistent challenges to strategic security and stability will remain and perhaps be exacerbated without a parallel reconsideration of the overall national security strategy.<br />

PGS destroys credibility, causes rogue aggression and global insecurity<br />

<br />
The Pentagon’s desire to field a PGS capability marks yet another dangerous precedent in recent US defence policy. As the Bush administration continues in what has been described as its ‘quest for absolute security’, serious questions must be asked not only regarding the feasibility of such a quest, but also as to the toll in terms of real security that projects such as PGS have on the rest of the international community.25 In its pursuit of a unilaterally shaped global security paradigm the present US administration threatens to destroy an international order that ‘has been patiently built up for 50 years’.26 In turn, this not only de-legitimises US power, but also creates in the process a world that is ever more insecure. The complex range of security dilemmas that the international community is faced with requires a multilateral and international law-based response that takes into account the security concerns of the community as a whole. The PGS capability is born of a narrow neo-realist perspective and seeks to buy security at the end of a $500 million missile system. Such an approach will further antagonise US allies and also create a heightened sense of global insecurity. And the more ‘rogue’ elements of the international community will already be preparing their own asymmetric response to this latest proposed big stick in the US arsenal.<br />

In its June 2006 report, Weapons of Terror: Freeing the World of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Arms, the Hans Blix-led Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission recommended, “All states possessing nuclear weapons should commence planning for security without nuclear weapons.” But, while advocating, “preparing for the outlawing of nuclear weapons through joint practical and incremental measures…” the Commission did not directly address what “security without nuclear weapons” means. One rather disquieting view of security without nuclear weapons was offered last year by Robert Einhorn, a Clinton administration nuclear policy expert and arms control advocate. “We should be putting far more effort into developing more effective conventional weapons,” he said. “It’s hard to imagine a president using nuclear weapons under almost any circumstance, but no one doubts our willingness to use conventional weapons.” This statement, unfortunately, is all too true. But an even more overpowering conventional U.S. military threat surely is not the desired outcome of the nuclear disarmament process. Moreover, how practical would that approach be? How would countries with fewer economic resources - especially those on the “enemies” list - respond? Wouldn’t they have an incentive to maintain or acquire nuclear weapons to counter overwhelming U.S. conventional military superiority? And wouldn’t that, in turn, even further entrench U.S. determination to retain and modernize its own nuclear arsenal, thus rendering the goal of nuclear disarmament nearly impossible? This conundrum is one of the biggest challenges we face and it cannot be ignored. To its credit, the Blix Commission ended its report by acknowledging: “The perspective of a world free of WMD must be supplemented by the perspective of a world in which the arsenals of conventional weapons have been reduced drastically.” The Commission concluded: “Tensions between rich and poor societies, the spread of diseases like HIV and avian flu, environmental threats, competition over energy, the functioning of international trade and financial markets, cross-border crime and terrorism, and so forth, will be challenges for all. They will require the development of an international society organized through cooperation and law rather than one controlled by overwhelming military force, including weapons of mass destruction.”<br />

<br />
Utgoff 2 - Deputy Director of Strategy, Forces, and Resources @ the Institute for Defense Analyses (Victor, Survival, “Proliferation, Missile Defense and American Ambitions”, 44:2, Summer, p. 87-90)<br />
<br />
Many readers are probably willing to accept that nuclear proliferation is such a grave threat to world peace that every effort should be made to avoid it. However, every effort has not been made in the past, and we are talking about much more substantial efforts now. For new and substantially more burdensome efforts to be made to slow or stop nuclear proliferation, it needs to be established that the highly proliferated nuclear world that would sooner or later evolve without such efforts is not going to be acceptable. And, for many reasons, it is not. First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous. Proliferating states will feel great pressures to obtain nuclear weapons and delivery systems before any potential opponent does. Those who succeed in outracing an opponent may consider preemptive nuclear war before the opponent becomes capable of nuclear retaliation. Those who lag behind might try to preempt their opponent’s nuclear programme or defeat the opponent using conventional forces. And those who feel threatened but are incapable of building nuclear weapons may still be able to join in this arms race by building other types of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological weapons. Second, as the world approaches complete proliferation, the hazards posed by nuclear weapons today will be magnified many times over. Fifty or more nations capable of launching nuclear weapons means that the risk of nuclear accidents that could cause serious damage not only to their own populations and environments, but those of others, is hugely increased. The chances of such weapons falling into the hands of renegade military units or terrorists is far greater, as is the number of nations carrying out hazardous manufacturing and storage activities. Increased prospects for the occasional nuclear shootout Worse still, in a highly proliferated world there would be more frequent opportunities for the use of nuclear weapons. And more frequent opportunities means shorter expected times between conflicts in which nuclear weapons get used, unless the probability of use at any opportunity is actually zero. To be sure, some theorists on nuclear deterrence appear to think that in any confrontation between two states known to have reliable nuclear capabilities, the probability of nuclear weapons being used is zero.3 These theorists think that such states will be so fearful of escalation to nuclear war that they would always avoid or terminate confrontations between them, short of even conventional war. They believe this to be true even if the two states have different cultures or leaders with very eccentric personalities. History and human nature, however, suggest that they are almost surely wrong. History includes instances in which states known to possess nuclear weapons did engage in direct conventional conflict. China and Russia fought battles along their common border even after both had nuclear weapons. Moreover, logic suggests that if states with nuclear weapons always avoided conflict with one another, surely states without nuclear weapons would avoid conflict with states that had them. Again, history provides counter-examples. Egypt attacked Israel in 1973 even though it saw Israel as a nuclear power at the time. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands and fought Britain’s efforts to take them back, even though Britain had nuclear weapons. Those who claim that two states with reliable nuclear capabilities to devastate each other will not engage in conventional conflict risking nuclear war also assume that any leader from any culture would not choose suicide for his nation. But history provides unhappy examples of states whose leaders were ready to choose suicide for themselves and their fellow citizens. Hitler tried to impose a ‘victory or destruction’ policy on his people as Nazi Germany was going down to defeat.4 And Japan’s war minister, during debates on how to respond to the American atomic bombing, suggested ‘Would it not be wondrous for the whole nation to be destroyed like a beautiful flower?’5 If leaders are willing to engage in conflict with nuclear-armed nations, use of nuclear weapons in any particular instance may not be likely, but its probability would still be dangerously significant. In particular, human nature suggests that the threat of retaliation with nuclear weapons is not a reliable guarantee against a disastrous first use of these weapons. While national leaders and their advisors everywhere are usually talented and experienced people, even their most important decisions cannot be counted on to be the product of well-informed and thorough assessments of all options from all relevant points of view. This is especially so when the stakes are so large as to defy assessment and there are substantial pressures to act quickly, as could be expected in intense and fast-moving crises between nuclear-armed states.6 Instead, like other human beings, national leaders can be seduced by wishful thinking. They can misinterpret the words or actions of opposing leaders. Their advisors may produce answers that they think the leader wants to hear, or coalesce around what they know is an inferior decision because the group urgently needs the confidence or the sharing of responsibility that results from settling on something. Moreover, leaders may not recognise clearly where their personal or party interests diverge from those of their citizens. Under great stress, human beings can lose their ability to think carefully. They can refuse to believe that the worst could really happen, oversimplify the problem at hand, think in terms of simplistic analogies and play hunches. The intuitive rules for how individuals should respond to insults or signs of weakness in an opponent may too readily suggest a rash course of action. Anger, fear, greed, ambition and pride can all lead to bad decisions. The desire for a decisive solution to the problem at hand may lead to an unnecessarily extreme course of action. We can almost hear the kinds of words that could flow from discussions in nuclear crises or war. ‘These people are not willing to die for this interest’. ‘No sane person would actually use such weapons’. ‘Perhaps the opponent will back down if we show him we mean business by demonstrating a willingness to use nuclear weapons’. ‘If I don’t hit them back really hard, I am going to be driven from office, if not killed’. Whether right or wrong, in the stressful atmosphere of a nuclear crisis or war, such words from others, or silently from within, might resonate too readily with a harried leader. Thus, both history and human nature suggest that nuclear deterrence can be expected to fail from time to time, and we are fortunate it has not happened yet. But the threat of nuclear war is not just a matter of a few weapons being used. It could get much worse. Once a conflict reaches the point where nuclear weapons are employed, the stresses felt by the leaderships would rise enormously. These stresses can be expected to further degrade their decision-making. The pressures to force the enemy to stop fighting or to surrender could argue for more forceful and decisive military action, which might be the right thing to do in the circumstances, but maybe not. And the horrors of the carnage already suffered may be seen as justification for visiting the most devastating punishment possible on the enemy.7 Again, history demonstrates how intense conflict can lead the combatants to escalate violence to the maximum possible levels. In the Second World War, early promises not to bomb cities soon gave way to essentially indiscriminate bombing of civilians. The war between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s led to the use of chemical weapons on both sides and exchanges of missiles against each other’s cities. And more recently, violence in the Middle East escalated in a few months from rocks and small arms to heavy weapons on one side, and from police actions to air strikes and armoured attacks on the other. Escalation of violence is also basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchanges of violent acts can escalate to levels unimagined by the participants beforehand.8 Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible.In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible with the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West of the late 1800s.

Responsive space systems delivered to space with responsive launch systems include replacement and augmentation satellites for communication; navigation; and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Launch could support an evolving mission area of force application from or through space with the use of common aero vehicles to carry strike weapons. The US Marine Corps even envisions transporting a Marine reconnaissance platoon from the continental United States (CONUS) to anywhere in the world within hours to conduct missions with special operations forces. Such a system would provide the theater commander unprecedented flexibility and capability to produce desired effects. An analysis of alternatives completed by AFSPC in 2004 concludes that “ORS can provide significant military utility at the campaign level” through the use of responsive space-asset delivery.3 The greatest impact occurs when the enemy has offensive counterspace (OCS) capabilities and the United States uses responsive launch vehicles and satellite systems to maintain on-orbit capabilities. This ability to sustain and supplement on-orbit assets could become particularly critical if potential adversaries can destroy or disable our satellites—reportedly, China has this capability. Force application and OCS missions also provide significant military utility, with the former increasing as a function of theater access.4 The United States has less access to some regions of the world as a result of the decreased forward presence of its forces and globalization of terrorism. Within that operational environment, the analysis of alternatives determined that a hybrid launch vehicle (HLV), a reusable first stage with expendable upper stages, was the most affordable solution to meet mission requirements. A subsequent study, by this author, developed a potential concept of operations for an HLV system which showed that no insurmountable technology challenges existed.5 ORS HLV wings located in the south central and southwestern United States will provide the combatant commander unprecedented strike capabilities without the burden of deployed assets or aerial-refueling resources required for long-range bombers. Inland CONUS basing offers an inherent degree of physical and operational security not available at deployed locations, as was the case with Atlas F intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) at sites in southern and southwestern areas, including rural Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. One cannot overstate the strategic benefits of an ORS system. For example, in the days immediately following the attacks of 11 September 2001, suppose that intelligence assets had pinpointed the location of al-Qaeda leadership in a remote region of Afghanistan outside the range of Tomahawk cruise missiles. Without overflight permission already in place, launching air strikes would have proved politically impossible; however, with a responsive space-lift vehicle, we could have completed attacks within a few days—or hours if a vehicle had been on alert.6 Despite the smaller payload of an HLV compared to that of a B-1, B-2, or B-52, the HLV’s increased kinetic energy and tactical surprise offset that detriment. As the sortie rate increases, the cost-efficiency also increases, providing the Air Force an alternative to the recapitalization of its long-range attack aircraft. The HLV’s flexibility (the reusable first-stage booster is configured with different upper-stage vehicles, depending upon the mission) represents a key feature of the ORS system, enabling a single capital investment to support multiple mission areas. The ORS concept effectively operationalizes the space-support mission, increasing its ability to provide force application (strike from, through, or in space), force enhancement (satellites supporting air, land, sea, and space operations), and offensive as well as defensive counterspace (attaining and maintaining space superiority). Prior to a formal decision to pursue an ORS program, as provided in the US Space Transportation Policy, a number of activities within the Air Force and the Department of Defense (DOD) have sustained the momentum and made progress in establishing the technology basis. DARPA’s Responsive Access, Small Cargo, Affordable Launch (RASCAL) and Force Application and Launch from CONUS (FALCON) programs attempted to identify and develop low-cost, responsive launch concepts. The RASCAL program focused on concepts for launching small vehicles from high-speed, high-altitude aircraft, whereas FALCON concentrated on developing low-cost, expendable launch vehicles that could demonstrate ORS requirements. The DOD canceled RASCAL in February 2005 in order to focus on FALCON, which continues to investigate two distinctively different concepts: a conventional, multiple-stage, ground-launched rocket and a rocket deployed from the back of a C-17 cargo aircraft.7 Under the FALCON program and with funding from the DOD’s Office of Force Transformation, the Space Exploration Corporation (SpaceX) has demonstrated many low-cost and responsiveness attributes of ORS during preparation for the inaugural launch of its Falcon‑1 small launch vehicle.8 FALCON remains important to the future development of the HLV since the expendable rockets developed under the program could be used as upper stages on the reusable booster. The Affordable Responsive Spacelift (ARES) program, the next step towards demonstrating the feasibility of an ORS system, set a goal of developing a subscale launch vehicle that demonstrates the characteristics of the HLV’s reusable first stage. ARES has just begun system-concept studies, but its progress will shape the future of the ORS launch vehicle. The operational responsiveness of an ORS system is not science fiction. Burt Rutan made history in October 2004 when his privately funded SpaceShipOne aerospace plane completed its second suborbital trip into space. Rutan and other start-up companies have demonstrated that it doesn’t take a large, government-funded program to build a launch vehicle. Profit from commercial launch services, including space tourism, serves as their motivation; however, the systems required to enable such a business may use the same systems and technologies needed by the ORS launch vehicle. If these programs can launch operations responsively, development of an Air Force operational capability can proceed with substantially decreased risk. Current trends in the air and space community show why this is possible. First, today’s computer technology allows us to go from idea, to computer, to machine-shop floor, to final part in a fraction of the time it used to take. Second, the recent slump in the world space-launch market, coincident with a period in which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) had no major hardware-development program, has permitted these new companies to hire technical experts who have experience in developing major space systems. This situation, coupled with the rapid increase in affordable computing capabilities and commercial engineering-analysis software, allows relatively few experienced engineers to produce designs that would have required much larger teams only a decade ago. Third, the economic potential of space tourism, combined with the wealth of a few dot-com company entrepreneurs, has opened up innovation and risk taking. DARPA projects encourage this type of innovation with significantly less government oversight than occurs in a typical DOD research and technology project. Building upon this philosophy, an ORS launch-vehicle program will prove successful. A responsive HLV capability will serve as the foundation for ORS, which is critical to the future national security of the United States. A building-block approach now under development will ensure that full-scale operational system development does not proceed until we have mitigated all significant risks; therefore, success of the FALCON and ARES programs is a critical first step. Such a capability will allow the United States to reduce its reliance on forward-deployed forces and will either maintain or decrease response time. Obviously, much work lies ahead, not the least of which is the writing of doctrine to guide the building of organizational structures; strategy; and operational tactics, techniques, and procedures. However, ORS will become another paradigm-shaping event for the Air Force. No: Expectations for an ORS Launch System Are Overly Ambitious and Put the Entire Concept at Risk. The ORS mission-needs statement essentially began as a set of technology-push requirements meant to drive technology to determine the feasibility of such a concept. We have insufficient capability-pull from the war fighter to justify the cost of fielding such a system. Furthermore, unannounced responsive launches from the CONUS would produce a destabilizing effect due to possible confusion with strategic ICBM launches. Admittedly, the United States needs many of the capabilities that an ORS system would purportedly provide, such as responsive replenishment of on-orbit space assets. However, attempting to do so with a single, partially reusable launch vehicle is a mistake. Several times in the past, we have attempted to create one aircraft platform to perform multiple mission roles (e.g., the F-4, F-111, A-12, etc.) with only limited success. Redeveloping an existing platform (e.g., the F-16) to conduct a different role has produced better results. Many ideas concerning responsive launch within the ORS construct have their origins in Air University’s Spacecast 2020 study of 1994, which postulated a military space plane known as Black Horse that not only delivered satellites to orbit but also launched strike weapons.9 When the National Space Policy of 1996 gave NASA responsibility for developing reusable launch vehicles, the Air Force could only participate in NASA’s concept development; it also either monitored or became actively involved in that organization’s DC-X, X-33, X-34, X-37, Integrated System Test of an Air-Breathing Rocket, and other technology and launch-vehicle demonstrator projects.10 Much of the passion for increasing US space-system capabilities originates with the paradigm-changing demonstration of space systems during Operation Desert Storm. The use of space capabilities continued to grow during the 1990s, with a significant increase in the use of precision-guided munitions aided by the global positioning system during Operation Allied Force. During this same time frame, many people within the space community advocated increased space-combat roles. One could almost hear their argument (one they never actually verbalized): “Just give us a strike system, and we’ll win the war from our consoles in Colorado.” Emphasizing their role in Desert Storm, they began to promote breaking away from the Air Force to create their own service—the US Space Force. With regard to competition for budget resources, space advocates became a “space mafia”—the modern equivalent of the legendary “bomber mafia”—arguing that space had yet to receive sufficient resources for its programs. Also during this time—the late 1990s through about 2001—studies supporting AFSPC’s long-term planning and research reports continued to develop the idea of a military space plane. The influence of space-sanctuary advocates, who oppose the militarization of space due to destabilization and proliferation worries, was waning, and the idea of using space for military purposes in a more aggressive manner gained greater acceptance. This period also saw a tremendous surge in commercial launch-vehicle development to support placement of commercial communication satellites in low Earth orbit.11 The launch-vehicle and mission concepts that offered the potential to significantly reduce cost and increase responsiveness, as proposed by private companies, fit nicely within the military space-plane concepts, indicating to the plane’s advocates that they were on the right path. Meanwhile, the Air Force began to become expeditionary, but AFSPC still tended to view its support as global and functionally based.12 However, the nonspace Air Force busily flew missions in Allied Force and Operations Northern Watch, Southern Watch, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom and did not have time to provide requirements for what we now call effects-based capabilities to support ORS development. Built upon that history, the AFRL developed a set of requirements for its space operational vehicle (SOV) concept. These requirements sought to drive technology-development projects—that is, they were so aggressive that only advanced technologies or unproven system concepts could possibly satisfy them. The mission-needs statement, approved for ORS in 2001 by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, has served as the basis for many subsequent launch-vehicle and propulsion-system technology projects. The analysis of alternatives study used requirements derived from this statement, specifying the reduction of launch-vehicle call-up times from months to days and of final preparation and launch from days to hours. The requirements also mention the ability to sustain multiple sorties per day during contingency operations, which might necessitate turnaround of the vehicle for a subsequent mission within hours of landing. From this history of the responsive launch vehicle—whether it’s called a military space plane, an SOV, or an ORS launch vehicle—one sees that the concept has emerged from the expansion of space capabilities through a technology-push program and that it has had inadequate capability-pull from the war-fighter community. Much of the support for a responsive launch concept depends upon obtaining access to space at lower costs. Claims of the low-cost-access-to-space companies in the 1990s, continuing with the more recent and better funded entrepreneurial companies, are accepted almost religiously. These businesses are deceiving themselves and their supporters. Building the first test vehicle might prove relatively straightforward, but seeing such a system through production and operation will not. Such companies can operate inexpensively in the early phases of development because they have no past liability; no large, aging infrastructure to maintain and operate; no large pension and retiree health insurance funds to maintain; and no large bureaucracies to do the little things that have to be done. As a program matures, as such a system must, one will find no substantial cost difference between a system from one of the United States’ traditional launch-vehicle companies and a system from one of the new companies. The goals of low-cost responsive launch are not new. An essay on an online air-and-space-news Web site notes that the goals of the Pegasus and Taurus launch vehicles, developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation, differed little from those of ORS launch.13 In fact, an Atlas F ICBM had more mass capability and better responsiveness than the small launch vehicles under development in DARPA’s FALCON program today. Given the likenesses between the early Atlas vehicles and the SpaceX launch vehicles, one should not be surprised by their similar responsiveness.14 The AFRL has been using technology-push SOV requirements to perform research and technology studies of propulsion systems. Based upon the sortie rate and requirements for turnaround time, these studies have indicated a potential advantage of using liquid oxygen/liquid methane engines, leading many of the lab’s current projects to focus on methane-fueled rocket-engine concepts. Methane has a slight performance advantage over rocket-engine-grade kerosene (RP-1); however, its density (almost 50 percent lower than kerosene) demands a larger vehicle. Moreover, the fact that it must be stored as a cryogenic liquid, at approximately -250° F, means that a methane-fueled vehicle would require more ground operations than one fueled by kerosene. Interestingly, the Soviet Union developed seven liquid oxygen/methane rocket engines for missiles and launch vehicles but never fielded any of them for operational use.15 One can infer that the Soviets concluded that the increased size and operational complexity of the vehicle offset the performance advantage. Hence, one might expect the Air Force to come to the same conclusion, particularly when it develops the next -iteration of responsiveness requirements for an ORS launch vehicle with effects-based operations in mind. Perhaps we won’t need an HLV to support the ORS construct—some other combination of systems may provide a better solution. A recent Air Force futures war game held at Air University included the capabilities of an ORS system and those of near-space balloons. Postgame analysis concluded that ultrahigh-altitude (often referred to as near-space) balloons, coupled with conventional attack aircraft, offer better support to the war fighter than does the responsive launch vehicle.16 Thus, instead of spending a great deal of time and money developing and fielding a system that may not provide the capabilities expected of it, the use of near-space balloons, converted ICBMs, or other inexpensive, expendable launch vehicles might be a better solution. Inclusion of a global strike capability might have a destabilizing effect on world affairs in times of heightened geopolitical tensions. Given an HLV that can deliver either a satellite payload to orbit or a common aero vehicle with a strike weapon to a terrestrial target, a third-party nation might detect the launch and fear a nuclear attack by the United States. Regardless of whether such fears have any foundation, the Cold War forged a paradigm that ICBMs deliver nuclear weapons, and a US adversary or a nation not friendly to the United States could have difficulty distinguishing the launch of an HLV from that of an ICBM with strategic weapons, despite the fact that the trajectories might differ. The world community would have to accept the uncertainty that a reentry vehicle could deliver a conventional precision-guided munition—in essence, we would be asking the world to trust us in a time of hostilities. The political environment in a time of such uncertainty could restrict the operational usefulness of the ORS system’s force-application capability. For example, if we determined that, in response to our planned delivery of a weapon by means of an HLV, a nation with theater or intercontinental nuclear capabilities might increase its readiness posture and thus amplify the risk of a launch on US forces or the United States itself, we would not execute the mission. Advocates of global strike dismiss such concerns, however, arguing that communications with the regional nations would prove sufficient to mitigate the risk. Nevertheless, would such communications affect the responsiveness and strategic surprise of the ORS system? Probably so<br />

In early 2003, AFMC, AFSPC, AFRL, and the Product Center Commanders established an Enterprise Leadership (EL) Long Range Strike (LRS) Task Team (LRS-TT) whose charter is to build roadmaps to describe the integrated development of LRS capabilities/solution options. Task teams uniquely bring together expertise from across enterprises &amp; MAJCOMs to attack horizontal integration issues &amp; produce integrated solutions in response to identified shortfalls. ACC had conducted several studies to research, assess and define LRS options. AFSPC has initiated the Operationally Responsive Space lift (ORS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) as part of the drive towards responsive space capabilities. A Prompt Global Strike (PGS) AoA is planned by AFSPC in FY05/06. USSTRATCOM has a newly defined Global Strike mission to provide Global Strike forces/options as a supporting or supported Combatant Commander. The Air Force needs to develop integrated air and space LRS capabilities to present forces for JTF/CC-directed Global Strike missions. LRS solutions must be developed to address shortfalls in current LRS capability. Operationally responsive space enables rapid access to space and power projection, space superiority, and enhanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.<br />

The worldwide scope of Space Command's project is shown by the names of some of the units under its control: Global Strike, Air and Space Expeditionary, Global Response Task Forces and Global Mobility Task Force. Space Command is also setting up a wing of the intelligence services devoted to the militarisation of space. Space Command says it is &quot;aggressively modernising our existing nuclear forces&quot;. Another goal is the ability to use a &quot;conventional non-nuclear prompt global strike from and through space&quot;. One of the new weapons tipped to bring about this transformation is the CAV, or Common Aero Vehicle. This military spaceplane would be stocked with so-called smart bombs and could strike targets from space. Another exotic development will be &quot;a virtual, global, synthetic battlespace in which space forces will train and rehearse missions&quot;. The US space corps would fight global cyber-battles in a virtual world as big as the earth and its atmosphere. This would complement current Space Command facilities such as the Space Warfare Centre, the Space Battle Lab and the Fusion Centre. The conclusion of the SMP report leaves no doubt of how important these plans are to the US military and government: &quot;Expanding the role of space in future conflicts produces a fully integrated air and space force that is persuasive in peace, decisive in war and pre-eminent in any form of conflict.&quot;<br />

The Aff’s vision of space as a realm to be controlled results in an extension of violence and militaristic domination—This turns the aff by encouraging the very anti-democratic wars they hope to prevent<br />
<br />
MacDonald 07, Fraser MacDonald, Professor of Anthropology, Geography, and Environmental Studies at Melbourne University in Australia, “Anti-Astropolitik – outer space and the orbit of geography,” Progress in Human Geography, 2007, Pages 592-615.<br />
<br />
Two things should now be clear. First, outer space is no longer remote from our everyday lives; it is already profoundly implicated in the ordinary workings of economy and society. Second, the import of space to civilian, commercial and, in particular, military objectives, means there is a great deal at stake in terms of the access to and control over Earth’s orbit. One cannot overstate this last point. The next few years may prove decisive in terms of establishing a regime of space control that will have profound implications for terrestrial geopolitics. It is in this context that I want to briefly introduce the emerging field of astropolitics, defined as ‘the study of the relationship between outer space terrain and technology and the development of political and military policy and strategy’ (Dolman, 2002: 15). It is, in both theory and practice, a geopolitics of outer space. Everett Dolman is one of the pioneers of the ﬁeld. An ex-CIA intelligence analyst who teaches at the US Air Force’s School of Advanced Airpower Fraser MacDonald: Anti-Astropolitik outer space and the orbit of geography 607 Studies , he publishes in journals that are perhaps unfamiliar to critical geographers, like the modestly titled Small Wars and Insurgencies. As what follows is uniformly critical of Dolman’s work, I should say that his Astropolitik: classical geopolitics in the space age (Dolman, 2002) is unquestionably a signiﬁcant book: it has deﬁned a now vibrant field of research and debate. Astropolitik draws together a vast literature on space exploration and space policy, and presents a lucid and accessible introduction to thinking strategically about space. (In the previous section I drew heavily on Dolman’s description of the astropolitical environment.) My critique is not founded on scientiﬁc or technical grounds but on Dolman’s construction of a formal geopolitics designed to advance and legitimate the unilateral military conquest of space by the United States. While Dolman has many admirers among neoconservative colleagues in Washington think-tanks, critical engagements (eg, Moore, 2003; Caracciolo, 2004) have been relatively thin on the ground. Dolman’s work is interesting for our purposes here precisely because he draw’s on geography’s back catalogue of strategic thinkers, most prominently Halford Mackinder, whose ideas gained particular prominence in America in the wake of the Russian Sputnik (Hooson, 2004: 377). But Dolman is not just refashioning classical geopolitics in the new garb of ‘astropolitics’; he goes further and proposes an ‘Astropolitik ’ – ‘ a simple but effective blueprint for space control’ (p. 9) – modelled on Karl Hausofer’s Geopolitik as much as Realpolitik. Showing some discomfort with the impeccably fascist pedigree of this theory, Dolman cautions against the ‘misuse’ of Astropolitik and argues that the term ‘is chosen as a constant reminder of that past, and as a grim warning for the future’ (Dolman, 2002: 3). At the same time, however, his book is basically a manual for achieving space dominance. Projecting Mackinder’s famous thesis on the geographical pivot of history (Mackinder, 1904) onto outer space, Dolman argues that: ‘who controls the Lower Earth Orbit controls near-Earth space. Who controls near-Earth space dominates Terra [Earth]. Who dominates Terra determines the destiny of humankind.’ Dolman sees the quest for space as already having followed classically Mackinderian principles (Dolman, 2002: 87). Like Mackinder before him, Dolman is writing in the service of his empire. ‘Astropolitik like Realpolitik’ he writes, ‘is hardnosed and pragmatic, it is not pretty or uplifting or a joyous sermon for the masses. But neither is it evil. Its benevolence or malevolence become apparent only as it is applied, and by whom’ (Dolman, 2002: 4). Further inspiration is drawn from Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose classic volume The inﬂuence of seapower upon history, has been widely cited by space strategists (Mahan, 1890; Gray, 1996; see also Russell, 2006). Mahan’s discussion of the strategic value of coasts, harbours, well-worn sea paths and chokepoints has its parallel in outer space (see France, 2000). The implication of Mahan’s work, Dolman concludes, is that ‘the United States must be ready and prepared, in Mahanian scrutiny, to commit to the defense and maintenance of these assets, or relinquish them to a state willing and able to do so’ (Dolman, 2002: 37). The primary problem for those advancing Astropolitik is that space is not a lawless frontier. In fact the legal character of space has long been enshrined in the principles of the OST and this has, to some extent, prevented it from being subject to unbridled interstate competition. ‘While it is morally desirable to explore space in common with all peoples’, writes Dolman without conviction, ‘even the thought of doing so makes weary those who have the means’ (Dolman, 2002: 135). Thus, the veneer of transcendent humanism with regard to space gives way to brazen self-interest. Accordingly, Dolman describes the res communist consensus 7 of the OST as ‘a tragedy’ that has removed any legal incentive for the exploitation of space (p. 137). Only a res nullius 8 legal order could construct space as ‘proper objects for which states may compete’ (p. 138). Under the paradigm of res nullius and Astropolitik, the moon and 608 Progress in Human Geography 31(5) other celestial bodies would become potential new territory for states. Here Dolman again parallels Karl Hausofer’s Geopolitik. Just as Hausofer desired a break from the Versailles Treaty (Ó Tuathail, 1996: 45), Dolman wants to see the USA withdraw from the OST, making full speed ahead for the moon (see also Hickman and Dolman, 2002). Non-spacefaring developing countries need not worry about losing out, says Dolman, as they ‘would own no less of the Moon than they do now’ (2002: 140). To his credit, Dolman does give some attention to the divisive social consequences of this concentrated power. Drawing on earlier currents of environmental determinism and on the terrestrial model of Antarctic exploration, he ponders the characteristics of those who will be ﬁrst to colonize space. They will be ‘highly educated, rigorously trained and psychologically screened for mental toughness and decision-making skills, and very physically ﬁ t’; ‘the best and brightest of our pilots, technicians and scientists’; ‘rational, given to scientific analysis and explanation, and obsessed with their professions’ (p. 26). In other words, ‘they are a superior subset of the larger group from which they spring’ (p. 27). As if this picture is not vivid enough, Dolman goes on to say that colonizers of space ‘will be the most capably endowed (or at least the most ruthlessly suitable, as the populating of America and Australia … so aptly illustrate[s])’ (p. 27; my emphasis). ‘Duty and sacriﬁce will be the highest moral ideals’ (p. 27). Society, he continues, must be prepared ‘to make heroes’ of those who undertake the risk of exploration (p. 146). At the same time, ‘the astropolitical society must be prepared to forego expenditures on social programs … to channel funds into the national space program. It must be embued with the national spirit’ (p. 146). Dolman slips from presenting what would be merely a ‘logical’ outworking of Astropolitik to advocating that the United States adopt it as their space strategy. Along the way, he acknowledges the full anti-democratic potential of such concentrated power, detaching the state from its citizenry: the United States can adopt any policy it wishes and the attitudes and reactions of the domestic public and of other states can do little to challenge it. So powerful is the United States that should it accept the harsh Realpolitik doctrine in space that the military services appear to be proposing, and given a proper explanation for employing it, there may in fact be little if any opposition to a fait accompli of total US domination in space. (Dolman, 2002: 156) Although Dolman claims that ‘no attempt will be made to create a convincing argument that the United States has a right to domination in space’, in almost the next sentence he goes on to argue ‘that, in this case, might does make right’, ‘the persuasiveness of the case’ being ‘based on the self-interest of the state and stability of the system’ (2002: 156; my emphasis). Truly, this is Astropolitik: a veneration of the ineluctable logic of power and the permanent rightness of those who wield it. If it sounds chillingly familiar, Dolman hopes to reassure us with his belief that ‘the US form of liberal democracy … is admirable and socially encompassing’ (p. 156) and it is ‘the most benign state that has ever attempted hegemony over the greater part of the world’ (p. 158). His sunny view that the United States is ‘willing to extend legal and political equality to all’ sits awkwardly with the current suspension of the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay as well as in various other ‘spaces of exception’ (see Gregory, 2004; Agamben, 2005).<br />

Conclusion: (bare) life under empire of the future In his Astropolitik Dolman calls upon U.S. defense policy-makers to weaponize orbital space so as to enhance U.S. hegemony over the planet. He does not address the astropolitical issues we have discussed here about what impact a space-based hegemony would have on the structure of the international system. Dolman, however, is confident that America would be responsible in using this awesome power to promote democracy and global capitalism. Setting aside the very contentious issues of whether or not America should be involved in &quot;promoting&quot; democracy and capitalism and whether or not current U.S. hegemony has been beneficial for the Earth's population, the moral and political implications of a space-based empire are not nearly as clear-cut as Dolman makes them out to be. One of the fundamental principles of classical geopolitics was that sea-based empires (such as Athens, Britain, and America) tended to be more democratic than land-based empires (such as Sparta, China, and Rome). The reason for this is that sea-based empires needed to disperse their forces away from the imperial center to exert control, whereas land-based empires exercised power through occupation. Military occupations made it increasingly likely that the army would seize power whenever it came into conflict with the government. Classical geopolitical theorist Otto Hintze argued that land powers tended toward dictatorships (Hintze 1975; see also Deudney 2007). Dolman builds upon these classical geopolitical insights by arguing that because space-based empires would not be able to occupy states, military coups would be less likely and democracy would be more likely (Dolman 2002a: 29). There is, however, a significant difference between space power and sea power. While neither is capable of occupying territory on its own, space power is capable of controlling territory from above through surveillance and precise projection of force control without occupation. While space power may not result in the dictatorships normally associated with land power, it would be a useful tool is establishing a disciplinary society over all the Earth. A second obstacle to the benevolent space-based empire that Dolman imagines is the lack of counterbalancing powers. Under the two other modes of protection/security we have considered here -the real-statist and the federal-republican there are checks that prevent even the most powerful scates in the system from dominating all the other units. In real-statism, the sovereignty of states means that any potential hegemon would have to pay a significant cost in blood and treasure to conquer other states. While this cost may not be enough to dissuade a superpower from conquering one or two states, the cumulative cost of conquest and occupation makes total domination over the Earth unlikely. In the federal-republican model, the collective security regime of the entire system should act as a sufficient deterrent to prevent one state from dominating the others. Conversely, in a space-based empire the entire world is placed under direct surveillance from above. There is no point on Earth where the imperial center cannot project force on very short notice. So long as the space-based empire can deny access to space to rival powers through missile defense and anti-satellite technologies, there is no possibility that other states can directly counteract this force. As such, the space-based empire erases all boundaries and places the Earth under its control. While the possibility to resist such an empire will exist, the dynamics of resistance will be considerably altered. Traditional insurgencies rely on physical occupation of territory by the conquering forces to provide targets of opportunity to the resistance. Because space weapons would orbit several hundred to several thousands of miles above the Earth, they would not be vulnerable to attack by anything except weapons systems possessed by the most advanced space powers, such as ballistic missiles and advanced laser systems. Even such counter-measures, however, would only raise the financial cost of space-based empire, not the COSt in human lives that insurgencies rely upon to diminish domestic support ti)f imperial occupations. Consequently a space-based empire would be freer to dominate the Earth from above than a traditional land-power occupation would be. Without obvious counterpowers or effective means of resistance, the space-based empire would be able to exercise complete bio-political control over the entire planet, turning all of Earth's inhabitants into &quot;bare life,&quot; Under such a political arrangement the likelihood that the imperial center would be a benevolent one, uncorrupted by its total domination of the Earth, is very slim indeed.<br />

Grondin, 06 David Grondin Assistant Professor, School of Political Studies, University of Ottawa (as of July 2006) Paper presented at the ISA Convention, San Diego March 25, 2006 Panel “Reading Outer Space I: The International Politics of Outer Space - Approaches and Themes” THE (POWER) POLITICS OF SPACE: THE US ASTROPOLITICAL DISCOURSE OF GLOBAL DOMINANCE IN THE WAR ON TERROR<br />
<br />
Indeed, we have no way of knowing how other state leaders and non-state agents will react to US spatial policy and to a path of weaponization. The security dilemma or a new global arms race in space remain social constructions and are not automatic responses to a course of action taken by the US state. Will it be like Roger Handberg fears: that the “[w]eaponization of space is the signal for the next arms race, one that may start slow but inevitably will speed up as other states reject the US claim to permanent dominance?” (Handberg 2004: 88) Indeed, Handberg makes lots of sense to me when he asserts that a healthy skepticism must be exercised when drastic changes in existing policy positions are considered, especially policies which have not yet failed. Too often, in American defense debates, technology trumps ‘mere politics’ with often-unanticipated consequences. The security dilemma is not just an obscure academic concept but one that reflects real possibilities in terms of outcomes. […] There is an irony in that the analyses assume, especially since the advent of the George W. Bush administration, that such military space activities, including weaponization, will be approved. Approval may come but resources may not, given the administration’s penchant for tax cuts. Sustaining a level of resource commitment necessary to maintain the force levels assumed here is questionable in the absence of an explicit and very visible threat (Handberg 2004: 88). Or will it rather be like the space warriors expect, Dolman and Lambakis especially, that there is an opportunity to be grasped by the US that will make other actors of the global arena accept an American dominance in space? In my mind, such view is to be resisted at all costs. In fact, one must be aware that behind all the rhetoric for space weaponization and the “threat game”, other power considerations still pull much weight – and the spectre of a Cold War military-industrial complex is still very much alive. As Lambakis bluntly puts it: “Although it still must guard against the transfer of critical military technologies, capitalism ought to be set loose to advance the development of satellite technologies and services (including imagery services), which would allow US industry to play its strength – technological innovation and application – which in turn would provide the United States significant technologies advantages in the years ahead” (Lambakis 2001: 281; original emphasis). Freedom of Space, Space control, and the Technological As space is conceived as a common medium, the principle of the freedom of space lasts as long as there is no will to take a step further – which is what space warriors recommend. As they acknowledge, many reasons may motivate a state to develop “capabilities to control, if not dominate or claim ownership over, space orbits” (Lambakis 2001: 86; original emphasis). This line of argument is usually linked to technological capacities. By asserting that other countries operate in Space, that conflicts are “natural” between humans – which brings the obvious “so why would it be different in Space” – technologies of power take the lead and one is left with devising what space-control strategy will be best and what one wants “to control, for how long, and for what purposes?/ (Lambakis 2001: 281). And in a context where one portrays the situation as one where US aerospace industry is held back by the rest of the world only for fear of potential not guaranteed conflicts that will evolve into Space warfighting because of a renewed arms race (Lambakis 2001: 282), the claim to let technology drive the policy and the political is not disinterested – albeit ill-advised – and definitely not a sure bet. For space warriors such as Dolmnan and Lambakis, space weaponization then appears not to be all related to the security issue but also very much to the maintenance of a strong defense and aerospace industry. The technological takes over as the political is eclipsed by the military professionals. In effect, for space warriors, because of national security, “if a determination is made that space weapons would improve national security, further analysis would be required to map out a path to take to introduce these tools in the arsenal and military strategy and a time line from which to plan” (Lambakis 2001: 282). Contrary to US astropolitical analysts, I find myself at fault with the logic of national security and securitization of space that drives US governmentality, especially with regard to Outer Space. I do not believe that arms control is given a fair trial by its opponents or even by some of its main defenders in US astropolitical discourse. For me, the security game is what seems so scary; and if we consider the one assumption of an astropolitical argument such as that of Lambakis that because of the 9/11 context, “one thing is certain – we will not be able to bludgeon our enemies into cooperation. For those times, the United States needs to have in place more assertive means and doctrines to counter hostiles activities in space” (Lambakis 2001: 282; my emphasis). When people are certain and need enemies to develop one strategy, then maybe some questions have not been raised. There are “unknowns” and we cannot be sure of how the events will unfold if the US goes further along a path to space weaponization. In any case, it gets even more problematic when security is trumped with technology for there is no way – so it seems – to argue against the desire of global (read absolute) security, especially when it comes from the strongest of power. You are brought back to the realities of the global homeland security state. One is doomed to either accept the logic of terror – that inexorably goes with the logic of global security – or reject it. I choose the latter. CONCLUSION: THE SECURITIZATION AND AMERICANIZATION OF SPACE This paper allowed me to address how the frontiers of the US are redefined by the War on Terror as it relates to the US strategic thinking on Outer Space. What conditions of possibility does 9/11 bring for US astropolitical discourse that were not already there? This inquiry leads me directly to reconsider the securitization and reterritorialization project of the “last frontier”, that is the attempt to secure Outer Space as an American space. It is important to rethink the push for space weaponization and its politics in light of the context of the US Global War on Terror (GWOT), which produced a new security thinking towards the “homeland” – a homeland strategy of security, a military doctrine of pre- emption/prevention and a reterritorialization of American frontiers and global power. Outer Space concerns, apparently, “the outer frontiers of national security policy, where technology and grand strategy meet” (Krepon 2003). Within the context of the War on Terror, where US strategic discourse sees a global terrorist threat as being ever possible, it seems that there can be no exception for Space. It is even done preventively as a secured space while Others do not exist yet in Space (in fact, they do, with the International Space Station; but that’s another story…). In this spatial inscription of securitization of the American identity in Space, the frontiers of the homeland are made global and are secured through a representation of dangers (with the exception of debris in Space which they do not categorize as “dangers”). This familiar approach to territory and space is inscribed in the identity politics of the US, a moral practice based on spatial exclusion of Others deemed threatening to secure the American Self (Campbell 1998 [1992]; Shapiro 1999). By focusing on the Rumsfeld 2001 Space Commission for the Management of Space in the national security strategy, one sees the application of the same reading that would later come with the War on Terror. To that effect, a terrorist group or rogue state might try to hinder US spatial assets or those of its allies on which the US depends militarily and economically. In its 2004 National Military Stragegy, the US thus reaffirmed with force its will to constitute a global information grid and achieve a full spectrum-dominance in military matters. The US therefore wants to prevent any threat in Outer Space and protect its spatial activities and that of its allies. Informed by the events of 9/11, space warriors, such as Dolman or Lambakis, criticize opponents of a US policy for space weaponization as being stuck in a Cold War mindset. They believe a strategy of pre-emption and a resolve not to wait for the next “Pearl Harbor”, whether in space, on Earth or in the cyberspace is necessary and that the US must really be prepared to defend its (global) homeland: “How else can one explain [a] statement [such as] ‘as long as we remain vulnerable and so accessible to our adversaries, their incentives to attack us in space are likely to remain quite low’? In the post-September 11 world, events have underscored that weakness entices those who would do us harms and vulnerability provokes those who hate us. We need fresh thinking” (Lambakis 2003: 118). Space was seen as a sanctuary during the Cold War. But because of the context of the War on Terror, the US now seems to be ready to go against the second Article of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 that stipulates that “Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, orby any other means”, the treaty which set out the principle that Space is to be used for “the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind” (Article 1). In effect, since 2001, the US wished to be the one responsible for setting new rules in Outer Space and for creating the conditions of its military dominance of Space. For instance, the merger of the US Space Command with the Strategic Command in January 2004 stems from this logic that wishes Space operations to be integrated in all domains of US military power. Because the US still possesses control over much of the information gathering in Space, it is interested in securitizing and Americanizing the “last frontier”, especially in the context of the War on Terror. As it stands, the US neoliberal geopolitics discourse of the Bush Administration on Space power still leads to Space weaponization. US sovereignty is placed as higher than any other forms of rule and the US prepares itself militarily, just in case Outer Space would turn into a battlefield. In Donald Rumsfeld’s words: “Our goal is not to bring war into space, but rather to defend against those who would” (Rumsfeld, quoted in Waldrop 2005 [2002]: 39). This participates in the discourse of a global security state that sees Outer Space as the most “global” of space. “Insofar as the weaponization of space represents the ‘cutting edge’ and highest ambitions of military primacy, it also represents the height of this folly” (Huntley 2005: 83). If we consider that political rhetoric creates political reality that may serve as bases for decisions, it appears fundamental to assess how the US wishes to securitize Outer Space with its will to achieve full-spectrum dominance in all battlespaces, as stated in the 2004 and 1997 National Military Strategies. Deeply anchored in the War on Terror cartography, where 9/11 serves as the ultimate justification since “one must prepare militarily for the worst since the worst has happened” (or so it goes), the US places itself in a state of insecurity by saying that even if no one may inflict them casualty in Space, nothing can guarantee that it will not happen in the future. This is why they prefer to try this likelihood and securitize Outer Space as part of the homeland security strategy. The paradox of the securitization and Americanization of Outer Space is that it could lead to its very opposite by allowing space weaponization to still be possible, if not inevitable.<br />

<br />
Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns. This background is essential for appreciating how the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails. The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3 To some degree, a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, new budget realities and unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds. The 2011 National Security Space Strategy, released February 4, is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation and greater attention to space policy in general. • The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and norms of behavior for responsible space operations.” [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements in the longer-term. • The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right. • The strategy commits to reforming export controls. “ The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps as striking as the prevalence of such passages, however, is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand the kind of independent space-based military capabilities that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. These policy movements toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 In sum, the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also, and more importantly, a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details.<br />

Although a less likely occurrence than interference with satellite ground stations or communications links, direct interference of satellites by conventional, nuclear, or directed energy weapons is much more difficult to defend against. In this case, the primary source of protection for satellites stems from the difficulties associated with launching an attack of conventional weapons into and through the space environment to specific locations. It is worth noting that, despite recent incidents involving ASATs impacting a country’s own spacecraft, no hostile attacks on an adversary’s satellite have been documented to date. The distinct nature of the space environment itself may provide a certain level of protection for space assets. For example, energy weapons must overcome atmospheric challenges and be effectively targeted at satellites, which orbit at great distances and move at very high speeds. Also, the distances and speeds involved in satellite engagements can be exploited to enhance protection. Satellites in lower-altitude orbits are more difficult to detect with spacebased infrared sensors because of their proximity to the Earth’s atmosphere. The fact that Low Earth Orbit (LEO) can be reached in a matter of minutes, while Geostationary Orbit (GEO) takes about a half-day to reach by completing a Hohmann transfer orbit, illustrates the unique protection of dynamics associated with different orbits.30 Lower orbits are also less predictable because of greater atmospheric effects, such as fluctuations in density in the upper atmosphere, which alter satellite drag. For example, at an altitude of about 800 km, the predictability of orbits is limited to an error of approximately one kilometer one day in advance of the calculation, using readily available models. Higher operational orbits also raise the power demands for terrestrial radars, leaving only optical systems capable of tracking satellites in altitudes beyond 5,000 km. Some military systems are being placed into higher orbits such as Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) or GEO, but orbits are largely dictated by function. Surface finishes and designs optimized for heat dissipation and radar absorption can also reduce the signatures of a satellite and the ability to observe it, further complicating negation targeting efforts, as in the US stealth satellite program Misty (cancelled in 2007).31<br />

3. Turn – Small Satellites undermine space capabilities – power and communication limitations<br />

<br />
Small satellites do suffer from some disadvantages. A primary disadvantage is that their smaller size limits their ability to generate power. There is simply less volume in which to place batteries for power storage, and less surface area to employ solar panels for power conversion. This means they are less capable of accommodating design demands such as redundant systems, fine pointing requirements, onboard processing, and multiple payloads. The restrictions on power also limit their communications data rates and subsequently their missions. It is a major reason why small satellites are well suited for simple mission tasking. However, there are singular missions that small satellites cannot currently accomplish as well as larger satellites. Imaging is a mission that is severely hindered by the satellite’s small size. These small satellites have limits to the size of the payloads that can be placed on them. For example, the size of the imaging aperture that can be placed on a small satellite is smaller than what could fit on a larger satellite, and subsequently limits the obtainable resolution. Another aspect that is tied to the satellite’s power limitations is the orbit the satellite is placed in. With minimal capability to generate power, signals transmitted to and from the satellites are limited in their range. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is the primary orbit for small satellites due to this limitation. LEO has its own list of advantages, such as minimal range, and disadvantages, such as shortened lifetimes as compared with higher orbiting middle earth and geostationary/geosynchronous orbits. These advantages and disadvantages inherently belong to the satellites that reside there. As summarized by the Chairman and Director of SSTL, small satellite manufactures balance these advantages and disadvantages following the general principle of the 80/20 rule, 80% of the performance for 20% of the price [4][7].<br />

4. No solvency – they don’t solve for Cyber Attacks<br />

<br />
Are we prepared for GPS-jammed operations? Twenty or 30 years ago, we were primarily worried about anti-satellite weapons as the major threat. Now, we still have to worry about ASAT [anti-satellite] weapons], but we also have to worry about cyberattacks [and] jamming. And we have to worry that these weapons might have proliferated beyond the Soviet Union. So part of the strategy, and the programs that follow from it, is to address exactly those kinds of threats and to ensure that we can continue to operate and leverage our space capabilities to make sure, for example, GPS jamming doesn't disable the great benefits we get militarily from space. Last year at the National Space Symposium, you said our space assets are more vulnerable than ever. Do you feel that there needs to be some sort of cohesive effort to focus on this problem? The first indication of [increased] focus is that we developed this strategy—the first space strategy the department's developed. The second indication is that we've named the secretary of the Air Force as the executive agent for space, and he chairs the Defense Space Council, which pulls together all of our space efforts and establishes a coherent approach across all the agencies and organizations that contribute to space.<br />

ORS has been defined broadly by the Department of Defense as “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of Joint Force Commanders’ needs . . . while also maintaining the ability to address other users’ needs for improving the responsiveness of space capabilities to meet national security requirements” (Department of Defense, 2007). The purpose of ORS is to reduce the time lag associated with space system acquisition to allow the national space architecture to keep pace with changing missions, environments, and technologies. The fundamental idea is to trade off the reliability and performance achieved by satellites under the “Big Space” paradigm (the currently accepted way of conceptualizing, and operating space systems) for the speed, responsiveness, and customization which may be achieved by architectures that incorporate elements such as small, modular spacecraft (Government Accounting Office, 2006, 2008).<br />

6. Turn – Chinese Militarization – plan makes it impossible to criticize China’s tests and causes massive backlash at US unilateralism<br />
<br />
Milowicki 2008 United States Naval War College [with Freese Strategic Choices: Examining the United States Military Response to the Chinese ASAT Test, Astropolitics, Volume 6, Issue 1 January 2008 JSTOR]<br />
<br />
Current U.S. space and counterspace policy and doctrine makes it difficult for the U.S., particularly the military, to protest very loudly regarding China's test. The U.S. has been developing and has been in possession of ASAT technology for over 45 years. Furthermore, other dual-use “defensive” systems such as the Airborne Laser and National Missile Defense systems can easily be applied to the offensive ASAT task. China and the rest of the world are keenly aware of this. In fact, it is a much easier physics problem to target and destroy a single orbiting satellite in a fixed path than it is to engage a ballistic missile with its many multiple independently targeted reentry vehicle (MIRV) warheads. Also, it is unlikely other countries have forgotten that the most aggressive and spectacular ASAT test in history was executed in the Cold War and involved the detonation of a 1.4 megaton thermonuclear warhead in LEO above the Pacific Ocean. This event, known as Starfish Prime, took place on 9 July 1962. The resulting electromagnetic pulse took out six U.S. and foreign satellites (i.e., about one third of the world's LEO total at the time) and knocked out over 300 streetlights on the island of Oahu in Hawaii while producing an eerie artificial glow in the sky for 20 minutes for the entire world to see.31 If comparing immediate negative impact due to the 10% increase in overall known debris created by the Chinese test, the January 2007 ASAT event can be viewed as relatively minor. It should also be noted that at the time of the Starfish Prime test, the knowledge base regarding potential debris created from ASAT tests was far less than it is now. With the most assets to be negatively impacted by debris, the U.S. has good reason to be attentive now that the issues are known. In the case of the Chinese test, it appears increasing likely that Chinese space debris experts were not consulted prior to the test, and that debris estimates generated by test supporters in the military likely downplayed whatever debris information was provided to politicians. This supports the view that the test was a “chest-thumping” exercise by the PLA and hardliners in China. The U.S. defense establishment's reaction to the ASAT test is guided and constrained by the National Space Policy of 2006 and the military doctrine that proceeds from it. Specifically, under paragraph 2 of the National Space Policy, one of the principles (cited below) clearly gives the military a mandate to react as it currently has to bolster both its defensive and offensive counterspace capabilities. Two underlying principles of the policy that are typically cited as unilateral and jingoistic by critics read as follows:32 The United States considers space capabilities—including the ground and space segments and supporting links—vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so; take those actions necessary to protect its space capabilities; respond to interference; and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests. The United States will oppose the development of new legal regimes or other restrictions that seek to prohibit or limit U.S. access to or use of space. Proposed arms control agreements or restrictions must not impair the rights of the United States to conduct research, development, testing, and operations or other activities in space for U.S. national interests.33 While the principle of preserving its rights, capabilities and freedom of action in space is absolutely reasonable for the U.S. to claim, the language of the principle makes it unclear if other countries are expected to be able to claim similar rights or if they accrue only to the U.S. If the latter, it is not reasonable to expect that other countries will forego the same rights claimed by the U.S. Regarding the second principle, rejecting arms control, this language makes public what has been U.S. government policy since the Space Commission Report first questioned whether space arms control was in the interest of the U.S. Given that the rest of the world regularly votes in support of resolutions toward preventing an arms race in space through the United Nations (UN), with the U.S. standing alone against those resolutions, this principle becomes perceived as another example of the U.S. ignoring the perspectives of other countries in favor of a unilateralist approach—not necessarily an effective approach if the U.S. is trying to get the rest of the world to accept it as a benevolent hegemon in space. Intentionally or not, this bellicose and overtly unilateral section of the document has effectively tied the hands of the U.S. military establishment in diplomatically or politically responding to actions too negatively. Perhaps, in order to provide more options, the policy should be revisited in light of geopolitical realities. With only a few changes, the U.S. could alter its course and establish the U.S. as a constructive player in the international community rather than as a perceived “bad actor” bent on preemptive and hegemonic use of space for its own purposes;34 a perception that possibly prompts or, at a minimum, provides an excuse for bad actions on the part of other countries. Theresa Hitchens' observation in her Congressional Testimony of 23 May 2007 captures the situation. She states, “if nothing else, U.S. declaratory policy gives Beijing an excuse to pursue a similar course. China's actions—despite its public dedication to the non-weaponization of space—make it abundantly clear that U.S. space dominance strategy will not go unchallenged.”35<br />

7. Turn – ORS forces dependence on outdated technology because it requires prepositioned replacements<br />
<br />
Rendleman, 2010 - Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
Whether the DOD will decide to develop any small satellites to perform reconnaissance, communications, warning, weather, or other missions and then store them for launch on short notice is, at best, uncertain. Appropriators in the Congress would probably view with suspicion a long-term storage strategy for satellites deployed only as part of some sort of reconstitution strategy. That is, they would not support storage of satellites ‘‘in the barn’’ or on-orbit unless the move was part of a viable and cost-effective sustainment strategy. This is not to say long-term storage cannot be used as part of a large constellation storage and sustainment strategy. Such a strategy could provide unique opportunities to upgrade, repair, or replace specific capabilities before it is too late do so upon launch of the spacecraft. The DOD already employs a replenishment launch campaign strategy to sustain its GPS precision navigation and timing system, and that system’s acquisition and sustainment approaches, while a bit imperfect, could be adopted at a minimum. Still, long-term storage of satellites could present a vexing dilemma—launching relatively old, outdated, and marginally useful systems if the storage continues too long. Taking a satellite that was designed 20 or 30 years ago, and built five to 10 years ago, and keeping it in storage does not appear to support a winning space strategy.<br />

<br />
A sampling of these writings reveals one thing: there is not a simple, clear and consistent definition of what constitutes ORS. Analysis of ORS elements Disparate Definitions The OFT began the current ORS initiative as a better means to develop tactically oriented satellites and rapidly get them to orbit. VADM Cebrowski wanted to create a “new business model” that focused on operational demand. Smaller, less costly spacecraft would be emphasized that tolerated greater reliability risk than traditional national security satellites due to overall system cost.2 This definition broadened as ORS transitioned from just a technology demonstration program to an operational concept involving Combatant Commands, the services, Congress, and the acquisition, and science and technology communities. These different constituent groups have various viewpoints on what ORS really means. Congress sees the program as a way to contain space systems costs while supporting the deployed warfighter. The Combatant Commands see the program as a means to satisfy urgent warfighter support requirements. The Science and Technology community views ORS as a test bed to develop new spacecraft technologies, payloads, and launcher capabilities in order to provide space services to the military forces. The acquisition community sees ORS as a means to complement established space systems support to tactical forces. Industry, in particular smaller companies, envisions ORS as a new market opportunity.3 Appendix B presents additional definitions from ORS stakeholders. According to Brian Green, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Forces Policy, the lack of a commonly accepted ORS definition has contributed to the difficulty of coordinating various aspects of the initiative within the DOD.4 Compounding the problem, space leaders have included other ancillary elements in their own ORS definitions. Lieutenant General Frank Koltz, AFSPC Vice Commander, included near-space5 as one of the four ORS components in a speech at a 2006 conference. The other elements were responsive satellites, spacelift, and launch ranges. A year later, AFSPC Commander Kevin Chilton ORS had three missions: 1. Augmenting surveillance and reconnaissance systems in response to combatant commander’s needs 2. Replacing space assets that have been disabled by attack or natural phenomenon 3. Enhancing space situational awareness6<br />

9. SSA Fails – poor technology, worker shortage and DOD overload<br />
<br />
Chaplain 2011 - Director Acquisition and Sourcing Management for GAO (Christina,, United States Government Accountability Office, May 2011. SPACE ACQUISITIONS Development and Oversight Challenges in Delivering Improved Space Situational Awareness Capabilities)<br />
<br />
DOD plans to deliver new technologies in the upcoming years, but it is too early to determine if these additions will address shortfalls. A number of challenges present roadblocks: immature technologies, program staffing and skill shortages, complex integration tasks, coordinating data from numerous sources and overloading DOD’s current space object tracking system with data from new sensor systems could threaten success of the current development. DOD says it plans to spend a total of $5.3 billion on space awareness projects from 2006 through 2015, but it has already spent almost $2 billion and plans to spend an additional $3.3 billion. The majority of investments will fund new sensors and a new command and control system.<br />

<br />
A responsive HLV capability will serve as the foundation for ORS, which is critical to the future national security of the United States. A building-block approach now under development will ensure that full-scale operational system development does not proceed until we have mitigated all significant risks; therefore, success of the FALCON and ARES programs is a critical first step. Such a capability will allow the United States to reduce its reliance on forward-deployed forces and will either maintain or decrease response time. Obviously, much work lies ahead, not the least of which is the writing of doctrine to guide the building of organizational structures; strategy; and operational tactics, techniques, and procedures. However, ORS will become another paradigm-shaping event for the Air Force.<br />

The launch of FalconSat-2 in early 2006 instead became the Falcon 1′s maiden flight, and following its failure, and the failure of a demonstration launch the next year, TacSat-1 was declared obsolete and its launch cancelled. Despite reports that it was to have been refurbished and launched in 2009 as TacSat-1A, it never flew. TacSat-2 was the first TacSat to fly. It was launched by a Minotaur I from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) in December 2006. Eleven imagery and technology demonstration payloads were carried aboard the satellite, with the primary instrument being the Earth Surface Imager, or ESI. The mission was officially considered a success, however a reported dispute between the US Navy and National Reconnaissance Office allegedly prevented some of the sensors from being tested for several months, and it remains unclear if they were ever activated. The satellite ceased operations in January 2008, and decayed from orbit on 5 February 2011. TacSat-3 was launched in May 2009, also on a Minotaur I from MARS. The first spacecraft to be operated under the Operationally Responsive Space Office, it carries a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) payload; the Advanced Responsive Tactically Effective Military Imaging Spectrometer or Artemis. the experimental phase of its mission, TacSat-3 was brought into service with US Space Command, reportedly as it was able to detect underground tunnels and roadside bombs. TacSat-4, which is currently scheduled to launch on a Minotaur IV in October, will be used for communications experiments. The United Kingdom has also developed operationally responsive satellites, with the TopSat spacecraft having been launched in October 2005, a year before TacSat-2. TopSat was also used for tests conducted by the United States as part of the TacSat programme, into the distribution of imagery to troops via the internet, and within 90 minutes of the images being produced. The United States military named the satellite TacSat-0 whilst it was being used for these tests. In addition to the TacSat series, the Operationally Responsive Space office was also to have operated the Trailblazer satellite, which was lost in a launch failure in August 2008. The primary payload for the third Falcon 1 launch, which was originally to have carried TacSat-1, Trailblazer was selected for launch in May 2008, at the time less than a month before the scheduled launch date, as part of the Jumpstart programme. During launch, residual thrust in the first stage engine led to recontact between the first and second stages, and the rocket subsequently failed to achieve orbit.<br />

Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed government contracts to companies that comply.<br />

12. Turn – Satellite Hardening undermines Redundancy – cost and weight trade offs<br />

<br />
Risk Mitigation Through Hardening Hardening involves making existing assets more difficult to attack and damage. Hardening makes space programs more expensive, something that could be difficult in a period of fiscal restraint, and policymakers will need to weigh the tradeoffs between hardening existing military space assets and building redundancy with commercial space services. There are also limits to the hardening of spacecraft. Given the weight limitations faced when putting a satellite into orbit, every pound devoted to hardening is a pound lost to mission capability. Armoring spacecraft, for example, is out of the question.<br />

13. Turn – Chinese Nuclear Deterrent - US Domination of space threatens China’s Nuclear Deterrent because it is perceived as BMD – this drives the arms race<br />
<br />
Zhang 2011 - Director of the Center for Asia Pacific Studies at Lingnan University [Baohui The Security Dilemma in the U.S.-China Military Space Relationship The Prospects for Arms Control ASIAN SURVEY 51:2 JSTOR Accessed July 12]<br />
<br />
The second factor adding to the security dilemma in the U.S.-China military space relationship involves U.S. efforts to rewrite the established rule of nuclear deterrence, i.e., mutually assured destruction (MAD), that prevailed during the Cold War era. According to Glasner and Fetter, the U.S. has been pursuing a new deterrence posture that combines offensive and defensive capabilities.25 Chinese strategists believe that the U.S. military space program, to a significant extent, is driven by missile defense. For example, in a study organized by the General Staff of the PLA, Major General Xu Hezhen charges that the U.S. is developing space-based laser weapons for missile defense. According to him, “A total of 14–24 satellites deployed on different orbits will constitute a defensive system. Relying on data from early warning systems, it can intercept ballistic missiles launched from anywhere in the world.”26 In another study, Major General Ling Yongshun argues that the U.S. is implementing a coherent plan to neutralize other countries’ strategic deterrence through the deployment of space-based missile defense. As he observes: Using space weapons to attack ballistic targets is a major goal of space weapon development. The U.S. believes that others’ ballistic missiles pose significant threats to its security. To be immune from this threat, the U.S. is putting major efforts into ballistic missile defense, with space-based weapons being one of the important intercepting platforms.27 In October 2008, the U.S. Congress approved $5 million for an independent study of possible space-based missile defense. This move gravely alarmed the Chinese military, which believed that the deployment of space-based missile defense could become inevitable. In fact, some PLA experts have claimed that “Star Wars has come back.”28 Li Daguang even charged that this decision by the U.S. Congress amounted to “declaring a new Cold War against China.”29 Chinese military strategists believe U.S. missile defense poses a real threat to China’s nuclear deterrent. Until recently, the Chinese military tended to believe that U.S. missile defense could not effectively deter a major nuclear power like China or Russia. It was thought that a range of countermeasures, such as deploying decoys and multiple warheads, could be employed to deceive and overwhelm U.S. missile defense. Now, however, with the maturing of a multilayered missile defense system by the U.S. and its allies, Chinese nuclear experts are losing confidence in China’s offensive capabilities. This pessimism was illustrated in a 2008 interview of Wang Wenchao in a Chinese military magazine. Wang, credited with being the chief designer of China’s sea-based strategic missiles, expressed grave pessimism about China’s offensive nuclear capability against U.S. missile defense. He said, “I have done research: Facing a multi-tiered missile defense system, if any single layer can achieve a success rate of 70%, then 100 single warhead missiles could all be intercepted even if they are mounting a simultaneous attack.”30 This is why Wu Tianfu—arguably the most important deterrence strategist of the Second Artillery of the PLA, which runs China’s strategic nuclear forces—charges that the U.S. has “forced China to engage in a space arms race.”31 More specifically, U.S. missile defense has forced China to integrate space war with its strategic nuclear deterrence. China must possess the ability to weaken American space-based assets such as early-warning satellites, to ensure the credibility of its own offensive nuclear forces. Thus, space war and nuclear war are now intertwined in Chinese strategic thinking. Indeed, China’s official media have credited Wu with establishing the PLA’s first space war research institute.32<br />

[ ] ORS fails – lack of a coherent definition prevents a coordinated strategy<br />

<br />
DOD is making some progress in developing the ORS concept, but whether it will meet warfighter requirements is unclear, principally because the concept is in the early stages of development and not commonly understood by all members of the warfighter and national security space communities. Our prior work examining successful organizational transformations shows the need to communicate to stakeholders often and early and to clearly define specific objectives. Since the Joint ORS Office was established in May 2007, it has developed a process for converting warfighter needs into formal requirements and identifying potential ORS solutions. Moreover, DOD issued the ORS Implementation Plan in April 2008 and is also developing new ORS guidance documents. However, GAO found disparity in stakeholder understanding of the ORS concept t within the warfighter and national security space communities. This disparity exists because DOD has not clearly defined key elements of the ORS concept and has not effectively communicated the concept with key stakeholders. For example, initial ORS planning documents are broad and lack the specificity needed to guide the ORS concept, according to some members of the warfighter and national security space communities. Moreover, officials from the intelligence community were concerned about DOD’s lack of consultation and communication with them regarding the ORS concept. Without having a well-defined and commonly understood concept, DOD’s ability to fully meet warfighter needs may be hampered.<br />

[ ] Obama’s New Space policy prevents an Arms Race – support for multilateralism and dialogue<br />

<br />
Once the above measures begin to relax the security dilemma, China, the U.S., and other major powers can work toward a multilateral agreement governing the military use of space. Although China’s military space programs, especially its January 2007 ASAT test, contradict its official policy of seeking to ban weapons in space, they can be interpreted as a hedging strategy in response to the security dilemma. When the U.S. opposed efforts to ban the weaponization of space, the PLA felt compelled to initiate its own military space programs. Now that the Obama administration is willing to ban weapons in space, this could bring both China and Russia to the negotiating table for a multilateral agreement. Indeed, in February 2008 China and Russia jointly proposed such a treaty at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Chinese experts have repeatedly emphasized that arms control for outer space remains China’s top priority, though it is prepared for an arms race if necessary. President Hu’s statement on the issue in November 2009 effectively reaffirmed this position. Therefore, the current strategic adjustment by the U.S. and President Obama’s new space policy could make a multilateral approach feasible. According to a PLA strategist assessing the new directions in U.S. space policy: If Obama, who champions the theme of change, forsakes the longtime U.S. strategy for space hegemony and is willing to pursue arms control in outer space through an international treaty, then, with effective mechanisms for monitoring and verification, the world community will be able to walk on the right track toward peaceful use of space, eradication of [the] arms race, and realization of permanent peace. 58<br />

<br />
The United States and China increasingly interact in space and already engage in space-related activities that could be termed cooperative. For example, the United States provides China with warnings of imminent orbital conjunctions between Chinese space assets and other space objects, because preventing another debris- producing event serves U.S. interests. Both countries also participate in many of the same multilateral processes addressing space issues. 11<br />

<br />
In the long run, if China sustains its economic growth to a point where its economic and technological prowess is roughly comparable to at least Japan’s, if not the United States’, U.S. offensive counterspace superiority could be more difficult to sustain if China decided it wanted parity or more, a distinct possibility. Yet by that time, China would be struggling with the economic and political impact of its demographics, where its one-child policy will lead to a rapidly aging workforce. Chinese leaders require decades of external stability so that they “can continue to focus their attention on economic growth and political reform. China can ill afford external distractions that would absorb resources and jeopardize the environment that China requires for continued economic growth.”20 China has many other looming sociopolitical issues, too, making space force parity likely a lower priority for it, as long as it could maintain space deterrence. If the United States and China can successfully navigate the shoals of uncertainty 26 China, Space Weapons, and U.S. Security over the next two or three decades and achieve friendlier relations, such considerations could shrink greatly in significance. But achieving such a state requires that these issues be discussed and debated, with as much information as can safely be made public. As a former Air Force vice chief of staff recently wrote, “It is important to encourage a debate on space power to include development of a space deterrent theory. We need something similar to the intellectual ferment that surrounded nuclear deterrence.”21<br />

<br />
What role might China's space capabilities play should such a conflict occur nonetheless? Answers to this question vary widely. In 2001, the commission on U.S. national security in space warned that unless steps were taken to reduce the vulnerability of America's space systems, the country would face the real possibility of a &quot;Space Pearl Harbor.&quot; 21 After the PRC's successful ASAT test in January 2007, Geoffrey Forden from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that even with months of planning and prepositioning, the best China could do against U.S. space capabilities would be to attack nine LEO satellites. He argued that the short term consequences of such an attack would be limited, and that, due to the redundancy of U.S. space systems, even under the worst case scenario China's all out ASAT attack would &quot;only reduce&quot; America's use of precision guided weapons and satellite communications into and out of the theater. 22 My inclination is to think that Forden's assessment better reflects actual PRC ASAT capabilities between now and 2020 than did the 2001 space commission's warning of a looming Space Pearl Harbor. Ashley Tellis, whose assessment of China's military space strategy in the autumn 2007 issue of Survival sparked a strident debate over China's counterspace capabilities and strategic goals in early 2008, 23 mentions several other options directed energy weapons, electronic attacks including jamming, and terrestrial attacks against the ground segments of U.S. space systems that provide alternatives to direct ascent, kinetic attacks against U.S. satellites. To these alternatives I would add cyber attacks aimed at disrupting U.S. computer networks. There are other ways, then, to try to turn U.S. dependence on space into vulnerabilities in addition to kinetic attacks on satellites, and some ways are certainly easier than other.<br />

<br />
Built upon that history, the AFRL developed a set of requirements for its space operational vehicle (SOV) concept. These requirements sought to drive technology-development projects—that is, they were so aggressive that only advanced technologies or unproven system concepts could possibly satisfy them. The mission-needs statement, approved for ORS in 2001 by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, has served as the basis for many subsequent launch-vehicle and propulsion-system technology projects. The analysis of alternatives study used requirements derived from this statement, specifying the reduction of launch-vehicle call-up times from months to days and of final preparation and launch from days to hours. The requirements also mention the ability to sustain multiple sorties per day during contingency operations, which might necessitate turnaround of the vehicle for a subsequent mission within hours of landing. From this history of the responsive launch vehicle—whether it’s called a military space plane, an SOV, or an ORS launch vehicle—one sees that the concept has emerged from the expansion of space capabilities through a technology-push program and that it has had inadequate capability-pull from the war-fighter community. Much of the support for a responsive launch concept depends upon obtaining access to space at lower costs. Claims of the low-cost-access-to-space companies in the 1990s, continuing with the more recent and better funded entrepreneurial companies, are accepted almost religiously. These businesses are deceiving themselves and their supporters. Building the first test vehicle might prove relatively straightforward, but seeing such a system through production and operation will not. Such companies can operate inexpensively in the early phases of development because they have no past liability; no large, aging infrastructure to maintain and operate; no large pension and retiree health insurance funds to maintain; and no large bureaucracies to do the little things that have to be done. As a program matures, as such a system must, one will find no substantial cost difference between a system from one of the United States’ traditional launch-vehicle companies and a system from one of the new companies. The goals of low-cost responsive launch are not new. An essay on an online air-and-space-news Web site notes that the goals of the Pegasus and Taurus launch vehicles, developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation, differed little from those of ORS launch.13 In fact, an Atlas F ICBM had more mass capability and better responsiveness than the small launch vehicles under development in DARPA’s FALCON program today. Given the likenesses between the early Atlas vehicles and the SpaceX launch vehicles, one should not be surprised by their similar responsiveness.14<br />

<em>Some say that the awarding of defense contracts should not be about U.S. jobs. But Embraer is making it just that by touting the number of assembly jobs that will be created in Jacksonville, Fla. So if Embraer is making the awarding of a defense contract about U.S. jobs in Florida, so should Hawker Beechcraft make it about the retention of 1,400 high-paying, skilled jobs in the United States that support the AT-6 program today. Hawker Beechcraft currently employs 6,300 people in Kansas. Today Kansas has 38,432 aerospace jobs working at 80 establishments. Workers earn, on average, $62,063 annually. Embraer promises a net addition of 50 jobs in Florida (assembly jobs) with average annual wages of $50,000. Today Florida has 28,506 aerospace jobs working at 105 establishments. Workers earn, on average, $56,226 annually. But Embraer is promising only assembly jobs as part of its bid. To even threaten to imperil one of the United States’ most important aerospace clusters at this point in the nation’s economic recovery would be a grave mistake. The Kansas aerospace cluster has suffered enough as the recession proved most difficult. The sale of business aircraft was adversely affected. It is well-known that the U.S. leadership in manufacturing has been on the decline for decades. According to a research report by U.S.-based consultancy IHS Global Insight, in 2010 China ended the United States’ 110-year-long reign as the world’s top manufacturing nation.

<br />
With military spending stagnant and the Obama administration looking at billions of dollars in cuts, the U.S. defense industry faces belt-tightening and consolidation over the next few years as companies begin to feel the pain, analysts say. Core performance among the top 105 defense contractors was flat for the second year in a row in 2010, Deloitte consulting firm reported last week, and new business booked by the companies was not enough to replace the revenue collected from completed contracts, suggesting another stagnant year in 2011. &quot;That's an indicator of the status of the industry, which is treading water at this point,&quot; said Tom Captain, Deloitte's vice chairman for aerospace and defense. Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute think tank, said the industry was fairly healthy following a decade of growth in U.S. defense budgets. But program cuts two years ago -- like the termination of the Air Force's F-22 fighter and the Navy's future cruiser -- were beginning to affect the bottom lines of some firms, he said. &quot;Most of the cuts that are being made to work forces are pre-emptive rather than a reaction to major budget reductions,&quot; Thompson said. &quot;However, the industry senses that tough times have begun and expects ... conditions to progressively deteriorate for some time to come.&quot; Defense contractors may begin to feel the bite in 2012. President Barack Obama is asking for $689 billion in defense spending for the 2012 fiscal year, about $35 billion less than 2011 -- the first significant reduction in years. Congress may cut the military budget back even more as lawmakers wrestle with record budget deficits. &quot;We are now at the point where 2012 is becoming the year of defense funding contraction,&quot; said analyst Jim McAleese, of McAleese &amp; Associates.<br />

3. Subsidizing the aerospace industry fails<br />
Sterner ‘10 Eric R. Sterner is a fellow at the George C. Marshall Institute, [“R&amp;D Can Revitalize the Space Industrial Base”2/22 <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:10934:http://www.marshall.org/article.php?id=782 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.marshall.org/article.php?id=782" rel="nofollow">http://www.marshall.org/article.php?id=782</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:10934 --><br />
<br />
Furthermore, the space industrial base, particularly the second- and third-tier suppliers, has not been immune to the steady decline in the overall U.S. manufacturing base, which has been exacerbated by the recent economic downturn. Particular attention needs to be given to these lower-tier suppliers because that is often where unique, specialized skills reside. It is tempting to throw money at these problems, but dollars will not solve them. Resources are clearly necessary, but not sufficient, for a healthy space industrial base. Today, the United States often spreads the funding available around industry to protect as many jobs and heritage capabilities as possible, but such subsidies represent a hollow approach. “Keep alive” funding will not revitalize industry; it only promotes stagnation.<br />

4. Turn – Launch service subsidies are protectionism – they cause foreign reactions and undermine commercial launchers<br />
Reed, 1999 former NASA space launch vehicle and satellite technologies engineering support contractor [James, JD candidate American University International Law Review Volume 13 | Issue 1 Article 7 The Commercial Space Launch Market and Bilateral Trade Agreements in Space Launch Serviceshttp://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1349&amp;context=auilr&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22launch%20services%20subsidy%20protectionism%22<br />
<br />
China's launch program has yet to show the potential to capture a larger percentage of the launch services market. China's launch services industry cannot, in the near term,296 offer the reliability and capacity of Western providers.297 Without a technological or economic capability to compete with Western providers, policymakers should reconsider whether quotas on Chinese launch vehicles are unnecessarily blocking commercial opportunities for United States business. In 1989, no one knew China's potential in the launch services market.298 The parties imposed quotas as a protective measure for Western launch competitors.299 Now, the world market views China's poor launch record and protective strategies as unacceptable,&quot; demonstrated by an exodus of customers and a diminishing number of insurance providers.30 ' These developments force a conclusion that China cannot, in the near term, achieve a more significant market share through predatory pricing. Prior to the 1993 Russia Agreement, the West voiced strong concerns over the potential effect of Russia's entry in the launch services market.302 Now, the failing Russian and Ukrainian space infrastructures30 3 suggests that these once ominous launch vehicle providers3&quot; cannot dictate their own rules for the market.35 As a result, Russia and Ukraine have become increasingly dependent on Western support. 306 Fears of dumping low-cost launch vehicles on the world market are simply not as prevalent as they once were.308 Although a relaxation of Russian launch quotas would threaten some Western launch providers,3&quot;9 a more open market for ex-soviet launch vehicles will afford United States satellite providers the same opportunities as foreign competitors.1 Moreover, a relaxation of quotas would arguably promote more favorable market transitioning mechanisms such as the formation ofjoint ventures ' in launch services. The launch agreements depend on market forecasts to implement the quota strategy.&quot;' The strategy is at best marginally acceptable to today's GEO launch vehicle customers, but the LEO strategy&quot; 3 has little, if any, support in the industry.&quot; 4 More importantly, the Russia, Ukraine, and China quotas will have little effect when countries like Japan, Brazil, and India3&quot; begin to gain market share. Rather than supporting launch quotas, the United States should place more faith in the resilience and competitiveness of the United States launch industry. Launch quotas can only hurt the satellite industry. The international telecommunications market requires diversity in launch vehicles. 3&quot;6 The United States satellite industry cannot continue to subsidize Western launchers by limiting launches on non-Western launch vehicles&quot; 7 if it is to remain competitive. Satellite planners need to be able to choose the least expensive launcher and make their own assessments of launch vehicle needs.&quot; 8 The United States communications satellite industry is ten-times larger than the United States launch services industry.1 9 The United States should act now by realigning its trade policies to better reflect the larger needs of the commercial space industry.<br />

Protectionism causes trade wars – political instability<br />
Rutledge 2007 (Dr. John, PROTECTIONISM - THE REAL THREAT TO GROWTH, STABILITY. Dr John Rutledge is a leading economist who has advised several presidents, including the current administration, as well as multinational corporations and financial institutions. China Daily august 3)<br />
<br />
Today, when a political leader announces a new protectionist measure, crowds cheer. I believe that rising protectionism, nationalism, and social instability are rooted in the turbulence caused by rapid economic change. Rapid economic change raises average incomes but it creates new industries and destroys others, creating uncertainty in the lives of many people. Those, whose fortunes have been temporarily or permanently reduced, as well as those who are simply afraid of change, appeal to political leaders for relief; political leaders who promise to stop or reverse change will gain power over leaders who counsel openness. Left unchecked, this process can lead to global trade war as country after country erects non-market barriers to the smooth flow of trade. Ultimately, these mounting frictions can produce system failure, akin to the blackouts caused by failures of an electricity network, in which the global economy stops growing, as it did in the 1970's. Rampant protectionism could also breed social and political instability and, ultimately, bring nations into conflict. Political instability would put all the gains of the past quarter century at risk. The unintended consequences of protectionism would be harmful for people living in developed countries; they would be a tragedy for the world's three billion poor people. We can choose a better course. Although we cannot entirely eliminate calls for protectionism, there are things we can do to retard its growth and mitigate its harmful effects.<br />

Trade Wars go Nuclear<br />
Spicer 96 - Olin Foundation (The Challenge from the East and the Rebirth of the West, p. 121)<br />
<br />
The choice facing the West today is much the same as that which faced the Soviet bloc after World War II: between meeting head-on the challenge of world trade with the adjustments and the benefits that it will bring, or of attempting to shut out markets that are growing and where a dynamic new pace is being set for innovative production. The problem about the second approach is not simply that it won’t hold: satellite technology alone will ensure that consumers will begin to demand those goods that the East is able to provide most cheaply. More fundamentally, it will guarantee the emergence of a fragmented world in which natural fears will be fanned and inflamed. A world divided into rigid trade blocs will be a deeply troubled and unstable place in which suspicion and ultimately envy will possibly erupt into a major war. I do not say that the converse will necessarily be true, that in a free trading world there will be an absence of all strife. Such a proposition would manifestly be absurd. But to trade is to become interdependent, and that is a good stop in the direction of world stability. With nuclear weapons at two a penny, stability will be at a premium in the years ahead.<br />

<br />
Ironically, efforts to deny space technology to potential enemies have hampered American cooperation with other nations and have limited sales of U.S.-made hardware. Concerned about Chinese use of space technology for military purposes, Congress ramped up restrictions on rocket and satellite sales, and placed them under the cumbersome International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). In addition, sales of potentially &quot;dual use&quot; technology have to be approved the State Department rather than the Commerce Department. The result has been a surge of rocket and satellite production abroad and the creation of foreign-made satellites that use only homegrown components to avoid complex U.S. restrictions under ITAR and the Iran Nonproliferation Act. That law, passed in 2000, tightened a ban on direct or indirect sales of advanced technology to Iran (especially by Russia). As a result, a number of foreign governments are buying European satellites and paying the Chinese, Indian and other space programs to launch them. &quot;Some of these companies moved ahead in some areas where, I'm sorry to say, we are no longer the world leaders,&quot; Griffin said.<br />

<br />
If current trends continue, the United States will not have the specialized workforce necessary to support future U.S. primacy in space. Indeed, there is a major crisis in the aerospace industry, both in terms of sustaining the current workforce and developing the workforce of the future. With the reductions in defense spending that followed the end of the Cold War, the United States lost over 600,000 scientific and technical aerospace jobs.68 According to the Aerospace Industries Association, total industry employment went from 1,120,800 in 1990 down to 637,300 in 2007. In the space sector alone, employment slipped from 168,500 to 75,200 over the same period of time. Of the employees that remained following the initial post-Cold War cuts, it is suggested that 27 percent of America’s aerospace technical workforce is now eligible for retirement. This is simply the continuation of a wave of retirements that began some time ago70 The Aerospace Industries Association contends that nearly 60 percent of the U.S.-aerospace workforce was at least 45 years old in 2007. What is significant is that because many began their careers relatively young, a large number will be eligible for retirement in the next decade. Clearly, the workforce that supported U.S. space primacy during and immediately following the Cold War will need to be replenished with the infusion of new talent. The ability of the United States to fill the void left by retirements is in question. Currently, the portion of those workers 34 or younger has declined from 32 percent in 1992 to 16 percent in 2003. About 70,000 students each year receive undergraduate degrees in engineering in the United States. Subtracting the 15,000 degrees in non-space related engineering fields (civil, automotive, mining and transportation engineers) about 55,000 graduates are qualified for aerospace work. Of those, approximately 20 percent are international students who are expected to return home upon graduation. That leaves about 44,000 graduates per year for all American companies, not only aerospace firms. Given that a single leading aerospace company expects to hire 50,000 engineers in the next five years, the challenge of replenishing the aerospace workforce becomes a challenge. It is compounded by the fact that fewer students are earning degrees in math and science—from undergraduate to doctorate—while at the same time, there is an ongoing shortage of math and science teachers.<br />

Can’t save the industrial base – terminal problems<br />
Hertzfeld, 11 – Research Professor of Space Policy and International Affairs in the Space Policy Institute and the Center for International Science and Technology Policy at The George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs (Henry, Toward a Theory of Space Power: Selected Essays, February, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:10937:http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/spacepower/spacepower.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:10937 -->)<br />
<br />
Below, some examples are listed.33 The major issue for consideration in the context of spacepower, however, is that many actions taken by the government for very valid purposes that are unrelated to space may create conditions that negate the ability to carry out space policies as proscribed in PDDs and/or create incentives for other nations or the companies in other nations to more aggressively develop systems in direct competition with U.S. capabilities. Taken collectively, many of these actions may make any attempt at a U.S. policy that emphasizes economic spacepower very difficult, if not impossible, to carry out. And looking historically, many of these nonspace policies and actions may have created and sped up the development of robust space capabilities in other nations, which, in turn, has weakened U.S. economic leadership in space and diluted the Nation's power in space systems development as well as in the technology and use of space applications.34 Overall U.S. Government philosophy toward economic deregulation of industry. Deregulation, along with policies to avoid developing government enterprises, is oriented toward letting the market and price system allocate resources more efficiently than government fiat can do. This works well in a truly competitive industry with many producers and many consumers. Unfortunately, space is an industry characterized by only a few producers and with governments as the major purchasers. What has occurred is a shift in power and human resource capability from governments to large corporations. Whether this is advantageous to either the development of space commerce or to U.S. spacepower is a matter of empirical analysis and further research, neither of which has been done as yet.35 Overall government attempts to privatize and outsource functions. Examples such as the attempted privatization of remote sensing satellites, first in the late 1970s and again in the mid-1980s, were premature and not very successful. In fact, the suggestion that the satellite weather service be privatized resulted in Congress declaring that meteorology and weather systems were a &quot;public good&quot; and would not be privatized. Essentially, the private market for space goods and services has never developed as rapidly as was expected, and most of these proposals have not happened due mainly to a lack of a sizable nongovernment market as well as to the large up-front investments. DOD incentives for mergers and combinations of firms since the 1990s. As discussed below, this has encouraged a more oligopolistic space industry in the United States. It also encouraged similar combinations abroad as the only way other nations could compete with U.S. companies. Lower-tier suppliers have been subsumed under larger companies, and the result has been a different type of competition than existed before these developments in the space sector. It has also created more powerful and capable foreign competition. Examples from Space-related Decisions Imposition of strict export controls on space systems and high-technology products. Both U.S. and foreign industries as well as foreign governments have complained bitterly about the strict enforcement of export control laws since the late 1990s. It is increasingly more difficult to share R&amp;D information, to sell U.S. space goods and services abroad, and to cooperate with foreign nations, even on government projects. The hardest hit space industry has been satellite manufacturing in the United States, where foreign competitors have built and are selling equipment worldwide at the expense of a market that formerly was controlled and dominated by U.S. firms. Sunset provisions on indemnification of space third-party liability. Although perhaps of a lesser economic disadvantage to the United States in providing competition in launch services, most foreign launch companies fully indemnify their domestic industry from the unlikely, but possibly very expensive, liability claims that could accrue if there were a major disaster from a space object destroying property or taking lives upon reentering the Earth's atmosphere. The United States requires private insurance and indemnifies firms (with a cap) on claims above what insurance would pay. That is a reasonable policy, but it has never been made permanent. Congress has consistently put a sunset provision into that authorizing legislation and therefore has increased the risk of investment for U.S. launch firms compared to our foreign competitors. Decision in the 1970s to put all commercial payloads on the space shuttle and not fund R&amp;D for expendable vehicles. The economic results of the Challenger disaster in 1986 clearly highlighted the potential problems with this policy. In particular, Arianespace, the French/European launch vehicle company, was developing a series of vehicles mainly designed for the commercial market in geosynchronous telecommunications satellites. As a result of the United States falling behind in R&amp;D and manufacturing of expendable rockets and the change in policy toward commercial space shuttle launches after Challenger, Arianespace was able to capture up to 60 percent of the launch market. The United States needed over a decade and a major policy shift toward stimulating commercial launch developments before being able to regain some of the lost market share. Decision not to authorize launches of foreign operational telecommunications satellites on U.S. launch vehicles. As with other restrictive policies, nations were given the incentive to develop independent capabilities. With the ensuing maturation of launch and satellite technologies, they were able to build very competitive and capable equipment without U.S. components or assistance.36 DOD decision to retain governance of GPS. Even though GPS was funded, designed, built, and operated by DOD, it had provided an unencrypted free signal for worldwide use as part of the program. Use of this signal has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry very quickly. Receivers are manufactured in many nations, and the system has become one of the important infrastructure services offered from space. It is important now to both the military and to civilian communications and timing systems. From the mid1990s to today, it has been the only fully operating space navigation system. That is about to change as Europe, Russia, and possibly China develop their own systems. Nobody questions the integrity or value of the U.S. global positioning system, but partially because it is controlled by DOD without any inputs from other nations, there are incentives to invest billions of dollars abroad to duplicate the capability. From a military viewpoint, not giving up control of a critical technology is understandable, but from a practical and economic perspective, the United States likely could have maintained a monopoly position, or at least greatly stalled foreign developments, if the government had been able to compromise on this policy. Delayed decision to allow release of higher resolution images from Earth observation satellites for civil and commercial purposes. By the early 1990s, when the restriction was lifted on releasing or permitting private U.S. companies to collect or sell imagery with a resolution of less than 10 meters, France had been selling such imagery on the open market, as had Russia. Again, nations with aggressive economic and industry space policies were able to capture market shares from U.S. companies hindered by policies designed for security, not commercial purposes.<br />

 <br />
Turns the case – protectionism invites economic retaliation and collapses the global economy<br />
US Department of State 1985 (Protectionism: A Threat to Our Prosperity, Government Publication)<br />
<br />
The Dangers of Protectionism The most serious threat to the world economy--and to our domestic economy--is the swelling tide of protectionism. People who would never condone protectionism at home somehow accept that it should be practiced internationally. To illustrate this point with a hypothetical example, suppose that the State of Virginia decided that North Carolina tobacco was making excessive inroads in the Virginia market, and suppose that Virginia (defying the constitutional prohibition against internal tariffs) managed to impose a special levy on all tobacco entering the state. Of course, North Carolina would retaliate against products from Virginia. Clearly, total economic activity--and our prosperity --would be reduced. No one in this room would consider that trade barriers among the 50 States would be anything but a disaster; but many people (economists included) appear to assume that a different set of economic rules operates on the international scene. By this same logic--or lack of logic--they assume that with impunity we can introduce protectionist measures at our international borders without hurting all parties concerned--ourselves more than others. Protectionist measures invite a spiral of retaliation, and, even in the absence of retaliation. They foster inefficient uses of scarce resources and raise the cost of living in the country introducing the protection. A favored group or industry may initially benefit from a quota, for example, but even greater additional costs are borne by the majority of the population. It may seem strange that in the United States, historically the champion of the free market, I should feel the need to make a plea for a free and open trading system. But, while most persons would readily agree that such a system is demonstrably superior in principle, I often find them advocating policies that would produce the opposite result. When individuals, industries, or even whole sectors perceive their economic interests to be threatened, they often rationalize a course of action that has, over and over again, proven to be a failure: protectionism. &quot;We believe in free trade,' they say, &quot;but it must be fair trade.' &quot;Fair trade' is not defined, but implicitly it means trade in which we win. Protectionist measures, and trade-distorting measures in general, are not really actions taken by one country against another country. Instead, they are actions that benefit one domestic group at the expense of other groups in the same country. Producers oppose consumers, and industries that compete with imports oppose industries that export. It is disheartening but not surprising that protectionism's advocates are found in all nations, and always have been, but that does not validate their cause. Their arguments, in whatever language they may be phrased, are founded on the same fallacies, and neither eloquence nor vehemence will alter the fundamental fact that protectionism is inevitably self-defeating. Protectionism is like a disease--not only pernicious but contagious. When it appears, it spreads and leaves a trail of economic disability. By &quot;protectionism,' I mean any measure that gives a domestic producer an artificial advantage over foreign producers. I include tariffs, quotas, voluntary export restraints, subsidies, unnecessary licensing, health and safety standards, and all other measures that distort trade.<br />

<em>LEON PANETTA is under no illusions about what Barack Obama moved him from the CIA to the Pentagon to do. The wily Mr Panetta, who took over from Robert Gates as defence secretary at the beginning of the month, is everyone’s idea of a safe pair of hands. But his greatest claim to fame (other than presiding over the plan to kill Osama bin Laden) is as the director of the Office of Management and Budget who paved the way to the balanced budget of 1998. Mr Panetta has inherited from his predecessor the outlines of a plan to reduce military spending by $400 billion by 2023. But America’s fiscal crisis (and the lack of any political consensus about how tackle it) makes it almost certain that Mr Panetta will have to cut further and faster than Mr Gates would have wished. That could be bad news for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the most expensive military-industrial programme in history, and its lead contractor, Lockheed Martin. The plane is expected to come into service six years late (in 2016) and wildly over-budget. The Pentagon still plans to buy 2,443 F-35s over the next 25 years, at a cost of $382 billion. But in a parting shot, Mr Gates gave warning that although he did not think the F-35 faced cancellation, “the size of the buy” might have to be cut. After beating a Boeing design that was deemed technically riskier, Lockheed Martin signed the contract with the Department of Defence to develop the F-35 in 2001. It was an ambitious undertaking. The aim was to reap huge efficiency gains by replacing nearly all of America’s ageing tactical aircraft (the air force’s F-16s and A-10s; the navy’s A/F-18s and the marines’ AV8B jump jets) with three variants of one basic design. There would be a conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) version for the air force, a short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) version for the marines and a beefier carrier version for the navy. With radar-beating stealth capability and a suite of advanced software and sensors, the F-35 would be a “fifth generation” fighter, far more effective in both its primary ground-attack role and air defence than “legacy” aircraft. (Respectively eight times and four times better, say Lockheed Martin executives, though by what measure is anyone’s guess.)</em><br />

There is another, perhaps far more compelling reason that space weaponization will in time be less threatening to the international system than without it. One of the more cacophonous refrains against weapons procurement of any kind is that the money needed to purchase them is better spent elsewhere. It is a simple cliché but a powerful one. Space weapons in particular will be very, very expensive. Are there not a thousand uses that are more beneficial for the money? But funding for weapons does not come directly from education, or housing, or transportation budgets. It comes from military budgets. And so the question should not be directed at particular weapons, but at all weapons. Immediately we see that the impact on the budget of significant increases in space weapons will be decreases in funding for combat aircraft, the surface battle fleet, and ground forces. This creates a dilemma for both pro and anti-space weaponization camps. Space advocates must sell their ideas to fellow pro-weapons groups by making the case that the advantages they provide outweigh the capabilities foregone. This is a mighty task. The tens (likely hundreds) of billions of dollars needed to develop, test, and deploy a minimal space weapons system with the capacity to engage a few targets around the world could displace a half a dozen or more aircraft carrier battle groups, entire aircraft procurement programs (such as the f-22), and several heavy armored divisions. This is a tough sell for supporters of a strong military. It is an even more difficult dilemma for those who oppose weapons in general, and space weapons in particular. Ramifications for the most critical current function of the army, navy, and marines are profound—pacification, occupation, and control of foreign territory. With the downsizing of traditional weapons to accommodate heightened space expenditures, the ability of the us to do all three will wane significantly. At a time when many are calling for increased capability to pacify and police foreign lands, in light of the no-end-in-sight occupation of iraq and afghanistan, space weapons proponents must advocate reduction of these capabilities in favor of a system that will have no direct potential to do so.<br />

No doubt the legal and monetary obligations would be great, but the strategic, operational, and defense industrial consequences of terminating the F-35 program would be catastrophic. To begin with, the F-35 is a multinational program. To kill it would not only yank the rug out from under America’s closest friends and allies – long-time partners like Great Britain, Australia, and Canada, for example – but destroy the prospects for closer partnerships in the Middle East and, particularly, the Asia-Pacific, where Japan, Korea and Singapore are likely F-35 customers. And it would forestall the opportunity to share a common fifth-generation aircraft with others like India, which could only turn to Russia or try to develop such an aircraft on its own. Terminating the F-35 would be the clearest signal one can imagine, even beyond retreat from Iraq or Afghanistan, that the United States no longer will assume the burdens of international security. Terminating the F-35, or simply terminating the F-35B short take off vertical landing (or STOVL), would be fatal for the Marine Corps as a serious war fighting service. The modernization of the Marines is already at risk; the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor transport turned out to be more difficult and more expensive than anticipated, and last year the Obama administration cancelled the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, which would have given the Marines both enhanced amphibious assault capability but, even more important, more firepower and mobility ashore. The Marines’ AV-8B Harriers – a development of the original British jump jet – are at the end of their service life, and the Marines’ F-18s cannot operate from Marine amphibious assault ships. And there’s hardly reason to have the big-deck amphibs without the F-35B. Conversely, operating a fifth-generation aircraft would give the Marine Corps a new viability in small-scale contingencies – think Libya – and allow them to contribute to more challenging “anti-access, area-denial” contingencies in East Asia or in an Iran-type operation. Similar challenges face the Navy; without a fifth-generation aircraft, its own aircraft carriers are increasingly irrelevant to high-end strike campaigns. Ending the F-35 program would also eviscerate what remains of the American military aviation industry. Only two companies in the world have prime contractor experience in building manned “stealth” aircraft, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. Northrop’s B-2 bomber, designed in the late 1970s, was last bought in 1997; only 21 of a planned 132 bombers. Northrop is no longer in that business. Lockheed built the F-117 Nighthawk, the first stealth fighter, another 1970s design and also long out of production. Lockheed also builds the F-22 Raptor, but that program was ended (with just 187 of a planned 750 aircraft produced) two years ago and the last F-22 will soon roll off the line. The F-35 line itself was sized (and the workforce planned) to build up to several hundred planes a year; under current plans, it’s not going to reach maximum efficiency. Indeed, the company may have to lay off workers. There’s no other place for the designers, engineers, or management to go; the investment, knowledge, and production experience to make stealthy, manned combat aircraft will rapidly disappear.<br />

<br />
The United States has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities. ,,39 Further, the DoD's Plan for Operationally Responsive Space highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1 implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions. PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The United States must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit. Although the United States maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network (SSN) network, it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space; the February 10, 2009 collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. Improved SSA also allows the United States to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations. While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the United States enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program. The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites The United States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture. A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished. Finally, small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities. Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons. China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities. Engagement Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic• missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options. In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program.53 Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems. “A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons. Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degrade US military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58<br />

Lastly, one very popular argument against developing space defenses is the fear that it would precipitate a space arms race. Typically, this argument is more often associated with competing offensive capabilities; however, there is ample empirical evidence that improved defenses can also cause an adversary to seek improved offensive weapon effectiveness. The original line of reasoning postulates that space assets are free from attack now because of the sanctuary they enjoy and because they do not represent a clear and present danger which an adversary feels compelled to directly challenge. Unfortunately, continued American reliance upon unchallenged space exploitation is slowly changing the equation. If the U.S. should develop more OCS capability (such as fielding a destructive ASAT or placing weapons in space) then other nations would feel compelled to develop an equal if not superior threat capability to balance the superiority of the U.S., which in turn creates a threat to the satellites that might not have existed in the first place.160 The defensive theory is a twist of that original argument. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. It argues that creating an effective satellite defense to a demonstrated contemporary threat only encourages the adversary country to improve on the threat, thus leading to the arms race. First, this line of thought assumes that the impetus causing the adversary to create space weapons in the first place can be abated or removed, and that only by making the adversary feel a greater or unreasonable risk does the arms race begin. While America has not placed weapons or even unassailable defenses in space yet, potential adversaries are feeling threatened by U.S. space dominance. It is unrealistic that the U.S. will forego the strategic and tactical advantages that space represents, or will willingly give up the dominance it enjoys today. It is exactly that dedication to space dominance that is making nations like China and North Korea turn to ASAT technology.161 While U.S. weaponization of space in order to gain an offensive initiative can certainly be argued against, the only viable means to protect already threatened satellites is to improve defenses or suffer the consequences. ASAT threats against U.S. satellites already exist and the adversary countries have demonstrated a desire to use them, if necessary. The U.S. cannot afford to do nothing about the threat and hope that it will never be challenged in space dominance. Even reversing space policy today and negotiating a treaty to ban all ASAT weapons would not physically prevent an adversary country from secretly building a robust ASAT capability while the U.S. rests on its laurels. Arguing diplomatically that the adversary country was in violation of a signed treaty would provide little comfort as U.S. satellites continued to be disabled or destroyed. By fielding a defensive system that mitigates or negates the effectiveness of a threat, the adversary country will become less inclined to risk war with the U.S. by employing ASATs if they could not guarantee some reasonable expectation of success. There is little evidence that specifically placing defenses onboard satellites will suddenly cause a space arms race to spiral out of control. Space systems are already protected through various means including threat of an air or surface attack, small maneuvers, configuration changes and others. These defensive measures exist today and a space arms race (if one exists at all) is proceeding at a relatively measured pace. Some can argue that U.S. DCS measures today are spurring the improvement of ASATs worldwide, but it is just as valid to point to inevitable strategic balancing that usually occurs against empires and hegemons throughout history as a stimulus for contemporary ASAT development. Second, there is a simple economic balance that prevents a space arms race from spiraling out of control, especially when matching adversarial offensive threats against competing domestic defensive capability. Secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, explained the economic math, “’I can’t afford as a nation to just do an exchange ratio where they send up a $100 million [ASAT] missile and I send up a $1.5 billion satellite.’”162 What the U.S. could afford, however, is to spend $45 million to neutralize the effect of the $100 million ASAT in protection of the $1.5 billion satellite. Most of the defenses proposed would cost less than or equal to the cost of a destructive ASAT. If they are effective and negate the usefulness of the threat ASAT, then the adversary has to increase spending to improve their ASAT. Typically that improvement cost is proportional to cost of the original system, in this case starting at $100 million. The same generally holds true for the defensive improvements. Therefore, the next spiral in the arms race would equate to a $200 million ASAT to attack a $1.5 billion satellite protected by a $100 million defensive system. And, much like the cold war, the U.S. would be in a position to outspend most any foreseeable adversary and neutralize the threat. That is based upon the assumption, of course, that defensive improvements could keep pace with offensive improvements technologically. Outpacing the potential adversary threat is exactly the goal of this proposal. The arguments against additional defensive measures may spark interest initially but, once examined, have limited rationale that would warrant abandoning satellite self-defense development and employment. However, lacking good reasons against improving the defense of satellites does not imply that the measures should therefore be developed. The Benefits of Chasing Additional Defensive Measures The first and most obvious advantage of developing timely and responsive satellite defenses is that America’s critical space capability would be preserved. Some of the technologies like increasing redundancy or whipple bumpers and nanotechnology can provide additional protection not only against ASATs but against a whole host of natural electromagnetic and projectile events that occur every day. Since nature can sometimes represent the biggest threat to the largest number of U.S. satellites, the additional protection ensures the availability of space exploitation when needed. The expeditionary nature of the American military depends greatly upon space for command and control, and modern military battlefields almost require precision weapons, many of which are also dependent upon space assets. Unfettered space support is necessary for the U.S. military to continue to function as it has over the past decade and predicted to do so in the future. Many of the technologies presented as possible near-term candidates have been developed for terrestrial application. Just as the technology transfer can go from air assets to space assets, so can the applications of some of the technologies developed for protecting satellites. The miniaturization and autonomous processing that will inevitably precipitate from micro- and nano-satellite development can greatly aid unmanned aircraft development in addition to other air, sea, and ground platforms.163 Aircraft could be made lighter and more capable. Ships could conserve space for additional supplies and ground vehicles could be made more reliable and have more room to carry additional equipment or supplies. Nanotechnology shielding could produce new means of concealing military vehicles from a vast array of sensors including from electronic sniffers.164 Just as the space race of the 1960s produced a great deal of spin off technologies, not just for NASA, but for the U.S. military and for the civilian population as well. Similar spin offs can be reasonably expected from developing effective satellite ASAT defense. Lastly, building an overwhelming defense may actually discourage adversary nations from pursuing offensive capabilities against the U.S.165 “If a weapon is vulnerable, yet capable of dramatically affecting the outcome of a conflict, the state that possesses it has an even more powerful incentive to employ the weapon early on in a conflict”166 Conversely, if a weapon is vulnerable and not capable of affecting the outcome of a conflict, which satellite self-defense would achieve against current generation ASATS, then there would be little motivation to resort to ASATs.<br />

In addition, it is not clear that space weapons could provide effective defense for US satellites. Space weapons would be useless against a wide variety of assaults on satellites that may be within China’s reach. 65 For instance, China could cut off communication between US military forces and US satellites by means of electronic jamming, blinding satellites through the use of laser technology, or hacking into a satellite signal. Most obviously, space weapons would also fail to deter conventional attacks on satellite ground communication stations. Such attacks on ground stations are easier to execute than a ground-to-space ASAT assault. 66 The challenge for the United States is to defend its own satellites against a wide variety of potential threats without encouraging China to significantly step up its ASAT program. Various techniques and policies are capable of achieving this objective. 67 First, the United States could engage in the hardening and shielding of its satellites. Making satellites more resistant to laser attack, nuclear radiation, or hacking would contribute greatly to the defense of its satellite system. Similarly, the United States could equip satellites with the means to protect themselves from high-intensity laser beams or other harmful agents. Additionally, cheap decoy satellites could be deployed. The United States could also work to decrease dependence on individual satellites: creating redundancy by placing additional satellites in space can effectively limit the damage that any single attack can inflict. 68 Admittedly, many of these techniques are not without their drawbacks. For example, it might be difficult to hide satellites inside radar-reflecting balloons without impairing their own sensors and communications. Yet, increasing the research and resources directed towards this area might provide added passive satellite defenses.<br />

The affirmative is a mimetic simulation of war, not an objective depiction of possible outcomes. Their methodology for policy making is to Imagine Impact scenarios and compare them in a virtual simulation. This divorces the simulated from the real and dominates all other forms of representation<br />

Der Derian, 1999 (James, Prof. of IR @ UMass – Amherst and Brown University, “A Virtual Theory of Global Politics, Mimetic War and the Spectral State,” Proceedings of the Annual Meeting (American Society of International Law), Vol. 93 (MARCH 24-27, 1999), pp. 163-176, JSTOR)<br />
<br />
It might seem tendentious, especially at a time when world leaders and leading political theorists herald an epoch of democratic peace, to invoke a thinker and a concept drawn from an interwar experience. But are we not currently experiencing a similar acceleration of technological, social and political change? In the last decade, there have not been abrupt shifts in configurations of power but also in what Benjamin referred to as radical breaks in &quot;the structure of experience,&quot; that is, how we think about and represent change. My question, however, stems not only from an appreciation of the conceptual powers of Benjamin but also from the official mimetic actions that are currently underway to plot an uncertain future. I refer to the mimetic powers of military and diplomatic simulation. Sold by their users as mere preparations for worst-case scenarios, they help to produce and delimit, through holistic training, hyperreal modeling and potential negative synergy, the dangers and possibilities of the future. Digitized, virtual war games and peace games, twice removed by scripted strategies and technological artifice from the bloody reality of war, take simulation into another realm. They take us to Jean Baudrillard's fractal turf of the hyperreal, where distinctions between the simulated and the real begin to break down. Baudrillard is willing to concede distinctions of a Baconian nature, stating: &quot;To dissimulate is to feign not to have what one has. To simulate is to feign to have what one hasn't. One implies a presence, the other an absence.&quot;29 However, in societies suffused with virtual technologies, &quot;the matter is more complicated, since to simulate is not simply to feign.&quot;30 Simulations produce real symptoms, hyperreal effects: &quot;Thus, feigning or dissimulating leaves the reality principle intact: the difference is always clear, it is only masked; whereas simulation threatens the difference between 'true' and 'false,' between 'real' and 'imaginary.'&quot;31 Things get further complicated when &quot;the real is no longer what it used to be&quot;32—an apposite description of post-Cold War attitudes—and the power of simulation, magnified by a fear of the future or a nostalgia for a mythical past, comes to dominate all other forms of representation. It becomes, says Baudrillard, &quot;a strategy of the real, neo-real, and hyperreal, whose universal double is the strategy of deterrence.&quot;33 A neoliberal order that ultimately relies on the cyberdeterrence of an overwhelming U.S. superiority in military planning, logistics and information technology seems uncomfortably close to Baudrillard's simulacrum. Paul Virilio sheds similar light on the current shift of representation into what he calls the &quot;virtual theatricalization of the real world&quot;: It has taken us from statistical management to electoral polls to video wars, until politics becomes a form of &quot;cathodic democracy.&quot;34 An obsessive media vigilance over behavior combines with political correctness to transform democracy from an open, participatory form of government into a software program for the entertainment and control of all spectators. Speed enhances a global &quot;shrinking effect:&quot; &quot;With acceleration there is no more here and there, only the mental confusion of near and far, present and future, real and unreal—a mix of history, stories, and the hallucinatory Utopia of communication technologies.&quot;35 The coeval emergence of a mass media and an industrial army was the signifying moment of modernity, of a capability to war without war, producing &quot;a parallel information market&quot; of propaganda, illusion, dissimulation. However, technological accelerants such as satellite linkups, real-time feeds, and high-resolution video threaten the power of television to dissimulate. Now the danger lies in the media's power to &quot;substitute&quot; realities. With the appearance of a global view comes the disappearance of the viewer subject: In the immediacy of perception, our eyes become indistinguishable from the camera's optics, and critical consciousness goes missing. In one of his signature, panoramic scans of contemporary society, Virilio early on captured the virtual effects of new media: In our situations of televisual experience, we are living in nothing less than the sphere of Einstein's relativity, which wasn't at all the case at the time that he wrote it since that was a world of trolley cars, and at most the rocket. But today we live in a space of relativity and non-separability. Our image of time is an image of instantaneity and ubiquity. And there's a stunning general lack of understanding of speed, a lack of awareness of the essence of speed . . . .And this passage from an extensive to an intensive time will have considerable impact on all the various aspects of the conditions of our society : it leads to a radical reorganization both of our social mores and our image of the world. This is the source of the feeling that we're faced with an epoch in many ways comparable to the Renaissance: it's an epoch in which the real world and our image of the world no longer coincide.36<br />
<br />
The impact is twofold—<br />
<br />
First, the mimetic construction of war makes wars inevitable—it requires the construction of an “evil” enemy and makes extermination viable—extinction becomes necessary because it is the only predictable outcome<br />
<br />
Der Derian, 2003 (James, Prof. of IR and polisci @ UMass – Amherst and Brown University, “War as Game,” THE BROWN JOURNAL OF WORLD AFFAIRS, pp.45-6)<br />
<br />
The charge of moral equivalency—in which any attempt at explanation is identified as an act of exoneration—should not deter investigations into the dangers of the mimetic relationships operating in war and games. People go to war not only out of rational calculation but also because of how they see, perceive, picture, imagine, and speak of each other: that is, how they construct the difference of other groups as well as the sameness of their own. Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein are not the first to mine this act of mimesis for political advantage. From Greek tragedy and Roman gladiatorial spectacles to futurist art and fascist rallies, mimetic violence has regularly overpowered democratic discourse. The question, then, is how long after Baghdad has fallen will this mimetic game of terror and counter-terror last? Bush, Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein need their mimetic foes—it takes two to play. Without a reciprocal hatred, their politics and prophecies lose their self-fulfilling powers. Historically, terrorist movements either evolve into states, or, without a mass base, they quickly weaken and rarely last longer than a decade. And empires inevitably, by over-reach or defeat, fall. However, this mimetic struggle, magnified by the media, fought by advanced technologies of destruction, and unchecked by the UN or U.S. allies, has now developed a logic of its own in which assimilation or extermination become plausible solutions, credible policies. Under such circumstances, one longs for the sure bet, a predictable unfolding of events, or at least a comforting conclusion. “At this stage of the game” (as Schwartzkopf said in the midst of GW1), I have none, because the currently designed game, to rid the world of evil, cannot possibly find an end. Inevitably, what Edmund Burke called the empire of circumstance will surely, and let us hope not too belatedly, trump Bush’s imperial game as well as Bin Laden’s terrorist one. When tempted in the interim by the promise of virtuous war to solve the world’s problems, we best listen to the great Yogi: “If the world were perfect, it wouldn’t be.”<br />
<br />
Second, the divorcing of trauma from war allows killing without responsibility—this is the root of the genocidal mindset<br />
<br />
Der Derian, 2000 (James, Prof. of IR @ UMass – Amherst and Brown University, “Virtuous War/Virtual Theory,” International Affairs, Vol. 76, No. 4 (Oct., 2000), pp. 771-788, JSTOR)<br />
<br />
In a sense, war has always been a virtual reality, too traumatic for immediate comprehension. Trauma, Freud tells us, can be re-enacted, even re-experienced, but cannot be understood at the moment of shock. This is what Michael Herr was getting at in Dispatches, when he wrote about his experiences in Vietnam: 'It took the war to teach it, that you were as responsible for everything you saw as you were for everything you did. The problem was that you didn't always know what you were seeing until later, maybe years later, that a lot of it never made it in at all, it just stayed stored there in your eyes'.2 But now there is an added danger, a further distancing of understanding. When compared to the real trauma of war, the pseudo-trauma of simulation pales. But an insidious threat emerges from its shadowing of reality. In this high-tech rehearsal for war, one learns how to kill but not to take responsibility for it, one experiences 'death' but not the tragic consequences of it. In the extreme case, with the predisposed pathologies of a Milosevic in Serbia, a McVeigh in Oklahoma City, or a Harris in Littleton, Colorado, this can lead to a kind of doubling or splitting of the self that psychologists Robert Jay Lifton and Erik Markusen see as a source of the 'genocidal mentality'. But what I have witnessed is more a closing than an opening of a schism, between how we see and live, represent and experience, simulate and fight war. New technologies of imitation and simulation as well as surveillance and speed have collapsed the geographical distance, chronological duration, the gap itself between the reality and virtuality of war. As the confusion of one for the other grows, we now face the danger of a new kind of trauma without sight, drama without tragedy, where television wars and video war games blur together.<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to reject the aff in favor of reformed constructivism—only a co-opted constructivist viewpoint can critique virtual theory and explain international events<br />
<br />
Der Derian, 2000 (James, Prof. of IR @ UMass – Amherst and Brown University, “Virtuous War/Virtual Theory,” International Affairs, Vol. 76, No. 4 (Oct., 2000), pp. 771-788, JSTOR)<br />
<br />
On the epistemological spectrum, this clearly places the virtualists nearer to the constructivists than the rationalists or realists. Virtual theory repudiates the philosophical realism and positivism underlying most social science theory, where words transparently mirror objects, facts reside apart from values, and theory is independent of the reality that it represents.'3 Yet, I have found little of intellectual or pragmatic utility in the metatheoretical, structuralist, and curiously amorphous forms (again, where are the bodies/agents?) that constructivism has taken in International Relations. To me it is a step backwards, from structuralism to bloburalism, to invoke that classic of the I950s, 'The Blob', where misunderstood teenagers (something of a stretch for the star, Steve McQueen) took on an extra-terrestrial gooey blob that had emerged from a meteor. In spite of efforts to destroy it by conventional means (i.e. lots of firepower), it grows to gargantuan proportions by parasitically sucking the life out of humans. This might be something of a dramatic exaggeration, but some hyperbole might be warranted, if we are not to awake one day in the future, to find where once regime theorists ruled, critical theorists critiqued, standpoint feminists stood, epistemic communities communed, and post-structuralists problematized, only a protoplasmic trace remains. Not even the 'English school' of international theory appears to have raised the Oxbridge in time against the constructivist onslaught. Only neo-realists and neo-liberals, occupying the higher reaches of the discipline, protected by positivism from non-observable phenomena like the Blob, have so far escaped its saprophytic attack. Constructivism in International Relations has demonstrated a remarkable capability to absorb any approach that privileges epistemology over methodology, identity over interest, relativism over rationalism, social facts over empirical data. To be fair, there are less metaphorical, not quite so philosophically obtuse, more practical reasons for the growth of constructivism. It can be attributed to the quality of its scholarship, the proselytizing energy of its proponents, as well as the strategic if somewhat compromising position it strives to occupy between other 'post-modem', 'rigid', 'hardcore', 'radical' or 'strong' approaches.'4 It could be argued that constructivism is spreading because it provides new and valuable concepts for interpreting a rapidly changing world that older approaches in IR have not, and perhaps cannot provide.'5 Indeed, it could be argued that argumentation itself, now thriving in the increasingly pluralistic and fragmented subfields of IR and schools of the social sciences, favours constructivism, which at least theoretically practises (a pragmatic evaluation of competing truth-claims) what it preaches (the world is what we make of it).i6 How, then, to link virtual theory to constructivism without falling prey to its blob-like qualities? There is the conventional approach, that would rest constructivist claims with precise definitions, comparative literature reviews, theoretical analysis, and the reductionist diagram viz., the kind of professional activity that keeps us all busy and our journals in business. Following economic models, this primitive accumulation of knowledge might well result in a great leap forward to a new stage of intellectual development in International Relations. However, progress in history, as well as discontinuous, epistemic innovation in science, rarely takes the linear path of incrementalism. A less direct critique might be more effective. It need not be on the order of past polemics, like Hedley Bull's infamous frontal assault on behaviouralists, which, we should remember, was spurred by his belief that one should 'study their position until one could state their own arguments better than they could and then-when they were least suspecting-to turn on them and slaughter them in an academic massacre of Glencoe'.17 Given the nature of the beast, it might be more appropriate to play down the minor differences, to mimic constructivism, say, as predators do their prey, and co-opt it from without. As Steve McQueen discovered the hard way, Blobs are pretty much immune to flaming or caging: direct confrontation is just more thought for food. Not wishing to escalate to the thermonuclear level (as they did, counter-productively, in the sequel, 'Beware the Blob!'), I suggest a different strategy for the de-blobbing of constructivism, one that is empirical, historical, and political, which refigures constructivism as a progenitor rather than pre-empter of virtual theory.<br />

The object of this inquiry is not to conduct an internal critique of the simulation industry, nor to claim some privileged grounds for disproving its conclusions.'4 Rather, the intent is to show how, in the construction of a realm of meaning that has minimal contact with historically specific events or actors, simulations have demonstrated the power to displace the &quot;reality&quot; of international relations they purport to represent. Simulations have created a new space in international relations where actors act, things happen, and the consequences have no origins except the artificial cyberspace of the simulations themselves<br />

What we are attempting in this article is an intervention that demonstrates how the illusion of the sovereign state in an insecure and anarchic international system is sustained and how it might be challenged. It seems to us that this has become important in the present circumstances. The focus on security and the dilemma of security versus freedom that is set out in debates immediately after September 11th presents an apparent choice as the focus for dissent, while concealing the extent to which thinking is thereby confined to a specific agenda. Our argument will be that this approach relies on a particular picture of the political world that has been reflected within the discipline of international relations, a picture of a world of sovereign states. We have a responsibility as scholars; we are not insulated from the policy world. What we discuss may not, and indeed does not, have a direct impact on what happens in the policy world, this is clear, but our writings and our teaching do have an input in terms of the creation and reproduction of pictures of the world that inform colic and set the contours of policy debates. Moreover, the discipline within which we are situated is one which depends itself on a particular view of the world - a view that sees the international as a realm of politics distinct from the domestic - the same view of the world as the one that underpins thinking on security and defense in the US administration. In this article then we develop an analysis of the ways in which thinking in terms of international relations and a system of states forecloses certain possibilities from the start, and how it might look to think about politics and the international differently. Our chosen point of intervention is to examine how IR thinking works; by showing how this thinking operates, and how it relies on certain analytical moves and particular categorisations and dichotomies, we hope to demonstrate that it is not the only way that world politics could be thought through. Identifying the underpinnings of existing frameworks is an important preliminary before new thinking can be full effective and is itself a first move hi dislodging these underpinnings. We have chosen to base our analysis on the work of Hedley Bull. This is for several reasons. First, Bull acknowledges in the preface to The Anarchical Society that he owes a profound debt to Martin Wight, who first demonstrated that international Relations could be made a subject'. We take Bull then as an example of someone who was attempting to establish `International Relations' as an academic discipline, and thus as an appropriate starting point in our attempt to `disestablish' it. Second, Bull provides an example of a theorist of international relations who sets out his position in a way that makes the underlying logic clear and thus available for analysis. He is well aware of the way in which it is necessary to neglect certain aspects of world politics in order to produce `International Relations' and is quite explicit in general about the moves he makes in order to do this. Bull's logic involves the types of impossible dilemmas and contradictions that we have located in current thinking about terrorism and vulnerability. In particular he discusses the relationship between order and justice, as two fundamental principles of international relations, and then sets aside the question of justice in order to focus on order. This is the third reason for focusing on his work. There are important parallels to be made between `order' as it appears in Bull and `security' in debates after September 11th. We tease out the implications of our reading of Bull's Anarchical Society and propose that what we call generalising the international could lead to an alternative analysis of world politics, one that did not replace politics with security or justice with order.<br />

‘We are the war’ does not mean that the responsibility for a war is shared collectively and diffusely by an entire society—which would be equivalent to exonerating warlords and politicians and profiteers or, as Ulrich Beck says, upholding the notion of collective irresponsibility1, where people are no longer held responsible for their actions, and where the conception of universal responsibility becomes the equivalent of a universal acquittal. 6 On the contrary, the object is precisely to analyze the specific and differential responsibilities of everyone in their diverse situations. Decisions to unleash a war are indeed taken at particular levels of power by those in a position to make them to command such collective action. We need to hold them clearly responsible for their decisions and actions without lessening theirs by any collective ‘assumption’ of responsibility. Yet our habit of focusing on the stage where the major dramas of power take place tends to obscure our sight in relation to our own sphere of competence, our own power and our own responsibility—leading to the –well-known illusion of our apparent ‘powerlessness’ and its accompanying phenomenon, our so-called political disillusionment. Single citizens- even more so those of other nations – have come to feel secure in their obvious non-responsibility for such large-scale political events as, say, the wars in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina or Somalia – since the decisions for such events are always made elsewhere. Yet our insight that indeed we are not responsible for the decisions of a Serbian general or a Croatian president tends to mislead us into thinking that therefore we have no responsibility at all, not even for forming our own judgment, and thus into underrating the respons¬ibility we do have within our own sphere of action. In particular, it seems to absolve us from having to try to see any relation between our own actions and those events, or to recognize the connections between those political decisions and our own personal decisions. It not only shows that we participate in what Beck calls ‘organized irresponsibility’, upholding the apparent lack of connection between bureaucratically, institutionally, nationally and also individually or¬ganized separate competences. It also proves the phenomenal and unquestioned alliance of our personal thinking with the thinking of the major powermongers. For we tend to think that we cannot ‘do’ anything, say, about a war, because we deem ourselves to be in the wrong situation; because we are not where the major decisions are made. Which is why many of those not yet entirely disillusioned with politics tend to engage in a form of mental deputy politics, in the style of ‘What would I do if I were the general, the prime minister, the president, the foreign minister or the minister of defence?’ Since we seem to regard their mega spheres of action as the only worthwhile and truly effective ones, and since our political analyses tend to dwell there first of all, any question of what I would do if I were indeed myself tends to peter out in the comparative insignificance of having what is perceived as ‘virtually no possibilities’: what I could do seems petty and futile. For my own action I obviously desire the range of action of a general, a prime minister, or a General Secretary of the UN — finding expression in ever more prevalent formulations like ‘I want to stop this war’, ‘I want military intervention’, ‘I want to stop this backlash’, or ‘I want a moral revolution.’7 ‘We are this war’, however, even if we do not command the troops or participate in so—called peace talks, namely as Drakuli~ says, in our non-comprehension’: our willed refusal to feel responsible for our own thinking and for working out our own understanding, preferring innocently to drift along the ideological current of prefabricated arguments or less than innocently taking advantage of the advantages these offer. And we ‘are’ the war in our ‘unconscious cruelty towards you’, our tolerance of the ‘fact that you have a yellow form for refugees and I don’t’ — our readiness, in other words, to build identities, one for ourselves and one for refugees, one of our own and one for the ‘others’. We share in the responsibility for this war and its violence in the way we let them grow inside us, that is, in the way we shape ‘our feelings, our relationships, our values’ according to the structures and the values of war and violence<br />

Clearly, the problem of representation is compounded when the foxhole itself goes virtual. The nature of war is mutating, morphing, virtualizing with new technologies and strategies. New media, generally identified as digitized, interactive, networked forms of communication, now exercise a global effect if not ubiquitous presence through real time access. Moreover, with the magnification and dramatization of old ailments like nationalism, balkanization, and civil war by new media, virtuous war reaches not only into every living room but splashes onto every screen, TV, computer and cinema. People will live and die, figuratively and literally, by the power of images, previewed by the famine child that drew American troops into Somalia, and of the dead US Ranger dragged through the streets that hastened their departure.<br />

Turn—scenario planning makes us less prepared and causes more wars and disasters—planning for the worst case scenario makes it inevitable—the logic of preparedness was exposed as a fiction by 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina<br />
<br />

It often takes a catastrophe to reveal the illusory beliefs we continue to harbor in national and homeland security. To keep us safe, we place our faith in national borders and guards, bureaucracies and experts, technologies and armies. These and other instruments of national security are empowered and legitimated by the assumption that it falls upon the sovereign country to protect us from the turbulent state of nature and anarchy that permanently lies in wait offshore and over the horizon for the unprepared and inadequately defended. But this parochial fear, posing as a realistic worldview, has recently taken some very hard knocks. Prior to September 11, 2001, national borders were thought to be necessary and sufficient to keep our enemies at bay; upon entry to Baghdad, a virtuous triumphalism and a revolution in military affairs were touted as the best means to bring peace and democracy to the Middle East; and before Hurricane Katrina, emergency preparedness and an intricate system of levees were supposed to keep New Orleans safe and dry. The intractability of disaster, especially its unexpected, unplanned, unprecedented nature, erodes not only the very distinction of the local, national, and global, but, assisted and amplified by an unblinking global media, reveals the contingent and highly interconnected character of life in general. Yet when it comes to dealing with natural and unnatural disasters, we continue to expect (and, in the absence of a credible alternative, understandably so) if not certainty and total safety at least a high level of probability and competence from our national and homeland security experts However, between the mixed metaphors and behind the metaphysical concepts given voice by US Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff early into the Katrina crisis, there lurks an uneasy recognition that this administration—and perhaps no national government—is up to the task of managing incidents that so rapidly cascade into global events. Indeed, they suggest that our national plans and preparations for the “big one”—a force-five hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic disease—have become part of the problem, not the solution. His use of hyberbolic terms like “ultra-catastrophe” and “fall-out” is telling: such events exceed not only local and national capabilities, but the capacity of conventional language itself. An easy deflection would be to lay the blame on the neoconservative faithful of the first term of US President George W. Bush, who, viewing through an inverted Wilsonian prism the world as they would wish it to be, have now been forced by natural and unnatural disasters to face the world as it really is—and not even the most sophisticated public affairs machine of dissimulations, distortions, and lies can close this gap. However, the discourse of the second Bush term has increasingly returned to the dominant worldview of national security, realism. And if language is, as Nietzsche claimed, a prisonhouse, realism is its supermax penitentiary. Based on linear notions of causality, a correspondence theory of truth, and the materiality of power, how can realism possibly account—let alone prepare or provide remedies—for complex catastrophes, like the toppling of the World Trade Center and attack on the Pentagon by a handful of jihadists armed with box-cutters and a few months of flight-training? A force-five hurricane that might well have begun with the flapping of a butterfly’s wings? A northeast electrical blackout that started with a falling tree limb in Ohio? A possible pandemic triggered by the mutation of an avian virus? How, for instance, are we to measure the immaterial power of the CNN-effect on the first Gulf War, the Al-Jazeera-effect on the Iraq War, or the Nokia-effect on the London terrorist bombings? For events of such complex, non-linear origins and with such tightly-coupled, quantum effects, the national security discourse of realism is simply not up to the task. Worse, what if the “failure of imagination” identified by the 9/11 Commission is built into our national and homeland security systems? What if the reliance on planning for the catastrophe that never came reduced our capability to flexibly respond and improvise for the “ultra-catastrophe” that did? What if worse-case scenarios, simulation training, and disaster exercises—as well as border guards, concrete barriers and earthen levees—not only prove inadequate but might well act as force-multipliers—what organizational theorists identify as “negative synergy” and “cascading effects” —that produce the automated bungling (think Federal Emergency Management Agency) that transform isolated events and singular attacks into global disasters? Just as “normal accidents” are built into new technologies—from the Titanic sinking to the Chernobyl meltdown to the Challenger explosion—we must ask whether “ultra-catastrophes” are no longer the exception but now part and parcel of densely networked systems that defy national management; in other words, “planned disasters.” What, then, is to be done? A first step is to move beyond the wheel-spinning debates that perennially keep security discourse always one step behind the global event. It might well be uni-, bi-, or multi-polar, but it is time to recognize that the power configuration of the states-system is rapidly being subsumed by a heteropolar matrix, in which a wide range of different actors and technological drivers are producing profound global effects through interconnectivity. Varying in identity, interests, and strength, these new actors and drivers gain advantage through the broad bandwidth of information technology, for networked communication systems provide the means to traverse political, economic, religious, and cultural boundaries, changing not only how we interpret events, but making it ever more difficult to maintain the very distinction of intended from accidental events. According to the legal philosopher of Nazi Germany, Carl Schmitt, when the state is unable to deliver on its traditional promissory notes of safety, security, and well-being through legal, democratic means, it will necessarily exercise the sovereign “exception:” declaring a state of emergency, defining friend from foe, and, if necessary, eradicating the threat to the state. But what if the state, facing the global event, cannot discern the accidental from the intentional? An external attack from an internal auto-immune response? The natural as opposed to the “planned disaster”? The enemy within from the enemy without? We can, as the United States has done since September 11, continue to treat catastrophic threats as issues of national rather than global security, and go it alone. However, once declared, bureaucratically installed, and repetitively gamed, national states of emergency grow recalcitrant and become prone to even worse disasters. As Paul Virilio, master theorist of the war machine and the integral accident once told me: “The full-scale accident is now the prolongation of total war by other means.”<br />

Synthesis is impossible—we have to instead send theory off in crazy directions—rationalism will always ignore our radical critique<br />
<br />
Der Derian, 1990 (James, Prof. of IR @ UMass – Amherst and Brown University, “The (S)pace of International Relations: Simulation, Surveillance, and Speed,” International Studies Quarterly, Vol. 34, No. 3, Special Issue: Speaking the Language of Exile: Dissidence in International Studies (Sep., 1990), pp. 295-310, JSTOR)<br />
<br />
I have reflected on Keohane's well-traveled road. I have weighed its quite reason- able rules against the historical evidence, the international events born out of both accidental (famine, flood, earthquake) and intentional (war, terrorism, genocide) disasters that have taken place on this road. I have considered Keohane's destination, the higher &quot;normative grounds&quot; of &quot;international cooperation,&quot; and found it to be laudable, and indeed shared by many of the reflective routes. But his conclusion makes the unbeaten track seem more appealing if not necessary: it is not in synthesis but by learning to live with irreconcilable differences and multiple identities-in high theory and in everyday practices-that we might find our best hope for international relations. I think here Keohane might agree: unless we are willing now and then to head the big American car of international relations theory off in untried, untestable, even unreasonable directions, the only perpetual peace-to update Kant-will be that of the roadside kill.' This essay is not a polemic against Keohane's rationalist institutionalism, nor is it a theoretical defense of post-structuralism. They are no longer needed, for each side has begun to recognize the legitimacy of the dialogue if not the epistemological claims of the other.2 Judging, however, from critical comments that have arisen as much from confusion as from disagreement, a few prefatory points are in order about some differences between rationalists and poststructuralists that resist synthesis. First, post-structuralism is a semio-critical activity, ever searching for and seeking to dismantle the empirico-rational positions where power fixes meaning.3 Second, post- structuralism does not hold that reflectivists or rationalists reflect the field of international relations. Both use and are used by language, by the tropes, rhetoric, narratives and grammar that make up an array of ambiguous and indeterminate signifying practices. It is this heterological nature of discourse that dominant powers, in a demonstrative, hegemonic act, always dream of fixing, reducing, subjecting to a single, monological meaning. Third, the rationalists demonstrate this power play when they construct a transcendental, privileged space to make truth-claims about international relations (like those made by game and rational choice theory from the supposed high-point of scientific progress). Alternatively-and Keohane deserves credit for now making it less of an alternative-the rationalists might simply ignore the problem of discourse, in the vain hope that it will ignore them. But the poststructuralists are always aware of-and always irritating others by demonstrating-the stickiness of the web of meaning.<br />

<br />
Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns. This background is essential for appreciating how the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails. The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3 To some degree, a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, new budget realities and unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds. The 2011 National Security Space Strategy, released February 4, is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation and greater attention to space policy in general. • The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and norms of behavior for responsible space operations.” [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements in the longer-term. • The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right. • The strategy commits to reforming export controls. “ The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps as striking as the prevalence of such passages, however, is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand the kind of independent space-based military capabilities that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. These policy movements toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 In sum, the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also, and more importantly, a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details.<br />

Although a less likely occurrence than interference with satellite ground stations or communications links, direct interference of satellites by conventional, nuclear, or directed energy weapons is much more difficult to defend against. In this case, the primary source of protection for satellites stems from the difficulties associated with launching an attack of conventional weapons into and through the space environment to specific locations. It is worth noting that, despite recent incidents involving ASATs impacting a country’s own spacecraft, no hostile attacks on an adversary’s satellite have been documented to date. The distinct nature of the space environment itself may provide a certain level of protection for space assets. For example, energy weapons must overcome atmospheric challenges and be effectively targeted at satellites, which orbit at great distances and move at very high speeds. Also, the distances and speeds involved in satellite engagements can be exploited to enhance protection. Satellites in lower-altitude orbits are more difficult to detect with spacebased infrared sensors because of their proximity to the Earth’s atmosphere. The fact that Low Earth Orbit (LEO) can be reached in a matter of minutes, while Geostationary Orbit (GEO) takes about a half-day to reach by completing a Hohmann transfer orbit, illustrates the unique protection of dynamics associated with different orbits.30 Lower orbits are also less predictable because of greater atmospheric effects, such as fluctuations in density in the upper atmosphere, which alter satellite drag. For example, at an altitude of about 800 km, the predictability of orbits is limited to an error of approximately one kilometer one day in advance of the calculation, using readily available models. Higher operational orbits also raise the power demands for terrestrial radars, leaving only optical systems capable of tracking satellites in altitudes beyond 5,000 km. Some military systems are being placed into higher orbits such as Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) or GEO, but orbits are largely dictated by function. Surface finishes and designs optimized for heat dissipation and radar absorption can also reduce the signatures of a satellite and the ability to observe it, further complicating negation targeting efforts, as in the US stealth satellite program Misty (cancelled in 2007).31<br />

<br />
Basing weapons in orbit also pre­sents difficult technical obstacles. They would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all kinds of outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic signals, even natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against such threats would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is bulky and adds mass, thereby greatly increasing launch costs. Orbital weapons would be mostly autonomous mechanisms, which would make operational errors and failures likely. The paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to predict, which would make hiding large weapons problematic. And because satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many weapons.<br />

5. No solvency – Cyber-attacks on our satellites will kill hegemony – ASATs can’t solve that<br />
<br />
Watts, 2011 - Senior Fellow, Center for Strategic &amp; Budgetary Assessments (Barry, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA; COMMITTEE: SENATE U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION,” 5/11, lexis)<br />
<br />
What role might China's space capabilities play should such a conflict occur nonetheless? Answers to this question vary widely. In 2001, the commission on U.S. national security in space warned that unless steps were taken to reduce the vulnerability of America's space systems, the country would face the real possibility of a &quot;Space Pearl Harbor.&quot; 21 After the PRC's successful ASAT test in January 2007, Geoffrey Forden from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that even with months of planning and prepositioning, the best China could do against U.S. space capabilities would be to attack nine LEO satellites. He argued that the short term consequences of such an attack would be limited, and that, due to the redundancy of U.S. space systems, even under the worst case scenario China's all out ASAT attack would &quot;only reduce&quot; America's use of precision guided weapons and satellite communications into and out of the theater. 22 My inclination is to think that Forden's assessment better reflects actual PRC ASAT capabilities between now and 2020 than did the 2001 space commission's warning of a looming Space Pearl Harbor. Ashley Tellis, whose assessment of China's military space strategy in the autumn 2007 issue of Survival sparked a strident debate over China's counterspace capabilities and strategic goals in early 2008, 23 mentions several other options directed energy weapons, electronic attacks including jamming, and terrestrial attacks against the ground segments of U.S. space systems that provide alternatives to direct ascent, kinetic attacks against U.S. satellites. To these alternatives I would add cyber attacks aimed at disrupting U.S. computer networks. There are other ways, then, to try to turn U.S. dependence on space into vulnerabilities in addition to kinetic attacks on satellites, and some ways are certainly easier than others.<br />

6. Plan doesn’t solve hegemony - ground facilities would still be vulnerable – they are also crucial to our satellite links<br />

<br />
The development of space weapons would not significantly mitigate three of the generalized threats to U.S. space capabilities mentioned above: denial and deception, attacks on ground stations, and high-altitude nuclear explosions. To counter an adversary’s denial and deception techniques, for example, the United States might seek to employ multiple, redundant satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensing channels; avoid detection of its reconnaissance satellites; and improve analysis of currently available imagery. Evidently, orbiting weapons cannot prevent physical attack on satellite ground infrastructure; more effective counters are familiar security techniques such as physical surveillance, fences, guards, and back-up systems. A high altitude nuclear explosion, and its resulting bands of persistent, damaging beta radiation, would require shielding (to reduce the radiation dose) and, in some cases, hardening (to increase tolerance of semiconductor circuitry to radiation) of satellites in potentially vulnerable orbits. Technological means to proactively depopulate the trapped electrons from the Van Allen belts—such as the orbiting of lead or uranium foil to scatter and disperse the electrons into the atmosphere—are possible but in their infancy. Electronic Warfare. Neither would space weapons easily resolve the oft-cited threat of electromagnetic jamming—unsuccessfully employed against U.S. Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) systems in Iraq. In time of war, as demonstrated in Iraq, ground- or air-launched munitions (in some cases guided by the enemy jammer’s own signals) can be a direct and effective countermeasure to ground-based jamming.24 In the face of more persistent jamming, ground- or air-deployed pseudosatellites, so-called pseudolites, could boost GPS and other satellite signals in a local area. For example, an unmanned aerial vehicle transmitting GPS signals from an altitude of 20 kilometers (60,000 feet) would provide 10,000 times the received signal strength on Earth as a GPS satellite with equivalent transmission energy. Such augmentation would reduce by a factor of 100 the effective radius of a GPS jammer—or, conversely, increase by a factor of 10,000 the power required to jam the original area, a significant improvement insofar as robustness is concerned. Furthermore, a GPS transmitter on an unmanned aerial vehicle could radiate ten times the power of a GPS satellite, rendering hostile jamming efforts more difficult by a further factor of 10. Neither “hacking” (unauthorized intrusion into satellite control networks), “spoofing” (fake instructions to a satellite), nor ground-based jamming of command links could be significantly mitigated by space weapons. A space mine closely accompanying a U.S. satellite easily jam its command link. Destructive attack on the little jammer could readily provoke an instantaneous and automatic destruction of the jammed satellite, limiting the utility of such a protective space weapon once the space mine was in place.<br />
<br />
7. Obama’s New Space policy prevents an Arms Race – support for multilateralism and dialogue<br />
<br />
Zhang 2011 - Professor of Political Science and Director of the Center for Asia Pacific Studies at Lingnan University [Baohui Zhang March/April &quot;The Security Dilemma in the U.S.-China Military Space Relationship: The Prospects for Arms Control,” Asian Survey, Volume 51, No. 2, pp. 331-332<br />
<br />
Once the above measures begin to relax the security dilemma, China, the U.S., and other major powers can work toward a multilateral agreement governing the military use of space. Although China’s military space programs, especially its January 2007 ASAT test, contradict its official policy of seeking to ban weapons in space, they can be interpreted as a hedging strategy in response to the security dilemma. When the U.S. opposed efforts to ban the weaponization of space, the PLA felt compelled to initiate its own military space programs. Now that the Obama administration is willing to ban weapons in space, this could bring both China and Russia to the negotiating table for a multilateral agreement. Indeed, in February 2008 China and Russia jointly proposed such a treaty at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Chinese experts have repeatedly emphasized that arms control for outer space remains China’s top priority, though it is prepared for an arms race if necessary. President Hu’s statement on the issue in November 2009 effectively reaffirmed this position. Therefore, the current strategic adjustment by the U.S. and President Obama’s new space policy could make a multilateral approach feasible. According to a PLA strategist assessing the new directions in U.S. space policy: If Obama, who champions the theme of change, forsakes the longtime U.S. strategy for space hegemony and is willing to pursue arms control in outer space through an international treaty, then, with effective mechanisms for monitoring and verification, the world community will be able to walk on the right track toward peaceful use of space, eradication of [the] arms race, and realization of permanent peace. 58<br />

8. US / Chinese space military cooperation increasing now<br />
<br />
Krolikowski, 2011 - Visiting Scholar, George Washington University Space Policy Institute (Alanna, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA,” 5/11, lexis)<br />
<br />
The United States and China increasingly interact in space and already engage in space-related activities that could be termed cooperative. For example, the United States provides China with warnings of imminent orbital conjunctions between Chinese space assets and other space objects, because preventing another debris- producing event serves U.S. interests. Both countries also participate in many of the same multilateral processes addressing space issues. 11<br />

Space-based lasers, however, face significant operational barriers. Because the satellite would move with respect to a fixed point on Earth, continuously covering strategically important regions (in clear weather) would require a constellation of several dozen lasers. The lasers would be effective only against a narrow class of targets, such as combustibles, aircraft canopies, and thinskinned storage tanks. Common military objectives such as bunkers, armored vehicles, and buildings would be basically immune to laser attack. Rudimentary shielding by smoke screens, ablative cork coatings, or even pools of water can provide a substantial and cheap defense for nearly any target. Furthermore, space-based lasers could not attack targets under cloud cover-on average 30-40 percent of the Earth's surface and some 70 percent of the time in parts of Germany or North Korea.<br />

Space-based Lasers for Force Projection. Using a space-based laser constellation to attack ground targets would face the logistical and cost barriers described in the time-critical targets section above. Furthermore, any target valuable enough to be protected by air defenses or other denied-access techniques could be fitted with laser countermeasures, including flatbed diffuse reflectors of titanium oxide or other material, ablative shields such as cork or more advanced ablative materials, dyed water that would absorb energy by boiling,62 or low-technology countermeasures such as smoke or fog generators. Naturally, while projected to be inexpensive, the costs of such countermeasures must be considered.<br />

The current hardware, software and networks within the Defense Department are obsolete and dysfunctional. The department continues to operate with a culture that does not as yet acknowledge that its computer systems are technically unsuited for operations in the age of cyber warfare. The existing cyber defense deficiencies are deeply rooted in the ways the Defense Department acquired information technologies over the past decades. The existing flaws are enterprise-wide and pervasive. Regardless how much money is spent on cyber security protection most of it is inadequate to make the existing proliferation of networks adequately secure. The total number of DoD systems projects in FY10 was 5,300. <strong>* Each of these programs is subdivided into subcontracts, many of which are legislatively dictated. The total number of DoD data centers was 772, which makes their defenses unaffordable.</strong> ** The information technology environment in the Defense Department is fractured. Instead of using a comprehensive and defensible infrastructure, which presently consumes 57% of the total information technology budget, money is spread over thousands of mini-infrastructures that operate in separate silo-like structures, which are almost entirely managed by contractors. Such profligacy is guaranteed to be incompatible and indefensible. Over ten percent of the total Defense Department IT budget is spent on cyber defenses to protect tens of thousands of points of vulnerability. The increasing amount of money spent on firewalls, virus protection and other protective measures cannot keep up with the rapidly rising virulence of the attackers.<br />

The most vulnerable segment of any space system is the ground node or ground stations that control the on-orbit assets or receive the data downlinks from the satellites. Since ground stations are typically considered “soft” targets and many locations can be easily identified through good intelligence, they are probably the most susceptible to attack from conventional weapons. Equally vulnerable would be the launch facilities used to place satellites into orbit. Therefore, substantial investments to place weapons in space would be counter-intuitive if ground stations are more susceptible to attack and can be easily neutralized. Perhaps discretionary funding should be allocated to hardening critical space nodes, ground nodes and communication links making them less susceptible to intentional electronic jamming, blinding, spoofing and conventional strikes. The author contends that these passive and active defense measures help make on-orbit and ground space systems more resistant to attack and are more economically feasible than placing weapons in space.<br />

Arguably, the Chinese leadership recognized that the 1995–1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis—the high point of coercive statecraft—had important costs throughout the region for China. 25 In the wake of that militarized event, a wave of counterbalancing against China occurred (Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, etc., all reinvigorated their security relationship with the United States). Furthermore, such activity received much international approbation. In response, China engaged in a very public campaign aimed to refurbish its image internationally: the New Security Concept and associated smile diplomacy by the PRC. Today, China’s policy toward Taiwan is characterized by a “de-emphasis on the use and show of military force in cross-Strait relations.” 26 Beyond that, China does not appear to be demanding more from Taiwan as its power position improves. Most observers of China’s policy over the past decade would characterize Hu Jintao as having moderated Beijing’s demands. While the shift in leadership in Taipei has centrally affected relations across the Strait, China’s policy has permitted Taiwan a wide range of behavior that would not have been possible in around the year 2000. Not all of these can be attributed to President Ma’s election.<br />

<br />
If all goes as planned, China would have launched between 12 and 16 ASATs, each capable of destroying a strategically important deep-space satellite. However, the United States military has many, many more deep space satellites. There are, as of December 2007, 32 functioning GPS navigation satellites even though the original design calls for only 24. [See above, left] In addition, the US has 23 military communications satellites, six early warning satellites that observe missile launches, and six surveillance satellites—most of which detect and monitor electronic transmissions of potential adversaries but one, apparently capable of photo-reconnaissance—in geostationary orbit. These satellites are reinforced by a private network of 90 commercial communications satellites, owned and operated by US corporations, that presumably could be used to replace destroyed military communications satellites. (Eighty-four percent of the space communications to military forces in the Iraqi theater of operations during Operation Iraqi Freedom used commercial satellites.) On top of that, there are 75 civilian and the 64 military/civilian communications satellites in low Earth orbit— although they do not have the same transmission capacity as the geostationary satellites. The United States may be the country most dependent on space for its military activities. But it is also the least vulnerable, because of the tremendous redundancy of its space assets. Of course, China does not have to destroy all these satellites to seriously hamper US military efforts in the Taiwan Straits. It would only have to destroy those satellites that have a direct line of sight to the conflict: this includes eight military and 22 US civilian communications satellites in geostationary orbits. Nevertheless, China would have to choose between attempts to destroy the satellites that guide US precision guided bombs and those satellites which relay the orders to drop those bombs. It simply cannot launch enough ASATs to destroy both systems. But does China have enough to wipe out even a single set of American satellites? Let’s examine the possibilities: Attacking Navigation Satellites You need a launch pad to attack a target in deep space, like an American GPS satellite. China has just three of these pads. This really restricts China’s offensive capabilities in space. Assuming that China devotes all its deep-space ASATs on GPS satellites, it could destroy at most 16 satellites. At the current time, with 32 functioning navigation satellites, that would still leave 16 satellites still working. Over a period of years, the debris from those collisions would represent a significant threat to more than those satellites immediately attacked. They would pass, time and time again, through the belts of debris that resulted from the interceptions. However, it would probably take longer than the military conflict China initiated with these attacks before additional satellites were destroyed by subsequent collisions. Usually, there are about nine GPS satellites over China at any given time. If China somehow managed to destroy all of these, it could eliminate America’s use of precision-guided munitions—for a few hours, until the orbits of other GPS satellites take them over the Taiwan Straits. Quite quickly, the constellation’s other 23 satellites would fill in the gap due to their normal orbital movement. Even if it destroyed 16 satellites, China could still only interrupt GPS over the Straits for about eight hours. During the other 16 hours there would be the four or more satellites present over the target area for bombing runs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights, and ship tracking. This pattern of eight hours off followed by 16 hours when GPS could be used would be repeated every day until new satellites are launched. This outage would certainly cause difficulties; GPS not only guides American precision bombs – it helps pilot UAV spy planes, and monitor ships. US casualties might increase , with air crews forced to fly missions during daylight hours – and conduct some of the &quot;dull, dirty, and dangerous&quot; missions now flown by robotic planes. It’s a situation no American commander would want to face. But it would not be a catastrophic one. And it would not eliminate precision weaponry, UAVs, or any other American activity that depends on GPS. Keep in mind, this is the worst of the worst-case scenarios. It is highly unlikely that China could remove all the satellites over the conflict area at the same time. After all, attacking 16 satellites, all in different orbits with ASATs launched on just four different rockets involves some fairly complex orbital maneuvers. A much more likely scenario is that, at best, China could destroy four GPS satellites in the initial wave followed roughly seven hours later by four more, a third wave at roughly 45 minutes after that, and the final wave two hours later. Thus, the GPS attack is spread over ten hours and never eliminates all the satellites visible over the area of conflict at the same time. This Chinese attack on US navigation satellites would not eliminate or even significantly degrade the US’s ability use precision-guided munitions..<br />

<br />
A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of 'peace through strength' deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that '… the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use'.33 This drift toward usage is strengthened by a strategic fact elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, 'anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand'.34 The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent 'dual capability' of spaceborne weapon components. As Marc Vidricaire, Delegation of Canada to the UN Conference on Disarmament, explains: 'If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land'. 35 To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting 'Death Stars', capable of sending munitions hurtling through the Earth's atmosphere. The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense 'use or lose' pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting Death Stars with automated 'hair trigger' devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed 'complexly interactive, tightly coupled' industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other's flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, '[t]he odd term &quot;normal accident&quot; is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable'.36 Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to 'normal accidents'. It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, 'even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage — even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!'. 37 In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: 'One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people'.38 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.<br />

<br />
Moreover, China is concerned that putting weapons in space would constrain its civilian and commercial space activities. China sees itself as a developing economic space power, dependent on free access to space for financial gain. However, U.S. driven space weaponization directly threatens this access. Due to the threatening nature of space weapons, it is reasonable to assume that China and others would attempt to block their deployment and use by political and, if necessary, military means.11 Many Chinese officials and scholars believe that China should take every possible step to maintain the effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent. This includes negating the threats from missile defense and space weaponization plans.12 In responding to any U.S. move toward deployment space weapons, the first and best option for China is to pursue an arms control agreement to prevent not just the United States but any nation from doing so – as it is advocating presently. However, if this effort fails and if what China perceives as its legitimate security concerns are ignored, it would very likely develop responses to counter and neutralize such a threat. Despite the enormous cost of space-based weapon systems, they are vulnerable to a number of low-cost and relatively low-technology ASAT attacks including the use of ground-launched small kinetic-kill vehicles, pellet clouds or space mines. It is reasonable to believe that China and others could resort to these ASAT weapons to counter any U.S. space-based weapons.13 This, however, would lead to an arms race in space. To protect against the potential loss of its deterrent capability, China could potentially resort to enhancing its nuclear forces. Such a move could, in turn, encourage India and then Pakistan to follow suit. Furthermore, Russia has threatened to respond to any country’s deployment of space weapons.14 Moreover, constructing additional weapons would produce a need for more plutonium and highly enriched uranium to fuel those weapons. This impacts China’s participation in the fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT).15 Eventually, failure to proceed with the nuclear disarmament process, to which the nuclear weapon states committed themselves under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, would damage the entire nuclear nonproliferation regime itself, which is already at the breaking point. As Hu Xiaodi, China’s ambassador for disarmament affairs, asked, “With lethal weapons flying overhead in orbit and disrupting global strategic stability, why should people eliminate weapons of mass destruction or missiles on the ground? This cannot but do harm to global peace, security and stability, and hence be detrimental to the fundamental interests of all States.”16<br />

b. Impact – the NPT is key to avoid extinction<br />
<br />
Mueller, 2001 – Professor of IR (Harald, Prof International Relations at Univ. Frankfurt “The Future of Arms Control”, Nuclear Weapons: A New Great Debate)<br />
<br />
Globally, non-proliferation or prohibition agreements, particularly those relating to weapons of mass destruction (WMD), are a precondition for banning existential dangers for global stability, ecological safety and, in extremis, even the survival of the human race. Arms control can create sufficient security and stability to motivate countries to commit themselves to cooperation in other sectors where it is mutually profitable and indeed indispensable for solving problems for society and the economy in the age of globalisation. Such agreements also impact heavily on regional balances and help, if successful, to prevent the greatest dangers of escalation of existing regional conflicts. Successful arms control agreements build shared security interests among erstwhile rivals and enemies. Hence, they even help to de-escalate the general level of regional conflict. This brings us to the second major significance of the triad of arms control, disarmament and humanitarian law. Taken together, these present an important and powerful alternative to a security policy based entirely on self-help and its extension, defensive alliances. While defence capabilities present, in the final instance, the essential backbone of any security system, arms control, disarmament and humanitarian law form a first line of security that consists of internationally agreed rules. The security dilemma which leads to costly and risky arms races and, in extreme circumstances, even to war, can be considerably lessened if there are generally accepted rules for upper limits of troops, military equipment, for the shape of military doctrines and the form of exercises, which give states the confidence that their neighbours do not harbour aggressive intentions. These rules delineate clear distinctions between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, and thus help to distinguish between the rule-abiding membership of such a security regime and the (hopefully very few) rule-breakers against which the capabilities of the lawful majority can then be directed.<br />

Offensive counterspace capabilities could permanently damage or destroy costly satellites and leave substantial harmful debris in space if they physically destroy the satellites. Space debris can collide with and destroy satellites and is an important element in thinking about space weapons. Like radioactive fallout from nuclear war, debris from space war can linger for many years. While the word “debris” sounds harmless based on common usage, most orbital debris moves at a speed of more than seventeen thousand miles per hour. Thus, relatively small debris pieces are highly destructive to a satellite in a collision. One only has to imagine what life would be like if thousands of bullets from World War II were still whizzing around to get some feel for the danger that debris growth poses for the future of space. At present, twelve thousand detectable debris pieces that are ten centimeters or larger orbit the earth, as well as millions of 6 China, Space Weapons, and U.S. Security smaller pieces. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) estimates China’s 2007 ASAT test alone increased orbital debris by 10 percent, and its fallout will take more than one hundred years to reenter the atmosphere. The implications of these new counterspace developments for peacetime and crisis stability, as well as the conduct of warfare, are profound. The sudden major loss of satellite function would quickly throw U.S. military capabilities back twenty years or more and substantially damage the U.S. and world economies. While backup systems could partially compensate for this loss, U.S. military forces would be significantly weakened.<br />

<br />
If there are significant military and national security advantages to be gained via commercial space, then it is important to recognize that there is the potential for great harm by placing military requirements at the forefront of how we think about space. While the January 2001 Space Commission report (and others) focus on the vulnerability of U.S. space assets and the potential for a “space Pearl Harbor,” there is a “flip side” that must also be considered. John Newhouse, senior fellow at the Center for Defense Information, states: The [Space Commission] report does not call for but implies a U.S. need to accelerate development of antisatellite weapons, some of them space-based. But deploying such weapons will press other countries to develop and deploy countermeasures. And in any such tit for tat, the United States has the most to lose, since it is far more dependent on satellites for commercial communications and data-gathering operations than any other country. Among the effects could be a sharp rise in the cost of insuring commercial satellites and an outcry from industry.4 And, as John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at the George Washington University points out: “There appears to be no demand from the operators of commercial communication satellites for defense of their multibillion-dollar assets. If there were to be active military operations in space, it could be difficult not to interfere with the functioning of civilian space systems.”5 In other words, weaponizing space could be costly to an American industry that has great promise to grow and increase its contribution to the U.S. (and world) economy. Ultimately, a vibrant commercial space industry will support and enhance U.S. military capabilities far better than letting military requirements dominate space policy. Therefore, the government should avoid overregulating commercial space activities and imposing costly military requirements.<br />

<br />
The second factor adding to the security dilemma in the U.S.-China military space relationship involves U.S. efforts to rewrite the established rule of nuclear deterrence, i.e., mutually assured destruction (MAD), that prevailed during the Cold War era. According to Glasner and Fetter, the U.S. has been pursuing a new deterrence posture that combines offensive and defensive capabilities.25 Chinese strategists believe that the U.S. military space program, to a significant extent, is driven by missile defense. For example, in a study organized by the General Staff of the PLA, Major General Xu Hezhen charges that the U.S. is developing space-based laser weapons for missile defense. According to him, “A total of 14–24 satellites deployed on different orbits will constitute a defensive system. Relying on data from early warning systems, it can intercept ballistic missiles launched from anywhere in the world.”26 In another study, Major General Ling Yongshun argues that the U.S. is implementing a coherent plan to neutralize other countries’ strategic deterrence through the deployment of space-based missile defense. As he observes: Using space weapons to attack ballistic targets is a major goal of space weapon development. The U.S. believes that others’ ballistic missiles pose significant threats to its security. To be immune from this threat, the U.S. is putting major efforts into ballistic missile defense, with space-based weapons being one of the important intercepting platforms.27 In October 2008, the U.S. Congress approved $5 million for an independent study of possible space-based missile defense. This move gravely alarmed the Chinese military, which believed that the deployment of space-based missile defense could become inevitable. In fact, some PLA experts have claimed that “Star Wars has come back.”28 Li Daguang even charged that this decision by the U.S. Congress amounted to “declaring a new Cold War against China.”29 Chinese military strategists believe U.S. missile defense poses a real threat to China’s nuclear deterrent. Until recently, the Chinese military tended to believe that U.S. missile defense could not effectively deter a major nuclear power like China or Russia. It was thought that a range of countermeasures, such as deploying decoys and multiple warheads, could be employed to deceive and overwhelm U.S. missile defense. Now, however, with the maturing of a multilayered missile defense system by the U.S. and its allies, Chinese nuclear experts are losing confidence in China’s offensive capabilities. This pessimism was illustrated in a 2008 interview of Wang Wenchao in a Chinese military magazine. Wang, credited with being the chief designer of China’s sea-based strategic missiles, expressed grave pessimism about China’s offensive nuclear capability against U.S. missile defense. He said, “I have done research: Facing a multi-tiered missile defense system, if any single layer can achieve a success rate of 70%, then 100 single warhead missiles could all be intercepted even if they are mounting a simultaneous attack.”30 This is why Wu Tianfu—arguably the most important deterrence strategist of the Second Artillery of the PLA, which runs China’s strategic nuclear forces—charges that the U.S. has “forced China to engage in a space arms race.”31 More specifically, U.S. missile defense has forced China to integrate space war with its strategic nuclear deterrence. China must possess the ability to weaken American space-based assets such as early-warning satellites, to ensure the credibility of its own offensive nuclear forces. Thus, space war and nuclear war are now intertwined in Chinese strategic thinking. Indeed, China’s official media have credited Wu with establishing the PLA’s first space war research institute.32<br />

<br />
Of course, there have been arguments about the tensions in the regime. Many NNWS continue to feel slighted by the perception that the NWS have abandoned serious, sustained commitment to disarmament under Article VI of the NPT. However, with respect to the regime’s foundational norms on the negative implications of nonproliferation for security and non-transfer, these disputes have never escalated beyond the third phase of norm change, where old norms are disregarded and new ones emerge. The complete disarmament of the NWS remains a distant and challenging goal; yet, successive NPT Review Conferences have sought to strengthen the treaty by enhancing measures to discourage, detect, and punish noncompliance.43 The strength of the nonproliferation norm diminishes as the security dilemma becomes acute*that is, when states view nuclear weapons as desirable for their deterrent effect in the absence of security guarantees. However, security needs must be balanced with maintaining good standing in the international community. States may feel constrained by and vulnerable because of the nonproliferation norm, but the majority still accept its overall intent and purpose. Without recognizing how the security environment affects the nonproliferation (non-acquisition) norm, it is easy to arrive at the erroneous assessment that the regime is faltering. We should be cognizant of how norms evolve within this regime, how systemic as well as ideational factors play a role. While arguments about contradictions and gaps in the normative framework are bound to happen, given systemic changes, these do not necessarily suggest a regime crisis, particularly in light of continued efforts to strengthen the institutions meant to encompass the original norm.<br />

Two weeks ago China put a man in space, a signal of China's arrival -and of the arrival of this grave question. Beijing has invested heavily in commercial development of space and will become a significant economic competitor in that sphere. But such peaceful competition presumes a framework of stability, and it is inconceivable that China can pursue a mainly nonmilitary space program while feeling vulnerable to American military dominance. China has constructed a minimal deterrent force with a few dozen nuclear-armed ICBMs, but US &quot;global engagement&quot; based on a missile defense, will quickly undercut the deterrence value of such a force. The Chinese nuclear arsenal will have to be hugely expanded. Meanwhile, America's &quot;high frontier&quot; weapons capacity will put Chinese commercial space investments at risk. No nation with the ability to alter it would tolerate such imbalance, and over the coming decades there is no doubt that China will have that capacity. Washington's refusal to negotiate rules while seeking permanent dominance and asserting the right of preemption is forcing China into an arms race it does not want. Here, potentially, is the beginning of a next cold war, with a nightmare repeat of open-ended nuclear escalation.<br />

China also fears the increasing population of space debris. Such debris, resulting from 50 years of space activity, already poses a considerable hazard to spacecraft. Under U.S. space weaponization plans, this crowding problem could worsen as a large number of space weapons could be deployed in LEO. The launching and testing of weapons would also increase space debris. Moreover, deploying space-based weapons in the increasingly crowded realm of LEO would leave less room for civilian systems. Those problems would also occur during periods of peace. If a number of satellites were to be destroyed during the course of a war, some scientists warn, they would create so much debris that it would prevent future satellites from being stationed in space and generally limit space access. Indeed, pointing to the debris problem, Chinese scientists and officials have said that space weaponization should be considered an environmental threat as well as a security problem.<br />

It is also important to consider the chain of events that is likely to occur if the United States tries to dominate space militarily and the effects that weaponizing space could have on the commercial space sector. John Newhouse, senior fellow at the Center for Defense Information, states: The [Space Commission] report does not call for but implies a U.S. need to accelerate development of antisatellite weapons, some of them space-based. But deploying such weapons will press other countries to develop and deploy countermeasures. And in any such tit for tat, the United States has the most to lose, since it is far more dependent on satellites for commercial communications and data-gathering operations than any other country. Among the effects could be a sharp rise in the cost of insuring commercial satellites and an outcry from industry. 68 In other words, weaponizing space could be costly to an American industry that has great promise to grow and increase its contribution to the U.S. (and world) economy. Ultimately, a vibrant commercial space industry will support and enhance U.S. mili- tary capabilities far better than letting military requirements dominate space policy. Therefore, the government should avoid overregulating commercial space activities and imposing costly military requirements. For example, the Heritage Foundation has recommended designating the Global Positioning System as critical national infrastructure, making the Department of Defense the lead agency responsible for GPS, and deploying a more secure GPS satellite network. 69 Although GPS was originally designed for and is operated by the U.S. military, 70 it is now interconnected with commercial satellites, and civilian and commercial use now dwarfs military use. More stringent military requirements imposed on the GPS system could have adverse effects on the commercial sector, such as increased complexity and higher cost of equipment. The past decade has seen expanded commercial use of sophisticated communications satellites for the Internet, television, and other broadband applications, but commercial suppliers still struggle under tight launch and export restrictions. Currently there are major efforts afoot in Congress to ease federal regulations imposed on private commercial space ventures, to deal with structural problems caused by activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and to promote private space ventures. 71 Space-related defense systems and strategies, if not wisely structured, could seriously hinder the development of future commercial activities in space and, in the long run, could harm America’s defense capabilities. Conversely, the Pentagon’s ability to defend the nation could benefit from a flourishing of commercial activities. The weaponization of space could ultimately lead to the federal government regulating commercial satellites for military purposes. As a result, the growth of private-industry ventures in space could be hindered by poorly conceived specifications and regulations in the name of national defense. There are unintended consequences of military requirements on certain kinds of dual-use technology.<br />

Frequently, the crisis has weakened the power of the merchants, industrialists, financiers, and professionals who want to develop a liberal capitalist society integrated into the world. Crisis can also strengthen the hand of religious extremists, populist radicals, or authoritarian traditionalists who are determined to resist liberal capitalist society for a variety of reasons. Meanwhile, the companies and banks based in these societies are often less established and more vulnerable to the consequences of a financial crisis than more established firms in wealthier societies. As a result, developing countries and countries where capitalism has relatively recent and shallow roots tend to suffer greater economic and political damage when crisis strikes--as, inevitably, it does. And, consequently, financial crises often reinforce rather than challenge the global distribution of power and wealth. This may be happening yet again. None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. Bad economic times can breed wars. Europe was a pretty peaceful place in 1928, but the Depression poisoned German public opinion and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. If the current crisis turns into a depression, what rough beasts might start slouching toward Moscow, Karachi, Beijing, or New Delhi to be born? The United States may not, yet, decline, but, if we can't get the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.<br />

Policy requires specification of the administrative process for implementation<br />

Mayer – Professor of Social Work at Fordham University – 1985 [Robert R., Policy and Program Planning: A Developmental Perspective, p. 19)<br />
<br />
In the work cited earlier, Lowi, (1972) argues that in making a policy it is not enough to specify the sanctions to be applied and the end to be achieved; it is also necessary to specify the process by which those sanctions are to be implemented. A policy therefore has three elements: (1) an end or set of objectives to be achieved, (2) a sanction by which to achieve that end, and (3) an administrative mechanism by which the sanction is to be applied. <br />
<br />
B. The Affirmative doesn't specify the Congress, Courts or Executive branch<br />

Elmore, Professor of public affairs at the University of Washington, 1980 (Political science quarterly, pg. 605)<br />
<br />
Analysis of policy choices matters very little if the mechanism for implementing those choices is poorly understood.  In answering the question, “What percentage of the work of achieving a desired governmental action is done when the preferred analytic alternative has been identified?”  Allison estimated that in the normal case, it was about 10 percent, leaving the remaining 90 percent in the realm of implementation<br />

Fitz, 09 (Marshall, Center For American Progress, Director of Immigration Policy at American Progress, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, key legislative strategists in support of CIR and has served as a media spokesperson on a broad array of immigration policy and legislative issues, quoted extensively across spectrum of international, national, presented at national conferences and universities on immigration matters, advised numerous members of Congress on immigration, helped draft major legislation, Prosperous Immigrants, Prosperous Americans, How to Welcome the World’s Best Educated,Boost Economic Growth, and Create Jobs, December 2009)<br />
<br />
Immigrants who come to the United States to study at our best universities and then go to work at our nation’s leading companies contribute directly and immediately to our nation’s global economic competitiveness. High-skilled immigrants who have started their own high-tech companies have created hundreds of thousands of new jobs and achieved company sales in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet despite the importance of such immigrants to the nation’s economic success in a global economy, our current high-skilled immigration system , while inadequate safeguards fail to prevent against wage depression and worker mistreatment. The reforms outlined in this paper will help establish a 21st century immigration system that serves the nation’s economic interests and upholds our responsibilities in a global economy. Of course, our current immigration policies have failed the country on many fronts beyond the high-skilled policy arena. And the urgent need for comprehensive, systemic reforms is beyond question. The national debate has understandably focused up to this point on the most visible and most highly charged issue—ending illegal immigration. Solving that riddle and ending illegal immigration is indisputably a national imperative and must be at the heart of a comprehensive overhaul of our system. But reforms to our high-skilled immigration system are an important component of that broader reform and integral to a progressive growth strategy.1 Science, technology, and innovation have been—and will continue to be—keys to U.S. economic growth. The United States must remain on the cutting edge of technological innovation if we are to continue driving the most dynamic economic engine in the world,2 and U.S. companies must be able to recruit international talent to effectively compete in the international innovation arena. To be certain, educating and training a 21st century U.S. workforce is a paramount national priority and the cornerstone of progressive growth. Improving access to topflight education for everyone in this country will be the foundation for our continued global leadership and prosperity.3 But it is shortsighted in a globalized economy to expect that we can fill all of our labor needs with a homegrown workforce. In fact, our current educational demographics point to growing shortfalls in some of the skills needed in today’s economy.4 And as global economic integration deepens, the source points for skill sets will spread—such as green engineering in Holland or nanotechnology in Israel—the breadth of skills needed to drive innovation will expand, and global labor pools must become more mobile. Reforming our high-skilled immigration system will stimulate innovation, enhance competitiveness, and help cultivate a flexible, highly-skilled U.S. workforce while protecting U.S. workers from globalization’s destabilizing effects. Our economy has benefitted enormously from being able to tap the international pool of human capital.5 Arbitrary limitations on our ability to continue doing so are ultimately self-defeating: Companies will lose out to their competitors making them less profitable, less productive, and less able to grow; or they will move their operations abroad with all the attendant negative economic consequences. And the federal treasury loses tens of billions of dollars in tax revenues by restricting the opportunities for high-skilled foreign workers to remain in the United States.6 Access to high-skilled foreign workers is critical to our economic competitiveness and growth, but facilitating such access triggers equally critical flip-side considerations, in particular the potential for employers to directly or indirectly leverage foreign workers’ interests against the native workforce. Current enforcement mechanisms are too weak to adequately prevent fraud and gaming of the system.7 And current regulations tie foreign workers too tightly to a single employer, which empowers employers with disproportionate control over one class of workers. That control enables unscrupulous employers to deliberately pit one group of workers against another to depress wage growth.8 Even when there is no malicious employer intent or worker mistreatment, the restriction of labor mobility inherently affects the labor market by preventing workers from pursuing income maximizing opportunities.<br />

The push for China currency legislation comes as President Barack Obama is urging Congress to approve free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama and legislation known as Trade Adjustment Assistance to help U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk told reporters on Wednesday he expected Obama to send the pacts to Congress within the next several weeks. The bills are expected to pass with bipartisan support, but many Democrats are anxious about the trade deals fearing they will lead to more manufacturing job losses. Reid told reporters on Thursday he planned to take up the Trade Adjustment Assistance bill next week. &quot;My goal is to get that done as quickly as we can&quot; and then send it to the House for approval, Reid said. He added that would hopefully set the stage for action on the three trade pacts. As for the China currency bill, &quot;we will move that at the right time,&quot; Reid said, without elaborating.<br />

It is one of the most sophisticated and technologically advanced machines ever conceived. The Next Generation Space Telescope, named for former Apollo-era NASA administrator James Webb, is actually designed to look all the way back to the beginning of time - 14 billion light years. It will also aid in detecting life on other planets, as well as catalogue rare cosomlogical phenomena like gamma ray bursts and supernovas. But in an era of budget cutting, it is seen by many on the Hill as a luxury we can't afford: The House Appropriations Committee released its 2012 Commerce, Justice and Science funding bill today, ahead of a scheduled committee markup Thursday. The bill provides $50.2 billion overall for the nation's projects in those three areas, which is $7.4 billion less than President Obama's budget request. NASA's budget is slashed by $1.6 billion, which is $1.9 billion less than Obama wanted. About $1 billion of that comes from the end of the shuttle program, and NASA Science funding is cut by $431 million from last year. The bill also terminates funding for the James Webb Space Telescope, which is billions of dollars over budget and plagued by poor management,&quot; an Appropriations Committee press release says flatly. While management problems are a little more subjective, the telescope is indeed massively over budget, as we've told you before. In November, a congressional panel described the telescope as &quot;NASA's Hurricane Katrina,&quot; because of its destructive toll on other agency projects. That review found the telescope's price tag had mushroomed to $6.5 billion and that it would not be ready until at least 2015. Then, just last week, the watchdog site NASA Watch obtained a memo from Goddard Space Flight Center describing that it may not launch until after 2018 -- even that is &quot;unfeasible,&quot; the report said.<br />

<br />
Mr. Daley will need all his political skills to tackle what we think should become one of the signature accomplishments of his tenure: the return of liberalized trade as a centerpiece of Democrats' vision of economic competitiveness and globalization. Bill Clinton embraced this vision, and he understood that trade liberalization required strong bipartisan efforts. To pass the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) in 1993, we set up a bipartisan war room within the White House, headed by Bill Daley and former Republican Congressman Bill Frenzel. Messrs. Daley and Frenzel worked together, with the full support of the president and White House staff, to push Nafta through the House with 102 Democratic and 132 Republican votes, and on to an equally bipartisan total in the Senate. Liberalized trade was also at the heart of President Clinton's view that America needed international competition to succeed in an increasingly trade-dependent world. Not every Democrat supported this view, though Mr. Clinton strongly pushed it within the party. But we quickly lost this bipartisan consensus and the progress Mr. Clinton had forged in his own party. By 1997, when Mr. Clinton sought renewal of &quot;fast track&quot; authority to negotiate more trade agreements, Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich could not corral his majority to support the president and the effort failed. And although President George W. Bush did manage to make congressional headway on trade with his Republican majorities, he did so principally with Republican support. In the first two years of President Obama's tenure, progress on trade was largely frozen. Mr. Obama stated his support for the uncompleted pieces of the Bush trade agenda—free trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia, the dangling Doha World Trade Organization round, and Russia WTO accession—but little measurable progress was made. Now, in a few short weeks, Mr. Obama has renegotiated the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement and announced that it will be a priority in the new Congress. He has taken steps to resolve a longstanding trade dispute with Mexico over trucks that goes back to the Clinton years. And, with his selection of Mr. Daley, the president has hired the man who can make this trade revival a reality. What now? Our experience tells us that the only way to push a major trade agreement through Congress—even one where the nominally pro-trade GOP rules the House—is with strong and unyielding presidential leadership, a unified White House staff and cabinet, and a genuinely bipartisan approach to stakeholders and the Congress. First, the president must be fully committed. Nafta was a bipartisan success in no small part because of the personal involvement of Mr. Clinton and sometimes tortuous negotiations with members of Congress. It's true that some pork was doled out and more than one bridge was built as a result of a Nafta vote—something they probably still understand in Chicago. Second, the White House and cabinet must be unified in pulling for passage. Everyone from Vice President Joe Biden to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk must be fully engaged, without hesitation. Don't forget the crucial role that then-Vice President Al Gore's 1993 debate with Ross Perot played in swinging public opinion in favor of Nafta. Third, the effort must be genuinely bipartisan. We'll need scores of members from both sides to make passage possible (this is particularly true with a large tea party GOP caucus that is as yet undefined on trade). Perhaps Mr. Obama could even take a page from the 1993 playbook and bring into the White House a prominent Republican—former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, former Reagan Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein, or a former congressman such as Jim Kolbe or Chris Shays, for example—to help quarterback the effort. Finally, the president has to show that his commitment to the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement isn't a one-off. Moderates and independents who have been spooked by an economic approach they see as veering strongly to the left are looking for signs that this president embraces their centrist views. A commitment to deficit reduction, sustained outreach to business, and a genuine embrace of trade liberalization must go hand-in-hand. Most importantly, the president should commit to advancing the pending trade agreements with Colombia and Panama right now, instead of leaving them until later as some in his administration would prefer. Why bother taking a half-measure on trade? A full-throated campaign for the Korea, Colombia and Panama trade agreements, along with WTO accession for Russia, can help reset this presidency. Capitalizing on his selection of Mr. Daley with a renewed American trade policy, Mr. Obama has the chance to remind moderates in both parties and independent voters that he is the man they voted for in 2008—a leader who appreciates the goals of businesses large and small, and who sees America as confident and innovative enough to remain the global economy's True North. It also gives the president the opportunity to strengthen ties with longtime allies who cultivate liberal democracy, reject old and ugly political and social traditions, stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us when it comes to fighting the world's darkest forces, and are willing to open their markets to us—or in the case of Russia, to encourage that behavior. It won't be easy, and it may alienate some in the Democratic base, but it is essential.<br />

Now is the time to advance an aggressive trade and global engagement agenda that will create jobs, revitalize the economy and reassert America’s leadership. Such an agenda offers an excellent opportunity to advance the goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years and putting Americans back to work. KORUS will boost GDP by at least $12 billion through expanded exports and create more than 70,000 American jobs. Failure to enact KORUS would cost more than 340,000 American jobs and cut $35 billion in exports. Those jobs would be lost because the European Union and others would gain a competitive advantage over America in Korea as their free-trade agreements go into effect soon. <br />

Based on the headlines, Americans could be forgiven for thinking that the recent U.S.-South Korean trade deal is only about motors and meat. But the agreement includes much more. To be sure, the Obama administration won important new concessions from Korea on autos. These include regulatory changes that that will facilitate the export of more U.S. vehicles to Korea, and delays in the phasing out of U.S. auto tariffs — changes that converted Ford, Chrysler and the UAW from opponents to strong supporters. Additionally, although Korea did not eliminate its remaining barriers to certain U.S. beef, the U.S. will continue to press Korea on these barriers, and the overall agreement has strong backing from U.S. meat exporters, because it will increase U.S. beef and pork exports by an estimated $2 billion once Korea’s high current duties are eliminated. But beyond autos and animals, there are other key reasons why America needs the Korea FTA. Here are five: 1. America Must Export to Grow. Over the next 5 years, an astounding 87% of global growth will take place outside the United States. By 2030, the world is will have some 2 billion new middle class consumers. Meanwhile, America is growing at an anemic 2.5%. To grow, we must export. Of the world’s 12 largest economies, we are dead last in the share that exports add to our economy. The Korea FTA can help to reverse this, by enabling our manufacturers, farmers and service firms to tap into a vibrant Korean market that is growing twice as fast as ours. 2. America’s Exporters and Workers Deserve Fairness. Korea imposes an array of unfair trade barriers on American exports. Harley-Davidson “Fat Boy” motorcycles are subject to 8% duties, varieties of Campbell’s soup face duties of 30% and U.S. farm products face an average applied duty of 52%. Additionally, U .S. manufacturers and farmers are often shut out of Korea’s opaque regulatory process. These and others barriers are unfair to American companies and their workers. But they are often entirely legal under international trade rules. Only a reciprocal trade deal will remove or reduce Korea’s trade barriers on a comprehensive basis, by eliminating or significantly reducing tariffs, opening up Korea’s services and procurement sectors and making Korea’s regulatory and customs rules more transparent. Harleys, for instance, would be duty-free immediately, as would two-thirds of American farm exports.<br />

WASHINGTON — US Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Friday that he opposed free trade deals with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea but set the stage for moving forward on the stalled accords next week. &quot;I do not like the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, the Korea Free Trade Agreement, or the Panama Free Trade Agreement. I will vote against them,&quot; the top Democrat said in remarks laying out the chamber's agenda. &quot;But I have been asked on numerous occasions to move these trade matters to the floor. And that's what I've agreed to do,&quot; he said. Reid set up a procedural vote at 5:30 pm (2130 GMT) Monday on a broad trade measure, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), to which he aimed to attach an aid package for US workers hurt by overseas competition. The Republican-led House of Representatives has already approved the GSP, but would have to vote on it again if the Democratic-held Senate, as expected, amends it with so-called Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) before passing it. Democrats, backed thus far by the White House, have said they will not move forward on the three trade deals unless Congress first approves Trade Adjustment Assistance. &quot;We're going to do the trade adjustment assistance, and then, with a few other stops in the middle, we're going to do the free trade agreements,&quot; Reid predicted. Congressional aides said they expected the Senate to attach TAA to the broader bill, and ultimately pass the legislation, sending it back to the House, but that it was unclear exactly what the next step would be. President Barack Obama, who has made passage of the three trade deals a plank in his jobs-creation platform, could submit the accords for congressional approval or wait for House passage of the GSP legislation.<br />

U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Wednesday expressed confidence that Congress has a bipartisan strategy in place to pass the long-overdue free trade agreements (FTAs) with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. But he stopped short of specifying when his administration will submit related bills to Capitol Hill. U.S. and South Korean officials apparently hope that the bilateral FTA will be ratified by Congress before South Korean President Lee Myung-bak makes an official state visit to Washington next month. In an interview with CNBC, Geithner admitted that the government wanted to get the bills passed over the summer. &quot;But I think we're more confident now -- that we have Republican and Democrat agreement for a strategy to get these three bills passed, Korea, Colombia and Panama,&quot; he said.<br />

<br />
In his speech on the economy on September 8, President Barack Obama tied our nation's fiscal recovery to the passage of three free trade agreements (FTA) currently awaiting approval. Said the president: Now it’s time to clear the way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for American companies to sell their products in Panama and Colombia and South Korea — while also helping the workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition. (Applause.) If Americans can buy Kias and Hyundais, I want to see folks in South Korea driving Fords and Chevys and Chryslers. (Applause.) I want to see more products sold around the world stamped with the three proud words: “Made in America.” That’s what we need to get done. While the Republicans may disagree with much of what the president proposed, their leadership is adamantly and enthusiastically behind the trade agreements. Evidence of the bipartisan support for the agreements is found everywhere. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kent.) wrote an op-ed piece in the Washington Post lamenting the languishing of the trade agreements on President Obama’s desk and imploring him to pass them along to Congress. For nearly three years, Republicans and a number of Democrats have been calling on the president to approve these deals to create a level playing field with America’s competitors overseas, vastly expand the market for U.S. goods, strengthen our ties with three important allies and create jobs for Americans. Yet the deals have been stuck at the White House since Inauguration Day. Publicly, the White House claims to support all three agreements. It even said in July that Republicans are the ones standing in the way of ratification. But this is absurd because Congress can’t ratify trade agreements until the president submits them for congressional approval. He knows as well as I do that once he does, all three would garner wide bipartisan support. Earlier, Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) mused as to why the President hasn’t moved more quickly to fast track these regional trade pacts. Upon reaching a path forward for the three pending Free Trade Agreements in the Senate, Senate leaders have cleared an important hurdle. Expanding markets for U.S. small businesses is a critical component of the Republican Plan for America's Job Creators, and further delay of these job-creating trade bills is unacceptable. I look forward to the House passing the FTAs, in tandem with separate consideration of TAA legislation, as soon as possible. Boehner’s ardent advocacy of these FTAs was laid out more fully on the Speaker’s blog. The Obama Administration tried to shift the blame (again) for its failure to submit job-creating trade agreements to Congress for ratification. A White House spokesman told ABC News they “have yet to hear specifics on what the ‘path forward’ consists of…” Well, here’s a “path forward”: send Congress the trade agreements and the Republican-led House will pass them without delay.<br />

Washington D.C. – Today the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics held a hearing to evaluate the progress and viability of commercial launch service providers to supplement our international partners in supplying cargo to the International Space Station (ISS). Once the Space Shuttle program is retired following the STS-135 mission, currently scheduled for July 8th 2011, NASA plans to rely on new commercial launch service providers to supply, maintain, and utilize the multi-billion dollar ISS. In his opening remarks, Subcommittee Chairman Steven Palazzo (R-MS) noted that Congress has generally been supportive of NASA’s commercial cargo efforts. However, he said that “Too often, requests for information have been met with a veil of secrecy and claims of company proprietary information.” Subsequently, Palazzo said, “I want to remind NASA and the commercial partners that you are spending taxpayer money, and lots of it. So you will not be exempt from oversight and financial scrutiny.” In closing, Palazzo said, “NASA has spent $1.25 billion over the last five years and it is my firm hope that before the year is out we will have real proof that this investment has been worthwhile.” NASA has spent $500 million since 2005 on the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, intended to demonstrate commercial cargo delivery capabilities to the ISS from two commercial partners, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) and Orbital Science Corporation (Orbital). Despite initial assurances that NASA would not expend any money to buy services until these systems were fully demonstrated, NASA has spent over $466 million toward the purchase of cargo delivery services even though no demonstration flights to the ISS have been performed. “We – NASA, Congress, our space station partners – expect these companies to perform,” Full Committee Chairman Ralph Hall (R-TX) told the witnesses today. “It is my sincere hope and desire that they perform and meet their contract goals. There is no plan B if they encounter severe technical or schedule challenges, and I want them to succeed.” Chairman Hall has been highly skeptical of the approach the Obama Administration has chosen. “I simply regret that there continues to be so much uncertainty about our nation’s ability to reliably get cargo to Station with the final Shuttle flight now less than two months away,” Hall said. “It is unfortunate that the decisions of this Administration have created so many questions and turmoil in our outlook for space.” While evaluating technical milestones and progress in developing commercial cargo capabilities, today’s hearing did not address more fundamental questions, such as whether there is credible economic demand for services to low earth orbit – governmental or non-governmental – to provide an economic rationale that makes commercial space ventures financially viable. <br />

(CNN) -- The marching orders from Congress and the White House to NASA were pretty straightforward. Go out and build a new big rocket to replace the retiring space shuttle fleet. Unlike the shuttle, the new rocket has to be powerful enough to get out of low Earth orbit and carry humans to an asteroid and eventually Mars, perhaps even the moon. There must also be a test flight by 2016. But at this point, NASA officials are warning of a potentially devastating setback to future space exploration. Its first new rocket in 40 years may not happen because the agency doesn't think the $8 billion budgeted over the next three years is enough. &quot;We have done calculations with current models and approaches to doing this type of development and it doesn't work with funding constraints combined with schedules that were laid out in the Authorization Act,&quot; Doug Cooke, NASA's associate administrator for exploration systems, told CNN. Congress has already responded that unless NASA can prove there's not enough money, the rocket must -- by law -- be built. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, a key space agency supporter, was adamant when he spoke to CNN: &quot;NASA must stop making excuses and follow this law. I believe the best and brightest at the space agency can build upon the $9 billion we've already invested in advanced technology to design a new heavy-lift rocket, while taking a stepping-stone, pay-as-you-go approach.&quot;<br />

While Shelby and others see the plan as &quot;pipe dreams and fairy tales,&quot; Scott Miller, a professor of aerospace engineering at Wichita State University, said that the new NASA budget is exactly the step the agency needed to make. Shelby said that although the Ares I probably would have done a fine job, he agreed with NASA's decision to contract with private industry to create rockets to taxi astronauts into low-Earth orbits. &quot;The technology and skill, the abilities to make a rocket like that are known,&quot; Shelby said. &quot;That is not a research project. If I want to go to the QuikTrip or drive from Wichita to Kansas City, I don't need to build my own car. I go to the dealer and buy one off the shelf.&quot; Although some jobs will be lost with the cancellation of Constellation, NASA officials say jobs will be created as it invests in different technologies. Some companies working on Constellation probably will receive contracts to work on NASA's new projects. &quot;This is what I could call an obvious correction in NASA's mission,&quot; Miller said. &quot;They are really where they ought to be.&quot; John M. Logsdon, the founder of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, agreed. &quot;It's old technology,&quot; Logsdon said of Constellation. &quot;It's an old solid rocket. It's fundamentally the kind of booster that has been launching the shuttle since 1981. That is not the way to build a 21st-century space program.&quot; Logsdon acknowledged that using private rockets as taxis to go into low-Earth orbit was &quot;a fundamental departure in the way NASA does human space flight. &quot;Giving up on the 2020 goal is a little sad for me.&quot; But, Logsdon said, increasing the investment in NASA as it explores new technologies to explore space is a sign that the agency is setting itself on the right trajectory. &quot;We're making an investment in the future that will be measurably greater than any other nation.&quot;<br />

Shelby’s key to stop gridlock <br />

<br />
Sen. Richard Shelby's (R-Ala.) decision to place a &quot;blanket hold&quot; on all presidential nominations until a pair of billion-dollar earmarks for his home state are fast-tracked has reignited the debate over the parliamentary tactics being deployed by the Republican Party. It also has thrust into the spotlight the clout that major defense contractors often wield on the political process. On Thursday evening, news broke that the Alabama Republican has taken the extraordinary measure of holding up at least 70 &quot;nominations on the Senate calendar&quot; -- essentially threatening to filibuster the confirmation processes if they came to a vote. The move has spurred a series of recriminations from Democratic officials who see it as yet another instance of over-the-top obstructionism of the president's agenda. It also has turned inquisitive eyes towards Shelby himself. The Senator confirmed that he launched the hold, in part, because he is upset with a tanker contract worth $35 billion that remains unresolved between Northrop Grumman/EADs and Boeing. Shelby favors the Northrop Grummann-EADS bid largely because it would result in tankers being assembled in his home state. The two contractors, in turn, have donated to Shelby's campaign committees, hoping ostensibly to secure favor or at least an audience with the Alabama Republican. According to a review of campaign finance records, Shelby's political action committee received $7,500 in donations from EADS's PAC during the past two election cycles and an additional $21,500 from Northrop's PAC since 2000. [UPDATE: The investigative journalism group Center for Public Integrity looked at all political action committees associated with Northrop Grumman andconcluded that Shelby has received at least $108,233 in contributions since his first Senate election in 1986.] Airbus Chairman T. Allan McArtor, meanwhile, donated $1,500 to Shelby in May 2009. Samuel Adcock, EADS Senior Vice President of Government Relations, donated $1,000 to Shelby in 2003. A fellow lobbyist and top executive at the company, Ralph Crosby, donated the same amount that same year. One other EADS employee, Bacon Douglas, donated $1,500 in 2003. The strongest connection between Shelby and EADS, however, may not involve campaign contributions. The senator's former legislative director, Stewart Hall, is a major lobbyist for the defense contractor -- he was signed up by EADS North America in 2006 while a member of the firm the Federalist Group. During that time period, the Federalist Group was given $240,000 to help advance the company's legislative interests. When Hall left for another major lobbying firm, Ogilvy, he brought EADS with him -- receiving $160,000 in compensation for his work for the company. To be sure, Shelby was just one of many lobbying targets for EADS and Northrop Grumman -- both of whom are major players in the world of money in politics and influence peddling. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), for one, received a series of suspicious donations from the companies after he threw his support behind granting them the $35 billion Pentagon contract. Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), meanwhile, serves on EADS's board. A host of prominent Democratic lawmakers -- from former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle to current Vice President Joseph Biden -- also had one-time staffers who, at one time, lobbied for EADS. For Shelby, moreover, there are other compelling interests at play. A major tanker plant in the heart of Alabama could result in hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs for his state. And well before he decided to hold up 70 presidential nominees, he proved he was willing to go to great parliamentary lengths to secure goodies for his state. In 2009, Taxpayers for Common Sense ranked him the second most proficient securer of earmarks, having brought home $114,484,250 worth of pet projects. In addition to the EADS contract, Shelby also is currently attempting to secure a $45 million improvised explosive device testing lab for the FBI, according to CongressDaily. In April 2009, Shelby held up another Obama nominee -- Ashton Carter to the post of Pentagon acquisition chief -- in order to receive assurances that the competition for the contract between Northrop/EADS and Boeing would be &quot;conducted in an open and transparent manner based on a best value process.&quot; Unlike with that hold, however, Shelby's most recent efforts to stop Obama nominees has earned him the scorn of the president's advisers. Briefing reporters on Friday morning, white House Press Secretary Roberts Gibbs called Shelby's actions to strongest reflection to date of how badly Washington is broken.<br />

<br />
The battle over the Hubble Telescope may very well be a political one. This week, the Republican favored House of Representatives proposed cutting the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the 2012 NASA budget. The budget was determined by the House Appropriations commerce, justice, science subcommittee and led by Republican Representative Frank Wolf from Virginia. Wolf and other appropriators said the JWST program &quot;is billions of dollars over budget and plagued by poor management.&quot; Not long after this budget cut was proposed, Wolf's opponent on the Senate subcommittee of the same nature, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat from Maryland, released a statement which said cutting the Webb telescope is a terrible idea. &quot;Today the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies passed a bill that would terminate the James Webb Space Telescope, kill 2,000 jobs nationwide and stall scientific progress and discovery. It was a shortsighted and misguided move,&quot; Mikulski said. &quot;The Webb Telescope will lead to the kind of innovation and discovery that have made America great. It will inspire America's next generation of scientists and innovators that will have the new ideas that lead to the new jobs in our new economy. It seems as if the Senate (Democrats) and the House (Republicans) will spar over this issue and determine Webb's fate. The funding bill will be considered by the Full Appropriations Committee on July 13.<br />
<br />
The plan would be contentious<br />

<br />
Another likely bone of contention with Congress is the James Webb Space Telescope, which an outside panel has found faces a cost overrun of at least $1.5 billion. In the new request the Webb telescope would get only $375 million to continue fabrication and testing while NASA conducts its own calculations. The budget request carries no launch date for the telescope, and the agency says there will not be one until the fiscal 2013 request a year from now. The independent review ordered by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), who chairs the appropriations panel that funds NASA, estimated that launch of the deep-space infrared telescope will have to slip more than a year from its old September 2014 target.<br />

<br />
Legislators seeking to rein in government spending have put the troubled James Webb Space Telescope up for cancellation, saying the successor to NASA's Hubble observatory is haunted by poor management and out-of-control costs. The next-generation space telescope is mired in a budgetary black hole. With an estimated cost of $6.5 billion and a cascade of delays, the flagship space mission could still be on the ground in 2018, NASA officials told Congress in April. Managers privately said launch of JWST could slip even later due to federal spending cutbacks. President Obama's 2012 budget proposal called for flat spending on JWST at $375 million annually over the next five years. Developed as the replacement for the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST is a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency. With a 21.3-foot-diameter primary mirror, the telescope is designed to peer back in time almost to the Big Bang, giving astronomers a glimpse of infant galaxies as the universe cooled after its formation. The proposal to terminate JWST came from the House Appropriations Committee's panel overseeing NASA. The committee released their 2012 spending bill Wednesday, calling for more than $1.6 billion in cuts to NASA's budget from this year's levels. The Republican-led House subcommittee suggested a $16.8 billion NASA budget for fiscal year 2012, which begins in October. That's $1.9 billion less than the White House proposed in February. &quot;The bill also terminates funding for the James Webb Space Telescope, which is billions of dollars over budget and plagued by poor management,&quot; lawmakers said in a press release. The Senate and the White House, which include JWST supporters, will weigh in on the federal budget before it becomes law. The budget must also pass the full House of Representatives. NASA officials have repeatedly told Congress, researchers and journalists that JWST's exorbitant cost is prohibiting the agency from conducting other astrophysics missions. JWST's budget problems will likely keep NASA from launching a gravitational wave detector named LISA or the International X-ray Observatory until the 2020s.<br />

A House panel recommends killing the Northrop Grumman-built James Webb Space Telescope, calling the Hubble successor “billions of dollars over budget and plagued by poor management.” Overall, the House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science subcommittee backs funding NASA at $16.8 billion in fiscal 2012, a cut of $1.9 billion to President Barack Obama’s budget request, according to a committee statement. The subcommittee is scheduled to approve its draft of the spending bill that also covers the Commerce and Justice departments on July 7. The bill still must pass in the full House and be reconciled with a Senate version before becoming law. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) defends the committee’s decisions. “Given this time of fiscal crisis, it is also important that Congress make tough decisions to cut programs where necessary to give priority to programs with broad national reach that have the most benefit to the American people,” Rogers says. NASA’s future space telescope has run into its share of trouble, going $1.5 billion over budget and seeing its launch date slip at least three years.<br />

Nasa is fighting to save its next-generation space observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope. Politicians want to end the project – one of the most complex ever conceived by space engineers – even though billions of dollars have already been spent on its construction. Scheduled for launch in 2016, the James Webb, intended to replace the ageing Hubble Space Telescope, would orbit in deep space, a million miles from Earth, and peer into the dawn of the universe. Its observations would answer major questions about the structure of the cosmos, say astronomers. The cost of the observatory has soared from an initial estimate of $1.6bn (£996m) to more than $6.5bn (£4bn). As a result, budgets for other astronomical research projects have been slashed, leading the journalNature to describe the James Webb as &quot;the telescope that ate astronomy&quot;. Last week the US House of Representatives' appropriations committee on commerce, justice, and science decided that it had had enough of these escalating costs and moved to cancel the project by stripping $1.9bn from Nasa's budget for next year. A terse statement, released by the Republican-dominated committee, said that the project &quot;is billions of dollars over budget and plagued by poor management&quot;. The decision still has to be approved by the full appropriations committee, the House and the Senate. Nevertheless, analysts say the telescope now faces a struggle to survive.<br />

One day before Atlantis was set to launch — marking the end of the storied space shuttle program — the Canadian government seemed caught off guard by a proposal in the U.S. Congress to kill a major new space telescope in which Canada is heavily invested. But a senior official here on Thursday underscored how important the James Webb Space Telescope is to Canadian ambitions in space. Canada is also spending $150 million in it. On Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives' Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science approved a yearly budget for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that does not include funding for the telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which has yielded a heap of amazing images and data. Federal Industry Minister Christian Paradis, in Florida with his 10-year-old son to watch the shuttle's historic launch, seemed to have had no warning of the decision. It comes at a time when U.S. politicians are debating deep government budget cuts in a range of areas. &quot;I was just told about this,&quot; Paradis told reporters near the launch pad. &quot;I will take the time to fully analyze what it is going on and check with the (Canadian Space Agency). Standing nearby, Steve MacLean, president of the CSA and an astronaut who went on two space shuttle missions, said the Webb telescope is absolutely worth trying to save. &quot;I think the one thing that people in North America will remember from the astronomy program in a hundred years is what the Hubble Telescope has done so far and what the James Webb Telescope could do,&quot; Hopefully, the cash-strapped U.S. government will figure out a way to fly the Webb, he added. &quot;It's that telescope and a few other things that we're doing on the ground that will teach us much about our future. Canada has a major role in this telescope. We have a technology that is at the heart of the telescope that's involved in precisely pointing it.&quot; The telescope is slated to launch in 2014 and use infrared technology to detect the first stars, quasars and supernovae of the early universe with unprecedented sensitivity. It is to be positioned 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. The Webb telescope project has been criticized for being poorly managed and for a budget that reportedly ballooned to $6.5 billion U.S. from $1.6 billion U.S..<br />

In an interview Monday with NBC News, Obama said it was too early for the comparison, but he didn't rule it out. &quot;Harry Truman ran against a do-nothing Congress. This Congress hasn't done much so far, but it still has an opportunity over the next several months to actually do something that helps the American people, and I want to give them a chance,&quot; the president said. &quot;What is not an option is doing nothing.&quot; Mary Stuckey, a communication and political science professor who studies presidential rhetoric at Georgia State University, began to hear echoes of a Truman campaign in August. &quot;It's pretty clear that's what he's doing, pushing hard to say, 'If you want me to do stuff, give me a Congress that will work with me.' He's engaging in the 'running against Congress strategy,&quot;' Stuckey said. &quot;It's not like it hasn't occurred to just us that the only people who are more unpopular are members of Congress. You don't have to go back to Harry Truman to say that running against Congress, that would be smart.&quot; Still, White House officials think that the initial GOP reaction to Obama's bill - which included some conciliatory remarks - suggested that some Republican leaders are worried about losing their majority next fall if the economy is still tanking.<br />

Today, Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson announced that there are enough votes in the Senate as well as the House of Representatives to pass free trade agreements with Columbia, Panama and South Korea. This announcement places even greater pressure on President Obama to finally submit the agreements for a congressional vote. The President has touted the agreements as job-creating measures since early 2011 and recently stated that the reason the agreements have not been passed was “the refusal by some in Congress to put country ahead of party.”  However, this claim continues to ring hollow considering the main holdup has been the president himself, who has delayed submitting the legislation due to a debate on Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA).<br />

Text: The President of the United States should issue an executive order mandating the increase in funds for the James Webb Telescope. <br />
<br />
The presidency is the best starting point for directing space policy – it is the central institution responsible for the plan -- congressional action alone doesn’t solve. <br />
<br />
Goldman, 92 [Space Policy an Introduction, Iowa state Press, Nathan, 0813810248, p. google books] <br />
<br />
ALTHOUGH THE CONSTITUTION establishes separation of powers among coequal branches of government, the presidency has become the central institution of American government. The dramatic increase in the visibility and importance of foreign and military affairs has enhanced the presidential powers of commander in chief and chief diplomat. The president's roles as commander in chief of the armed forces and as chief administrator of the federal bureaucracy ensure executive preeminence over the diplomatic, military, and intelligence establishments. After the Vietnam War, the Watergate scandal of 1975, and again after the Iran-Contra affair of 1987, the Congress attempted to reassert its power in these arenas. The Challenger disaster directed Congress's attention also toward a renewed interest in the creation and implementation of space policy. But the Congress cannot speak with a unified voice, does not have ready access to bureaucratic expertise and information, and can rarely respond to events as quickly as the president can. In assessing the relative strength of the two branches, one should distinguish between the powers to authorize and appropriate funds for military and intelligence forces and the powers to command these forces. The president shares the former in degrees with Congress; the latter are his almost exclusively. As chief diplomat, he has preeminence in foreign affairs, determining national interests and recommending to Congress the means to protect these interests. Until the late 1980s, space policy resulted as much from the interest and powers of the presidency as from the relative indifference of Congress. The president, assisted by executive departments and agencies, determined the na- tional policies and the role of space in their fulfillment. Few members of Congress have had a keen interest in space policy. Space has not usually involved personal entitlements that require special legislation. Nor does space provide sufficient economic activity in most home states and districts to warrant close attention. Absent sizable and focused interest-group activity. Congress hastened lo follow the White House and public opinion. Yet, clear public opinion is often nonexistent for secret military and intelligence space programs and it is volatile for civilian programs because the public perceives space mainly as en- tertainment. The White House, therefore, has until recently formulated space policy in a relative political and institutional vacuum. Several factors suggest now that congressional and, indeed, presidential consideration of space policy may increase. The importance of space worldwide and the shrinking American lead in space technologies and applications dictate a closer review of the subject. The slowness of NASA's recovery from the Challenger disaster impugned the ability of the executive branch to make and implement space policy. As President Reagan struggled with the Iran-Contra scandal and with lame-duck status, the Congress controlled by the other party exerted itself politically and institutionally. <br />

And, only the counterplan restores leadership in Space that generates certainty about the civil space program <br />

<br />
Logsdon seemed to suggest that personalities can affect space policy as well as process. He noted that May 25 is the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; speech before a joint session of the Congress. Then he stated something half wistfully about the current president. &quot;'How do we get ourselves out of this morass?' Logsdon asked. Fifty years ago, he noted, we had an external motivation in the Soviet Union; a similar driving force doesn't exist today. '[They] kind of fall back on presidential leadership,&quot; he said. &quot;I doubt this is going to happen, but I would hope that on the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's own speech, next Wednesday, President Obama has something positive to say about working together internationally to find a global strategy for exploration -- I would not hold my breath on that happening, but something like that needs to be done.'&quot; Implicit in this statement is that the process of developing space policy can be the most efficient in the world, but still be broken if the personalities involved do not know what they are doing. Logsdon, who generally supports Democrats, is implying that President Barack Obama's space policy as regarded human space flight is broken. Whether the president can fix what has been broken in a single speech is open to question. Indeed, Obama gave the sort of speech that Logsdon wishes he would make on May 25, 2011, last year, on April 15. Like many of the president's speeches, it created chaos and acrimony. Part of the reason for that was that the speech itself was flawed, with its sneering about a return to the Moon and its airy promises about going to an asteroid and then to Mars. The other part is that there was a lack of follow through. Space policy is now in chaos with competing factions pulling this way and that, with a limited budget that cannot possibly cover every one's agenda. In this President Obama shares with his predecessor. President George W. Bush made an excellent speech in early 2004 about space exploration and the need to nurture commercial space. But his follow through, efforts to keep his plan on track and adequately funded, left much to be desired. That left an opening for President Obama to cancel Bush's plan and substitute not so much his own plan, but a set of ill defined ideas. The problem with space policy may not be process, but rather leadership. Until leadership is found that can not only articulate space policy, but implement it effectively through the shifting tides of political whim, the course of the US civil space program will remain uncertain.<br />

During the 1950's and the 1960's, aviation researchers worked to develop winged rocket planes. Advocates of winged spaceplanes pointed out that such vehicles could land on ordinary airfields. Adding wings to a spacecraft increases the vehicle's weight, but wings make landing the vehicle much easier and cheaper than splashdowns at sea. Ocean landings require many ships and aircraft, and the salt water usually damages the spacecraft beyond repair. NASA began to develop a reusable space shuttle while the Apollo program was still underway. In 1972, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon signed an executive order that officially started the space shuttle project. The shuttles were designed to blast off like a rocket and land like an airplane, making up to 100 missions. <br />

The President approved on January 5, 1988, a revised national space policy that will set the direction of U.S. efforts in space for the future. The policy is the result of a five-month interagency review which included a thorough analysis of previous Presidential decisions, the National Commission on Space report, and the implications of the Space Shuttle and expendable launch vehicle accidents. The primary objective of this review was to consolidate and update Presidential guidance on U.S. space activities well into the future. The resulting Presidential Directive reaffirms the national commitment to the exploration and use of space in support of our national well being. It acknowledges that United States space activities are conducted by three separate and distinct sectors: two strongly interacting governmental sectors (Civil, and National Security) and a separate, non-governmental Commercial Sector. Close coordination, cooperation, and technology and information exchange will be maintained among sectors to avoid unnecessary duplication and promote attainment of United States space goals. <br />

The characteristics of this relationship were strongly influenced by the former Supreme Allied Commander, President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was determined that the U.S. space program should be the opposite of the overtly militaristic Soviet program and that it would not create a national deficit. n17 Therefore, Eisenhower resisted popular sentiment and military pressure and endeavored to place the national space program under civil control. By executive order, Eisenhower transferred all space-related civilian personnel, property, and funds not primarily related to military operations and weapon SYSTEM development from the Department of Defense (DoD) to NASA. n18 The civil-military relationship has ebbed and flowed over the years, with the relative closeness of purpose waxing and waning as political forces [*409] changed. It continues to be a source of tension for both NASA and DoD. n19 Nonetheless, NASA remains a civil agency committed to civil missions. <br />

Executive orders can give momentum to legislation, while avoiding spending capital fighting over policy – civil rights orders prove<br />
New York Times July 5, 2000<br />
Congress appears intent on denying President Clinton major legislative victories in his final months of office, but White House officials say they will continue drafting and carrying out policies, Congress or no Congress, until Mr. Clinton's final day. Through executive orders, memorandums, proclamations, regulations and other flexing of presidential power, Mr. Clinton has already put in effect a host of measures concerning the environment, health care and civil rights. And with the presidential campaign in high gear, and the Republican-controlled Congress not inclined to give Democrats any boost, Mr. Clinton's aides intend to continue making policy by decree -- putting federal land off limits to development, reorganizing government agencies, tightening pollution control rules and pushing other measures that would otherwise stand little chance of congressional passage. Mr. Clinton has been especially frustrated that many of his nominees for judgeships, ambassadorships and other posts have failed to be confirmed by the Senate. But he is not surrendering in that area either. If Congress fails to act on some of the nominations later this month, White House aides say they expect the president to make recess appointments in August that would require no Congressional approval. &quot;This president will be signing executive orders right up until the morning of Jan. 20, 2001,&quot; said Bruce N. Reed, the president's domestic policy adviser. &quot;In our experience, when the administration takes executive action, it not only leads to results while the political process is stuck in neutral, but it often spurs Congress to follow suit.&quot;<br />

First, executive foreign policy superior to legislation for 5 reasons,  1. faster, 2. better information, 3. public demand, 4. weak interest groups,  5. congressional reluctance<br />

The distinction between foreign and domestic issues has long been noticed. Two decades ago, in a classic essay written under the fetching title “the two presidencies,” the political scientist Aaron Wildavsky ([1966]1991) argued that modern presidencies were fraternal – but hardly identical – twins.  The one – the domestic policy president – was subject to the  debate, pressure politics and congressional infighting that is a concomitant of the ordinary workings of democratic processes.  The other – the foreign policy president – enjoyed an independent, respect, and prestige that enabled him to manage the external relations of the country quite autonomously.  Wildavsky identified several factors that differentiated domestic from foreign policy.  1. Since foreign policy questions often require “fast action”, they are more appropriate for executive than legislative decision making.  2. Presidents have vast “formal powers to commit resources in foreign affairs,” and they have “far greater ability than anyone else to obtain information on developments abroad.” 3. Since voters know little about foreign policy issues, they “expect the president to act in foreign affairs and reward him with their confidence”. 4. On foreign policy questions, “the interest group structure is weak, unstable, and thin.” 5. Members of Congress follow a “self-denying ordinance.  They do not think it is their job to determine the nation’s defense policies.” Wildavsky’s analysis was not so much an original statement as a summary of a more generally held scholarly perception.  Robert Dahl had put forth much the same argument more than a decade earlier: “In foreign policy the president proposes, the congress disposes”, Dahl wrote, adding that: “in a very large number of highly important decisions about foreign policy, the Congress does not even have the opportunity to dispose.” (1964, 58).  Samuel Huntington similarly concluded that “strategic programs are determined in the executive rather than the Congress.”  “Just as power to legislate strategic programs was at one time, at least in theory, shared by President and Congress, so it is now, very much in practice, shared by the President and a variety of agencies within the executive branch. (1961, 146, 127-28).  Richard Fenno’s views were a little different: “Foreign Affairs members…help make policy in an environment strongly dominated by the President… [They} have been hard put to develop any strategic posture than one calling for responsiveness to executive branch expectations” (1973, 213-3).<br />

Presidents do not use executive orders solely or even primarily to control the operation of executive branch agencies. In fact, presidents sometimes elect to employ executive orders that are nominally directed to government officials in order to leverage a much larger change in the society as a whole. The federal government (and states and localities at their levels) represents a large and important employer and a major participant in the economy, particularly when members of the armed services are included in the count. When government issues significant policy changes with respect to employment, it sets out markers that influence demands in the private sector as well. Similarly, when government establishes contracting requirements or even simply lays out purchasing preferences, it can significantly affect business practices across the nation. Chief executives are well aware of that leverage and have used it to achieve important policy impact without the need to fight pitched congressional battles or to depend on executive branch agencies to generate regulations.<br />

Although ii has become increasingly institutionalized, the office of the president is driven by one person. The public policy of the presidency is deter- mined by the president's own personality, values, beliefs, and style. Presidents have rarely valued space policy beyond its instrumental function. Eisenhower perceived space as public relations. Kennedy championed space only after realizing its value in the Cold War. Johnson was the first true space advocate, as shown by his association with space in the Senate and in the vice presidency. Nixon declared landing on the moon &quot;the greatest event since creation,&quot; but he chopped its budget to ensure a stillbirth. Friendly Ford was benevolent; engi- neer Carter, mechanical; actor Reagan, a born-again space enthusiast. Reagan attempted to formulate and execute the first systematic space policy since the Kennedy era but with mixed results. Bush may be unique; he believes in space exploration for its own sake and not as a means to another end. Each president has left his imprint on space policy and the development of space. In the first half of the twentieth century, presidents had already con- fronted a similar problem in the role that the United States would play in world aviation. Policymakers then were slow to respond to the potential of the Wright brothers' invention, as shown by the early lead that Europe took in military aviation. Only as World War I threatened to reach America did President Woodrow Wilson establish the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics. This agency conducted research for the next forty years, providing important technological advances in aviation that served the nation well in both world wars.<br />

The Obama administration on Monday unveiled a space policy that renounces the unilateral stance of the Bush administration and instead emphasizes international cooperation, including the possibility of an arms control treaty that would limit the development of space weapons. In recent years, both China and the United States have destroyed satellites in orbit, raising fears about the start of a costly arms race that might ultimately hurt the United States because it dominates the military use of space. China smashed a satellite in January 2007, and the United States did so in February 2008. The new space policy explicitly says that Washington will “consider proposals and concepts for arms control measures if they are equitable, effectively verifiable and enhance the national security of the United States and its allies.” The Bush administration, in the space policy it released in August 2006, said it “rejects any limitations on the fundamental right of the United States to operate in and acquire data from space,” a phrase that was interpreted as giving a green light to the development and use of antisatellite weapons. The policy also stated that Washington would “oppose the development of new legal regimes or other restrictions that seek to prohibit or limit U.S. access or use of space,” a phrase that effectively ruled out arms control. In secret, the Bush administration engaged in research that critics said could produce a powerful ground-based laser, among other potential weapons meant to shatter enemy satellites in orbit. By contrast, the Obama policy underlines the need for international cooperation. “It is the shared interest of all nations to act responsibly in space to help prevent mishaps, misperceptions and mistrust,” the new policy says in its opening lines. “Space operations should be conducted in ways that emphasize openness and transparency.” Peter Marquez, director of space policy at the White House National Security Council, told reporters on Monday that the policy was reverting to a less confrontational approach that the United States had championed in the past. “The arms control language is bipartisan language that appeared in the Reagan policy and George H. W. Bush’s policy and the Clinton policy,” Mr. Marquez said in a White House briefing. “So we’re bringing it back to a bipartisan agreed-upon position.” Jeff Abramson, a senior analyst at the Arms Control Association, a private group in Washington, said the new policy “sets the stage for progress in space arms control — without getting into specifics.” For many years, diplomats from around the globe have gathered in Geneva to hammer out a treaty on the “prevention of an arms race in outer space,” which would ban space weapons. Arms control supporters say that China and Russia have backed the process, and that the United States during the Bush administration dragged its feet. In 2006, John Mohanco, a State Department official, told the diplomats in Geneva that as long as attacks on satellites remained a threat, “our government will continue to consider the possible role that space-related weapons may play in protecting our assets.” Now, the Obama administration has stopped the saber-rattling and started what might end in a new kind of peaceful accord — though with plenty of caveats and vague conditions. Although the new policy calls on the United States to “lead in the enhancement of security, stability and responsible behavior in space,” it also says that any resulting arms treaties would have to be equitable, verifiable and enhance the security interests of the United States and its allies. “Those are the gates,” Mr. Marquez told reporters, “that the arms control proposals must come through before we consider them.” The White House said the State Department would make more details public in coming weeks. President Obama said in a statement that the new policy was “designed to strengthen America’s leadership in space while fostering untold rewards here on Earth.” On the civilian use of space, the policy, which is 14 pages long, puts renewed emphasis on the commercial space industry, reflecting the administration’s desire to get the National Aeronautics and Space Administration out of the business of launching astronauts. Listed first among the administration’s space goals is to “energize domestic industries.” That contrasts with the top goal of the 2006 Bush administration policy, to “strengthen the nation’s space leadership,” and that of the 1996 Clinton administration policy, to “enhance the knowledge of the Earth, the solar system and the universe.” The Bush policy asserted that the government would buy commercial services “to the maximum practical extent” and refrain from federal activities that would discourage or compete with commercial options. The Obama policy retains those provisions and, in addition, calls on federal agencies to “actively explore the use of inventive, nontraditional arrangements” like creating public-private partnerships, flying government instruments on commercial spacecraft or buying data from commercial satellite operators. The commercial space section of the Obama policy also includes provisions for promoting American commercial space industry in foreign markets. In contrast, the Bush administration highlighted national security concerns, like preventing unfriendly countries from obtaining advanced technologies. Critics of that approach said the same technologies could often be bought from other countries, adding that the limitations hurt American aerospace companies without improving the nation’s security.<br />

Some aspects of space policy are documented in a formal presidential statement of national space policy. In 2006, the Bush Administration issued such a statement, 158 replacing a previous one that had been in place for 10 years. 159 The 2006 policy established principles and goals for U.S. civilian and national security space programs and set guidelines for a few specific issues such as the use of nuclear power in space and the hazard of debris in orbit. It defined the space-related roles, responsibilities, and relationships of NASA and other federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Commerce. The Obama Administration issued an updated national space policy in June 2010. 160 The new policy reiterates the policy changes proposed in the Administration’s FY2011 budget and places new emphasis on international cooperation and development of the commercial space industry.<br />

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. ? President Barack Obama will visit NASA?s Florida spaceport today to hold a much-anticipated summit on his vision for the future of America?s space exploration program. Space experts, scientists and members of Congress are expected to attend the space summithere at NASA?s Kennedy Space Center, which will be followed by a presentation by the space agency?s chief Charles Bolden and other officials. ?I think I can share that he actually plans to have some private moments with the members who will be there for the conference,? Bolden told reporters last week of the President?s intentions. ?He then plans to deliver a major space policy speech.? That speech, Bolden hopes, will convince allies and critics alike that President Obama is ?dedicated to exploration and human spaceflight.? [Fact sheet on Obama?s space plan.] Space plan under fire President Obama?s space plan has been under fire since its announcement in February, when the president rolled out a $19 billion NASA budget request for 2011 that included the cancellation of the agency?s Constellation program in charge of developing new Orion spacecraft and the Ares rockets designed to launch them into space. Critics blasted the plan for not stating a timetable or destination for human spaceflight, as well as for shifting American manned spacecraft development from NASA to commercial companies. The president?s 2011 budget would increase NASA funding and set aside $6 billion to spur commercial spacecraft development. <br />

National directives are codified in federal law – they are functionally legislation, but the president does it <br />
NASA, No Date [“Explanation of Executive Branch Policy Directives”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:10989:http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/explain.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/explain.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/explain.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:10989 -->]<br />
While the U.S. Congress establishes its positions on National space policy through authorization and appropriations bills, the Executive Branch articulates the President's views on the Nation's ends and means for Space exploration and development through the budget it introduces annually, any other legislation it might introduce, and a series of policy directives. These directives, no less than congressional legislation, are the result of compromise, though the compromises are hammered out by a much smaller number of players, viz., representatives of Executive branch agencies in negotiation with White House staff assigned to various policy areas. During the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and President George Bush, shaping and articulating &quot;National&quot; (but actually the Administration) space policy was the work of the National Space Council, descendant of the National Space Council first established in 1958 under the National Aeronautics and Space Act (&quot;the Space Act&quot;; PL 85-568). Chaired by the Vice-President, the Council consisted of the heads of all Federal departments or other high-level offices having either a programmatic role, or legitimate concern, in Federal government space activities, e.g., the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Commerce (which contains the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the Director of Central Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The National Space Council's policy declarations, designated &quot;National Space Policy Directives&quot; (NSPD's), were negotiated by the policy staffs of the member agencies, agreed to by their &quot;principals,&quot; who sat on the Council, and eventually signed by the President. Both Presidents Reagan and Bush displayed an interest in the unique importance of Space exploration to the country's future. For example, President Reagan openly supported NASA's Space Station Freedom initiative, while President Bush publicly endorsed a piloted (&quot;manned&quot;) mission to the planet Mars. Not surprisingly, then, the Bush administration witnessed the articulation of an important series of NSPD's. The first, NSPD-1 (1989), entitled &quot;National Space Policy,&quot; articulated the Bush Administration's overall policy for U.S. purposes and activities in Space. NSPD-2 (&quot;Commercial Space Launch Policy&quot;, 1990) reflected the Administration's commitment to developing a thriving commercial space sector by establishing &quot;the long-term goal of a free and fair [space launch] market in which the U.S. industry can compete&quot; internationally, while NSPD-3 elaborated the Administration's commercial Space policy with specific guidelines &quot;aimed at expanding private sector investment in space by the market-driven Commercial Space Sector&quot;. NSPD-4 affirmed &quot;assured access to Space&quot; as a key element of National space launch policy. Maintaining &quot;a continuity of Landsat-type [remote sensing] data&quot; was the principal objective of NSPD-5 (1992), while the desire to ensure well coordinated planning and implementation of a U.S. program to examine natural and human-induced changes in the Earth system was reflected in NSPD-7 (1992). NSPD-6(&quot;Space Exploration Initiative&quot;, 1992) announced the strongest White House commitment to an ambitious program of human Space exploration since John F. Kennedy's clarion call of 1961 for a human mission to the Moon. Classified annexes to Space policy directives, or other classified directives, articulated policy for sensitive National security and intelligence activities in Space.<br />

Under Bush’s ill-defined space policy, government leaders made decisions about space policy that affected not only national security but also the ability of the United States to compete successfully with other countries in the commercial use of space and to maintain a leadership role in space exploration, science and engineering, and technology. These decisions have had ramifications for the health of the U.S. space industry, which is crucial to all aspects of the space program and fundamental to the future of American efforts in space. Furthermore, these policies were being made without adequate consultation with foreign partners, whose participation is essential to future U.S. space efforts.<br />

Tomorrow is the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's call to send a man to the moon and back, a goal achieved by Apollo 11. With the space shuttle program one launch away from being shuttered, astronaut and PM contributor Tom Jones argues that we need another spark of presidential leadership to relight America's pioneering and entrepreneurial spirit. This week six astronauts aboard space shuttle Endeavour are knocking its last mission to the International Space Station (ISS) out of the park. In July, Atlantis's final flight will bring down the curtain on NASA's 30-year shuttle program. However, when Atlantis's crew calls &quot;wheels stop, Houston!&quot; for the final time, many Americans will be startled to find that the nation has no replacement rocket that can launch astronauts to the ISS, 220 miles up. Fifty years ago tomorrow, John F. Kennedy committed the nation to reaching the moon within a decade. But soon we'll be unable to reach the space station we largely built and paid for without help. Until roughly 2015, when American companies hope to produce a commercial rocket and spacecraft that can carry NASA's crews safely and economically, astronauts will be renting rides on the Russian Soyuz vehicle (at $55 million per seat and climbing). The fact that presidents and congresses have seen this gap coming and failed to close it is a significant gamble, and not just because it's unclear whether commercial spaceflight will be ready to deliver crews by the 2015 target. NASA has no backup: If the new space startups can't make a profit on flying astronauts and other customers to orbit, they will hang up the out-of-business sign and walk away. We'd be forced to buy Russian seats indefinitely while starting an expensive crash program to regain access to the ISS. Once we find a way to reach the station, we face another gap—one of vision. Between now and 2020, the Obama administration proposes nothing more ambitious for the nation in space than operating the ISS in low Earth orbit, where we have been mired since 1972. The president's single mention last year of a 2025 mission to a nearby asteroid has not led to firm NASA program plans, realistic milestones or funding. This space-policy muddle is already having serious negative effects. NASA is letting go thousands of skilled engineers, technicians and scientists who made the shuttle a success and built the space station. As they scatter to other industries, the nation loses an irreplaceable resource. Congress stepped in and directed NASA to build a rocket and deep spacecraft, but senators and representatives are not paid to do rocket science. Only the president can propose and execute a coherent policy for space exploration. To fill this vacuum in space policy, the president should chart a vigorous, well-funded exploration path that finally returns American explorers to deep space, with the twin goals of scientific exploration and the creation of a commercial, space-based economy. Astronauts should lead the way out of Earth orbit by 2020, using a new heavy-lift booster and deep-space craft that will serve the nation for at least the next two decades. Commercial competition can help to create an innovative design, but this is a job for NASA. To see a project of such scale realized, the government will have to fund it. After tests in lunar orbit, astronauts should embark on a series of voyages to nearby asteroids that are rich in water and other resources. Robot explorers like the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have already found water near the lunar poles, and ground-based telescopes, along with recovered meteorites, tell us that some nearby asteroids harbor minerals comprising as much as 20 percent water. Asteroids are also rich in iron, nickel, rare platinum group metals, and industrial catalysts. Following up discoveries by robot prospectors, astronauts could tap these space natural resources and demonstrate methods to produce water, structural materials and energy to fuel off-Earth industries. NASA's mission will not just grow our economy, but also invigorate scientific discovery: The experience and resources derived from asteroids and our moon will lay the foundation for eventual expeditions to the moons and surface of Mars. And it could even lead to the technologies that will protect our society from the threat of a future asteroid impact. This pursuit will drive technological innovation for decades, spurring our high-tech economy and, like President Kennedy's declaration, inspiring new generations of young scientists, engineers and explorers. Can we afford it? We'd be foolish not to invest in space. During Apollo, spurred by the Cold War, we spent nearly 5 percent of the annual federal budget on space, winning the space race and sparking a technological revolution. But NASA's budget has been shrinking for two decades; today, it is just over half a percent of annual spending. The Augustine Committee in 2009 recommended that we commit to a human spaceflight program &quot;worthy of a great nation,&quot; estimating NASA would need only an additional $3 billion above the current $19 billion annually to launch America on voyages into deep space. That would still be less than 0.6 percent of the federal budget, an affordable investment to open this frontier and ensure our technological leadership in the 21st century. As we debate America's future in space, we should look for leaders who will build on the shuttle's success, set ambitious goals and commit the resources to achieve them. Great nations are exploring nations. America's explorer-entrepreneurs are just waiting for the word &quot;go!&quot;<br />

Executive orders allow presidents to do pretty much whatever they want<br />

Executive orders weren’t systematically recorded until the 1920s, and the numbering system instituted in 1907 extends, retroactively, only to the Lincoln administration. (Executive Order 1, issued on April 15, 1961, established military courts in Louisiana.) What’s more, many actions characterized as executive orders are actually presidential memoranda, directives, and proclamations, similar in use but legally distinct tools. (Ronald Reagan’s so-called Mexico City policy, which blocked federal funds for international aid groups that provide abortion counseling, is one such memorandum often mischaracterized as an executive order.) But while the definition is vague and the limits are murky, the exercise of an executive order is pretty straightforward: The president can order an executive branch agency to do anything he wants, as long as he can cite a law or the Constitution to support his action.<br />

Presidents have used executive orders to do pretty much everything<br />
Kevin M. Stack (Assistant Professor of Law at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law Yeshiva University) January 2005 “The Statutory President,” Iowa Law Review<br />
Presidents shape our national life. In executive orders and other written directives, presidents have declared a nationwide freeze on wages and prices; established major agencies such as the EPA, the Peace Corps, and the Office (now Department) of Homeland Security; mandated nondiscrimination and affirmative action programs for the vast portions of the economy engaged in government contracting; suspended private legal claims against foreign governments in domestic courts; established military tribunals; ordered that an American citizen captured in Chicago be subject to military jurisdiction; and initiated federal funding.<br />

Space, what President Kennedy called “the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked,” has always been the greatest measure of America’s prestige. Other countries have democracy, other countries have nuclear weapons, but no other country has a flag on the Moon. So it is no surprise that both candidates propose ambitious space policies in their Science Debate 2008 answers. Talking about the grandiose themes space travel evokes makes a candidate sound very presidential, while at the same time, failing to deliver on space related campaign promises doesn’t really anger the majority of voters. It’s win-win for lofty rhetoric, but does anything in their record hint that their promises of a beefed up space program are for real? The answer is both yes and no. “The problem is, Senators don’t really get to vote on this,” said Scott Pace, Director of the Space Policy Institute, “there are space issues in the Defense appropriation and authorization bills, and in the NASA appropriation and authorization bills, but space has not been a major legislative issue for either candidate.” Congress does not have much say in US space policy. Traditionally, the executive branch dictates space policy; with the President setting the agenda, and the Vice President enforces that policy as the Chairman of the Board of NASA.<br />

Second, executive orders save political capital by avoiding and preempting congressional opposition<br />
Joel Fleishman (Professor of Law &amp; Policy Sciences at Duke University) 1976 Law &amp; Contemporary Problems, Summer p. 38<br />
Several related factors, in particular, make executive orders especially attractive policymaking tools for a President. First is speed. Even if a President is reasonably confident of securing desired legislation from congress, he must wait for congressional deliberations to run their course. Invariably, he can achieve far faster, if not immediate, results by issuing an executive order. Moreover, when a President acts through an order, he avoids having to subject his policy to public scrutiny and debate. Second is flexibility. Executive orders have the force of law. Yet they differ from congressional legislation in that a President can alter any executive order simply with the stroke of his pen-merely by issuing another executive order. As noted earlier, Presidents have developed the system of classifying national security documents in precisely this manner. Finally, executive orders allow the President, not only to evade hardened congressional opposition, but also to preempt potential or growing opposition-to throw Congress off balance, to reduce its ability to formulate a powerful opposing position.<br />

New laws and Supreme Court decisions are widely reported, sometimes with detailed analysis and commentary. In contrast, an executive order tends to be less visible unless a president decides to make it newsworthy. This low visibility may have checked otherwise hostile public opinion on race discrimination orders.<br />

Launius, 97 [Chair of the Division of Space History, National Air and Space Museum, “ Spaceflight and the myth of presidential leadership” By Roger D. Launius, p. google books] <br />
Conclusion Presidents exercise leadership in the U.S. space program within a complex web of ideological, partisan, and economic constraints. Other nuances too subtle to discuss here, such as a personal infatuation with space explora- tion, have also moved individual political leaders to support or oppose presidential initiatives in space. Presidential cadcrship is not easy, given these constraints, nor is success assured. In this regard, the space program resembles other political issues. It is not as unique as its adherents would like to believe. Although opportunities for presidential control are limited, the president continues to be the person who initiates the national space agenda Before an initiative has any chance of political success, it must be endorsed by the president. The initiative may be modified substantially by the Con- gress, but it will not be considered to any great extent unless the president proposes it- No one but; the president could have effectively initiated the race to the Moon in 1961. the space shuttle program in 197a, or the space station and space exploration initiatives of the 1980s. Leadership had to emanate from the White I louse, even if other politicians disagreed. As such, the president has been and continues to be the crucial player in the effort to define the overall space program. Without the president, no large-scale project could be placed on the national political agenda. Once proposed, however, any large space effort has to be nurtured through the political process. For projects involving space technology, this lakes place over many years. That process in Washington has never been particularly tidy, nor can it ever be in a pluralistic system. There may be fundamental agreement on overarching goals, such as the desire to par- ticipate in space exploration, but specific means for achieving those goals are constantly reevaluated and altered. This constant revaluation gives rise to what some observers have char- acterized as &quot;heterogeneous engineering.&quot; a situation in which technolo- gy and politics develop simultaneously.ri The image of presidential lead ership created by Kennedy and Project Apollo is certainly attractive, but it does not abolish the general rule. Space policy is constructed within a complex web of institutions and interests that makes space exploration no more or less exceptional than other governmental activities.<br />

1. Executive orders are fast and build political capital<br />
Krause and Cohen 97 [George + David, Professors of Political Science @ South Carolina, “Presidential Use of Executive Orders” American Politics Quarterly, Vol 25 No 4, October 1997, Sage Journals Online]  <br />
The aim of this study is to answer the question: What causes presidents to issue executive orders with greater (or less) frequency in a given year? This is an important topic of inquiry, not only because of the dearth of research that has been conducted to date but also because it is a valuable way to assess both the managerial and policymaking characteristics associated with the office of the presidency. Executive orders are another weapon in the arsenal that presidents have at their disposal. They both afford the chief executive the ability to make quick and efficient policy decisions without consultation from Congress or from the public, and they are also a tool that allows presidents to exert bargaining pressure on Congress to enact legislation more favorable to the White House (Wigton 1996). Thus, explaining how and why executive orders are used by presidents allows scholars a better understanding of the presidency and the powers that are inherent in that office.<br />
<br />
2. Executive orders attract no Congressional battles<br />
Moe and Howell 99 (Terry M and William G., senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and Associate Professor in the Government Department at Harvard University, “Unilateral Action and Presidential Power: A theory”, Presidential Studies Quarterly 29.4, December 1999) <br />
Our aim here is to highlight an institutional basis for presidential power that has gone largely unappreciated to this point but that, in our view, has become so pivotal to presidential leadership, and so central to an understanding of presidential power, that it virtually defines what is distinctively modern about the modern American presidency. This is the president's formal capacity for taking unilateral action and thus for making law on his own. Often, presidents do this through executive orders. Sometimes they do it through proclamations or executive agreements or national security directives. But whatever vehicles they may choose, the end result is that presidents can and do make new law--and thus shift the existing status quo--without the explicit consent of Congress. The fact is, presidents have always acted unilaterally to make law. The Louisiana Purchase, the freeing of the slaves, the internment of the Japanese, the desegregation of the military, the initiation of affirmative action, the imposition of regulatory review--these are but a few of the most notable examples. Most presidential orders are far less dramatic, of course. But they are numerous and often important, and it appears the strategy of unilateral action has grown increasingly more central to the modern presidency. <br />

4. Executive orders save capital by avoiding involvement with Congress <br />
Fleishman 76 [Joel, Prof Law and Policy Sciences, Duke, Law &amp; Contemporary Problems, Summer, p. 38] Several related factors, in particular, make executive orders especially attractive policymaking tools for a President. First is speed.  Even if a President is reasonably confident of securing desired legislation from congress, he must wait for congressional deliberations to run their course.  Invariably, he can achieve far faster, if not immediate, results by issuing an executive order. Moreover, when a President acts through an order, he avoids having to subject his policy to public scrutiny and debate.  Second is flexibility. Executive orders have the force of law.

<br />
5. The President can use executive orders to gain political capital<br />
Mayer ’01 (Kenneth – Prof. Political Science at University of Wisconsin –Madison, WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN: EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND PRESIDENTIAL POWER, P 31)  At the third level, presidents use their unilateral authority as a bargaining tool in an effort to shape the strategic context in which they operate. By taking symbolic stands, placing issues and policies on the public agenda, and providing political benefits to important constituencies, presidents can dramatically alter the strategic environment in which bargaining takes place. This type of authority comes closest to Neustadt’s “persuasion” model of presidential power. Two recent examples are Clinton’s 1995 order that barred government contractors from hiring replacement workers and a 1997 order prohibiting smoking in government buildings. In the first case Clinton was trying to mend the breach with organized labor that arose over his support of the North American Free Trade Agreement (which unions strongly opposed).Even though the president ultimately lost in the courts, he still gained considerable leverage by making the attempt. In the second case, the president’s action was largely symbolic, and part of an effort to gain public credit by getting on the  “right side” of an important public heath issue. My focus is on the second and third categories of presidential action. Although presidents face limits on their ability to mandate direct change—indeed, in a separated system the lack of such limits would be, as Montesquieu put it, the very definition of tyranny—the focus in the presidency literature on the limits of command has obscured the president’s ability to use executive authority to gain control of institutions, processes, and agendas. Even within this more narrow area presidents are not free to do whatever they want, and in any case Congress or the courts may step in to reverse what the president has done. I argue, though, that the president will win more of these battles than he loses, as Congress fails to overcome the collective dilemma and institutional inertia that make quick and decisive action difficult. Before I turn to the task of analyzing how presidents have used this power in particular policy areas, though, it is necessary first to define with more precision what the law says about executive orders, and provide an accurate and systematic account of the patterns of overall use.  <br />

A2: Extinction Outweighs<br />
<br />
Extinction doesn’t outweigh everything—the quest for survival shouldn’t be allowed to destroy other values<br />
CALLAHAN 1973 (Daniel,  institute of Society and Ethics, The Tyranny of Survival, p. 91-3)<br />
The value of survival could not be so readily abused were it not for its evocative power. But abused it has been. In the name of survival, all manner of social and political evils have been committed against the rights of individuals, including the right to life. The purported threat of Communist domination has for over two decades fueled the drive of militarists for ever-larger defense budgets, no matter what the cost to other social needs. During World War II, native Japanese-Americans were herded, without due process of law, to detention camps. This policy was later upheld by the Supreme Court in Korematsu v. United States (1944) in the general context that a threat to national security can justify acts otherwise blatantly unjustifiable. The survival of the Aryan race was one of the official legitimations of Nazism. Under the banner of survival, the government of South Africa imposes a ruthless apartheid, heedless of the most elementary human rights. The Vietnamese war has seen one of the greatest of the many absurdities tolerated in the name of survival: the destruction of villages in order to save them. But it is not only in a political setting that survival has been evoked as a final and unarguable value. The main rationale B. F. Skinner offers in Beyond Freedom and Dignity for the controlled and conditioned society is the need for survival. For Jacques Monod, in Chance and Necessity, survival requires that we overthrow almost every known religious, ethical and political system. In genetics, the survival of the gene pool has been put forward as sufficient grounds for a forceful prohibition of bearers of offensive genetic traits from marrying and bearing children. Some have even suggested that we do the cause of survival no good by our misguided medical efforts to find means by which those suffering from such common genetically based diseases as diabetes can live a normal life, and thus procreate even more diabetics. In the field of population and environment, one can do no better than to cite Paul Ehrlich, whose works have shown a high dedication to survival, and in its holy name a willingness to contemplate governmentally enforced abortions and a denial of food to surviving populations of nations which have not enacted population-control policies. For all these reasons it is possible to counterpoise over against the need for survival a &quot;tyranny of survival.&quot; There seems to be no imaginable evil which some group is not willing to inflict on another for sake of survival, no rights, liberties or dignities which it is not ready to suppress. It is easy, of course, to recognize the danger when survival is falsely and manipulatively invoked. Dictators never talk about their aggressions, but only about the need to defend the fatherland to save it from destruction at the hands of its enemies. But my point goes deeper than that. It is directed even at a legitimate concern for survival, when that concern is allowed to reach an intensity which would ignore, suppress or destroy other fundamental human rights and values. The potential tyranny survival as value is that it is capable, if not treated sanely, of wiping out all other values. Survival can become an obsession and a disease, provoking a destructive singlemindedness that will stop at nothing. We come here to the fundamental moral dilemma. If, both biologically and psychologically, the need for survival is basic to man, and if survival is the precondition for any and all human achievements, and if no other rights make much sense without the premise of a right to life—then how will it be possible to honor and act upon the need for survival without, in the process, destroying everything in human beings which makes them worthy of survival. To put it more strongly, if the price of survival is human degradation, then there is no moral reason why an effort should be made to ensure that survival. It would be the Pyrrhic victory to end all Pyrrhic victories.<br />

<br />
1. President has discretionary spending power within agencies<br />
Pika et al 5 [Joseph, Professor of Political Science and International Relations @ University of Delaware + John Maltese, Associate Professor of Political Science @ University of Georgia + Norman Thomas, department of Political Science @ University of Cincinnati The Politics of the Presidency 5th Edition, pg. 233]<br />
In addition to budgeting, presidents have certain discretionary spending powers that increase their leverage over the bureaucracy. They have substantial nonstatutory authority, based on understandings with congressional appropriations committees, to transfer finds within an appropriation and from one program to another. The committees expect to be kept informed of such “reprogramming” actions. Fund transfer authority is essential to sound financial management, but it can be abused to circumvent congressional decisions. In 1970, for example, Nixon transferred funds to support an extensive unauthorized covert military operation in Cambodia. Nevertheless, Congress has given presidents and certain agencies the authority to spend substantial amounts of money on a confidential basis, the largest and most controversial of which are for intelligence activities. <br />
<br />
2. Presidents can appropriate money without the Congress <br />
Rosen 98 [Colonel Richard, Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army, “Funding &quot;Non-Traditional&quot; Military Operations: The Alluring Myth Of A Presidential Power Of The Purse” Military Law Review 155 Mil. L. Rev. 1, Lexis]<br />
Presidents have occasionally spent public funds without an appropriation during serious emergencies that could not await congressional action (usually because Congress was not in session). In such cases, presidents have not assumed the authority to appropriate funds without Congress; instead, they have recognized the extra-constitutional nature of their expenditures, returning to Congress for the appropriations required to cover their spending. Several examples illustrate the practice. <br />
<br />
3. President has statutory authority to spend without appropriations<br />
Raven-Hansen and Banks 95 [Peter, Glen Earl Weston Research Professor of Law, George Washington University Law School + William, Professor of Law, Syracuse University College of Law, ARTICLE: From Vietnam to Desert Shield: The Commander in Chief’s Spending  Power” Iowa Law Review, 81 Iowa L. Rev. 79]<br />
In contrast to reprogramming, the shifting of funds between programs within an appropriation, transfer is the shifting of funds between appropriations. From the very start of the republic, the Commander in Chief has spent funds without appropriations or in advance of them, 208 commingled or transferred funds for purposes other than those for which they were appropriated, 209 and spent all available funds early in the fiscal year, thereby justifying seeking a deficiency appropriation in order to continue to operate. 210 The transfer custom originates with the defeat of Gallatin's proposal for line-itemization in the debates with Hamilton and Wolcott around the turn of the eighteenth century. 211 The transfer custom was partly codified in an 1809 statute authorizing the President, &quot;on the application of the secretary of the proper department . . . to direct . . . that a portion of the monies appropriated for a particular branch . . . in that department, be applied to another branch of expenditure in the same department.&quot; 212<br />
<br />
4. The President can secure funding<br />
William G. Howell, Associate Professor of Government @ Harvard University, September 2005, Presidential Studies Quarterly, Unilateral Powers: A Brief Overview<br />
For at least three reasons, however, the obligations of funding do not torpedo the president's unilateral powers. First, and most obviously, many unilateral actions that presidents take do not require additional appropriations. Bush's orders took immediate effect when he decided to include farm-raised salmon in federal counts under the Endangered Species Act, removing twenty-three of twenty-seven salmon species from the list of endangered species and thereby opening vast tracks of lands to public development; when he issued rules that alter the amount of allowable diesel engine exhaust, that extend the number of hours that truck drivers can remain on the road without resting, and that permit Forest Service managers to approve logging in federal forests without standard environmental reviews; and when he froze all financial assets in U.S. banks that were linked to bin Laden and other terrorist networks. These orders were, to borrow Neustadt's term, &quot;self-executing,&quot; and the appropriations process did not leave him open to additional scrutiny. Second, the appropriations process is considerably more streamlined, and hence easier to navigate, than the legislative process. It has to be, for Congress must pass a continually expanding federal budget every year, something not possible were the support of supermajorities required. But by lowering the bar to clear appropriations, Congress relaxes the check it places on the president's unilateral powers. There are a range of programs and agencies that lack the support of supermajorities that are required to create them, but that have the support of the majorities needed to fund them. Just because the president cannot convince Congress to enact a program or agency does not mean that he cannot build the coalitions required to fund them.Third, and finally, given the size of the overall budget and the availability of discretionary funds, presidents occasionally find ways to secure funding for agencies and programs that even a majority of members of Congress oppose. Presidents may request moneys for popular initiatives and then, once secured, siphon off portions to more controversial programs and agencies that were unilaterally created. They can reprogram funds within budgetary accounts or, when Congress assents, they may even transfer funds between accounts. And they can draw from contingency accounts, set-asides for unforeseen disasters, and the like, in order to launch the operations of certain agencies that face considerable opposition within Congress. By Louis Fisher's account, &quot;The opportunity for mischief is substantial&quot; (1975, 88). While discretion is far from absolute, the president does have more flexibility in deciding how funds are spent than a strict understanding of Congress's appropriations powers might suggest.<br />

Just as Queen Isabella sent in the Spanish Armada to protect the new found territory and resources of the New World, so too is the U.S. moving in a similar way.  The Pentagon, through the U.S. Space Command, is working hard to ensure that the space corridor will remain open and free for private corporate interests. Weapon systems such as nuclear powered lasers and anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons are now being funded, researched, and tested in the U.S. It will only be a matter of time until deployment of space based weapons will follow. In the Space Command’s document, Vision for 2020, they state that &quot;Historically, military forces have evolved to protect national interests and investments – both military and economic. During the rise of sea commerce, nations built navies to protect and enhance their commercial interests. …The control of space will encompass protecting U.S. military, civil and commercial investments in space…. Control of space is the ability to assure access to space, freedom of operations within the space medium, and an ability to deny others the use of space, if required.&quot; A parallel, military highway will be created between the Earth and the planets beyond. Documents commissioned by the U.S. Congress suggest that U.S. military bases on the Moon will enable the U.S. to control access to and from the planet Earth.

Exoplanet research is an economic inevitability – Kepler telescope solves<br />

<br />
Astronomers searching for planets around stars other than the Sun have had much to celebrate over the past decade. The number of confirmed 'exoplanets' has soared from about 50 to more than 500 in that time. And although none of these planets closely resembles Earth, NASA's Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009, is now delivering candidates from distant stars by the hundreds — some of which may prove to be very Earth-like indeed (see page 24). The exoplanet search itself has been wildly successful, but not so the searchers' quest for multibillion-dollar follow-up missions. Hopes for ambitious spacecraft such as a Space Interferometry Mission or Terrestrial Planet Finder have been dashed as missions have been cancelled or postponed owing to a combination of sluggish economic growth, deep cuts to space-science funding and programme difficulties with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In response, the planet-hunting community has got creative, devising ways to maximize the science and minimize the costs. An Exoplanet Task Force jointly commissioned by NASA and the US National Science Foundation accordingly issued a report1 in 2008, supporting a new strategy for exoplanet research. Rather than waiting for the launch of costly, dedicated planet-hunting spacecraft, it calls for astronomers to press ahead with cheaper, ground-based surveys to discover worlds orbiting nearby stars, which appear brighter to us than do those farther away, and so are easier to study. The hope is that such low-cost surveys will yield at least a few worlds that can be studied using space-based resources such as the JWST. Such facilities would allow astronomers to spectroscopically search the exoplanets' atmospheres for ingredients such as carbon dioxide, water vapour and perhaps methane, oxygen and other trace gases, which could indicate that life is present. A 2010 report from the European Space Agency reached nearly identical conclusions2. &quot;The planets are out there, and it's relatively inexpensive to go after them,&quot; says Greg Laughlin, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who served on the NASA/National Science Foundation task force. &quot;There's an economic inevitability to this.&quot; Of the many ideas that astronomers have come up with for conducting exoplanet searches on the cheap, five stand out.<br />

Ground-based telescopes solve exoplanet study <br />
Dacey, 10 – a reporter for physicsworld.com [Feb 5, 2010, James Dacey, “Exoplanet hunting brought down to Earth,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:10997:http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/41642 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/41642" rel="nofollow">http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/41642</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:10997 -->]<br />

Researchers in the US, UK and Germany have used a ground-based telescope to detect organic compounds in the atmosphere of an exoplanet – that is, a planet orbiting a star other than our Sun. The result, the researchers claim, will open up the hunt for Earth-like planets to anyone with access to a decent telescope. &quot;We expect a massive explosion of exoplanet research because it is not limited anymore to the lucky few who have access to space telescopes,&quot; says Pieter Deroo at the California Institute of Technology. Since astronomers made the first discovery of a planet orbiting another star in 1992 they have gone on to catalogue more than 400 of these exoplanets. The favoured hunting technique is known as the transit method whereby astronomers monitor the light from a star and look for dips in its intensity caused by a planet sweeping in front of its parent star cutting across the line of vision from Earth. Honing in on exoplanets The next stage in exoplanet research is to start looking a bit more closely at the nature of these planets with the ultimate goal of discovering a planet with habitable conditions like Earth's. The first step is to decipher the chemical composition of exoplanetary atmospheres as this could provide information about a planet's formation and evolution; it might also reveal the signatures of life. To date, the most popular approach has been to adapt the transit detection method to study how starlight, observed from Earth, is affected during eclipses. The idea is a relatively simple one: compare the spectrographic data of a star's light when an exoplanet is first in front then behind its parent star in relation to our line of vision.<br />

Despite the rhetoric and the intensive action on the Hill, some voices called for restraint. The reports and testimony making a case for or arguing against an S&amp;T crisis are part of an ongoing policy debate. One line of counterargument is that such warnings are far from unprecedented and have never resulted in the crisis anticipated. The author of a Washington Watch article noted that “similar fears of a STEM6 workforce crisis in the 1980s were ultimately unfounded” (Andres, 2006). Neal McCluskey, a policy analyst from the Cato Institute, noted that similar alarm bells were sounded decades earlier (and in his view, have had underlying political agendas): Using the threat of international economic competition to bolster federal control of education is nothing new. It happened in 1983, after the federally commissioned report A Nation at Risk admonished that ‘our once unchallenged preeminence in commerce, industry, science, and technological innovation is being overtaken by competitors throughout the world,’ as well as the early 1990s, when George Bush the elder called for national academic standards and tests in order to better compete with Japan. (McCluskey, 2006) Roger Pielke of the University of Colorado observed that such issues as poor student performance have an even longer history, with no negative outcomes. Arguments that “certain other countries produce a greater proportion of scientist and engineering students or that those students fare better on tests of achievement . . . have been made for almost 50 years,” he stated, “yet over that time frame the U.S. economy has done quite well” (Pielke, 2006).<br />

In October 1962, the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of a nuclear holocaust. President John F. Kennedy put the chance of nuclear war at “somewhere between one out of three and even.” The historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., at the time an adviser of the President, later called this “the most dangerous moment in human history.”1 What if a substantial fraction of the world’s population had been killed in a nuclear holocaust in the 1960s? In some sense, the overall cost of the technological innovations of the preceding 30 years would then seem to have outweighed the benefits. While nuclear devastation represents a vivid example of the potential costs of technological change, it is by no means unique. The benefits from the internal combustion engine must be weighed against the costs associated with pollution and global warming. Biomedical advances have improved health substantially but made possible weaponized anthrax and lab-enhanced viruses. The potential benefits of nanotechnology stand beside the threat that a self-replicating machine could someday spin out of control. Experimental physics has brought us x-ray lithography techniques and superconductor technologies but also the remote possibility of devastating accidents as we smash particles together at ever higher energies. These and other technological dangers are detailed in a small but growing literature on socalled “existential risks”; Posner (2004) is likely themost familiar of these references, but see also Bostrom (2002), Joy (2000), Overbye (2008), and Rees (2003). Technologies need not pose risks to the existence of humanity in order to have costs worth considering. New technologies come with risks as well as benefits. A new pesticide may turn out to be harmful to children. New drugs may have unforeseen side effects. Marie Curie’s discovery of the new element radium led to many uses of the glow-in-the-dark material, including a medicinal additive to drinks and baths for supposed health benefits, wristwatches with luminous dials, and as makeup — at least until the dire health consequences of radioactivity were better understood. Other examples of new products that were intially thought to be safe or even healthy include thalidomide, lead paint, asbestos, and cigarettes. While some new technologies are dangerous, many others are devoted to saving lives. Lichtenberg (2005), for example, estimates that new pharmaceuticals accounted for perhaps 40 percent of the rise in life expectancy between 1986 and 2000. MRI machines, better diagnostic equipment, and new surgical techniques as well as anti-lock brakes, airbags, and pollution scrubbers are all examples of lifesaving technologies. How is growth theory altered when technologies involve life and death instead of just higher consumption? Consider what might be called a “Russian roulette” theory of economic growth. Suppose the overwhelming majority of new ideas are beneficial and lead to growth in consumption. However, there is a tiny chance that a new idea will be particularly dangerous and cause massive loss of life. Do discovery and economic growth continue forever in such a framework, or should society eventually decide that consumption is high enough and stop playing the game of Russian roulette? How is this conclusion affected if researchers can also develop life-saving technologies? The answers to these questions turn out to depend crucially on the shape of preferences. For a large class of conventional specifications, including log utility, safety eventually trumps economic growth. The optimal rate of growth may be substantially lower than what is feasible, in some cases falling all the way to zero.<br />

Hot pixels kill solvency<br />
<br />
New Scientist, 11 [March 5, 2011, Rachel Courtland, New Scientist, “Hot pixel mystery plagues delayed space telescope,” Lexis]<br />
<br />
What is degrading detectors on a NASA telescope already projected to launch late and run over-budget? Hot pixel mystery SOMETHING strange is killing off pixels in the detectors of a multi-billion-dollar space telescope. NASA's ultra-sensitive James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is supposed to launch in 2014 and glimpse the universe's first stars and galaxies. But in December Marcia Rieke of the University of Arizona in Tucson and colleagues found that roughly 2 per cent of pixels in a detector destined for JWST's Near Infrared Camera were transmitting signals although no light was hitting them, four times as many &quot;hot pixels&quot; as expected. They later found that the problem affects four of the camera's five long-wavelength detector arrays. &quot;We don't know what is happening, and we don't know if there's a way to reverse it or slow it down,&quot; Rieke says. NASA allows no more than 5 per cent of a detector's pixels to be hot by the end of the telescope's five-year space mission. At this rate, the detectors may exceed this limit before the telescope even leaves the ground, says Rieke. The pixel problem is just the latest setback for JWST. In November 2010, an independent review panel predicted that JWST is unlikely to launch before September 2015 and will cost $1.5 billion more than expected.<br />

<br />
Considered by scientists the most important space mission of the decade, the James Webb Space Telescope project is being overhauled for the second time in five years because of skyrocketing costs and cascading schedule delays. Decision-makers initially were told the observatory would cost $1.6 billion and launch this year on a mission to look deeper into space and further back in time than the Hubble Space Telescope, in a quest for new clues about the formation of our universe and origins of life. NASA now says the telescope can't launch until at least 2018, though outside analysts suggest the flight could slip past 2020. The latest estimated price tag: up to $6.8 billion. NASA admits the launch delay will push the bill even higher. And, scientists are worried the cost growth and schedule delays are gobbling up more and more of the nation's astronomy budget and NASA's attention, threatening funding for other space science programs. Some fear the dilemma will get worse if the replanning work this summer forces NASA to shift billions more science dollars to Webb to get it back on track. So, what went wrong? A Florida Today review of five years' worth of budget records, status reports and independent audits show the Webb observatory is plagued by the same, oft-repeated problems that caused most major NASA projects to bust their budgets and schedules. In short, mistakes included: » NASA and its contractors underestimated the telescope's cost and failed to include enough reserve cash to handle the kinds of technical glitches that always crop up in development of a complex spacecraft, including many expensive risks managers knew about. » Leaders at agency headquarters in Washington and Goddard Space Flight Center in Baltimore, which led the project before the problems came to light, failed to act on repeated warnings that cash flow was too tight and technical glitches too many to meet the budget or schedule. &quot;We were optimistic,&quot; said NASA headquarters program manager Keith Howard, who has worked on the telescope project since its inception in the 1990s. &quot;If you want to say overly optimistic, that's one way to look at it. If we weren't optimistic, we would not be in this business.&quot; Even an infusion of federal stimulus money — meant to prop up the nation's ailing economy — was only enough to keep the telescope project afloat and workers on the job. The Independent Comprehensive Review Panel concluded NASA needed to make immediate management changes mostly because leaders had not questioned and verified enough of what they were being told. The review panel recommended NASA headquarters take control, starting with a new cost estimate and schedule more in line with reality.  <br />

<br />
One of the frustrations of meetings at which scientists gather to discuss policy-related issues is the speed with which the requirements for evidence-based discussion they would expect in a professional context can go out of the window. Such has been the issue over the past two days in the meeting jointly organised in London by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the Royal Society on the topic “New Frontiers in Science Diplomacy“. There has been much lively discussion on the value of international collaboration in achieving scientific goals, on the need for researchers to work together on the scientific aspects of global challenges such as climate change and food security, and on the importance of science capacity building in developing countries in order to make this possible. But there remained little evidence at the end of the meeting on how useful it was to lump all these activities together under the umbrella term of “science diplomacy”. More significantly, although numerous claims were made during the conference about the broader social and political value of scientific collaboration – for example, in establishing a framework for collaboration in other areas, and in particular reducing tensions between rival countries – little was produced to demonstrate whether this hypothesis is true. If it is not, then some of the arguments made on behalf of “science diplomacy”, and in particular its value as a mechanism for exercising “soft power” in foreign policy, do not stand up to close scrutiny. Indeed, a case can be made that where scientific projects have successfully involved substantial international collaboration, such success is often heavily dependent on a prior political commitment to cooperation, rather than a mechanism for securing cooperation where the political will is lacking. Three messages appeared to emerge from the two days of discussion. Firstly, where the political will to collaborate does exist, a joint scientific project can be a useful expression of that will. Furthermore, it can be an enlightening experience for all those directly involved. But it is seldom a magic wand that can secure broader cooperation where none existed before. Secondly, “science diplomacy” will only become recognised as a useful activity if it is closely defined to cover specific situations (such as the negotiation of major international scientific projects or collaborative research enterprises). As an umbrella term embracing the many ways in which science interacts with foreign policy, it loses much of its impact, and thus its value. Finally, when it comes to promoting the use of science in developing countries, a terminology based historically on maximising self-interest – the ultimate goal of the diplomat – and on practices through which the rich have almost invariably ended up exploiting the poor, is likely to be counterproductive. In other words, the discussion seemed to confirm that “science diplomacy” has a legitimate place in the formulation and implementation of policies for science (just as there is a time and place for exercising “soft power” in international relations). But the dangers of going beyond this – including the danger of distorting the integrity of science itself, and even alienating potential partners in collaborative projects, particularly in the developing world – were also clearly exposed.<br />

Ties with EU trades off with NATO<br />
<br />
International Herald Tribune – 2-18-2005<br />
<br />
On the face of it, the issue is about how NATO and the European Union can discuss sensitive security issues when some EU countries have not received security clearance from NATO to attend these meetings. In essence, however, diplomats say, it is about how the two organizations are vying with each other to set the agenda for the trans-Atlantic relationship. &quot;There is now a competition between both organizations where member countries try to play off their interests either against the EU or NATO, &quot; said a senior NATO official who, like most officials interviewed for this article, requested anonymity. &quot;The relationship between the EU and NATO is in flux because both are jockeying for influence on the international stage,&quot; he added. &quot;As the EU moves slowly along the road toward doing more defense and security, it is seen as threatening to NATO. NATO knows it is no longer Washington's first port of call for its military missions. It is becoming a toolbox for the U.S.&quot; <br />

Collapse of NATO causes multiple escalatory nuclear wars<br />
<br />
John Duffield, Assistant Professor of Government and Foreign Affairs at the University of Virginia, 1994<br />
[Political Science Quarterly 109:5, p. 766-7]<br />
<br />
Initial analyses of NATO's future prospects overlooked at least three important factors that have helped to ensure the alliance's enduring relevance. First, they underestimated the extent to which external threats sufficient to help justify the preservation of the alliance would continue to exist. In fact, NATO still serves to secure its members against a number of actual or potential dangers emanating from outside their territory. These include not only the residual threat posed by Russian military power, but also the relatively new concerns raised by conflicts in neighboring regions. Second, the pessimists failed to consider NATO's capacity for institu¬tional adaptation. Since the end of the cold war, the alliance has begun to develop two important new functions. NATO is increasingly seen as having a significant role to play in containing and controlling milita¬rized conflicts in Central and Eastern Europe. And, at a deeper level, it works to prevent such conflicts from arising at all by actively pro-moting stability within the former Soviet bloc. Above all, NATO pessimists overlooked the valuable intra-alliance functions that the alliance has always performed and that remain rele¬vant after the cold war. Most importantly, NATO has helped stabilize Western Europe, whose states had often been bitter rivals in the past. By damping the security dilemma and providing an institutional mech¬anism for the development of common security policies, NATO has contributed to making the use of force in relations among the countries of the region virtually inconceivable. In all these ways, NATO clearly serves the interests of its European members. But even the United States has a significant stake in preserving a peaceful and prosperous Europe. In addition to strong transatlantic historical and cultural ties, American economic interests in Europe— as a leading market for U.S. products, as a source of valuable imports, and as the host for considerable direct foreign investment by American companies — remain substantial. If history is any guide, moreover, the United States could easily be drawn into a future major war in Europe, the consequences of which would likely be even more devastating than those of the past, given the existence of nuclear weapons.11<br />

And, “United States Federal Government should” means the debate is solely about the outcome of a policy established by governmental means<br />
Ericson, 03 (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts – California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater’s Guide, Third Edition, p. 4)<br />
<br />
The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions, each topic contains certain key elements, although they have slightly different functions from comparable elements of value-oriented propositions. 1. An agent doing the acting ---“The United States” in “The United States should adopt a policy of free trade.” Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of value, the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. The verb should—the first part of a verb phrase that urges action. 3. An action verb to follow should in the should-verb combination. For example, should adopt here means to put a program or policy into action though governmental means. 4. A specification of directions or a limitation of the action desired. The phrase free trade, for example, gives direction and limits to the topic, which would, for example, eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs, discussing diplomatic recognition, or discussing interstate commerce. Propositions of policy deal with future action. Nothing has yet occurred. The entire debate is about whether something ought to occur. What you agree to do, then, when you accept the affirmative side in such a debate is to offer sufficient and compelling reasons for an audience to perform the future action that you propose. <br />

Arguing against the government perspective is critical—it’s key to refining our positions and building bridges with insiders<br />
GITLIN 2003 (Todd, Professor of Journalism and Sociology at Colombia and Former President of Students for a Democratic Society, Letters to a Young Activist, 96)<br />
Insider and outsider impulses sometimes coexist and war in the same breast.  Some outsiders are former insiders—Daniel Ellsberg, for example, the career Pentagon official who, in 1971, released the Pentagon Papers on Vietnam to the Washington Post and New York Times, risking a long jail sentence and reprisals by President Nixon’s operatives.  Ellsberg proceeded to cross the line, devoting himself for decades to civil disobedience against American nuclear policy.  Outsiders may in turn become insiders.  Tom Hayden, for example, principle author of SDS’s Port Huron Statement, sought and held state office in California and became a powerful voice in education and environmental policy there for a quarter of a century—much longer than he spent as a student and community organizer and planner of demonstrations.  Don’t accuse ex-outsiders of selling out, a charge that is not only smug, drenched as it is in moral superiority, but self-defeating, since it forswears influence and regresses to the Manichaean presumption that all will be better when all your outsiders displace all the other side’s insiders—a dubious proposition trailing Leninist fumes—or when no more insiders exist (a hallucination).  Rather than hallucinate or plot coups, it behooves outsiders to contact insiders, argue with them, learn something from them, challenge them and resist the all-or-nothing temptation to demonize them.  Equally it behooves insiders to listen to outsiders, not just to cool them out.  Any real reformer greets you and your friends as useful allies.<br />

Role-playing solves exclusion—it’s ideal for people with limited knowledge of the subject<br />
SCHAAP 2005 (Andrew, University of Melbourne, Politics, Vol 25 Iss 1, February)<br />
#2  Concern and respect for students and student learning: Using the role play encouraged students to express ideas in terms of the concepts associated with the particular ideology they were asked to engage with. A particular advantage of the role play was that it enabled students to learn from each other; students with different levels of competence in political theory benefited from the questions and explanations that they gave to each other. Moreover, the teacher naturally assumes a generous disposition in this situation as students ask for advice, help, clarification, etc. throughout the session. # 3  Appropriate assessment and feedback: The role play provided immediate opportunities to provide students with feedback on their ideas. Like Levy, I tended not to correct misinformation. However, I did reward students by pointing out when a particularly good point was being made. I also recorded the meeting so that students could listen to the discussion later and I posted the various draft declarations of human rights on the subject website. # 4  Clear goals and intellectual challenge: When devising the role play I was forced to articulate the learning outcomes I hoped to achieve more clearly than I had done when preparing regular lectures. This may have been related to the high-risk nature of this teaching method and my worry that students would not take it seriously if they could not see the point of it. A particular advantage of this teaching method is that it posed an intellectual challenge to students, regardless of their level of competence in the subject.<br />

Role playing overcomes polarization and teaches students political jargon necessary to form critical opinions<br />
SCHAAP 2005 (Andrew, University of Melbourne, Politics, Vol 25 Iss 1, February)<br />
While every subject has its jargon, the object of study in political theory is the jargon itself. Perhaps because of its abstract nature, political theory often polarises politics students: it either alienates or inspires them. Role playing offers one valuable technique to overcome this divide by demonstrating in practice why we cannot do without theories of politics. By participating in this role play, students experienced at first hand how arguments made from within five traditions of political philosophy come into conflict in relation to the issue of human rights. Even self-avowed pragmatists have their own theories – only they are implicitly assumed rather than explicitly articulated. In role playing the pragmatists' self-deception is exposed: they are forced to declare their (imagined) hands and hold their (assigned) theories open to scrutiny. Once drawn into the game, in this way, they are on their way to becoming political theorists.<br />

Role playing is the most effective means of understanding conflicting roles of government actors<br />
GONZALES 2008 (Angelo, Ph.D. Candidate, Travers Department of Political Science, University of California at Berkeley, “Teaching American Political Institutions Using Role Playing Simulations,” Feb 22, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11003:http://www.allacademic.com --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allacademic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.allacademic.com</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11003 --><em>meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/6/3/pages245631/p245631-1.php)<br />
The observation that organizational actors can play multiple roles in political institutions is important from a pedagogical standpoint, because these roles provide the basis upon which teachers can design effective role-playing simulations. First, roles provide the essential structure for simulations, in conjunction with one’s learning objectives. If one’s goal is to teach students about the importance of parties in Congress, then one’s simulation should include important roles for party leaders. To that end, a House floor debate or a Rules Committee deliberation might make the most sense, but a Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hearing on western water might not be as effective. Second, with adequate preparation time, roles help ensure that students are not just acting on their personal beliefs and preconceptions. In preparing for a role, students are forced to look at the individual whose part they are playing from different perspectives, considering the ways in which their multiple positions within the organization might conflict with each other. And even in situations where students haven’t prepared well, there are numerous opportunities in interacting with other simulation actors for students to learn about the ways in which multiple roles can come into play in a particular institution. Finally, roles can liberate shy students to take a more active role in simulations than they might otherwise do in more traditional class settings. I’ll never forget one particularly shy student who came out of her shell when asked to play a lawyer in a Supreme Court simulation I designed. Something about the act of playing a particular role helped her shed her fears of speaking in class, and from that day forward, she no longer had any qualms about participating actively in discussions. In sum, when designed properly, role-playing simulations can be an effective pedagogical technique for teaching students about the dynamic interaction between political actors and the internal rules and processes of political institutions. The role-playing aspect forces students to get into the heads of political actors and to consider why these actors make the decisions they do, given the structure of institutional incentives and constraints in which they operate. The simulation aspect forces students to engage in an actual decision-making process and to consider why the process works or fails to work as it does. Short of actually working in a political institution, role-playing simulations provide the best means by which students can learn about the complex inner workings of these organizations that are so central to the American political system. <br />

Switch side policy debates are good for critical thinking and education<br />
KELLER, WHITTAKER, AND BURKE, 2001 [Thomas E., James K., and Tracly K., Asst. professor School of Social Service Administration U. of Chicago, professor of Social Work, and doctoral student School of Social Work, &quot;Student debates in policy courses: promoting policy practice skills and knowledge through active learning,&quot; Journal of Social Work Education, Spr/Summer, EBSCOhost]<br />
The purposes of this article were to examine the potential of student debates for fostering the development of policy practice knowledge and skills, to demonstrate that debates can be effectively incorporated as an in-class assignment in a policy course, and to report findings on the educational value and level of student satisfaction with debates. Based on a review of the literature, the authors' experience conducting debates in a course, and the subsequent evaluation of those debates, the authors believe the development of policy practice skills and the acquisition of substantive knowledge can be advanced through structured student debates in policy-oriented courses. The authors think debates on important policy questions have numerous benefits: prompting students to deal with values and assumptions, encouraging them to investigate and analyze competing alternatives, compelling them to advocate a particular position, and motivating them to articulate a point of view in a persuasive manner. We think engaging in these analytic and persuasive activities promotes greater knowledge by stimulating active participation in the learning process.<br />

Role playing is critical to understand how government works and how it fails—traditional education is less effective<br />

Political institutions are central to many courses on American politics and government. From the institutions of government – represented by legislatures, executive agencies, and courts at all levels – to the intermediary institutions that structure citizens’ interactions with their government (e.g., parties and interest groups), a thorough knowledge of political institutions is necessary to truly grasp the inner workings of the American political system. Unfortunately, it can be difficult for students to learn about the dynamic nature of these institutions from the pages of a textbook. For example, it is important to know the textbook description of Congress as a bicameral institution, with representatives elected every two years and senators every six years, but such information does little to explain how these constitutional differences between the House and Senate can create incentives for members to act in different ways. Congress is a complex institution with numerous rules governing the consideration of business and multiple incentives structuring the behavior of members. The best way to truly understand the effects of these rules and incentives, I argue, is to get inside the heads of the members themselves, and the most effective way to do so pedagogically is through the use of role-playing simulations.  Congress is not the only political institution with interesting internal dynamics that can be taught using simulations. Political parties are continually struggling to manage the diverse interests of their internal coalitions, while staking out policy positions that will give them an electoral advantage in the next election. Interest groups comprise nearly every conceivable interest, exhibit widely varying degrees of political sophistication, and interact with many different aspects of the political system (e.g., lobbying bureaucratic agencies during the rule-making process, testifying before committees, lobbying individual members of Congress, and engaging in electioneering to influence the results of elections). The bureaucracy and the courts, though underappreciated, are essential actors in the policy process from start to finish. The Executive Office of the President walks a fine line between serving the individual interests of the President and respecting the statutory mandates of Congress. And the President (and most governors) wear several institutional hats that are often in conflict with one another (e.g., head of state, party leader, and chief policy maker). Understanding the ways in which these institutions manage all of their internal conflicts is critical for understanding why the American political system works (or fails to work) as it does.  In this paper, I argue that role-playing simulations are an essential technique in any professor's repertoire for teaching American political institutions. I also discuss two case studies from my own teaching experience: (1) a congressional committee hearing designed to simulate the role of interest groups in the policy process, and (2) a Senate floor debate designed to simulate the interplay between Senate rules and the major interests that structure senators’ behaviors (i.e., committees, parties, and re-election). In both of these exercises, I argue that students came away with a better understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of each institution than had they simply been asked to memorize the textbook. Finally, I present results from a brief survey my former students to solicit their thoughts about the effectiveness of these simulations.<br />
<br />
Debate as a dialogue between two teams doesn’t exclude critical approaches – it just requires them to debate the resolution.  There has to be a place for the negative in a debate – otherwise the affirmative is an independent monologue that precludes dialogue.  Fairness is the prerequisite for any investigation of argument.<br />
<br />
Galloway, 7 –professor of communication at Samford University (Ryan, “DINNER AND CONVERSATION AT THE ARGUMENTATIVE TABLE: RECONCEPTUALIZING DEBATE AS AN ARGUMENTATIVE DIALOGUE”, Contemporary Argumentation and Debate, Vol. 28 (2007), ebsco)<br />
<br />
Conceiving debate as a dialogue exposes a means of bridging the divide between the policy community and the kritik community. Here I will distinguish between formal argument and dialogue. While formal argument centers on the demands of informal and formal logic as a mechanism of mediation, dialogue tends to focus on the relational aspects of an interaction. As such, it emphasizes the give-and-take process of negotiation. Consequently, dialogue emphasizes outcomes related to agreement or consensus rather than propositional correctness (Mendelson &amp; Lindeman, 2000). As dialogue, the affirmative case constitutes a discursive act that anticipates a discursive response. The consequent interplay does not seek to establish a propositional truth, but seeks to initiate an in-depth dialogue between the debate participants. Such an approach would have little use for rigid rules of logic or argument, such as stock issues or fallacy theory, except to the point where the participants agreed that these were functional approaches. Instead, a dialogic approach encourages evaluations of affirmative cases relative to their performative benefits, or whether or not the case is a valuable speech act. The move away from formal logic structure toward a dialogical conversation model allows for a broader perspective regarding the ontological status of debate. At the same time, a dialogical approach challenges the ways that many teams argue speech act and performance theory in debates. Because there are a range of ways that performative oriented teams argue their cases, there is little consensus regarding the status of topicality. While some take topicality as a central challenge to creating performance-based debates, many argue that topicality is wholly irrelevant to the debate, contending that the requirement that a critical affirmative be topical silences creativity and oppositional approaches. However, if we move beyond viewing debate as an ontologically independent monologue—but as an invitation to dialogue, our attention must move from the ontology of the affirmative case to a consideration of the case in light of exigent opposition (Farrell, 1985). Thus, the initial speech act of the affirmative team sets the stage for an emergent response. While most responses deal directly with the affirmative case, Farrell notes that they may also deal with metacommunication regarding the process of negotiation. In this way, we may conceptualize the affirmative’s goal in creating a “germ of a response” (Bakhtin, 1990) whose completeness bears on the possibility of all subsequent utterances. Conceived as a dialogue, the affirmative speech act anticipates the negative response. A failure to adequately encourage, or anticipate a response deprives the negative speech act and the emergent dialogue of the capacity for a complete inquiry. Such violations short circuit the dialogue and undermine the potential for an emerging dialogue to gain significance (either within the debate community or as translated to forums outside of the activity). Here, the dialogical model performs as a fairness model, contending that the affirmative speech act, be it policy oriented, critical, or performative in nature, must adhere to normative restrictions to achieve its maximum competitive and ontological potential.<br />

Space debates that don’t incorporate politics are naïve and doomed to fail. <br />
<br />
Johnson-Freese and Handberg 97 (Joan Johnson-Freese, Professor of International Security Studies at Air War College, and Roger Handberg, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Center for Space Policy and Law at the University of Central Florida, 1997, “Space, The Dormant Frontier: Changing the Paradigm for the 21st Century,” Praeger Publishing, p. 230-231)<br />
<br />
Visionaries, almost by definition, desire to work in a perfect world where participants’ motivations are pure and all mean what they say. This usually gets translated into a world devoid of that ugly human characteristic—politics. This desire for an apolitical world is why being visionary too often correlates with either being naïve or a hypocrite. In the former situation, the condition of being apolitical translates into no conflict. That is, everyone everywhere accepts the espoused goal uncritically and without hesitation. Such a simplistic world neglects to consider human nature in that individuals normally perceive the world differently (thereby creating conflicts, intentionally or not) and often engage in competition for personal and/or organization status and scarce resources even while pursuing the same goal. The politics need not be partisan or ideological in nature. They may merely reflect diverse institutional perspectives and personality clashes. Those conflicts in the broadest human sense are political, for they reflect self-interested motivations that divert attention from the primary objective. From a more realistic perspective, this type of politics cannot be abolished unless human nature is removed. Some visionaries propose such &quot;perfect&quot; worlds or utopias, but their desires are usually defeated. For brief and shining moments, such dissension may be suppressed in pursuit of some overriding goal, for example, during times of war and national emergency. Given time, cracks in the facade of unanimity appear (the dissension having been only muted, not banished), which often widen into major schisms because the idea of dissension (e.g. politics in a primitive sense) is so abhorrent to major participants. Space policy has its visionaries who perceive the future in a particular way and are not tolerant of alternative future scenarios. Indeed, there are those who view the past in a particular way, to the determinant of the future. Those who profess President Kennedy as a space visionary with no political motivation simplify their lives by then needing only to wish for another visionary president who could magically &quot;fix things.&quot;&quot; While that view ignores reality, it makes life more manageable. Dissent from their views, either in a historical or future sense, is viewed as equivalent to treason to the cause or ignorance at best. Perhaps a more useful approach is that the learning process is often painful but necessary, and critics are not always the devil; they may be misguided, but they are not the devil. Some critics are even prophets of the future, just out often with the imperfect present. <br />

Debate over space is key to education over major global problems<br />
Byerly 92 (Radford Byerly, Jr., member on NASA Space Science Advisory Committee, NRC Board of Assessment of NIST Programs among other committees, Space Policy Alternatives, Westview Press 1992) <br />
<br />
Seeking to elevate debate in such a manner also makes clear that part of the burden rests with heretofore quiet players, including the public and the space science community. While one percent of the typical household's tax bill may render space presently unimportant enough to worry about, the space station, Earth Observing System, and human exploration initiatives would dig much deeper into pockets. Moreover, a public that appears increasingly to care about environmental amenities, global sustainability, and math and science skills may indeed value space research for knowledge's sake. Then again, it may not. Finding out is important.25 Similarly, the science community could play a large role in raising the quality of the debate insofar as it can enunciate the scientific benefit of knowledge gained from space. Reports that tend to be circulated only within the community suggest that these benefits are indeed large (having radically changed our understanding of the planet and the universe).2 If so, such benefits should expressly be included in debate. The responsibility, expertise, and as budgets tighten, the incentives to do so rest with the community. <br />

Debating space inspires debaters to join the activity – it’s more easily accessible<br />
NFHS 11 (2011, National Federation of State High School Associations, Space Exploration Topic Paper)<br />
<br />
Space exploration fires the imagination of people like little else. The 1969 moon landings rank as one of the highest achievements of modern civilization. There is something uncanny about the human need to explore their world, and little captures people’s minds like looking up at the stars and wondering. As a debate topic, space exploration would do the same thing. Like it or not, cross-examination debate participation numbers are declining. A topic like this could fire the imagination of potential debaters, and the easy accessibility of this topic would make the learning curve on the subject less steep than other topics which often require a more detailed background. <br />

Policy analysis is key to have a complete perspective of space. <br />
<br />
Handberg 02 (Roger Handberg, Professor of Political Science at University of Central Florida, 2002, from “Space Politics and Policy: an Evolutionary Perspective,” edited by Eligar Sadeh, Kluwer Academic Publishers, p. 39-40) <br />
<br />
The research literature that examines the rationales underpinning the US space program is fairly sparse and highly selective. This state of the literature is a function of the space policy field’s development. Many of the writers engaged in space policy analysis have been policy participants and advocates, meaning their analyses are focused upon explicating and justifying their viewpoints regarding the issues of the day. The most prominent writers have been direct participants in the space program including Wernher von Braun and Carl Sagan. Advocacy literature is typical because the policy choices are controversial. For instance, the current debate over the feasibility of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) generates controversy between economics and technical feasibility. This occurs in advance of any demonstration of the RLV concept in actual flight, resulting in literature that focuses upon technological specifics rather than the broader political contours embodied in rationales.   Academic observers, who write in the area of space policy, put forward analyses that are either technical-analytic focused or policy-studies oriented. In the former case, the focus is on effectively accomplishing the specific mission or overcoming a particular technical problem where political issues are external to the frame of reference. There is a disjunction between practitioners and policy-makers due to this myopia. Public policies by definition involve politics, and analyses that fail to incorporate such insights remain incomplete. In the latter case, researchers tend to concentrate on how a particular program meets its programmatic goals. These program goals flow from the broader rationales discussed herein yet the very rationales underlying the goals are either unexamined or are assumed to be fixed and agreed-upon. Such a disconnection is typical of academic disciplines where certain fundamentals are assumed to be true; therefore, the research focuses on the factual issues generated by hose rationales. <br />

Interpretation - of space’ indicates that space must be the object of exploration or development – it is different from activities that occur ‘in’ space<br />
Bockstiegel 95 –Ph D., Directitor of the Institute of Air and Space Law, Chairman of the Space Law Committee of the International Law Association; Chairman of Council of the National German Space Agency (Dr. Karl-Heinz, 1995, “Research and invention in outer space: liability and intellectual property rights” pg 4.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The official title of the Outer Space Treaty (‘OST’) mentions both exploration and use of outer space as the two ‘activities of States’ which one has to take into account and which are therefore covered by the Outer Space Treaty. The same pair of terms appears again in the Preamble as well as further articles such as Article I and Article III of the Treaty. Other articles and other space treaties either take up only one of these two terms or use a general terms such as ‘activities in outer space’ (Art. VI, OST) or generally deal with ‘objects launched into outer space’ (Art. VII, Art. VIII, OST and the Registration Convention) or ‘space objects’ (Liability Convention) or finally ‘activities of States on the Moon and other celestial bodies’ (Moon Treaty). At first sight the distinction between exploration and use may seem sufficiently clear. Indeed in connection with most space activities there may be little doubt which of these two terms is applicable. First doubts appear, however, because the Outer Space Treaty speaks of exploration ‘of outer space’. This wording could be interpreted to mean that space must be the object of exploration. The consequence would be that the great part of research which has to take place ‘in space’ in view of the specific physical conditions there, but which has as its object specific materials, would not be covered and might only be considered as ‘use’ of space<br />
<br />
Violation – The affirmative creates space development, not development of space – activities occurring such as targeting are not topical<br />
<br />
Limits – specifying what the affirmative can do in space makes the amount of affirmatives limitless. What the equipment does should not be specified <br />
<br />
Extra topicality – The deployment of weapons in space is okay but the part that is untopical is what the space lasers do. This makes the ground of the affirmative limitless and makes disadvantages impossible to link <br />
<br />
Voting issue for fair limits and fairness <br />

This concept provides an expanded, but complementary, role for a new generation of stratospheric platforms. As with satellites, these platforms will be global in nature and essentially orbit the Earth. However, StratoSat™ systems will fly much lower and slower than satellites, enabling in situ measurements not possible from satellites and improving surface and atmospheric remote sensing performance. Such a system provides a wide range of potential benefits including new opportunities for Earth science, global communications, worldwide defense, and monitoring global pollution <br />

Debris is reaching its tipping point. A single collision could threaten communication and lives.<br />

<br />
The volume of abandoned rockets, shattered satellites and missile shrapnel in the Earth’s orbit is reaching a “tipping point” and is now threatening the $250 billion (£174bn) space services industry, scientists said. A single collision between two satellites or large pieces of “space junk” could send thousands of pieces of debris spinning into orbit, each capable of destroying further satellites. Global positioning systems, international phone connections, television signals and weather forecasts are among the services which are at risk of crashing to a halt. This “chain reaction” could leave some orbits so cluttered with debris that they become unusable for commercial or military satellites, the US Defense Department's interim Space Posture Review warned last year. There are also fears that large pieces of debris could threaten the lives of astronauts in space shuttles or at the International Space Station.<br />

More space launches will increase debris.<br />

This ASAT mission, however, was not the United States’ first. Although most of America’s space debris “comes from the upper stages of [satellite] launch vehicles,”123 until 2002, the United States was also responsible for over 250 pieces of space debris, ten centimeters or larger, that it created during a 1985 ASAT test.124 <br />

These gloomy prognostications about the threats to our space environment should be troubling to Americans. The United States relies on the unhindered use of outer space for national security.151 According to a space commission led by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, “[t]he [United States] is more dependent on space than any other nation.”152 According to Robert G. Joseph, former Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security at the State Department, “space capabilities are vital to our national security and to our economic well-being.”153 Therefore, a catastrophic collision between space debris and the satellites on which that national security so heavily depends poses a very real and current threat to the national security interests of the United States. Since “the [1991] Gulf War, the [United States] military has depended on satellites for communications, intelligence and navigation for its troops and precision-guided weapons.”154 Satellites are also used for reconnaissance and surveillance, command and control, and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.155 According to the United States Space Command’s Fact Sheet: Satellites provide essential in-theater secure communications, weather and navigational data for ground, air and fleet operations and threat warning. Ground-based radar and Defense Support Program satellites monitor ballistic missile launches around the world to guard against a surprise missile attack on North America. Space surveillance radars provide vital information on the location of satellites and space debris for the nation and the world. Maintaining space superiority is an emerging capability required to protect our space assets. With the modern speed of warfare, it has become difficult to fight conflicts without the timely intelligence and information that space assets provide. Space-based assets and space-controlled assets have created among U.S. military commanders “a nearly insatiable desire for live video surveillance, especially as provided from remotely piloted vehicles like the Predator and now the Reaper.”157 Moreover, military forces have become so dependent on satellite communications and targeting capabilities that the loss of such a satellite would “badly damage their ability to respond to a military emergency.”158 In fact, the May 2008 malfunction of a communications satellite demonstrates the fragile nature of the satellite communications system.159 The temporary loss of a single satellite “effectively pulled the plug on what executives said could [have been] as much as 90 percent of the paging network in the United States.”160 Although this country’s paging network is perhaps not vital to its national security, the incident demonstrates the possible national security risks created by the simultaneous loss of multiple satellites due to space debris collisions. <br />

<br />
A world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and receptive to American values--democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, renegade states, and low level conflicts. Finally, U S leadership would help preclude the rise of another global rival, enabling the U S and the world to avoid another cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange. <br />

Irony is an endless game of illusions that promotes tyrannical ideas of inaction like a genocidal state                                                                                               <br />
Wallace, 97 (David Foster, Professor of Creative Writing and English at Pomona College, “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do again,” pgs 66-68)<br />
<br />
So then how have irony, irreverence, and rebellion come to be not liberating but enfeebling in the culture today's avant-garde tries to write about? One clue's to be found in the fact that irony is still around, bigger than ever after 30 long years as the dominant mode of hip expression. It's not a rhetorical mode that wears well. As Hyde (whom I pretty obviously like) puts it, &quot;Irony has only emergency use. Carried over time, it is the voice of the trapped who have come to enjoy their cage:'32 This is because irony, entertaining as it is, serves an almost exclusively negative function. It's critical and destructive, a ground-clearing. Surely this is the way our postmodern fathers saw it. But irony's singularly unuseful when it comes to constructing anything to replace the hypocrisies it debunks. This is why Hyde seems right about persistent irony being tiresome. It is unmeaty. Even gifted ironists work best in sound bites. I find gifted ironists sort of wickedly fun to listen to at parties, but I always walk away feeling like I've had several radical surgical procedures. And as for actually driving cross-country with a gifted ironist, or sitting through a 300-page novel full of nothing but trendy sardonic exhaustion, one ends up feeling not only empty but somehow . . . oppressed.<br />
Think, for a moment, of Third World rebels and coups. Third World rebels are great at exposing and overthrowing corrupt hypocritical regimes, but they seem noticeably less great at the mundane, non-negative task of then establishing a superior governing alternative. Victorious rebels, in fact, seem best at using their tough, cynical rebel-skills to avoid being rebelled against themselves — in other words, they just become better tyrants.<br />
And make no mistake: irony tyrannizes us. The reason why our pervasive cultural irony is at once so powerful and so unsatisfying is that an ironist is impossible to pin down. All U.S. irony is based on an implicit &quot;I don't really mean what I'm saying.&quot; So what does irony as a cultural norm mean to say? That it's impossible to mean what you say? That maybe it's too bad it's impossible, but wake up and smell the coffee already? Most likely, I think, today's irony ends up saying: &quot;How totally banal of you to ask what I really mean.&quot; Anyone with the heretical gall to ask an ironist what he actually stands for ends up looking like an hysteric or a prig. And herein lies the oppressiveness of institutionalized irony, the too-successful rebel: the ability to interdict the question without attending to its subject is, when exercised, tyranny. It is the new junta, using the very tool that exposed its enemy to insulate itself.<br />
<br />
Irony is a decoy that devoids us from real activism<br />
Goerlandt, 06 (Iannis, Professor at Ghent University, “Put the Book Down and Slowly Walk Away:” Irony and David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest, Volume 47, Issue 3, Spring, Proquest)<br />
<br />
Hutcheon also spots the possibility of complacency in irony: irony becomes a kind of surrogate for actual resistance and opposition. Ironists have been accused of smugness before, [. . .] but this time it is the interpreter too who is not being let off the hook. Even worse, irony is seen by some to have become a cliché of contemporary culture, a &quot;convention for establishing complicity,&quot; a &quot;screen for bad faith&quot; [. . .]. What was once an &quot;avenue of dissent&quot; is now seen as &quot;a commodity in its own right&quot; [. . .]. This position is usually articulated in terms of contrast: the &quot;authentic&quot; or &quot;sincere&quot; past versus the ironic present of the &quot;total&quot; ironist [. . .] whose use of what is interpreted as a mode of &quot;monadic relativism&quot; [. . .] prevents taking any stand on any issue.

But here is where we need a political economy of irony, or an ironic reading of political economy. I love the fact that Willett is aiming very high, at the very heart of our heartless social system, as captured well by the title of her second chapter, “Laughter Against Hubris: A Preemptive Strike.” It is a matter of deploying the comedic modes against imperial hubris, as a strike against empire itself. Irony absolutely abounds in this crazy social system, from the couple whose money went toward a dirt bike rather than health insurance to the role that “exotic financial instruments” (such as the bizarre phenomenon of “naked short selling”) have played in the current economic crisis, to say nothing of a seven-hundred-billion-dollar bailout for “capitalists” who are criminal rip-off artists on a scale and who are playing the central contradiction of capitalism, of socialized production and privatized accumulation, at a pitch that Marx could not have imagined. Surely there is a large role for ridicule here, but perhaps even much more for simple, outright condemnation and even more for, as Marx said, the weapons of criticism to go over to “criticism” by weapons! Irony, on the one hand, works differently from “simple” ridicule (even if it can fill out a certain kind of ridicule); among other complexities it always comes in at an angle, so to speak, and not simply straight on. On the other hand, for this very reason, it may not be able to play an emancipatory role in a world that is so upside down—or, at the very least, we’d better be careful in how we approach the question of a politics of irony.<br />

Alternatives to capitalism leads to suffering the collapse of civilization<br />

On one hand there is nothing to say, really. You are surrounded by the blessings of capitalism. The buffet table, which you and your lunch partners only had to walk into a building to find, has a greater variety of food at a cheaper price than that which was available to any living person — king, lord, duke, plutocrat, or pope — in almost all of the history of the world. Not even fifty years ago would this have been imaginable.    All of history has been defined by the struggle for food. And yet that struggle has been abolished, not just for the rich but for everyone living in developed economies. The ancients, peering into this scene, might have assumed it to be Elysium. Medieval man conjured up such scenes only in visions of Utopia. Even in the late 19th century, the most gilded palace of the richest industrialist required a vast staff and immense trouble to come anywhere near approximating it.    We owe this scene to capitalism. To put it differently, we owe this scene to centuries of capital accumulation at the hands of free people who have put capital to work on behalf of economic innovations, at once competing with others for profit and cooperating with millions upon millions of people in an ever-expanding global network of the division of labor. The savings, investments, risks, and work of hundreds of years and uncountable numbers of free people have gone into making this scene possible, thanks to the ever-remarkable capacity for a society developing under conditions of liberty to achieve the highest aspirations of the society's members.    And yet, sitting on the other side of the table are well-educated people who imagine that the way to end the world's woes is through socialism. Now, people's definitions of socialism differ, and these persons would probably be quick to say that they do not mean the Soviet Union or anything like that. That was socialism in name only, I would be told. And yet, if socialism does mean anything at all today, it imagines that there can be some social improvement resulting from the political movement to take capital out of private hands and put it into the hands of the state. Other tendencies of socialism include the desire to see labor organized along class lines and given some sort of coercive power over how their employers' property is used. It might be as simple as the desire to put a cap on the salaries of CEOs, or it could be as extreme as the desire to abolish all private property, money, and even marriage.    Whatever the specifics of the case in question, socialism always means overriding the free decisions of individuals and replacing that capacity for decision making with an overarching plan by the state. Taken far enough, this mode of thought won't just spell an end to opulent lunches. It will mean the end of what we all know as civilization itself. It would plunge us back to a primitive state of existence, living off hunting and gathering in a world with little art, music, leisure, or charity. Nor is any form of socialism capable of providing for the needs of the world's six billion people, so the population would shrink dramatically and quickly and in a manner that would make every human horror ever known seem mild by comparison. Nor is it possible to divorce socialism from totalitarianism, because if you are serious about ending private ownership of the means of production, you have to be serious about ending freedom and creativity too. You will have to make the whole of society, or what is left of it, into a prison.    In short, the wish for socialism is a wish for unparalleled human evil. If we really understood this, no one would express casual support for it in polite company. It would be like saying, you know, there is really something to be said for malaria and typhoid and dropping atom bombs on millions of innocents.    Do the people sitting across the table really wish for this? Certainly not. So what has gone wrong here? Why can these people not see what is obvious? Why can't people sitting amidst market-created plenty, enjoying all the fruits of capitalism every minute of life, see the merit of the market but rather wish for something that is a proven disaster?    What we have here is a failure of understanding. That is to say, a failure to connect causes with effects. This is a wholly abstract idea. Knowledge of cause and effect does not come to us by merely looking around a room, living in a certain kind of society, or observing statistics. You can study roomfuls of data, read a thousand treatises on history, or plot international GDP figures on a graph for a living, and yet the truth about cause and effect can still be evasive. You still might miss the point that it is capitalism that gives rise to prosperity and freedom. You might still be tempted by the notion of socialism as savior.    Let me take you back to the years 1989 and 1990. These were the years that most of us remember as the time when socialism collapsed in Eastern Europe and Russia. Events of that time flew in the face of all predictions on the Right that these were permanent regimes that would never change unless they were bombed back to the Stone Age. On the Left, it was widely believed, even in those times, that these societies were actually doing quite well and would eventually pass the United States and Western Europe in prosperity, and, by some measures, that they were already better off than us.    And yet it collapsed. Even the Berlin Wall, that symbol of oppression and slavery, was torn down by the people themselves. It was not only glorious to see socialism collapse. It was thrilling, from a libertarian point of view, to see how states themselves can dissolve. They may have all the guns and all the power, and the people have none of those, and yet, when the people themselves decide that they will no longer be governed, the state has few options left. It eventually collapses amid a society-wide refusal to believe its lies any longer.    When these closed societies suddenly became open, what did we see? We saw lands that time forgot. The technology was backwards and broken. The food was scarce and disgusting. The medical care was abysmal. The people were unhealthy. Property was polluted.    It was also striking to see what had happened to the culture under socialism. Many generations had been raised under a system built on power and lies, and so the cultural infrastructure that we take for granted was not secure. Such notions as trust, promise, truth, honesty, and planning for the future — all pillars of commercial culture — had become distorted and confused by the ubiquity and persistence of the statist curse.    <br />

The gloom may be misplaced. Reports of capitalism's death have been exaggerated before and it has stubbornly survived Karl Marx, the Great Depression, world wars and oil shocks. And in contrast to the Maya, it is possible our technology will prevail over population and environmental pressures. Malthusian doomsayers have consistently underestimated the capacity of better irrigation, pesticides, new strains of crops and other technologies to boost food yields. The rate of population growth is slowing and human numbers are expected to peak at around 9.2 billion by 2050 before declining. That Asians are moving more and more to western-type diets and consumer baubles will strain resources, acknowledges the Economist. But don't worry: &quot;There is no limit to human ingenuity.&quot;  If the gloomy environmental prognosis is correct, and global warming is set to wreak major havoc, what are the chances we will respond better than the Maya? Electing Bush instead of Al Gore suggests limited wisdom in picking kings, and emasculating the Kyoto treaty was perhaps as sensible as burning corn harvests to appease the gods. When Republicans chant, &quot;Drill, baby, drill!&quot; it is not much of a stretch to picture them, barefoot and in traditional huipil shirts, rooting for another sacrifice.  Nevertheless there are promising omens. Governments are beginning to assign monetary values to natural &quot;assets&quot; such as forests, a conceptual leap that could reinvent economics. The EU has set up a carbon-trading market to get industry to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The UN is pushing for a new climate treaty in which governments will pay tropical countries billions of dollars annually to leave their forests untouched. Ecuador has already requested $350m a year in exchange for leaving 1bn barrels of oil beneath its Amazon floor. &quot;I believe the 21st century will be dominated by the concept of natural capital, just as the 20th was dominated by financial capital,&quot; says Achim Steiner, head of the UN environment programme.<br />

Turns their moral obligation – only capitalism sustains freedom and value to life<br />
<br />
Douglas, Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ UC San Diego, ‘91<br />
[“The Myth of the Welfare State”, p. 42-43, Google Books <em> Reuben]<br />
<br />
The modernist welfare state is ultimately, if unknowingly, built on the logic of totalitarian collectivism: when the goal of the state becomes that of pursuing the common welfare, without basic constraints of custom, moral principle, or constitutional law, then the welfare of any individual or subgroup rapidly approaches zero. Thus, we eventually arrive at the logical conclusion of the egalitarian welfare state, the conclusion Rousseau and socialist revolutionaries in Europe reached two centuries ago: the equal welfare of all demands that the individual welfares of everyone be totally sacrificed to the state that is rhetorically committed to the common welfare. And so the Juggernaut of the modernist welfare state trundles onward, slowly but relentlessly crushing beneath its bureaucratic powers our ancient freedoms one after another--to serve the common welfare of all, of course. Today the businesspeople, the gas producers, and the steel makers; tomorrow the doctors; then the parents; and someday the entire world.  The opposite of the logic of totalitarian collectivism is the logic of individual freedom within the System of Natural Liberty. The logic of collectivism computes the individual welfare, if at all, in terms of the collective welfare, that is, in terms of aggregates like gross national product, income distribution, relative poverty, and, above all distributive justice--equality. The logic of individualist freedom does the opposite, that is, it computes the general welfare in terms of all the individuals' welfare as defined and experienced by the individuals. Certainly the individuals define their welfare in good part in terms derived from their family and community ties, in communion with their own consciences and with the embodiments of their consciences in the constitution; for we human beings are profoundly loving beings who identify with our ancestors, our communities, and our posterity. But it is we alone, acting as individuals, who can know in our hearts what is right and good for us and our loved ones. It is we alone who can most truthfully define our own welfare.  The American Constitution was built upon the logic of individual freedom. The American government was founded to promote the general welfare, but to the eighteenth-century classic liberals that meant the exact opposite of what the common welfare means to the American statists today. Because they assumed that welfare could only be defined individually, most Americans intended the government to promote the general welfare by remaining as small and weak as it could while serving the two obviously, specific, and explicitly bounded forms of general welfare: that of defense against foreign powers that wanted to impose absolutist tyranny on Americans and that against the domestic oppression of crime and rebellion. Thus it was that they discovered that revolutionary idea of individual freedom: minimizing the power of government will optimize the welfare of all. Liberty was both the greatest blessing in itself and the fount from which would spring all others by enabling individuals to use all their potentially vast spiritual energy and creativity. Thus it was that when Tocqueville visited America in the early 1830s, he found a remarkable &quot;absence&quot; of government and an equally remarkable high level of general welfare--a land of freedom and, thus, of peace and plenty.<br />

Capitalism solves resource scarcity<br />

Lomborg (2001, 29) also indicates why this improvement is occurring. Trade and less costly transport effectively act to reduce risks and make local areas less vulnerable to natural resource exhaustion and depletion. This is a tremendously important insight. In a trading economy, production does not necessarily have to take place at the physical location of demand, but where it is most efficient. An implication is that as resource scarcity occurs and prices and costs rise in a trading world, production will shift to other locations with less scarcity and lower prices and costs. The effect is that each country can almost indefinitely postpone running into a wall imposed by resource scarcity, and all of the trading economies will benefit. <br />

&quot;As famine, disease, and weather-related disasters strike due to abrupt climate change,&quot; the Pentagon report notes, &quot;many countries' needs will exceed their carrying capacity&quot; -- that is, their ability to provide the minimum requirements for human survival. This &quot;will create a sense of desperation, which is likely to lead to offensive aggression&quot; against countries with a greater stock of vital resources. &quot;Imagine eastern European countries, struggling to feed their populations with a falling supply of food, water, and energy, eyeing Russia, whose population is already in decline, for access to its grain, minerals, and energy supply.&quot;  Similar scenarios will be replicated all across the planet, as those without the means to survival invade or migrate to those with greater abundance -- producing endless struggles between resource &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots.&quot;  It is this prospect, more than anything, that worries John Reid. In particular, he expressed concern over the inadequate capacity of poor and unstable countries to cope with the effects of climate change, and the resulting risk of state collapse, civil war and mass migration. &quot;More than 300 million people in Africa currently lack access to safe water,&quot; he observed, and &quot;climate change will worsen this dire situation&quot; -- provoking more wars like Darfur. And even if these social disasters will occur primarily in the developing world, the wealthier countries will also be caught up in them, whether by participating in peacekeeping and humanitarian aid operations, by fending off unwanted migrants or by fighting for access to overseas supplies of food, oil, and minerals.  When reading of these nightmarish scenarios, it is easy to conjure up images of desperate, starving people killing one another with knives, staves and clubs -- as was certainly often the case in the past, and could easily prove to be so again. But these scenarios also envision the use of more deadly weapons. &quot;In this world of warring states,&quot; the 2003 Pentagon report predicted, &quot;nuclear arms proliferation is inevitable.&quot; As oil and natural gas disappears, more and more countries will rely on nuclear power to meet their energy needs -- and this &quot;will accelerate nuclear proliferation as countries develop enrichment and reprocessing capabilities to ensure their national security.&quot;  Although speculative, these reports make one thing clear: when thinking about the calamitous effects of global climate change, we must emphasize its social and political consequences as much as its purely environmental effects. Drought, flooding and storms can kill us, and surely will -- but so will wars among the survivors of these catastrophes over what remains of food, water and shelter. As Reid's comments indicate, no society, however affluent, will escape involvement in these forms of conflict.<br />

Capitalism key to ethics – gives individuals freedom to determine their own morality <br />
<br />
Romar, Lecturer in Management, ‘09<br />
[Journal of Business Ethics, “Noble Markets: The Noble/Slave Ethic in Hayek’s Free Market Capitalism”, p. 57-66, Google Scholar </em> Lack]<br />
<br />
Like Nietzsche, Hayek, though acutely aware of  the importance of ethics in a world based upon  maximum freedom, did not develop a complete  ethical theory to support the functioning of free  market capitalism. Like Nietzsche, Hayek does not  claim to know the meaning of morality or, in  Nietzsche’s case, good and evil.3 Beyond support for  the principles needed to anchor the functioning of  free markets and the institutions needed to support  them, Hayek left it to individual actors to develop  their own moral principles, so long as these did not  contradict those needed to support free markets. It  was not his intention to prescribe a detailed ethical  system to support free market capitalism because to  do so would violate his principle of freedom and  curtail the creativity of markets. Yet, the world described  by Hayek is one where individuals have  substantial power to control their destiny and seek  their own level, a world where talent and risk  dominate, a world governed by self interest, a world  where individuals have few responsibilities to others,  and a world driven by competition where reward  goes to the successful. He described a world open to  Nietzschean ethics.  In The Road to Serfdom (1994) and The Fatal  Conceit (1988) Hayek presents a powerful and eloquent  attack on twentieth century totalitarianism. In  The Road to Serfdom he argues that the socialist  experiment must inevitably lead to totalitarianism  and the complete elimination of individual liberty  and freedom. In the name of principles of social  justice, society installs a system of centralized social  and economic planning, substitutes collective decisions  for individual ones, and requires each person to  adopt an identical and complete set of social values.  Furthermore, to achieve its objectives, the socialist  state must determine in great detail the allocation of  resources and insure that each individual performs precisely his/her assigned role. Planned economies  must substitute collectivist thought, values and  behavior and eliminate any room for individualism.  Hayek labels this weltanschauung the ‘‘fatal conceit.’’  It is fatal because it cannot achieve its objectives  and it is conceit because it overestimates the  role of human rationality and man’s ability to control  social and economic processes. He sees constructivist  continental European philosophic thought, primarily  Cartesian rationalism, as the source of this error  (Hayek, 1948, pp. 9–10; 1973, pp. 9–12). This  philosophic tradition argues that man can understand  the world completely and, therefore, social and  economic processes can be understood completely  and molded to fit human will.  Hayek considers this a foolish, self-serving and  arrogant position.4 Certainly, humans have a powerful  intellect and reasoning skills. Human reason,  though powerful, has its limitations and cannot  completely understand with any certainty how human  institutions and social processes evolved and  how they operate. He views the evolution and  development of human institutions, be they money,  markets, or ethics as spontaneous, self-generating  orders. Systems, if you will, evolving gradually,  accidentally, on the basis of incremental change; not  as a result of human design. He labels this ‘‘between  instinct and reason.’’ Humans can understand to  some extent how human society evolved from clan  based societies into modern, complex ones based  upon individualism and abstract rules, but we cannot  know the processes or mechanisms of this evolution  in sufficient detail to bend them to our will. We can  tweak the social and moral systems but cannot  engineer them. Man can modify social processes and  their underlying ethical foundations; but, in the final  analysis, we must accept them as is.5  Since social process and institutions obey their  own set of evolutionary principles which man cannot  know completely, it is best for these to evolve  on their own, without much human interference. In  The Constitution of Liberty (1960) and Law, Legislation  and Liberty (3 vols., 1973, 1976, 1979) Hayek  develops his ideas about the proper principles of  economic and political organizations and their  underlying ethical foundations. The fundamental principle of social organization must be based upon  the principle of liberty, which may be defined as  ‘‘that condition of men in which coercion of some  by others is reduced as much as possible in society’’6  (Hayek, 1960, p. 11). Hayek’s conception of the  free, just and moral society is not one where there is  a complete absence of coercion but where coercion  is limited to those situations where it is required to  prevent a reduction in the liberty of others. Society  may use coercion to protect private property and to  secure individual rights and conditions which allow  each person the maximum amount of personal  freedom to make choices of their own. This is  accomplished through a limited set of abstract rules  ‘‘that apply equally to all’’ which protect private or  several property, enforce contracts, and prevent  fraud and deception’’ (Hayek, 1960, pp. 140, 141,  143, 155).  While Hayek is concerned with just and moral  principles of economic, political and social organization,  he views attempts to achieve ‘‘distributive  justice’’ as the root cause of the immorality brought  about by planned economies. In order to achieve the  desired goals, human behavior must be planned in  minute detail, thereby eliminating freedom of  choice. Achieving collectivist goals mean that there  can be no individual ones. Organizing to control  every outcome means there cannot be individual  choice. Social control means there will be little  individual control and it is all doomed because humans  cannot understand completely the mechanisms  needed to reach their objectives. The only solution  must be the free market and the minimal organizational  principles required for it to operate efficiently.  Since these are few and well known, it will be easier to succeed and create a just and moral society. Allow  the market free reign and the just and moral society  will follow according to its own principles.<br />

<br />
To understand the cause of war, consider the major wars of the 20th century. World War I was started by the dictatorial monarchies of Germany and Russia. Nazi Germany caused World War II by invading Poland. Totalitarian Soviet Russia repeatedly initiated war by first aligning with Hitler in the conquest of Poland, then by swallowing up Eastern Europe in 1945, and later by supporting the Communist invasion of South Korea.    And consider recent but less global conflicts: Saddam Hussein instigated the Persian Gulf War by conquering Kuwait. The Taliban, former dictators of Afghanistan, warred against other factions in Afghanistan and then spread its terror overseas by arming and abetting Osama bin Laden's attacks against the United States. Observe the pattern. It is the less free nations--those in which power is concentrated in the hands of the state at the expense of the individual--that attack their freer neighbors. Such statist regimes, which deny any rights to the individual, are the cause of history's most savage wars. Statist regimes launched the wars that ravaged much of the world in the 20th century. The reason why these regimes did so is not difficult to find. Dictators are in chronic war against their own people. Hitler murdered the Jews; Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot each murdered millions of businessmen, landowners and bourgeoisie; Milosevic slaughtered the Muslims, Saddam Hussein butchered the Kurds. In her seminal essay, &quot;The Roots of War,&quot; Ayn Rand observed: &quot;A country that violates the rights of its own citizens, will not respect the rights of its neighbors. Those who do not recognize individuals rights, will not recognize the rights of nations: a nation is only a number of individuals.&quot;    Statism is the cause of war. Statism rests on the idea that men can legitimately pursue their ends by initiating force against other men. In a free country such acts are properly regarded as criminal and punished by law; in a free country government uses force only in retaliation against those who initiate it. But statist regimes of all varieties--Nazi, Communist, Islamic Fundamentalist, etc.--initiate force ceaselessly against innocent victims, first within their own borders and then without. In a free country it is recognized that every individual has an inalienable right to his own life. In a statist country the individual exists in bondage to the state, his life to be sacrificed at the whim of the state.    Shamefully, the Nobel Committee has repeatedly awarded its Peace Prize to the bringers of war.    For example, it routinely bestows the prize on statists who condemn the United States--the world's freest, most individualistic country--while praising murderous Third World dictatorships. It awarded the 1994 prize to Yasser Arafat, the brutal dictator of the Palestinian Authority, who imposed a despotic regime on his own people and initiated a murderous war against the free citizens of Israel. Even worse, in 1973 it awarded the prize to Le Duc Tho, the North Vietnamese Communist, who, along with Ho Chi Minh and other Party leaders, imposed a vicious Communist dictatorship in North Vietnam that slaughtered at least 50,000 Vietnamese in the 1950s and then invaded and conquered South Vietnam. All told, the death toll caused by that Communist dictatorship and its warring totaled two million individuals.    If one admires men who cause war, one will ignore or vilify men who promote peace. Those who respect and support individual rights and political/economic freedom are the only true lovers of peace. Private capitalists and businessmen are outstanding examples. Business requires the barring of the initiation of force. Businessmen deal with one another peacefully, by means of trade, persuasion and voluntary contracts and agreements. Because businessmen respect the rights of all individuals, they have helped liberate the best minds to innovate, invent and advance, and thereby helped produce great general prosperity and peace. By helping to spread free trade across the globe, they have created peaceful relations among the individuals of many nations. Yet perversely, capitalists are denounced as exploiters of man. If we sincerely seek to attain the inestimable value that is world peace, it is individual rights and therefore capitalism that we must endorse. Capitalism is the only political-economic system that protects individual rights by banning the initiation of force. As Ayn Rand observed, it was capitalism that gave mankind its longest period of peace--an era in which there were no wars involving the entire civilized world--from the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914.  If we truly want to recognize and promote the cause of peace, let us award a peace prize to Capitalism.<br />

Environmentalists and globalization foes are united in their fear that greater population and consumption of energy, materials, and chemicals accompanying economic growth, technological change and free trade—the mainstays of globalization—degrade human and environmental well-being. Indeed, the 20th century saw the United States’ population multiply by four, income by seven, carbon dioxide emissions by nine, use of materials by 27, and use of chemicals by more than 100. Yet life expectancy increased from 47 years to 77 years. Onset of major disease such as cancer, heart, and respiratory disease has been postponed between eight and eleven years in the past century. Heart disease and cancer rates have been in rapid decline over the last two decades, and total cancer deaths have actually declined the last two years, despite increases in population. Among the very young, infant mortality has declined from 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1913 to just seven per 1,000 today. These improvements haven’t been restricted to the United States. It’s a global phenomenon. Worldwide, life expectancy has more than doubled, from 31 years in 1900 to 67 years today. India’s and China’s infant mortalities exceeded 190 per 1,000 births in the early 1950s; today they are 62 and 26, respectively. In the developing world, the proportion of the population suffering from chronic hunger declined from 37 percent to 17 percent between 1970 and 2001 despite a 83 percent increase in population. Globally average annual incomes in real dollars have tripled since 1950. Consequently, the proportion of the planet's developing-world population living in absolute poverty has halved since 1981, from 40 percent to 20 percent. Child labor in low income countries declined from 30 percent to 18 percent between 1960 and 2003. Equally important, the world is more literate and better educated than ever. People are freer politically, economically, and socially to pursue their well-being as they see fit. More people choose their own rulers, and have freedom of expression. They are more likely to live under rule of law, and less likely to be arbitrarily deprived of life, limb, and property. Social and professional mobility have also never been greater. It’s easier than ever for people across the world to transcend the bonds of caste, place, gender, and other accidents of birth. People today work fewer hours and have more money and better health to enjoy their leisure time than their ancestors. Man’s environmental record is more complex. The early stages of development can indeed cause some environmental deterioration as societies pursue first-order problems affecting human well-being. These include hunger, malnutrition, illiteracy, and lack of education, basic public health services, safe water, sanitation, mobility, and ready sources of energy. Because greater wealth alleviates these problems while providing basic creature comforts, individuals and societies initially focus on economic development, often neglecting other aspects of environmental quality. In time, however, they recognize that environmental deterioration reduces their quality of life. Accordingly, they put more of their recently acquired wealth and human capital into developing and implementing cleaner technologies. This brings about an environmental transition via the twin forces of economic development and technological progress, which begin to provide solutions to environmental problems instead of creating those problems. All of which is why we today find that the richest countries are also the cleanest. And while many developing countries have yet to get past the “green ceiling,” they are nevertheless ahead of where today’s developed countries used to be when they were equally wealthy. The point of transition from &quot;industrial period&quot; to &quot;environmental conscious&quot; continues to fall. For example, the US introduced unleaded gasoline only after its GDP per capita exceeded $16,000. India and China did the same before they reached $3,000 per capita. This progress is a testament to the power of globalization and the transfer of ideas and knowledge (that lead is harmful, for example). It's also testament to the importance of trade in transferring technology from developed to developing countries—in this case, the technology needed to remove lead from gasoline. This hints at the answer to the question of why some parts of the world have been left behind while the rest of the world has thrived. Why have improvements in well-being stalled in areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world? The proximate cause of improvements in well-being is a “cycle of progress” composed of the mutually reinforcing forces of economic development and technological progress. But that cycle itself is propelled by a web of essential institutions, particularly property rights, free markets, and rule of law. Other important institutions would include science- and technology-based problem-solving founded on skepticism and experimentation; receptiveness to new technologies and ideas; and freer trade in goods, services—most importantly in knowledge and ideas. In short, free and open societies prosper. Isolation, intolerance, and hostility to the free exchange of knowledge, technology, people, and goods breed stagnation or regression. <br />

Phase out government involvement in space exploration, and the free market will work to produce whatever there is demand for. After years of declining budgets, public apathy, and failed missions, NASA has gotten a big boost from the Bush Administration's recent promises of extravagant missions to permanently settle the moon and eventually explore Mars. No one knows what it would cost, but a similar idea in 1989 was estimated to cost up to $500 billion. Rather than lavishing money on new missions of dubious value, President Bush should consider a truly radical solution for America's moribund space program: privatize it. There is a contradiction at the heart of the space program: space exploration, as the grandest of man's technological advancements, requires the kind of bold innovation possible only to minds left free to pursue the best of their thinking and judgment. Yet by placing the space program under governmental funding, we necessarily place it at the mercy of governmental whim. The results are written all over the past twenty years of NASA's history: the space program is a political animal, marked by shifting, inconsistent, and ill-defined goals. The space shuttle was built and maintained to please clashing constituencies, not to do a clearly defined job for which there was an economic and technical need. The shuttle was to launch satellites for the Department of Defense and private contractors--which could be done more cheaply by lightweight, disposable rockets. It was to carry scientific experiments--which could be done more efficiently by unmanned vehicles. But one &quot;need&quot; came before all technical issues: NASA's political need for showy manned vehicles. The result, as great a technical achievement as it is, was an over-sized, over-complicated, over-budget, overly dangerous vehicle that does everything poorly and nothing well. Indeed, the space shuttle program was supposed to be phased out years ago, but the search for its replacement has been halted, largely because space contractors enjoy collecting on the overpriced shuttle without the expense and bother of researching cheaper alternatives. A private industry could have fired them--but not so in a government project, with home-district congressmen to lobby on their behalf. There is reason to believe that the political nature of the space program may have even been directly responsible for the Columbia disaster. Fox News reported that NASA chose to stick with non-Freon-based foam insulation on the booster rockets, despite evidence that this type of foam causes up to 11 times as much damage to thermal tiles as the older, Freon-based foam. Although NASA was exempted from the restrictions on Freon use, which environmentalists believe causes ozone depletion, and despite the fact that the amount of Freon released by NASA's rockets would have been trivial, the space agency elected to stick with the politically correct foam. It is impossible to integrate the contradictory. To whatever extent an engineer is forced to base his decisions, not on the realities of science but on the arbitrary, unpredictable, and often impossible demands of a politicized system, he is stymied. Yet this politicizing is an unavoidable consequence of governmental control over scientific research and development. Nor would it be difficult to spur the private exploration of space. Phase out government involvement in space exploration, and the free market will work to produce whatever there is demand for, just as it now does with traditional aircraft, both military and civilian. Develop a system of property rights to any stellar body reached and exploited by an American company, and profit-minded business will have the incentive to make it happen. We often hear that the most ambitious projects can only be undertaken by government, but in fact the opposite is true. The more ambitious a project is, the more it demands to be broken into achievable, profit-making steps--and freed from the unavoidable politicizing of government-controlled science. If space development is to be transformed from an expensive national bauble whose central purpose is to assert national pride to a practical industry with real and direct benefits, it will only be by unleashing the creative force of free and rational minds. Extending man's reach into space is not, as some have claimed, our &quot;destiny.&quot; Standing between us and the stars are enormous technical difficulties, the solution of which will require even more heroic determination than that which tamed the seas and the continents. But first, we must make a fundamental choice: will America continue to hold its best engineering minds captive to politics, or will we set them free?<br />

However, one may still insist, echoing Ernest Hemingway - &quot;I believe in only one thing: liberty.&quot; And it is always well to bear in mind David Hume's observation: &quot;It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once.&quot; Thus, it is unacceptable to say that the invasion of one aspect of freedom is of no importance because there have been invasions of so many other aspects. That road leads to chaos, tyranny, despotism, and the end of all human aspiration. Ask Solzhenitsyn. Ask Milovan Dijas. In sum, if one believed in freedom as a supreme value and the proper ordering principle for any society aiming to maximize spiritual and material welfare, then every invasion of freedom must be emphatically identified and resisted with undying spirit.<br />

A seminal paper by Antweiler, Copeland, and Taylor (2001) provides convincing theoretical and empirical evidence that international trade is good for the environment. They postulate that trade affects environmental quality through three channels: (1) the location of production; (2) the scale of production; and (3) the techniques of production. Their econometric model estimates the independent effects of each of these channels on variation in the concentrations of sulfur dioxide in the air among the countries sampled. Changes in the location of production attributable to international trade are found to be empirically trivial. Freer trade results in an increase in the scale of production, and this effect has a modest negative impact on environmental quality (more output is associated with a little more pollution). A 1 percent increase in the scale of production raises pollution concentrations by 0.25 to 0.5 percent for an average country in the sample. It is the increase in income produced by trade liberalization that is the dominating force, driving concentrations of pollutants down by a significant amount (1.25 to 1.5 percent) via the technique effect (Antweiler, Copeland, and Taylor 2001, 877–78). The critical explanatory factor is that wealthier countries value environmental amenities more highly and enhance their production by employing environmentally friendly technologies. <br />

That's right: Moscow can actually raise the number of its launch/delivery platforms under new START. In other words, the &quot;reduction&quot; in START applies mostly to us . . .   * US conventional warheads on ICBMs are counted toward the treaty's nuclear-warhead limit. This would strangle Prompt Global Strike -- a new ICBM armed with a non-nuclear payload that could be used globally on short notice.      That sort of quick, reach-out-and-touch-you capability would sure be nice if you knew where Osama bin Laden was going to be in an hour but didn't have any forces nearby.  The same is true for other quick-turnaround military scenarios that don't require nukes, such as taking out a WMD-armed ballistic missile ready for launch or vaporizing some counterspace weapons before they strike your satellites. <br />

Development of responsive space may in turn enable new concepts. We could use a highly responsive and inexpensive space-launch capability to precisely deliver conventional ordnance anywhere in the world (a Prompt Global Strike system). Low-cost spacecraft could enable space systems to provide direct support to the operational and tactical levels of warfare, as envisioned by the Air Force's concept document on joint war-fighting space. (16) Development of quick-response spacecraft capable of augmenting existing capabilities might allow transition to an expeditionary space forces concept whereby we deploy the full system capability only when needed. Counterspace missions will benefit from improvements to small spacecraft and responsive-launch technologies associated with ORS. Ultimately, technologies that improve the responsiveness of new missions and small spacecraft will transform the way we perform traditional space missions.<br />

PGS kills non-prolif – turns Taiwan <br />
<br />
Davis 2006 - former executive director of the British American Security Information Council [Ian Davis, Ph.D., independent human security and arms control consultant, , and Robin Dodd, researcher at BASIC, June 2006 [BASIC Paper No. 51, US ‘Prompt Global Strike’ Capability: A New Destabilising Sub-State Deterrent in the Making? www.basicint.org/pubs/Papers/BP51.pdf, BBQ]<br />
<br />
The PGS capability also raises serious non-proliferation issues. First, it is likely to lead to a new arms race in ballistic missiles and countermeasures as other countries seek to match the US system and/or seek to protect their sovereignty by building weapon systems to counter US capabilities. It seems likely, for example, that other nuclear powers, such as China and Russia, would embark on similar SLBM and ICBM conversion projects. This could in turn ratchet up the potential for major armed conflict in areas, such as the Taiwan Straits, where tensions already run high. Second, PGS clearly undermines ballistic missile non-proliferation efforts, such as the 2002 Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation, which calls for greater restraint in developing, testing, using, and spreading ballistic missiles.22 At the signing of the Code, John Bolton, then US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, affirmed US support for it, but also highlighted a number of qualifying factors and reservations. One such reservation concerning pre-launch notifications was that the United States ‘reserves the right in circumstances of war to launch ballistic missile and space-launch vehicles without prior notification’.23 If the US administration is also asserting its ‘right’ to pre-emptive launch of a PGS capability the Code is as good as dead and buried. Third, it will lower the threshold of use for such weapons. And as Steve Andreason, a former US Nation Security Council staffer has pointed out: “Long-range ballistic missiles have never been used in combat in 50 years”. But once the United States starts indicating that it views these missiles as no different than any other weapon, “other nations will adopt the same logic”, he said.24 4 <br />

The main argument for US weaponization of space turns on the inherent vulnerability of space assets and the fundamental need for them to ensure national security and prevent another Pearl Harbor. Space-based weapons and ASAT systems seem to reduce vulnerability either through active defense or deterrence (though that assertion becomes questionable if one takes into account the likely weapons race that would result). They do nothing, however, to address the dependence of military forces upon such systems and create a requirement for a permanent “global fortress” in space. But recently, near-space technologies such as high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles have shown potential for reducing military dependence upon space-based assets by performing command and control, communication, and ISR missions similar to those conducted by satellites.42 Sensible policy making requires debating the implications of trying to directly defend space assets versus developing alternative military capabilities that would reduce our military reliance upon space and thus diminish the attractiveness of space assets as targets for our adversaries. Though long-term investments, both space-based defenses and near-space vehicles create very different potentials for US space policy. Uncontested control of the high ground of space seems tempting, especially for a superpower. It is unrealistic to base US policy on this school of thought, however, due to the ability of other spacefaring states to counter US interests by developing their own space weapons and beginning a new arms race—or simply bypassing deployed defenses. 43 Though stable, current US space policy cannot last without a strong diplomatic structure. The rise of another nation to challenge the United States in space will surely alter the status quo in a manner unacceptable to us. Bruce DeBlois articulates a better choice: “The decision to weaponize space does not lie within the military (seeking short-term military advantage in support of national security) but at the higher level of national policy (seeking long-term national security, economic well-being, and world­wide legitimacy of US constitutional values).”44 This view uses the current US ability to lead negotiations from a position of authority and power to ensure the creation of rules of the road and, eventually, treaties that will protect US space interests in the future. Combined with existing passive defenses and the development of near-space defenses for addressing security vulnerabilities and requirements, a “space sanctuary” provides economic, political, and even security advantages.<br />

MacDonald 07, Fraser MacDonald, Professor of Anthropology, Geography, and Environmental Studies at Melbourne University in Australia, “Anti-Astropolitik – outer space and the orbit of geography,” Progress in Human Geography, 2007, Pages 592-615. <br />
<br />
Two things should now be clear. First, outer space is no longer remote from our everyday lives; it is already profoundly implicated in the ordinary workings of economy and society. Second, the import of space to civilian, commercial and, in particular, military objectives, means there is a great deal at stake in terms of the access to and control over Earth’s orbit. One cannot overstate this last point. The next few years may prove decisive in terms of establishing a regime of space control that will have profound implications for terrestrial geopolitics. It is in this context that I want to briefly introduce the emerging field of astropolitics, defined as ‘the study of the relationship between outer space terrain and technology and the development of political and military policy and strategy’ (Dolman, 2002: 15). It is, in both theory and practice, a geopolitics of outer space. Everett Dolman is one of the pioneers of the ﬁeld. An ex-CIA intelligence analyst who teaches at the US Air Force’s School of Advanced Airpower Fraser MacDonald: Anti-Astropolitik outer space and the orbit of geography 607 Studies , he publishes in journals that are perhaps unfamiliar to critical geographers, like the modestly titled Small Wars and Insurgencies. As what follows is uniformly critical of Dolman’s work, I should say that his Astropolitik: classical geopolitics in the space age (Dolman, 2002) is unquestionably a signiﬁcant book: it has deﬁned a now vibrant field of research and debate. Astropolitik draws together a vast literature on space exploration and space policy, and presents a lucid and accessible introduction to thinking strategically about space. (In the previous section I drew heavily on Dolman’s description of the astropolitical environment.) My critique is not founded on scientiﬁc or technical grounds but on Dolman’s construction of a formal geopolitics designed to advance and legitimate the unilateral military conquest of space by the United States. While Dolman has many admirers among neoconservative colleagues in Washington think-tanks, critical engagements (eg, Moore, 2003; Caracciolo, 2004) have been relatively thin on the ground. Dolman’s work is interesting for our purposes here precisely because he draw’s on geography’s back catalogue of strategic thinkers, most prominently Halford Mackinder, whose ideas gained particular prominence in America in the wake of the Russian Sputnik (Hooson, 2004: 377). But Dolman is not just refashioning classical geopolitics in the new garb of ‘astropolitics’; he goes further and proposes an ‘Astropolitik ’ – ‘ a simple but effective blueprint for space control’ (p. 9) – modelled on Karl Hausofer’s Geopolitik as much as Realpolitik. Showing some discomfort with the impeccably fascist pedigree of this theory, Dolman cautions against the ‘misuse’ of Astropolitik and argues that the term ‘is chosen as a constant reminder of that past, and as a grim warning for the future’ (Dolman, 2002: 3). At the same time, however, his book is basically a manual for achieving space dominance. Projecting Mackinder’s famous thesis on the geographical pivot of history (Mackinder, 1904) onto outer space, Dolman argues that: ‘who controls the Lower Earth Orbit controls near-Earth space. Who controls near-Earth space dominates Terra [Earth]. Who dominates Terra determines the destiny of humankind.’ Dolman sees the quest for space as already having followed classically Mackinderian principles (Dolman, 2002: 87). Like Mackinder before him, Dolman is writing in the service of his empire. ‘Astropolitik like Realpolitik’ he writes, ‘is hardnosed and pragmatic, it is not pretty or uplifting or a joyous sermon for the masses. But neither is it evil. Its benevolence or malevolence become apparent only as it is applied, and by whom’ (Dolman, 2002: 4). Further inspiration is drawn from Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose classic volume The inﬂuence of seapower upon history, has been widely cited by space strategists (Mahan, 1890; Gray, 1996; see also Russell, 2006). Mahan’s discussion of the strategic value of coasts, harbours, well-worn sea paths and chokepoints has its parallel in outer space (see France, 2000). The implication of Mahan’s work, Dolman concludes, is that ‘the United States must be ready and prepared, in Mahanian scrutiny, to commit to the defense and maintenance of these assets, or relinquish them to a state willing and able to do so’ (Dolman, 2002: 37). The primary problem for those advancing Astropolitik is that space is not a lawless frontier. In fact the legal character of space has long been enshrined in the principles of the OST and this has, to some extent, prevented it from being subject to unbridled interstate competition. ‘While it is morally desirable to explore space in common with all peoples’, writes Dolman without conviction, ‘even the thought of doing so makes weary those who have the means’ (Dolman, 2002: 135). Thus, the veneer of transcendent humanism with regard to space gives way to brazen self-interest. Accordingly, Dolman describes the res communist consensus 7 of the OST as ‘a tragedy’ that has removed any legal incentive for the exploitation of space (p. 137). Only a res nullius 8 legal order could construct space as ‘proper objects for which states may compete’ (p. 138). Under the paradigm of res nullius and Astropolitik, the moon and 608 Progress in Human Geography 31(5) other celestial bodies would become potential new territory for states. Here Dolman again parallels Karl Hausofer’s Geopolitik. Just as Hausofer desired a break from the Versailles Treaty (Ó Tuathail, 1996: 45), Dolman wants to see the USA withdraw from the OST, making full speed ahead for the moon (see also Hickman and Dolman, 2002). Non-spacefaring developing countries need not worry about losing out, says Dolman, as they ‘would own no less of the Moon than they do now’ (2002: 140). To his credit, Dolman does give some attention to the divisive social consequences of this concentrated power. Drawing on earlier currents of environmental determinism and on the terrestrial model of Antarctic exploration, he ponders the characteristics of those who will be ﬁrst to colonize space. They will be ‘highly educated, rigorously trained and psychologically screened for mental toughness and decision-making skills, and very physically ﬁ t’; ‘the best and brightest of our pilots, technicians and scientists’; ‘rational, given to scientific analysis and explanation, and obsessed with their professions’ (p. 26). In other words, ‘they are a superior subset of the larger group from which they spring’ (p. 27). As if this picture is not vivid enough, Dolman goes on to say that colonizers of space ‘will be the most capably endowed (or at least the most ruthlessly suitable, as the populating of America and Australia … so aptly illustrate[s])’ (p. 27; my emphasis). ‘Duty and sacriﬁce will be the highest moral ideals’ (p. 27). Society, he continues, must be prepared ‘to make heroes’ of those who undertake the risk of exploration (p. 146). At the same time, ‘the astropolitical society must be prepared to forego expenditures on social programs … to channel funds into the national space program. It must be embued with the national spirit’ (p. 146). Dolman slips from presenting what would be merely a ‘logical’ outworking of Astropolitik to advocating that the United States adopt it as their space strategy. Along the way, he acknowledges the full anti-democratic potential of such concentrated power, detaching the state from its citizenry: the United States can adopt any policy it wishes and the attitudes and reactions of the domestic public and of other states can do little to challenge it. So powerful is the United States that should it accept the harsh Realpolitik doctrine in space that the military services appear to be proposing, and given a proper explanation for employing it, there may in fact be little if any opposition to a fait accompli of total US domination in space. (Dolman, 2002: 156) Although Dolman claims that ‘no attempt will be made to create a convincing argument that the United States has a right to domination in space’, in almost the next sentence he goes on to argue ‘that, in this case, might does make right’, ‘the persuasiveness of the case’ being ‘based on the self-interest of the state and stability of the system’ (2002: 156; my emphasis). Truly, this is Astropolitik: a veneration of the ineluctable logic of power and the permanent rightness of those who wield it. If it sounds chillingly familiar, Dolman hopes to reassure us with his belief that ‘the US form of liberal democracy … is admirable and socially encompassing’ (p. 156) and it is ‘the most benign state that has ever attempted hegemony over the greater part of the world’ (p. 158). His sunny view that the United States is ‘willing to extend legal and political equality to all’ sits awkwardly with the current suspension of the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay as well as in various other ‘spaces of exception’ (see Gregory, 2004; Agamben, 2005). <br />

Conclusion: (bare) life under empire of the future In his Astropolitik Dolman calls upon U.S. defense policy-makers to weaponize orbital space so as to enhance U.S. hegemony over the planet. He does not address the astropolitical issues we have discussed here about what impact a space-based hegemony would have on the structure of the international system. Dolman, however, is confident that America would be responsible in using this awesome power to promote democracy and global capitalism. Setting aside the very contentious issues of whether or not America should be involved in &quot;promoting&quot; democracy and capitalism and whether or not current U.S. hegemony has been beneficial for the Earth's population, the moral and political implications of a space-based empire are not nearly as clear-cut as Dolman makes them out to be. One of the fundamental principles of classical geopolitics was that sea-based empires (such as Athens, Britain, and America) tended to be more democratic than land-based empires (such as Sparta, China, and Rome). The reason for this is that sea-based empires needed to disperse their forces away from the imperial center to exert control, whereas land-based empires exercised power through occupation. Military occupations made it increasingly likely that the army would seize power whenever it came into conflict with the government. Classical geopolitical theorist Otto Hintze argued that land powers tended toward dictatorships (Hintze 1975; see also Deudney 2007). Dolman builds upon these classical geopolitical insights by arguing that because space-based empires would not be able to occupy states, military coups would be less likely and democracy would be more likely (Dolman 2002a: 29). There is, however, a significant difference between space power and sea power. While neither is capable of occupying territory on its own, space power is capable of controlling territory from above through surveillance and precise projection of force control without occupation. While space power may not result in the dictatorships normally associated with land power, it would be a useful tool is establishing a disciplinary society over all the Earth. A second obstacle to the benevolent space-based empire that Dolman imagines is the lack of counterbalancing powers. Under the two other modes of protection/security we have considered here -the real-statist and the federal-republican there are checks that prevent even the most powerful scates in the system from dominating all the other units. In real-statism, the sovereignty of states means that any potential hegemon would have to pay a significant cost in blood and treasure to conquer other states. While this cost may not be enough to dissuade a superpower from conquering one or two states, the cumulative cost of conquest and occupation makes total domination over the Earth unlikely. In the federal-republican model, the collective security regime of the entire system should act as a sufficient deterrent to prevent one state from dominating the others. Conversely, in a space-based empire the entire world is placed under direct surveillance from above. There is no point on Earth where the imperial center cannot project force on very short notice. So long as the space-based empire can deny access to space to rival powers through missile defense and anti-satellite technologies, there is no possibility that other states can directly counteract this force. As such, the space-based empire erases all boundaries and places the Earth under its control. While the possibility to resist such an empire will exist, the dynamics of resistance will be considerably altered. Traditional insurgencies rely on physical occupation of territory by the conquering forces to provide targets of opportunity to the resistance. Because space weapons would orbit several hundred to several thousands of miles above the Earth, they would not be vulnerable to attack by anything except weapons systems possessed by the most advanced space powers, such as ballistic missiles and advanced laser systems. Even such counter-measures, however, would only raise the financial cost of space-based empire, not the COSt in human lives that insurgencies rely upon to diminish domestic support ti)f imperial occupations. Consequently a space-based empire would be freer to dominate the Earth from above than a traditional land-power occupation would be. Without obvious counterpowers or effective means of resistance, the space-based empire would be able to exercise complete bio-political control over the entire planet, turning all of Earth's inhabitants into &quot;bare life,&quot; Under such a political arrangement the likelihood that the imperial center would be a benevolent one, uncorrupted by its total domination of the Earth, is very slim indeed.<br />

Grondin, 06 David Grondin Assistant Professor, School of Political Studies, University of Ottawa (as of July 2006)   Paper presented at the ISA Convention, San Diego  March 25, 2006  Panel “Reading Outer Space I:  The International Politics of Outer Space - Approaches and Themes” THE (POWER) POLITICS OF SPACE:  THE US ASTROPOLITICAL DISCOURSE OF GLOBAL DOMINANCE  IN THE WAR ON TERROR<br />
<br />
Indeed, we have no way of knowing how other state leaders and non-state agents will react to US spatial policy and to a path of weaponization. The security dilemma or a new global arms race in space remain social constructions and are not automatic responses to a course of action taken by the US state. Will it be like Roger Handberg fears: that the “[w]eaponization of space is the signal for the next arms race, one that may start slow but inevitably will speed up as other states reject the US claim to permanent dominance?” (Handberg 2004: 88) Indeed, Handberg makes lots of sense to me when he asserts that a healthy skepticism must be exercised when drastic changes in existing policy positions are considered, especially policies which have not yet failed. Too often, in American defense debates, technology trumps ‘mere politics’ with often-unanticipated consequences. The security dilemma is not just an obscure academic concept but one that reflects real possibilities in terms of outcomes. […] There is an irony in that the analyses assume, especially since the advent of the George W. Bush administration, that such military space activities, including weaponization, will be approved. Approval may come but resources may not, given the administration’s penchant for tax cuts. Sustaining a level of resource commitment necessary to maintain the force levels assumed here is questionable in the absence of an explicit and very visible threat (Handberg 2004: 88). Or will it rather be like the space warriors expect, Dolman and Lambakis especially, that there is an opportunity to be grasped by the US that will make other actors of the global arena accept an American dominance in space? In my mind, such view is to be resisted at all costs. In fact, one must be aware that behind all the rhetoric for space weaponization and the “threat game”, other power considerations still pull much weight – and the spectre of a Cold War military-industrial complex is still very much alive. As Lambakis bluntly puts it: “Although it still must guard against the transfer of critical military technologies, capitalism ought to be set loose to advance the development of satellite technologies and services (including imagery services), which would allow US industry to play its strength – technological innovation and application – which in turn would provide the United States significant technologies advantages in the years ahead” (Lambakis 2001: 281; original emphasis). Freedom of Space, Space control, and the Technological As space is conceived as a common medium, the principle of the freedom of space lasts as long as there is no will to take a step further – which is what space warriors recommend. As they acknowledge, many reasons may motivate a state to develop “capabilities to control, if not dominate or claim ownership over, space orbits” (Lambakis 2001: 86; original emphasis). This line of argument is usually linked to technological capacities. By asserting that other countries operate in Space, that conflicts are “natural” between humans – which brings the obvious “so why would it be different in Space” – technologies of power take the lead and one is left with devising what space-control strategy will be best and what one wants “to control, for how long, and for what purposes?/ (Lambakis 2001: 281). And in a context where one portrays the situation as one where US aerospace industry is held back by the rest of the world only for fear of potential not guaranteed conflicts that will evolve into Space warfighting because of a renewed arms race (Lambakis 2001: 282), the claim to let technology drive the policy and the political is not disinterested – albeit ill-advised – and definitely not a sure bet. For space warriors such as Dolmnan and Lambakis, space weaponization then appears not to be all related to the security issue but also very much to the maintenance of a strong defense and aerospace industry. The technological takes over as the political is eclipsed by the military professionals. In effect, for space warriors, because of national security, “if a determination is made that space weapons would improve national security, further analysis would be required to map out a path to take to introduce these tools in the arsenal and military strategy and a time line from which to plan” (Lambakis 2001: 282). Contrary to US astropolitical analysts, I find myself at fault with the logic of national security and securitization of space that drives US governmentality, especially with regard to Outer Space. I do not believe that arms control is given a fair trial by its opponents or even by some of its main defenders in US astropolitical discourse. For me, the security game is what seems so scary; and if we consider the one assumption of an astropolitical argument such as that of Lambakis that because of the 9/11 context, “one thing is certain – we will not be able to bludgeon our enemies into cooperation. For those times, the United States needs to have in place more assertive means and doctrines to counter hostiles activities in space” (Lambakis 2001: 282; my emphasis). When people are certain and need enemies to develop one strategy, then maybe some questions have not been raised. There are “unknowns” and we cannot be sure of how the events will unfold if the US goes further along a path to space weaponization. In any case, it gets even more problematic when security is trumped with technology for there is no way – so it seems – to argue against the desire of global (read absolute) security, especially when it comes from the strongest of power. You are brought back to the realities of the global homeland security state. One is doomed to either accept the logic of terror – that inexorably goes with the logic of global security – or reject it. I choose the latter. CONCLUSION: THE SECURITIZATION AND AMERICANIZATION OF SPACE This paper allowed me to address how the frontiers of the US are redefined by the War on Terror as it relates to the US strategic thinking on Outer Space. What conditions of possibility does 9/11 bring for US astropolitical discourse that were not already there? This inquiry leads me directly to reconsider the securitization and reterritorialization project of the “last frontier”, that is the attempt to secure Outer Space as an American space. It is important to rethink the push for space weaponization and its politics in light of the context of the US Global War on Terror (GWOT), which produced a new security thinking towards the “homeland” – a homeland strategy of security, a military doctrine of pre- emption/prevention and a reterritorialization of American frontiers and global power. Outer Space concerns, apparently, “the outer frontiers of national security policy, where technology and grand strategy meet” (Krepon 2003). Within the context of the War on Terror, where US strategic discourse sees a global terrorist threat as being ever possible, it seems that there can be no exception for Space. It is even done preventively as a secured space while Others do not exist yet in Space (in fact, they do, with the International Space Station; but that’s another story…). In this spatial inscription of securitization of the American identity in Space, the frontiers of the homeland are made global and are secured through a representation of dangers (with the exception of debris in Space which they do not categorize as “dangers”). This familiar approach to territory and space is inscribed in the identity politics of the US, a moral practice based on spatial exclusion of Others deemed threatening to secure the American Self (Campbell 1998 [1992]; Shapiro 1999). By focusing on the Rumsfeld 2001 Space Commission for the Management of Space in the national security strategy, one sees the application of the same reading that would later come with the War on Terror. To that effect, a terrorist group or rogue state might try to hinder US spatial assets or those of its allies on which the US depends militarily and economically. In its 2004 National Military Stragegy, the US thus reaffirmed with force its will to constitute a global information grid and achieve a full spectrum-dominance in military matters. The US therefore wants to prevent any threat in Outer Space and protect its spatial activities and that of its allies. Informed by the events of 9/11, space warriors, such as Dolman or Lambakis, criticize opponents of a US policy for space weaponization as being stuck in a Cold War mindset. They believe a strategy of pre-emption and a resolve not to wait for the next “Pearl Harbor”, whether in space, on Earth or in the cyberspace is necessary and that the US must really be prepared to defend its (global) homeland: “How else can one explain [a] statement [such as] ‘as long as we remain vulnerable and so accessible to our adversaries, their incentives to attack us in space are likely to remain quite low’? In the post-September 11 world, events have underscored that weakness entices those who would do us harms and vulnerability provokes those who hate us. We need fresh thinking” (Lambakis 2003: 118). Space was seen as a sanctuary during the Cold War. But because of the context of the War on Terror, the US now seems to be ready to go against the second Article of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 that stipulates that “Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, orby any other means”, the treaty which set out the principle that Space is to be used for “the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind” (Article 1). In effect, since 2001, the US wished to be the one responsible for setting new rules in Outer Space and for creating the conditions of its military dominance of Space. For instance, the merger of the US Space Command with the Strategic Command in January 2004 stems from this logic that wishes Space operations to be integrated in all domains of US military power. Because the US still possesses control over much of the information gathering in Space, it is interested in securitizing and Americanizing the “last frontier”, especially in the context of the War on Terror. As it stands, the US neoliberal geopolitics discourse of the Bush Administration on Space power still leads to Space weaponization. US sovereignty is placed as higher than any other forms of rule and the US prepares itself militarily, just in case Outer Space would turn into a battlefield. In Donald Rumsfeld’s words: “Our goal is not to bring war into space, but rather to defend against those who would” (Rumsfeld, quoted in Waldrop 2005 [2002]: 39). This participates in the discourse of a global security state that sees Outer Space as the most “global” of space. “Insofar as the weaponization of space represents the ‘cutting edge’ and highest ambitions of military primacy, it also represents the height of this folly” (Huntley 2005: 83). If we consider that political rhetoric creates political reality that may serve as bases for decisions, it appears fundamental to assess how the US wishes to securitize Outer Space with its will to achieve full-spectrum dominance in all battlespaces, as stated in the 2004 and 1997 National Military Strategies. Deeply anchored in the War on Terror cartography, where 9/11 serves as the ultimate justification since “one must prepare militarily for the worst since the worst has happened” (or so it goes), the US places itself in a state of insecurity by saying that even if no one may inflict them casualty in Space, nothing can guarantee that it will not happen in the future. This is why they prefer to try this likelihood and securitize Outer Space as part of the homeland security strategy. The paradox of the securitization and Americanization of Outer Space is that it could lead to its very opposite by allowing space weaponization to still be possible, if not inevitable.<br />

<br />
Ashley Tellis weaves a compelling argument of China’s counterspace strategy and its implications for space arms control. His logic rests on two principle elements. ‘China’s pursuit of counterspace capabilities … is not driven fundamentally by a desire to protest American space policies … but is part of a considered strategy designed to counter the overall military capability of the United States.’ This underpins Tellis’s conclusion that ‘Washington should not invest time, energy and resources in attempting to negotiate space-control arrangements ... Such regimes are destined to be stillborn because the larger strategic logic conspires against them.’ In other words, the pursuit of a space arms-control regime is futile, even harmful to US interests, because China’s strategy to challenge American space dominance is unyielding to anything the United States can do. Both pillars of Tellis’s rationale are problematic. A comprehensive assessment of China’s strategic aims does not confirm such an inflexible posture. Rather, his assumptions about China’s strategy are far-reaching and worst- case scenarios, most of which are speculative and contradict considerable evidence. The United States, as he repeatedly points out, is an important driver of China’s strategic posture. As such, there are a number of measures the United States can indeed explore to positively alter the security dilemma in space. It is important to understand the core assumption underpinning all of Tellis’s analysis, which is related to but goes beyond the issue of space. That is, his overarching judgment that China is seeking to construct a ‘Sinocentric order in Asia and perhaps globally’. And since the ‘United States, and its superior military power, remains the biggest objective constraint on China’s ability to secure its own political interests’, China will not only challenge the United States in immediate concerns over Taiwan, but will rival US hegemony, particularly in military terms. How does Tellis know Beijing is committed to such an expansive military strategy or will challenge US military dominance? The evidence is inconclusive at best. China’s policies do not state such goals, but to avoid the debate over their reliability, let us leave government rhetoric aside. Chinese analysts, on balance, certainly argue against this paradigm and the US scholarly community is divided over the validity of such assumptions. That leaves individual interpretation of China’s strategic calculations; Tellis’s is imbued with a highly realist zero-sum framework. He cites the military component of China’s strategic interests as being ‘preventive’, ‘protective’ and ‘defensive’ in nature. Though these terms are fairly accurate, they only support the claim applied to specifically defined goals, which he concurs are, in the near term, ‘to defeat any US expeditionary force that might be committed in support of [Taiwan]’. From this point, however, he moves to a far more expansive strategy: ‘the capabilities thus obtained are intended to mutate gracefully into servicing other, more ambitious geostrategic aims’. In this way Tellis subtly, though assertively, leaps from ascribing to China a defensive posture to one that seeks to challenge and even rival US military power. The literature is not nearly so definitive. Such theorising of China’s strategic intent is highly speculative. Tellis uses a number of examples of American–Soviet competition to support his thesis that China will inevitably seek to confront US military dominance. Meanwhile, he declines to entertain the notion that China’s incentives and actions vis-à-vis the United States may be shaped by strategic values and interests outside his framework. In fact, China’s strategic considerations toward the United States are influenced and constrained by factors beyond a direct militarily antagonistic relationship. They range from China’s profound domestic development challenges; its precarious geopolitical relations with regional players; and its deep dependence on global commercial and energy markets. China also has a unique set of historical experiences (colonialism, foreign occupation, border wars) as well as the lessons learned from current events, not the least of which is the US quagmire in Iraq. These point to conditions for China and an international environment significantly different than were extant during the Cold War. Even if one assumes that some form of challenge to US hegemony is inevitable, China has a growing kit of tools at its disposal to wield non- military influence. China now has clout in financial, trade and even soft- power terms, all of which could bring to bear considerable economic and political pressure on a potential adversary or strategic competitor. This is not to suggest China would forgo its military options in a conflict with the United States. But it should, at the very least, give pause to consider alterna- tive strategic modalities by China. Tellis doesn’t mention any of these, much less figure them into China’s counterspace strategy. Tellis brings that strategy within his broader framework of China’s goals to challenge and rival the United States. China’s best shot at accomplishing these expansive strategic goals, Tellis writes, is to have a ‘riposte against [America’s] Achilles heel’, its space dominance. Tellis overstates both China’s ability and its incentives to use space in a conflict with the United States. He draws the analogy of Cold War competi- tion between the Soviet Union and the United States: ‘neither side had an incentive to attack the other’s space systems, even though both developed modest instruments for this purpose, because the costs to each individually far outweighed the benefits’. The unstated implication is that China does have the incentive to attack America’s disproportionately vulnerable space assets. He is partly right; the United States is arguably now more vulnerable to asymmetric ASAT weapons that China could employ. But concluding that China has the incentive to act on this advantage removes the ‘battle’ of space out of the context of the larger conflict that such a battle would either be a part of, or would most probably escalate to. It wrongly isolates space from the US capabilities that could be brought to bear on a much inferior China in the dynamic of any military conflict. The United States has overwhelming military superiority over China. Besides vastly outnumbering China’s conventional and nuclear forces, other key elements include the dramatic advantage the United States has accrued in the past decade in precision-strike conventional weapons. These may even be capable of taking out even hardened nuclear silos in certain circumstances, thus comprising a new threat to China’s nuclear deterrence.1 There is also the developing US multi-layered missile defence system with boost-phase components based in space that threaten China’s missile force. Even considering space alone, US capabilities and programmes far exceed those of China: for example micro- or nanosatellites, such as the XSS-10, XSS-11, DART, MiTex, Orbital Express and the new DARPA TICS and F6 programmes. There are also laser weapons: MIRACL, the ABL and its COIL, various solid-state HEL and FEL programmes, and the Starfire adaptive optics range, all of which have powerful ASAT capabilities.2 All this means that even if the United States is currently vulnerable in space, China would have little incentive to attack American space assets because the risk of escalation to generalised conflict – a conflict China would have no chance of winning – is far too great, as Tellis admits. Failing to incorporate this into China’s strategic calculus leads to a narrow reading of what China is capable of, to say nothing of what its intentions may be. China’s own investment and interests in commer- cial and civilian space are also rapidly increasing, serving as a further check on any bellicose use of space. There is, of course, one plausible scenario where China could have incentive to attack US assets in space, despite its military disadvantage: a conflict over Taiwan. Kinetic-energy ASATs or other asymmetric counterspace weapons could very well be used if the United States employed its own space assets in a confrontation over the island. But this would be only in extreme circumstances, an act of desperation or self- preservation, since China understands such a scenario could very well bring down the full force of US military might on China. The possibility of China making this calculation is far from certain, however, since to avoid escalation (possibly to nuclear exchange) or outright failure, China would need to reduce US military might to a level relative to its own (a formidable task even without space assets). Just diminishing US military dominance will not suffice if America remains powerful enough to prevail in a conflict. China may one day have the counterspace capability to achieve this goal, but one ASAT test does not get it there. For a successful kinetic-energy ASAT capability alone, China would have to conduct more tests, to say nothing of the other capabilities that would need to be devel- oped and deployed to effectively disable US space assets. Furthermore, all this assumes that the United States is indeed highly vulnerable in space, an assumption scarcely borne out by current Chinese ASAT capabilities and inherent redundancy of US space assets.3 This more narrowly defined scope for China’s counterspace capabilities fits within its overall strategic parameters and defined goals. And Tellis’s judgement that the potential conflict in space will ‘likely persist whether or not the Taiwan conflict is resolved’, is entirely possible if the United States and China find new strategic terms to compete over, but that outcome is speculative and is an entirely separate issue from China’s rivaling US space dominance writ large. A note on sources is also in order, since Tellis uses only secondary mate- rial to make sweeping assumptions about China’s military and counterspace strategies. The discussion of source material often comes up with the subject of China because of the difficulty in deciphering the vast body of litera- ture, often of questionable reliability and predominantly in Chinese. Tellis remains undaunted, however, and cites secondary Western publications analysing this literature that primarily support his hawkish version of China’s space ambitions while giving scant mention to other more moder- ate positions. A selection of the provocative statements and ambitions on the American side would present a similarly distorted picture of US policy and intentions. A comprehensive reading of the Chinese literature is highly inconclusive with regard to both China’s policies and intentions as well as its programmes and capabilities. All this would matter little if it were not employed to support Tellis’s dim prognosis that space arms control is futile: ‘the threat posed by this Chinese effort cannot be neutralised by arms-control agreements’. His rejection of an arms-control regime for space is assured, yet it rests on speculations and opinions about China’s intentions, none of which have any conclusive backing. Even his language often belies a degree of uncertainty. For example, ‘it should not be surprising that Chinese leaders … have tasked their military forces to develop means to defeat the power-projection capa- bilities of the United States’. Such a development may not be surprising to Tellis, but that is not proof it is true. Tellis is mirror-imaging his own strate- gic logic onto China. In any case, to conjecture about worst-case scenarios is one thing, but it is dangerous to conclude that any hope of extricating ourselves from a deadly space rivalry is pointless. Tellis refuses to entertain any willingness by China to negotiate a space arms-control regime: ‘the implications are devastating for arms-control theorists who believe that Chinese counterspace investments are primarily bargaining chips aimed at creating a peaceful space regime’. First, where is the recent historical precedent to support this claim? China has negotiated a number of wide-ranging arms-control agreements in the past. The Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is the most obvious, though not the only, example. Tellis’s pronouncements might be justified with solid proof, but not even talking to the Chinese and calling their bluff is illogical and unwise. What is sorely missing in Tellis’s paper is ‘the other side’ of the problem, namely that there are initiatives that the United States (and others) can take to seek to calm the Chinese drive for counterspace capabilities. The report repeatedly details how US military posturing is driving China to invest in and plan counterspace technologies, yet it fails to propose what could be changed to stop and reverse those trends. In reality, it will cost the United States very little (with the potential to gain a significant measure of inter- national support and goodwill) to explore the possibilities for space arms control, notwithstanding the difficulties of definitions and verifiability. Tellis also brushes aside with no analysis whatsoever the value and potential effect of ‘rules of the road’ arrangements to limit or regulate space weapons and operations in space, or space-debris mitigation agreements or the confidence-building measures of reaching agreement on banning spe- cific debris-creating ASAT tests. He does recommend talking with the Chinese to better understand their space programme, a wise suggestion if done seriously and comprehensively with a view to long-term cooperation. Beyond that, however, he proposes surprisingly little to alter the security dynamic in space, concluding that the worst case is probably inevitable and the United States should simply counter with military means. Here, Tellis makes no mention of the critically important debate over whether an unrestricted ‘offence–defence arms race’ in space is something that the United States, or any country, can ‘win’. <br />

Although a less likely occurrence than interference with satellite ground stations or communications links, direct interference of satellites by conventional, nuclear, or directed energy weapons is much more difficult to defend against. In this case, the primary source of protection for satellites stems from the difficulties associated with launching an attack of conventional weapons into and through the space environment to specific locations. It is worth noting that, despite recent incidents involving ASATs impacting a country’s own spacecraft, no hostile attacks on an adversary’s satellite have been documented to date. The distinct nature of the space environment itself may provide a certain level of protection for space assets. For example, energy weapons must overcome atmospheric challenges and be effectively targeted at satellites, which orbit at great distances and move at very high speeds. Also, the distances and speeds involved in satellite engagements can be exploited to enhance protection. Satellites in lower-altitude orbits are more difficult to detect with spacebased infrared sensors because of their proximity to the Earth’s atmosphere. The fact that Low Earth Orbit (LEO) can be reached in a matter of minutes, while Geostationary Orbit (GEO) takes about a half-day to reach by completing a Hohmann transfer orbit, illustrates the unique protection of dynamics associated with different orbits.30 Lower orbits are also less predictable because of greater atmospheric effects, such as fluctuations in density in the upper atmosphere, which alter satellite drag. For example, at an altitude of about 800 km, the predictability of orbits is limited to an error of approximately one kilometer one day in advance of the calculation, using readily available models. Higher operational orbits also raise the power demands for terrestrial radars, leaving only optical systems capable of tracking satellites in altitudes beyond 5,000 km. Some military systems are being placed into higher orbits such as Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) or GEO, but orbits are largely dictated by function. Surface finishes and designs optimized for heat dissipation and radar absorption can also reduce the signatures of a satellite and the ability to observe it, further complicating negation targeting efforts, as in the US stealth satellite program Misty (cancelled in 2007).31<br />

3. Turn – Small Satellites undermine space capabilities – power and communication limitations <br />

Small satellites do suffer from some disadvantages. A primary disadvantage is that their smaller size limits their ability to generate power. There is simply less volume in which to place batteries for power storage, and less surface area to employ solar panels for power conversion. This means they are less capable of accommodating design demands such as redundant systems, fine pointing requirements, onboard processing, and multiple payloads. The restrictions on power also limit their communications data rates and subsequently their missions. It is a major reason why small satellites are well suited for simple mission tasking. However, there are singular missions that small satellites cannot currently accomplish as well as larger satellites. Imaging is a mission that is severely hindered by the satellite’s small size. These small satellites have limits to the size of the payloads that can be placed on them. For example, the size of the imaging aperture that can be placed on a small satellite is smaller than what could fit on a larger satellite, and subsequently limits the obtainable resolution. Another aspect that is tied to the satellite’s power limitations is the orbit the satellite is placed in. With minimal capability to generate power, signals transmitted to and from the satellites are limited in their range. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is the primary orbit for small satellites due to this limitation. LEO has its own list of advantages, such as minimal range, and disadvantages, such as shortened lifetimes as compared with higher orbiting middle earth and geostationary/geosynchronous orbits. These advantages and disadvantages inherently belong to the satellites that reside there. As summarized by the Chairman and Director of SSTL, small satellite manufactures balance these advantages and disadvantages following the general principle of the 80/20 rule, 80% of the performance for 20% of the price [4][7]. <br />

4. No solvency – they don’t solve for Cyber Attacks<br />

Are we prepared for GPS-jammed operations? Twenty or 30 years ago, we were primarily worried about anti-satellite weapons as the major threat. Now, we still have to worry about ASAT [anti-satellite] weapons], but we also have to worry about cyberattacks [and] jamming. And we have to worry that these weapons might have proliferated beyond the Soviet Union. So part of the strategy, and the programs that follow from it, is to address exactly those kinds of threats and to ensure that we can continue to operate and leverage our space capabilities to make sure, for example, GPS jamming doesn't disable the great benefits we get militarily from space. Last year at the National Space Symposium, you said our space assets are more vulnerable than ever. Do you feel that there needs to be some sort of cohesive effort to focus on this problem? The first indication of [increased] focus is that we developed this strategy—the first space strategy the department's developed. The second indication is that we've named the secretary of the Air Force as the executive agent for space, and he chairs the Defense Space Council, which pulls together all of our space efforts and establishes a coherent approach across all the agencies and organizations that contribute to space. <br />

<br />
ORS has been defined broadly by the Department of Defense as “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of Joint Force Commanders’ needs . . . while also maintaining the ability to address other users’ needs for improving the responsiveness of space capabilities to meet national security requirements” (Department of Defense, 2007). The purpose of ORS is to reduce the time lag associated with space system acquisition to allow the national space architecture to keep pace with changing missions, environments, and technologies. The fundamental idea is to trade off the reliability and performance achieved by satellites under the “Big Space” paradigm (the currently accepted way of conceptualizing, and operating space systems) for the speed, responsiveness, and customization which may be achieved by architectures that incorporate elements such as small, modular spacecraft (Government Accounting Office, 2006, 2008).<br />

6. Turn – Chinese Militarization – plan makes it impossible to criticize China’s tests and causes massive backlash at US unilateralism<br />
<br />
Milowicki 2008 United States Naval War College [with Freese Strategic Choices: Examining the United States Military Response to the Chinese ASAT Test, Astropolitics, Volume 6, Issue 1 January 2008 JSTOR]<br />
<br />
Current U.S. space and counterspace policy and doctrine makes it difficult for the U.S., particularly the military, to protest very loudly regarding China's test. The U.S. has been developing and has been in possession of ASAT technology for over 45 years. Furthermore, other dual-use “defensive” systems such as the Airborne Laser and National Missile Defense systems can easily be applied to the offensive ASAT task. China and the rest of the world are keenly aware of this. In fact, it is a much easier physics problem to target and destroy a single orbiting satellite in a fixed path than it is to engage a ballistic missile with its many multiple independently targeted reentry vehicle (MIRV) warheads. Also, it is unlikely other countries have forgotten that the most aggressive and spectacular ASAT test in history was executed in the Cold War and involved the detonation of a 1.4 megaton thermonuclear warhead in LEO above the Pacific Ocean. This event, known as Starfish Prime, took place on 9 July 1962. The resulting electromagnetic pulse took out six U.S. and foreign satellites (i.e., about one third of the world's LEO total at the time) and knocked out over 300 streetlights on the island of Oahu in Hawaii while producing an eerie artificial glow in the sky for 20 minutes for the entire world to see.31 If comparing immediate negative impact due to the 10% increase in overall known debris created by the Chinese test, the January 2007 ASAT event can be viewed as relatively minor. It should also be noted that at the time of the Starfish Prime test, the knowledge base regarding potential debris created from ASAT tests was far less than it is now. With the most assets to be negatively impacted by debris, the U.S. has good reason to be attentive now that the issues are known. In the case of the Chinese test, it appears increasing likely that Chinese space debris experts were not consulted prior to the test, and that debris estimates generated by test supporters in the military likely downplayed whatever debris information was provided to politicians. This supports the view that the test was a “chest-thumping” exercise by the PLA and hardliners in China. The U.S. defense establishment's reaction to the ASAT test is guided and constrained by the National Space Policy of 2006 and the military doctrine that proceeds from it. Specifically, under paragraph 2 of the National Space Policy, one of the principles (cited below) clearly gives the military a mandate to react as it currently has to bolster both its defensive and offensive counterspace capabilities. Two underlying principles of the policy that are typically cited as unilateral and jingoistic by critics read as follows:32 The United States considers space capabilities—including the ground and space segments and supporting links—vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so; take those actions necessary to protect its space capabilities; respond to interference; and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests. The United States will oppose the development of new legal regimes or other restrictions that seek to prohibit or limit U.S. access to or use of space. Proposed arms control agreements or restrictions must not impair the rights of the United States to conduct research, development, testing, and operations or other activities in space for U.S. national interests.33 While the principle of preserving its rights, capabilities and freedom of action in space is absolutely reasonable for the U.S. to claim, the language of the principle makes it unclear if other countries are expected to be able to claim similar rights or if they accrue only to the U.S. If the latter, it is not reasonable to expect that other countries will forego the same rights claimed by the U.S. Regarding the second principle, rejecting arms control, this language makes public what has been U.S. government policy since the Space Commission Report first questioned whether space arms control was in the interest of the U.S. Given that the rest of the world regularly votes in support of resolutions toward preventing an arms race in space through the United Nations (UN), with the U.S. standing alone against those resolutions, this principle becomes perceived as another example of the U.S. ignoring the perspectives of other countries in favor of a unilateralist approach—not necessarily an effective approach if the U.S. is trying to get the rest of the world to accept it as a benevolent hegemon in space. Intentionally or not, this bellicose and overtly unilateral section of the document has effectively tied the hands of the U.S. military establishment in diplomatically or politically responding to actions too negatively. Perhaps, in order to provide more options, the policy should be revisited in light of geopolitical realities. With only a few changes, the U.S. could alter its course and establish the U.S. as a constructive player in the international community rather than as a perceived “bad actor” bent on preemptive and hegemonic use of space for its own purposes;34 a perception that possibly prompts or, at a minimum, provides an excuse for bad actions on the part of other countries. Theresa Hitchens' observation in her Congressional Testimony of 23 May 2007 captures the situation. She states, “if nothing else, U.S. declaratory policy gives Beijing an excuse to pursue a similar course. China's actions—despite its public dedication to the non-weaponization of space—make it abundantly clear that U.S. space dominance strategy will not go unchallenged.”35<br />

1. No Solvency – ORS depends on Lower Launch costs, but fails to bring those costs down<br />

Brown, 2006 – Lt Col, USAFR, [PhD liquid-rocket-engine system engineer at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and a researcher at the College of Aerospace Doctrine (6/1/06, Kendall K., Air &amp; Space Power Journal, “Is Operationally Responsive Space the Future of Access to Space for the US Air Force?,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11024:http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj06/sum06/brown.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj06/sum06/brown.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj06/sum06/brown.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11024 -->, Sawyer)<br />
<br />
Built upon that history, the AFRL developed a set of requirements for its space operational vehicle (SOV) concept. These requirements sought to drive technology-development projects—that is, they were so aggressive that only advanced technologies or unproven system concepts could possibly satisfy them. The mission-needs statement, approved for ORS in 2001 by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, has served as the basis for many subsequent launch-vehicle and propulsion-system technology projects. The analysis of alternatives study used requirements derived from this statement, specifying the reduction of launch-vehicle call-up times from months to days and of final preparation and launch from days to hours. The requirements also mention the ability to sustain multiple sorties per day during contingency operations, which might necessitate turnaround of the vehicle for a subsequent mission within hours of landing. From this history of the responsive launch vehicle—whether it’s called a military space plane, an SOV, or an ORS launch vehicle—one sees that the concept has emerged from the expansion of space capabilities through a technology-push program and that it has had inadequate capability-pull from the war-fighter community. Much of the support for a responsive launch concept depends upon obtaining access to space at lower costs. Claims of the low-cost-access-to-space companies in the 1990s, continuing with the more recent and better funded entrepreneurial companies, are accepted almost religiously. These businesses are deceiving themselves and their supporters. Building the first test vehicle might prove relatively straightforward, but seeing such a system through production and operation will not. Such companies can operate inexpensively in the early phases of development because they have no past liability; no large, aging infrastructure to maintain and operate; no large pension and retiree health insurance funds to maintain; and no large bureaucracies to do the little things that have to be done. As a program matures, as such a system must, one will find no substantial cost difference between a system from one of the United States’ traditional launch-vehicle companies and a system from one of the new companies. The goals of low-cost responsive launch are not new. An essay on an online air-and-space-news Web site notes that the goals of the Pegasus and Taurus launch vehicles, developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation, differed little from those of ORS launch.13 In fact, an Atlas F ICBM had more mass capability and better responsiveness than the small launch vehicles under development in DARPA’s FALCON program today. Given the likenesses between the early Atlas vehicles and the SpaceX launch vehicles, one should not be surprised by their similar responsiveness.14<br />

Some say that the awarding of defense contracts should not be about U.S. jobs. But Embraer is making it just that by touting the number of assembly jobs that will be created in Jacksonville, Fla. So if Embraer is making the awarding of a defense contract about U.S. jobs in Florida, so should Hawker Beechcraft make it about the retention of 1,400 high-paying, skilled jobs in the United States that support the AT-6 program today. Hawker Beechcraft currently employs 6,300 people in Kansas. Today Kansas has 38,432 aerospace jobs working at 80 establishments. Workers earn, on average, $62,063 annually. Embraer promises a net addition of 50 jobs in Florida (assembly jobs) with average annual wages of $50,000. Today Florida has 28,506 aerospace jobs working at 105 establishments. Workers earn, on average, $56,226 annually. But Embraer is promising only assembly jobs as part of its bid. To even threaten to imperil one of the United States’ most important aerospace clusters at this point in the nation’s economic recovery would be a grave mistake. The Kansas aerospace cluster has suffered enough as the recession proved most difficult. The sale of business aircraft was adversely affected. It is well-known that the U.S. leadership in manufacturing has been on the decline for decades. According to a research report by U.S.-based consultancy IHS Global Insight, in 2010 China ended the United States’ 110-year-long reign as the world’s top manufacturing nation. China last year accounted for 19.8 percent of the world’s manufacturing output while the U.S. accounted for 19.4 percent, <br />

With military spending stagnant and the Obama administration looking at billions of dollars in cuts, the U.S. defense industry faces belt-tightening and consolidation over the next few years as companies begin to feel the pain, analysts say. Core performance among the top 105 defense contractors was flat for the second year in a row in 2010, Deloitte consulting firm reported last week, and new business booked by the companies was not enough to replace the revenue collected from completed contracts, suggesting another stagnant year in 2011. &quot;That's an indicator of the status of the industry, which is treading water at this point,&quot; said Tom Captain, Deloitte's vice chairman for aerospace and defense. Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute think tank, said the industry was fairly healthy following a decade of growth in U.S. defense budgets. But program cuts two years ago -- like the termination of the Air Force's F-22 fighter and the Navy's future cruiser -- were beginning to affect the bottom lines of some firms, he said. &quot;Most of the cuts that are being made to work forces are pre-emptive rather than a reaction to major budget reductions,&quot; Thompson said. &quot;However, the industry senses that tough times have begun and expects ... conditions to progressively deteriorate for some time to come.&quot; Defense contractors may begin to feel the bite in 2012. President Barack Obama is asking for $689 billion in defense spending for the 2012 fiscal year, about $35 billion less than 2011 -- the first significant reduction in years. Congress may cut the military budget back even more as lawmakers wrestle with record budget deficits. &quot;We are now at the point where 2012 is becoming the year of defense funding contraction,&quot; said analyst Jim McAleese, of McAleese &amp; Associates.<br />

Coming at the problem from the same direction as Romney, the Senate this week passed a bill to impose higher taxes on imports on China if the government fails to allow the yuan to rise in value faster. The bill is unlikely to pass the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders oppose it. And, as Huntsman noted, the Chinese could easily retaliate with penalties against American goods aided by the Federal Reserve's pumping of hundreds of billions of dollars into the U.S. economy. The Obama and Bush administrations have approached China more carefully, targeting with higher import taxes those Chinese goods they felt were selling at artificially low prices while negotiating with Beijing for a fairer currency exchange rate. Despite limited success, they've avoided a blanket punishment of all Chinese goods and any breakdown in relations that would surely make it harder for American products to reach China's booming internal market.<br />

Overall, pushing forward on SBSP &quot;is a complex problem and one that lends itself to a wide variety of competing solutions,&quot; said John Mankins, President of Artemis Innovation Management Solutions, LLC, in Ashburn, Virginia. &quot;There’s a whole range of science and technology challenges to be pursued. New knowledge and new systems concepts are needed in order to enable space based solar power. But there does not appear, at least at present, that there are any fundamental physical barriers,&quot; Mankins explained. Peter Teets, Distinguished Chair of the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Studies, said that SBSP must be economically viable with those economics probably not there today. &quot;But if we can find a way with continued technology development ? and smart moves in terms of development cycles to bring clean energy from space to the Earth, it’s a home run kind of situation,&quot; he told attendees of the meeting. &quot;It’s a noble effort,&quot; Teets told Space News. There remain uncertainties in SBSP, including closure on a business case for the idea, he added. &quot;I think the Air Force has a legitimate stake in starting it. But the scale of this project is going to be enormous. This could create a new agency ? Who knows? It’s going to take the President and a lot of political will to go forward with this,&quot; Teets said. <br />

Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Charles Schumer also have signaled plans to push for a vote on legislation to pressure China to revalue its currency in conjunction with the free trade pacts. That would inflame relations with Beijing and possibly trigger tit-for-tat trade retaliation if Obama does not expend political capital to block it. The early start of the 2012 U.S. election campaigns, however, may dampen Obama's appetite to lead aggressively on trade. But &quot;if the administration spends the effort and actually finishes the job (the trade deals) with Congress, that will send a very positive signal,&quot; said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.<br />

<br />
There are two common options in government policies to curb trade imbalances: adjusting the exchange rate or turning to protectionism. The past two years have seen China falling victim to U.S. protectionist measures adopted in the wake of the global financial crisis. The motives for the mounting pressure on China over the yuan have been widely questioned, even in the United States. As the U.S. mid-term elections approach, the political clamoring will expectedly turn increasingly shrill. Many wonder if the lawmakers are really speaking against China for the benefit of Americans or only out of their selfish desire to please their constituents and gain more votes ahead of the coming elections. A common view is that, to some extent, the lawmakers are looking to improve their public image in an effort to pocket more political capital. On Tuesday, 36 U.S. farm and business groups, including the U.S.-China Business Council, the American Soybean Association and the American Meat Institute, urged the Congress not to pass any legislation threatening China with new duties if Beijing does not revalue the yuan. &quot;Estimations of the correct currency value would be inherently subjective, unilateral and potentially politicized since there is no agreed upon method to determine what a country's exchange rate should be in the absence of a market-based determination,&quot; the groups said. Another reason to question the lawmakers' motives is based on the credibility of the data they cite in accusing Beijing of undervaluing the yuan by 24 percent to as much as 40 percent. The figures the lawmakers cite were drawn from previous IMF predictions that China's current account would represent 8 percent of its gross domestic product by 2015. Based on that prediction, the Chinese yuan needs to appreciate 24.2 percent to achieve the current account/GDP target ratio of 3 percent. Please forget the predictions that always vary widely from what happens in reality. China's real current account represented 6 percent of its yearly GDP in 2009, a figure that means the yuan needs only to appreciate 10 percent to reach the target ratio of 3 percent. The true situation this year shows China does not need to revalue the yuan at all, considering China's decreased trade surplus during the past nine months and a likely drop in its current account/GDP ratio to below 4 percent. At the same time, many people worry that the yuan issue could spark a trade war between the world's two largest economies and trigger a spate of protectionism that might endanger the fragile global economic recovery. Past experience shows that global peace and prosperity is impossible without China's participation, and as the world's biggest developing country, China cannot develop itself without the help of other countries. Therefore, the U.S. should rein in those congressmen yapping for Beijing to revalue the yuan and join hands with China to build a positive, cooperative and comprehensive relationship for the 21st century.<br />

C. Impacts - Trade wars cause global war<br />
<br />
Spicer, Olin Foundation, 96 (The Challenge from the East and the Rebirth of the West, p. 121)<br />
<br />
The choice facing the West today is much the same as that which faced the Soviet bloc after World War II: between meeting head-on the challenge of world trade with the adjustments and the benefits that it will bring, or of attempting to shut out markets that are growing and where a dynamic new pace is being set for innovative production. The problem about the second approach is not simply that it won’t hold: satellite technology alone will ensure that consumers will begin to demand those goods that the East is able to provide most cheaply. More fundamentally, it will guarantee the emergence of a fragmented world in which natural fears will be fanned and inflamed. A world divided into rigid trade blocs will be a deeply troubled and unstable place in which suspicion and ultimately envy will possibly erupt into a major war. I do not say that the converse will necessarily be true, that in a free trading world there will be an absence of all strife. Such a proposition would manifestly be absurd. But to trade is to become interdependent, and that is a good stop in the direction of world stability. With nuclear weapons at two a penny, stability will be at a premium in the years ahead. <br />

The incoming Obama administration and congressional Democrats are now considering a second fiscal stimulus package, estimated at more than $500 billion, to follow the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. As they do, much can be learned by examining the first. The major part of the first stimulus package was the $115 billion, temporary rebate payment program targeted to individuals and families that phased out as incomes rose. Most of the rebate checks were mailed or directly deposited during May, June and July. [Commentary] The argument in favor of these temporary rebate payments was that they would increase consumption, stimulate aggregate demand, and thereby get the economy growing again. What were the results? The chart nearby reveals the answer. The upper line shows disposable personal income through September. Disposable personal income is what households have left after paying taxes and receiving transfers from the government. The big blip is due to the rebate payments in May through July. The lower line shows personal consumption expenditures by households. Observe that consumption shows no noticeable increase at the time of the rebate. Hence, by this simple measure, the rebate did little or nothing to stimulate consumption, overall aggregate demand, or the economy. These results may seem surprising, but they are not. They correspond very closely to what basic economic theory tells us. According to the permanent-income theory of Milton Friedman, or the life-cycle theory of Franco Modigliani, temporary increases in income will not lead to significant increases in consumption. However, if increases are longer-term, as in the case of permanent tax cut, then consumption is increased, and by a significant amount. After years of study and debate, theories based on the permanent-income model led many economists to conclude that discretionary fiscal policy actions, such as temporary rebates, are not a good policy tool. Rather, fiscal policy should focus on the &quot;automatic stabilizers&quot; (the tendency for tax revenues to decline in a recession and transfer payments such as unemployment compensation to increase in a recession), which are built into the tax-and-transfer system, and on more permanent fiscal changes that will positively affect the long-term growth of the economy. Why did that consensus seem to break down during the public debates about the fiscal stimulus early this year? One reason may have been the apparent success of the rebate payments in 2001. However, those rebate payments were the first installment of more permanent, multiyear tax cuts passed that same year. Hence, they were not temporary. What are the implications for a second stimulus early next year? The mantra often heard during debates about the first stimulus was that it should be temporary, targeted and timely. Clearly, that mantra must be replaced. In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee on Nov. 19, I recommended alternative principles: permanent, pervasive and predictable. - Permanent. The most obvious lesson learned from the first stimulus is that temporary is not a principle to follow if you want to get the economy moving again. Rather than one- or two-year packages, we should be looking for permanent fiscal changes that turn the economy around in a lasting way. - Pervasive. One argument in favor of &quot;targeting&quot; the first stimulus package was that, by focusing on people who might consume more, the impact would be larger. But the stimulus was ineffective with such targeting. Moreover, targeting implied that increased tax rates, as currently scheduled, will not be a drag on the economy as long as increased payments to the targeted groups are larger than the higher taxes paid by others. But increasing tax rates on businesses or on investments in the current weak economy would increase unemployment and further weaken the economy. Better to seek an across-the-board approach where both employers and employees benefit. - Predictable. While timeliness is an admirable attribute, it is only one property of good fiscal policy. More important is that policy should be clear and understandable -- that is, predictable -- so that individuals and firms know what to expect. Many complain that government interventions in the current crisis have been too erratic. Economic policy -- from monetary policy to regulatory policy, international policy and fiscal policy -- works best if it is as predictable as possible. Many good fiscal packages are consistent with these principles. But what can Congress and the incoming Obama administration do to give the economy a real boost on Jan. 20? Here are a few fairly bipartisan measures worth considering: First, make a commitment, passed into law, to keep all income-tax rates were they are now, effectively making current tax rates permanent. This would be a significant stimulus to the economy, because tax-rate increases are now expected on a majority of small business income, capital gains income, and dividend income. Second, enact a worker's tax credit equal to 6.2% of wages up to $8,000 as Mr. Obama proposed during the campaign -- but make it permanent rather than a one-time check. Third, recognize explicitly that the &quot;automatic stabilizers&quot; are likely to be as large as 2.5% of GDP this fiscal year, that they will help stabilize the economy, and that they should be viewed as part of the overall fiscal package even if they do not require legislation. Fourth, construct a government spending plan that meets long-term objectives, puts the economy on a path to budget balance, and is expedited to the degree possible without causing waste and inefficiency. Some who promoted the first stimulus package have reacted to its failure by saying that we must now switch to large increases in government spending to stimulate demand. But government spending does not address the causes of the weak economy, which has been pulled down by a housing slump, a financial crisis and a bout of high energy prices, and where expectations of future income and employment growth are low. The theory that a short-run government spending stimulus will jump-start the economy is based on old-fashioned, largely static Keynesian theories. These approaches do not adequately account for the complex dynamics of a modern international economy, or for expectations of the future that are now built into decisions in virtually every market. <br />

Text – the United States federal government should establish a feed-in tariff policy for renewable energy that includes guaranteed grid access, long term contracts and purchase prices based on the cost of generation.<br />

A feed in tariff is the best way to incentivize renewable energy – it is cost effective, encourages diversity and decentralization, and enhances market certainty. Prefer our evidence because it is comparative and empirical.<br />

Morris 7 (Craig Morris, 6/25/07, “The Irony of US and UK Renewable Policies”, Writer for Petite Planete and RenewableEnergyAccess.com, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11032:http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/reinsider/story?id=49084 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/reinsider/story?id=49084" rel="nofollow">http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/reinsider/story?id=49084</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11032 -->)\\TM<br />
<br />
Germany, a country with moderate wind and solar potential, has nevertheless become a global leader in not only renewable energy generation, but also industry. This success is greatly attributed to the Renewable Energy Act (REA), which established a renewable energy feed-in tariff (FIT) that set a price schedule for renewable electricity. The secret to the REA? It unleashed the collective might of small investors. In contrast, the United States and the United Kingdom still leave investments in power production up to conglomerates. The predominant mechanism in both the U.S. and the UK for promoting renewable energy is a quota system known in the U.S. as a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and in the UK as Renewable Obligations (RO). Under a quota system, the government mandates that power supply companies generate a specified amount of electricity from renewables. As an entry in Wikipedia puts it, &quot;The underlying theory is that competition in this market place will drive down the costs of supplying renewable electricity and thus minimize the costs to the consumer of meeting renewable energy targets.&quot; Basically, the most efficient projects are implemented; the least efficient ones are rejected. The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) applauds this approach, which &quot;[limits] the role of government to certifying credits, monitoring compliance, and imposing penalties if necessary.&quot; As another entry in Wikipedia would have us believe, the quota system is closer to the market economy than the more &quot;bureaucratic&quot; FITs. Furthermore, the inefficiency of FITs is not held to be limited to bureaucracy; opponents claim that FITs pick winners. By guaranteeing a return on certain renewables, critics charge that the government in effect commits to financing inefficient technologies. Or, to quote Wikipedia once again, FITs are seen as &quot;an extreme form of net-metering.&quot; This derogatory language overlooks a significant similarity between quota systems and FITs-they both intervene in the market. While quota systems set the RE capacity required and leave the price up to market, FITs set the price and leave capacity to the market. FITs are not an &quot;extreme&quot; form of net-metering; in fact, it is not met metering at all. Even in the case of a single solar installation atop a family home, two separate meters are used (one measures generation; the other, consumption), and compensation for power fed to the grid has nothing to do with the retail power rate. It turns out that, far from &quot;picking winners,&quot; FITs make each source equally profitable. In Germany, wind investors fare no worse than solar investors. The price paid is calculated for each by dividing the generator price by the probable output in kilowatt hours (kWh) plus a slight profit margin. Thus, the least is paid for wind and the most for solar, with biomass, etc. in-between. Compare that to quota systems, which only reward the currently most efficient technology (wind at the moment). In other words, quota systems boost the energy source that needs the least help. So while a score of U.S. states have an RPS and 41 have net-metering, only 7 specify a target for solar within the RPS. This means that solar, which cannot currently compete, must—so wind wins. In other words, the U.S. and UK pick the winner. Ironically though, even the most efficient renewable sources are limited by the quota system. At the beginning of 2006, AWEA said the U.S. had a goal of 3,000 MW of new wind power capacity for 2006, but in fact only some 2400 MW was installed that year. Why the shortfall? It turns out that planners realized they were in no hurry when the Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended. Compare that to German system, which reduces compensation on January 1, putting planners under pressure to connect to the grid by Dec 31 or face a reduction in compensation. And there is a further irony in the U.S. system: it uses caps—generally a mechanism to decrease something, such as carbon emissions—to increase renewables. Why limit RE expansion by setting a cap? In quota systems, projects slow down as the target approaches; planners wonder whether their project will go online soon enough. In 2005, Germany blew past its 2010 target for wind for 2010 and has not looked back since. FITs create incentives to move fast by means of price degression, with the goal being not a particular percentage of energy supply, but to make renewables competitive quickly. For example, in Germany around Euro 40 cents/kWh is paid for solar electric, several times the retail rate. Compensation, however, drops forty percent in the ten years from 2004 to 2013. Far from being bureaucratic, FITs hand everything over to the market. Want to install PV or your roof or invest in a local wind turbine? Go to the shop down the street and buy your panels, or talk to the local wind energy office or bank about investing. There is no bidding, no monitoring, no penalties, nor is there any approval/refusal as in Britain, where the British Wind Energy Association lists statistics according to &quot;submitted, refused, approved.&quot; No wonder the EU Commission concluded in 2005 that FITs &quot;are in general cheaper and more effective than ... quota systems&quot;. Other policy-neutral bodies, such as the International Solar Energy Society, have also officially stated the obvious: &quot;To date, feed-in policies have achieved the greatest market penetrations of renewable energy, produced the most cost-effective renewable energy, established local industries, built domestic markets, created work places, and attracted small and big private investors as well as bankers.&quot;<br />

One of the biggest obstacles to reducing carbon emissions is the simple fact that political time and climatological time are very, very different. Politicians in elected democracies think on two- or four-year cycles—if that—while even the leaders of an autocratic state like China, without the pressures of an election, are still limited in just how far ahead they can plan. That's not just politics—that's human psychology. We tend not to be very good at planning for the future—just look at the long-term decline in the American savings rate—and that's just thinking over the scale of a human lifetime. Climatological time is closer to &quot;deep time,&quot; the writer John McPhee's term for how the planet's geology changes over millions to even billions of years, a span of time simply unfathomable to human beings. Climate can change a lot faster than that—thanks largely to the billions of tons of greenhouse gases we've been pumping into the atmosphere over the past 150 years—but it still moves a lot slower than political time, so it's easy to put off until tomorrow.<br />
But two papers published over the weekend in Nature Geoscience show that the very length of climatological time can frustrate our efforts to slow global warming—assuming we can begin to do that. In one paper, a group of Canadian researchers decided to see how the climate system might react over the next hundreds of years if greenhouse gas emissions kept rising to a high level until 2100, and then were zeroed out. (Download a PDF here.) As of 2100, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere reach some 1,000 ppm—two and a half times the current level, and well above the 450 or 350 ppm that many scientists believe would be a safe limit. At that point, emissions magically stop—impossible in the real world, but this is a model. Carbon dioxide, however, can stay in the atmosphere for centuries or even longer, so warming doesn't end when the emissions do. The damage is already done—and continues for the next 900 years.<br />

b) Weather cycles are locked<br />

This week's PNAS brings with it some bad news on the climate front: even if policy makers and the general public get on board with drastic CO2 emission cuts, it's already too late to prevent serious changes to the planet's climate, and those changed will be remarkably persistent. Those are the findings of a group of researchers from the US, Switzerland, and France. In their paper, they look at the effect of increasing CO2 over millennial time frames, and it's worrisome stuff. Currently, CO2 levels in the atmosphere are around 385 ppm, a 35 percent increase over pre-industrial levels. The most optimistic scenarios arrive at a figure of 450 ppm as the best we might be able to achieve in the coming decades, but even at that level, changes in precipitation patterns, temperature increases, and a rise in sea level appear to be locked in for at least the next thousand years. The dynamics of the oceans are to blame. According to Susan Soloman, Senior Scientist at NOAA and lead author, &quot;In the long run, both carbon dioxide loss and heat transfer depend on the same physics of deep-ocean mixing. The two work against each other to keep temperatures almost constant for more than a thousand years, and that makes carbon dioxide unique among the major climate gases.&quot; One of the most profound effects looks to be a severe decrease in rainfall that will affect the southeastern US, the Mediterranean, southern Asia, and swathes of subtropical Africa and South America. Sea levels are going to rise too. Without even accounting for melting ice sheets, the sheer thermal expansion of the Earth's oceans will be between 0.4-1m, and as with the temperature rise and the changes to rainfall, these effects look set to persist for at least until the year 3000. <br />

Climate change is a much, much bigger issue than the public, politicians, and even the most alarmed environmentalists realize. Global warming extends to Mars, where the polar ice cap is shrinking, where deep gullies in the landscape are now laid bare, and where the climate is the warmest it has been in decades or centuries. &quot;One explanation could be that Mars is just coming out of an ice age,&quot; NASA scientist William Feldman speculated after the agency's Mars Odyssey completed its first Martian year of data collection. &quot;In some low-latitude areas, the ice has already dissipated.&quot; With each passing year more and more evidence arises of the dramatic changes occurring on the only planet on the solar system, apart from Earth, to give up its climate secrets. NASA's findings in space come as no surprise to Dr. Habibullo Abdussamatov at Saint Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory. Pulkovo -- at the pinnacle of Russia's space-oriented scientific establishment -- is one of the world's best equipped observatories and has been since its founding in 1839. Heading Pulkovo's space research laboratory is Dr. Abdussamatov, one of the world's chief critics of the theory that man-made carbon dioxide emissions create a greenhouse effect, leading to global warming.  &quot;Mars has global warming, but without a greenhouse and without the participation of Martians,&quot; he told me. &quot;These parallel global warmings -- observed simultaneously on Mars and on Earth -- can only be a straightline consequence of the effect of the one same factor: a long-time change in solar irradiance.&quot;  The sun's increased irradiance over the last century, not C02 emissions, is responsible for the global warming we're seeing, says the celebrated scientist, and this solar irradiance also explains the great volume of C02 emissions.  &quot;It is no secret that increased solar irradiance warms Earth's oceans, which then triggers the emission of large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So the common view that man's industrial activity is a deciding factor in global warming has emerged from a misinterpretation of cause and effect relations.&quot;  Dr. Abdussamatov goes further, debunking the very notion of a greenhouse effect. &quot;Ascribing 'greenhouse' effect properties to the Earth's atmosphere is not scientifically substantiated,&quot; he maintains. &quot;Heated greenhouse gases, which become lighter as a result of expansion, ascend to the atmosphere only to give the absorbed heat away.&quot; <br />

2. SPS Hurts the environment – launch cost and production<br />

&lt;Unlike the ground antennas and power beams, an SSP satellite segment (the aggregated powersat infrastructure) large enough to deliver a substantial part of the 15 terawatts of power we use today may have significant environmental impact if launched from the ground. This 15TW figure includes all energy use, not just electricity, but with sufficient R&amp;D and infrastructure development, electricity can in most cases be substituted for other energy forms, as with electrical cars. Also note that much of the world's population does not now have access to significant energy resources. These people are unlikely to accept that condition forever; thus, energy production will need to increase. Ten (10) TW continuously supplied will provide somewhat more than half of today's energy use. This number will be used for our comparisons. Assuming a powersat mass of 5kg/kw, 40% end-to-end efficiency and 500 tons/launch using the large Sea Dragon booster (a large, robust, reusable, ocean-launched rocket design from the 1960s),[1] some 250,000 launches will be needed. Such an enormous number of launches from earth would dump a great deal of rocket exhaust into the atmosphere. In addition, when space structures are launched from earth, all the mining, processing and construction must take place on earth with the usual environmental costs. While there are ways to minimize the impact of lifting these satellites into space, for example using hydrogen/oxygen propellant which produces only water in the exhaust, from an environmental perspective it would be better to eliminate the launches altogether. These costs can be eliminated entirely by taking the lunar option.<br />

While it has been suggested that in the long term, space solar power (SSP) can provide all the clean, renewable energy Earth could possibly need (and then some), there has been less discussion on the most economic way to produce that power. If we want to build two or three solar power satellites, one obvious approach is to manufacture the parts on the ground, launch them into orbit, and assemble them there, just like the International Space Station. But a few power satellites won’t solve our energy or greenhouse gas problems. We’ll need more. To generate all the energy used on Earth today (about 15 terawatts) would require roughly 400 solar power satellites 10 kilometers across. Assuming advanced, lightweight space solar power technology, this will require at least 100,000 launches to bring all the materials up from Earth. But even 400 satellites won’t be enough. Billions of people today have totally inadequate energy supplies— and the population is growing. Providing everyone with reasonable quantities of energy might take five to ten times more than we produce today. To supply this energy from solar power satellites requires a staggering launch rate. There are two major issues with a very high launch rate.<br />

4. No impact --- warming will be slow and predictable<br />

<br />
Here's what every American needs to know about global warming. Contrary to almost every news report and every staged hearing, including one held by Mr. McCain on Oct. 1, scientists know quite precisely how much the planet will warm in the foreseeable future, a modest three-quarters of a degree (C), plus or minus a mere quarter-degree, according to scientific figures as disparate as this author and NASA scientist James Hansen. The uncertainty is so small, in fact, that publicly crowing this figure is liable to result in a substantial cut in our research funding, which is why the hundreds of other scientists who know this have been so reluctant to disgorge the truth in public. All this has to do with basic physics, which isn't real hard to understand. It has been known since 1872 that as we emit more and more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere, each increment results in less and less warming. In other words, the first changes produce the most warming, and subsequent ones produce a bit less, and so on. But we also assume carbon dioxide continues to go into the atmosphere at an ever-increasing rate. In other words, the increase from year-to-year isn't constant, but itself is increasing. The effect of increasing the rate of carbon dioxide emissions, coupled with the fact that more and more carbon dioxide produces less and less warming compels our climate projections for the future warming to be pretty much a straight line. Translation: Once human beings start to warm the climate, they do so at a constant rate. And yes, it's a sad fact that it took $10 billion of taxpayer money to &quot;prove&quot; something so obvious it can be written in a mere 100 words. <br />

5. Plan can’t solve—to actually impact climate change they’d need international cooperation<br />

Many previous studies have indicated that SSP is a promising candidate as a future clean electric power system. SSP is quite different from many other renewable energy sources, because the SSP systems are launched into Earth's orbit and can supply electricity anywhere on the Earth, including the polar regions. This means SSP cannot be realized without international cooperation and worldwide public acceptance. Especially, allocation of the microwave frequencies needed for the wireless power transmission from the Earth's orbit to the ground will be determined by international votes. Microwave power transmission cannot be used for SSP without acceptance and agreement of all countries. It is important to emphasize that the allocation of acceptable orbits is significant, as is the allocation of radio frequencies. These can only be solved by international cooperation, but those tools now exist and an appropriate process should be designed and implemented. These are the immediate concern for planning for the future. There will also be a significant land use issue for space solar power implementation — the receiving antenna (Rectenna) are not small and may be numerous, and their location should be determined using sound science and policy. On a relative scale, the research and development costs for the safety and environmental issues of SSP are quite small and will have the most positive effect if implemented at the earliest stages of engineering and demonstration projects.<br />

The UK's MailOnline did just that this week under the headline The mini ice age starts here. Lead paragraph? &quot;The bitter winter afflicting much of the Northern Hemisphere is only the start of a global trend towards cooler weather that is likely to last for 20 or 30 years, say some of the world's most eminent climate scientists.&quot; Right. MailOnline reporter David Rose doesn't call them &quot;the world's leading climate skeptics.&quot; He calls them &quot;some of the world's most eminent climate scientists&quot;--and he goes on to cite &quot;Mojib Latif, a leading member of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),&quot; &quot;Anastasios Tsonis, head of the University of Wisconsin Atmospheric Sciences Group,&quot; and &quot;William Gray, emeritus Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Colorado State University.&quot; Contrary to fears of inexorably diminishing Arctic sea ice, Rose cites the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center as reporting that &quot;Arctic summer sea ice has increased by 409,000 square miles, or 26 per cent, since 2007.&quot; Though snow's been unusual for most of the southern half of the United Kingdom in recent decades, the Mail published the accompanying satellite photo of Great Britain during the recent cold snap. The island is essentially all covered with snow. Rose reported record lows as far south as Cuba--something I can attest to, living near Miami in south Florida, where we experienced sub-freezing weather over the weekend. He quoted Tsonis as saying that last week 56% of the United States was covered by snow--something that hasn't happened in several decades. And the &quot;'Arctic oscillation'--a weather pattern that sees the development of huge 'blocking' areas of high pressure in northern latitudes, driving polar winds far to the south . . . is at its strongest for at least 60 years. As a result, the jetstream--the high-altitude wind that circles the globe from west to east and normally pushes a series of wet but mild Atlantic lows across Britain--is currently running not over the English Channel but the Strait of Gibraltar.&quot; Consequently, most of the Northern Hemisphere is much colder this winter than it's been in decades--and the Southern Hemisphere is cooler, too. According to Rose, Latif, Tsonis, and other scientists attribute the cold shift primarily to a shift in the world's dominant ocean circulations--the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation--from a warm phase to a cool phase, something that happens about every 20 to 30 years. &quot;The scientists' predictions also undermine the standard climate computer models, which assert that the warming of the Earth since 1900 has been driven solely by man-made greenhouse gas emissions and will continue as long as carbon dioxide levels rise. They say that their research shows that much of the warming was caused by oceanic cycles when they were in a 'warm mode' as opposed to the present 'cold mode'.&quot; That's a point made by Dr. Roy W. Spencer in the science chapter of the Cornwall Alliance's new document A Renewed Call to Truth, Prudence, and Protection of the Poor: An Evangelical Examination of the Theology, Science, and Economics of Global Warming and illustrated in the graph below. &quot;A significant share of the warming we saw from 1980 to 2000 and at earlier periods in the 20th Century was due to these cycles,&quot; said Latif, &quot;perhaps as much as 50 per cent. They have now gone into reverse, so winters like this one will become much more likely. Summers will also probably be cooler, and all this may well last two decades or longer. The extreme retreats that we have seen in glaciers and sea ice will come to a halt. For the time being, global warming has paused, and there may well be some cooling.&quot; Tsonis also believes that the ocean current cycles dominated global climate change in the 20th century, including the post-1970s, the period many point to as driven by human greenhouse gas emissions, but he doesn't venture to attribute specific percentages to the natural and human causes. &quot;I do not believe in catastrophe theories,&quot; Rose quoted him as saying. &quot;Man-made warming is balanced by the natural cycles, and I do not trust the computer models which state that if CO2 reaches a particular level then temperatures and sea levels will rise by a given amount. These models cannot be trusted to predict the weather for a week, yet they are running them to give readings for 100 years.&quot; Gray went farther: &quot;Most of the rise in temperature from the Seventies to the Nineties was natural. Very little was down to CO2--in my view, as little as five to ten per cent.&quot; Gray, Tsonis, and Latif all agreed that the findings about the ocean currents undermined the credibility of the computer climate models on which the IPCC and other alarmists rely.<br />

7. Global warming is not caused by humans, major scientists agree.<br />

Peden, 1/17/09,(Atmospheric Physicist at the Space Research and Coordination Center in Pittsburgh and Extranuclear Laboratories in Blawnox, Pennsylvania) “The Great Global Warming Hoax?”, (<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11040:http://www.middlebury.net/op-ed/global-warming-01.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.middlebury.net/op-ed/global-warming-01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.middlebury.net/op-ed/global-warming-01.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11040 -->)<br />
But then something unusual happened.  On Dec. 13, 2007, 100 scientists jointly signed an Open Letter to Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting they cease the man-made global warming hysteria and settle down to helping mankind better prepare for natural disasters. The final signature was from the President of the World Federation of Scientists. So what's really causing the endless cycles of warming and cooling, if it isn't a constantly changing &quot;Greenhouse Effect&quot; - with man to blame? Man wasn't producing much CO2 in the past million years, so he hasn't simply been turning the greenhouse up and down at will. Just look up - one of the most likely culprits is our old friend, the Sun. Our satellites are pretty good at measuring overall ocean temperatures from afar, and CO2 measurements are being taken daily around the globe. The best results we have been able to turn up so far is that measurable CO2 increases appear about 9 months after an upswing in ocean temperatures. The data is messed up a bit every time a volcano decides to blow its top, because that's the mother of CO2 producers, bar none. And a buffalo emits about the same amount of methane (CH4) as driving your automobile about 8,000 miles - which can combine with O2 in a highly exothermic reaction ( gives off heat ) to produce CO2 and H2O as end products.<br />

1. Energy Independence breaks down deterrence – every war becomes inevitable<br />
Miller, 10 – professor of political science (Gregory, “The Security Costs of Energy Independence,” April 2010, Gregory D. Miller is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma)<br />
International Conflict A drop in demand for oil would lead to increased probability of conflict between current oil exporters and their customers, including developed Western states, as well as between oil producers and their neighbors. This risk will be especially pronounced in regions with a high number of oil-exporting states such as the Middle East. According to the concept of interdependence, the likelihood of states going to war with each other decreases as mutual dependence between them increases, with trade being the most common measure of interdependence. This idea was reflected in the Clinton administration policy of increasing trade with China in the 1990s. Early European integration in the 1950s was similarly designed to prevent a future European war. 3 If valid, then the inverse of the theory suggests that as states reduce their demand for foreign oil, levels of interdependence between consumer states and oil exporters will fall, increasing the likelihood of conflict. Although it is unlikely that war would occur simply because of lower trade levels, the logic of interdependence theory is that the wealth gained from trade restrains policymakers who otherwise might engage in conflict. 4 If the United States is no longer dependent on foreign oil and if oil-exporting states no longer gain revenue from the United States, there would be fewer constraints on each state’s willingness to use violence, whether it be in the form of conventional military force or state sponsorship of terrorism. One counterargument is that the United States has been drawn into a number of conflicts as a result of its dependence on Middle East oil, such as the reflagging of the Kuwaiti oil tankers in 1987 and the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 5 According to this logic, reducing its dependence on foreign oil would help the United States stay out of such conflicts. Although plausible, a useful exercise is to imagine a future where the United States is no longer dependent on Middle Eastern states for oil. Although the United States will still have important economic and political interests in the Middle East, such as Israel, Iraq, and Turkey as a NATO ally, if oil no longer provides states with some leverage over U.S. foreign policy, then the United States can pursue its interests with less concern about retaliation by oil-exporting states or by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Conversely, as long as oil-exporting states depend on the United States to purchase oil, they are more inclined to assist the United States in pursuing any of its interests, such as the fight against terrorism. Consequently, if states no longer depend on the United States as a consumer, they may have less interest in cooperating with the United States.<br />

2.  No Energy Crisis – Tech Improvements, decreasing costs, other resources, and Aff Exaggeration <br />

<br />
Peak Oil theory is based on a number of assumptions and omissions that make it less than reliable. To begin with, it discounts or disregards the fact that energy-saving technologies have drastically improved (and will continue to further improve) the efficiency of oil consumption. Evidence shows that, for example, &quot;over a period of five years (1994-99), US GDP expanded over 20% while oil usage rose by only 9%. Before the 1973 oil shock, the ratio was about one to one.&quot; [4] Second, Peak Oil theory pays scant attention to the drastically enabling new technologies that have made (and will continue to make) possible discovery and extraction of oil reserves that were inaccessible only a short time ago. One of the results of the more efficient means of research and development has been a far higher success rate in finding new oil fields. The success rate has risen in 20 years from less than 70% to over 80%. Computers have helped to reduce the number of dry holes. Horizontal drilling has boosted extraction. Another important development has been deep-water offshore drilling, which the new technologies now permit. Good examples are the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and more recently, the promising offshore oil fields of West Africa. [5] Third, Peak Oil theory also pays short shrift to what is sometimes called non-conventional oil. These include Canada's giant reserves of extra-heavy bitumen that can be processed to produce conventional oil. Although this was originally considered cost inefficient, experts working in this area now claim that they have brought down the cost from over US$20 a barrel to $8 per barrel. Similar developments are taking place in Venezuela. It is thanks to developments like these that since 1970, world oil reserves have more than doubled, despite the extraction of hundreds of millions of barrels. [6] Fourth, Peak Oil thesis pays insufficient attention to energy sources other than oil. These include solar, wind, non-food bio-fuel, and nuclear energies. They also include natural gas. Gas is now about 25% of energy demand worldwide. It is estimated that by 2050 it will be the main source of energy in the world. A number of American, European, and Japanese firms are investing heavily in developing fuel cells for cars and other vehicles that would significantly reduce gasoline consumption. [7]<br />
Fifth, proponents of Peak Oil tend to exaggerate the impact of the increased oil demand coming from China and India on both the amount and the price of oil in global markets. The alleged disparity between supply and demand is said to be due to the rapidly growing demand coming from China and India. But that rapid growth in demand is largely offset by a number of counterbalancing factors. These include slower growth in US demand due to its slower economic growth, efficient energy utilization in industrially advanced countries, and increases in oil production by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, and others.<br />
Finally, and perhaps more importantly, claims of &quot;peaked and dwindling&quot; oil are refuted by the available facts and figures on global oil supply. Statistical evidence shows that there is absolutely no supply-demand imbalance in global oil markets. Contrary to the claims of the proponents of Peak Oil and champions of war and militarism, the current oil price shocks are a direct consequence of the destabilizing wars and geopolitical insecurity in the Middle East, not oil shortages. These include not only the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also the threat of a looming war against Iran. The record of soaring oil prices shows that anytime there is a renewed US military threat against Iran, fuel prices move up several notches. <br />

No market advantage What the telegraph story says to me is that space-based power is increasingly more likely to fail than to succeed. It's the market-timing paradox. When the telegraph line was put in, its only competition was the transmission of information using ships. Sailing across the Atlantic took the better part of two weeks and led to the newspapers of the time often featuring stories with the attribution &quot;a recently arrived boat passenger has reported.&quot; Conversely, once the telegraph line was actually functional in the 1860s, it could transmit Morse-coded accounts of events in minutes. What this leap in the speed of information transmission meant is that there was effectively no competition for a telegraph. Accordingly, customers were charged $5 a word for the initial transmissions. To put this in modern context for you, when inflation is taken into consideration, that would translate into a 140-character internet tweet costing upwards of $4,000. Therein lies the fundamental problem with space-based solar power: it isn't different from any other kind of electricity. Toasters or computers or the internet won't run faster or smoother or better when powered by solar energy from space. And this means that space solar power is — in price, reliability, availability and reduction of global warming — in competition with every other form of alternative and conventional energy. It is as if laying telegraph cables existed in a world where primitive forms of radio transmissions and cellphones and internet signals were also developing. In this complex marketplace, price isn't set by a monopoly medium but by all media in competition. The most optimistic of scenarios today has space-based solar costing five to 10 times as much as traditional energy sources. Prohibitive cost The argument that proponents make is that a variety of technological advances could bring this cost down. However, there is a root problem in this. The same pressure to provide sustainable, environmentally friendly energy sources is at work through out the power industry. And Earth-based technologies have an intrinsic advantage in what is called &quot;the learning curve.&quot; Jonathan Koomey, who co-authored in 2007 an article called &quot;The Risk of Surprise in Energy Technology Costs,&quot; points out that when developing something like a better wind power generator, errors teach you things. &quot;You learn what went wrong, correct it and build another one,&quot; Koomey said from Yale University, where he is a visiting professor. But space construction bedevils any simple learning feedback. Simply getting to where the problem exists to determine the problem and fix it is a huge issue. A single space shuttle flight costs about $1 billion. Even cheap launch vehicles envisaged for the future are estimated to cost around $78 million a flight. How can you be nimble and do quick redesigns with this kind of overhead? I don't think you can. And thus the paradox: if SBSP gets better but its competitors do as well, space power might never be good enough to compete in the energy marketplace. So, what the transatlantic telegraph tells me is a great irony for proponents of space solar power. Despite all its recent activity and advances, SBSP seems today more likely to fail because external circumstances mean other energy alternatives are more likely to succeed.<br />

The success space based solar power will be determined by the ability to decrease cost, with much of this depending on the development of rocket launches. For space based solar power to be viable, the frequency of rocket launches needs to increase and the cost per kilogram needs to decrease. Another major issue is the design of the space based solar power platform. Primarily, the wireless power transmission systems need to be developed so that there is acceptable DC to DC conversion efficiency. This also affects the necessary payload and structure of the space based solar power platform. Methods of assembly in space, system architecture, etc. must also be developed. It will be difficult for the business to be profitable early on since it will lack a product and be mainly in the performing research &amp; development. The development of infrastructure and the deployment costs will require a large amount of funding. Space based solar power is high risk and there is no guarantee that there will be acceptable returns. Because of the long development cycle, investors will not receive any returns until several decades later. Therefore, investment groups/ venture capitalists are unlikely to fund space based solar power. The company will need to be assisted by the government investment. Currently organizations such as NASA, the Japan Space Agency, and the Chinese government all appear to have interest in developing space based solar power. The business will have to continue to run on government grants until it can launch a satellite for niche markets. After this point, the business will start receiving income and there will be greater confidence to invest into space based solar power technology.<br />

The United States is the richest and largest economy in the world, with economic growth rates that have outpaced other developed countries. Between 1986 and 2005, for example, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 3.1 percent compared to 2.1 percent for Japan, 2.6 percent for the United Kingdom, and 2.6 percent for Germany. Among the reasons for the United States’s economic success: World class post-secondary education: The United States is home to the world’s top research universities. According to High Impact Universities, the top 12 research universities in the world are all in America, and of the top 50, only 10 are outside of the United States. Smart regulatory policy: The United States remains one of the easiest places to start a business. It costs less than 1 percent of per capita income to start a business in the United compared to 5.1 percent in Germany and 7.5 percent in Japan. An entrepreneurial culture: The United States has a uniquely strong entrepreneurial culture. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reports that Americans are the least likely of developed countries to have a “fear of failure that would prevent them from starting a business.” Only 27 percent of American respondents indicated that they would not start a business due to a fear of failure. In Germany, France, and Japan, that figure was 37 percent, 47 percent, and 50 percent, respectively. A commitment to innovation: The United States as a whole, including American businesses, devote more money to research and development as a share of GDP than almost all other developed countries, including Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The exception to this is Japan and South Korea, which, over the past three decades, have invested more in research and development than the United States. <br />

<br />
Whether or not you’re buying the sudden, unlikely, belief in American Exceptionalism that Barack Obama displayed during his State of the Union speech, one thing is clear. However great we, as a nation are, we cannot “win the future.” In his address, Obama spent a lot of time talking about our “Sputnik Moment.” In the mid 50’s, the United States was on the receiving end of a space-race smack down. The Russians had been the first to put a satellite in orbit. Soon after, they would outpace us again, by putting a human in space and returning them safely to Earth. Despite the objections from Democrats like Walter Mondale, America funneled its collective will into rectifying the situation. According to the President, we had recognized our “Sputnik moment” and were on our way to “winning the future” by beating Russia to the Moon. That was 50 years ago. In the following decades, we maintained our space-age dominance through multiple lunar missions, Skylab, the space shuttle, and unparalleled advances in satellite technology. We’re now seeing our leadership status erode. When George Bush left office, we were on pace to return to the moon – ahead of our new space-rivals, the Chinese. Barack Obama put an end to that program. He gutted NASA’s budget and all but eliminated manned space flight, while paying lip service to a nebulous, underfunded, Mars mission that many believe will never come to fruition. Liberals regularly tell us that there’s nothing a human can do in space that a machine can’t. According to the scientific mind of Barney Frank, “Manned space travel adds far more cost than is justified in terms of scientific return.” Predictably, while the left decimates American space exploration, China is ramping up its Space initiative. The CNSA (China National Space Administration) is aggressively pursuing a series of orbital missions and moon shots, which will be funded by the interest paid on the money Barack Obama is currently borrowing. As a result, where space exploration is concerned, China has become the new Russia, and once again we’ve fallen behind. Only this time, we’ve done so by choice. Barack Obama says we’re at “a Sputnik moment” – this time, due to our financial situation. We find ourselves being fiscally outpaced by a hostile foreign government, to which we’re deeply indebted. We’ve got to turn the situation around. According to his State of the Union address, we simply need the will to make it happen. Disastrously, the one man in America who seems to lack that will is the President himself. A day after the State of the Union address, we learned that 2011 will see the United States perched precariously atop a record breaking 1.5 trillion dollar deficit. How are we going to deal with it? We’re going to borrow more money from China. We’re going to fund our chief competitor. Just as Obama has forfeited our place in the space race, he is willfully relinquishing our place as a global economic superpower because he lacks the willpower necessary to embrace his own “sputnik moment” and make the decisions necessary to fix the situation. Instead, he’s marching down a path of “investment” in green energy and high speed rail. In short, he’s embracing the same old left-wing, big government positions, digging us deeper and deeper into the hole. Even if, by some strange miracle, tomorrow saw Barack Obama change course and embrace every tenant of fiscal conservatism the fight would go on. Yes, we would quickly return to dominance, but there will always be the next competitor, the next country, trying to knock us out of the top spot. “Winning the future” implies that an endgame exists where it clearly doesn’t. It’s a problem around which dyed-in-the-wool liberals, like Barack Obama, have a hard time wrapping their heads. We will never be able to “win the future” because the future is always in motion. We can however, prepare ourselves for success by cultivating an environment in which achievement is possible. Obama’s brand of anti- entrepreneur, anti-individual, liberalism has been tried, repeatedly, and has served only to neuter our country’s greatest assets. Recognizing this fact is Barack Obama’s true “Sputnik moment.” Sadly, he continutes to prove that he’s absolutely unwilling to embrace it. <br />

But even though some of them [lawmakers] appreciate the need for them to retrench, particularly to stop adding so much debt every year until they reach the point where the capital markets rebel against them, that that will be the real constrain on them. Because at some point the people that buy these bonds will simply lose interest in buying any more of them and in fact will want to hold fewer of them, and when that turnaround comes, and I think we may be in the neighborhood of such a turnaround right now, these governments will not be able any longer to continue spending at the same rate that they’ve been spending without financing their expenditures in even more troublesome ways such as by outright inflation of the money stock. So, if they reach the point where the financial constraint really begins to bite, they’re going to have to reduce expenditures, and that will almost certainly have to include the enormous expenditures on maintenance of the U.S. empire. <br />

The possible resulting collapse of U.S. bonds will be especially bad for the holders of U.S. Treasury bonds. Countless American corporations and banks hold these, believing them to be guaranteed. Fixed income retirees collect these in their retirement portfolios, believing them to be supremely safe. Once they were. But if you see the bond market crash as a result of U.S. government debt downgrades, these IOU pieces of paper also known as Treasury bonds will become pariah. Plummeting bond prices will be devastating for the retirees who depend on the income from these instruments and the gradual sales of them to finance their retirements. Banks have only recently come off of their sub prime real estate collapse and defaults too. Imagine them having to now weather a severe deterioration in what they up till now believed to be their most trustworthy assets. The consequential damage to the U.S. financial system will be catastrophic. You thought bank failures in the hundreds were bad. Imagine closing banks by the thousands. If the bond market crashes, this will only be one of the unfortunate results. The Bond Market Crash Impact on All Americans As bad as bankrupt retirees and rapidly failing banks sound, this is only the tip of the iceberg for the way that average middle class Americans will be affected by the collapsing bond market. You might not be immediately clear on why this would be the case. Your average American middle class person is not holding significant quantities of U.S. Treasury Bonds, after all. The relationship between Treasury Bond prices and rates are inversely related. Because treasury bond prices are high and stable, the government, and hence all Americans, are able to borrow money for ridiculously low interest rates. The government only has to pay between zero and point twenty-five percent interest on its massive debt now. But if the bond market prices plummet with the lack of demand to keep up with supply, the the interest rates will move the other direction, sharply higher. You might wonder how much higher they could go. A sudden precipitous plunge in U.S. Treasury bond prices could send interest rates up to double digits, according to some economists. The effects of this would be devastating and widespread in their immediate impact. In order to fight inflation, the rising costs of goods and services, as foreign investors fled the U.S. Treasuries market altogether, the Fed would be forced to raise interest rates to match. This would be necessary not only to fight off a sudden surge in inflation, but also a potentially crashing dollar value. The resulting rates that you pay for every form of debt, from cars to credit cards, to home mortgages, would skyrocket. Government services would have to be drastically reduced, as Washington was forced to spend the majority of its annual income on servicing the debt at the much higher interest rates. This is not as far fetched as it might seem. Both the financial editor of the prestigious Financial Times of London and the former head of the IMF have painted this scenario as a specter likely to face the U.S. and its tax paying citizens in the near future.<br />

These debt forecasts for the United States were especially ominous in light of recent research by economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff warning that debt above 90 percent of GDP is associated with substantially lower real economic growth. As they summarized the findings from their cross-country study: First, the relationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. 9 Some members of the U.S. public, an agency of the federal government, and at least one bond rating firm became concerned. New federal spending programs (financial and auto industry bailouts, pork-filled ―stimulus,‖ Obamacare) and ballooning debt helped to trigger the ―Tea Party‖ protests of 2009 and 2010 against what was seen as fiscal irresponsibility. The Congressional Budget Office warned in its July 2010 report: ―Unless policymakers restrain the growth of spending, increase revenues significantly as a share of GDP, or adopt some combination of those two approaches, growing budget deficits will cause debt to rise to unsupportable levels.‖ What had happened in Greece and Ireland might then happen in the United States: A ―growing level of federal debt would also increase the probability of a sudden fiscal crisis, during which investors would lose confidence in the government‘s ability to manage its budget, and the government would thereby lose its ability to borrow at affordable rates. 10 A hint of higher future borrowing costs was suggested in January 2011 when the Moody‘s bondrating agency warned that for United States Treasury debt ―the probability of assigning a negative outlook in the coming two years is rising.‖ 11 <br />

One of the most persistent calls for change in space policy in the US in recent years has revolved around export control. Current law puts virtually most space hardware under the jurisdiction of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), an acronym that has become figuratively and literally a four-letter word in the industry given the costs, delays, and general uncertainty involved in dealing with those regulations. There’s no shortage of horror stories among companies who have run into ITAR when dealing with seemingly innocuous components, and a growing stack of studies that conclude that ITAR has put US companies at a disadvantage in the global market and spurred other countries to develop their own versions of protected components.<br />

B. THE PLAN WILL REQUIRE MASSIVE POLITICAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT. SPIN WON’T SOLVE<br />
<br />
MARK S. AVNET, 2006. ENGINEERING SYSTEMS DIVISION, MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, THE SPACE ELEVATOR IN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT SPACE EXPLORATION POLICY, MAY 2, 2006,  SPACE POLICY 22 (2006) 133–139, WWW.SCIENCEDIRECT.COM.<br />
The scale and scope of the space elevator make it an infrastructural technology that will require a rather signiﬁcant initial government investment. However, taxpayers will support a national space elevator program only to the extent that it is viewed as a worthwhile use of tax dollars. The space elevator faces a number of obstacles to this. It will most likely have to be funded from the civil space program budget, which is already rather limited. In addition, most people consider the space elevator to be science ﬁction, and members of the US Congress will back the project only if they believe that their constituents will beneﬁt from the program. On 25 May 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced his decision that the United States should send a human being to the Moon [10]. After the embarrassment of the Bay of Pigs ﬁasco and the orbital ﬂight of Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, Kennedy sought a way ‘‘to demonstrate to the world that the United States remained the leading nation in technological and social vitality’’ [11]. The decision was made not because it was the best course of action for the space program but because it served the broader cold war agenda. Kennedy chose that particular goal because his advisors determined that it promised the best hope among civil space programs for a U.S. victory over the Soviet Union. According to John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at The George Washington University, ‘‘The Apollo decision is best understood as national policy, not space or technology policy; the space program was used as a means to broader national purposes, not supported on its own merits’’ [11]. Similarly, a directed program of space elevator development would have to be initiated because it served broader policy objectives. Even if such a stimulus does present itself, however, the space elevator is an unlikely goal to be chosen. Human missions to Mars and lunar colonies have proven to be much more attractive space exploration goals to high-level policy makers. Since the space elevator probably will not be chosen to meet an Apollo-type objective, it will be subject to the normal give-and-take of the political process. Therefore, the International Space Station (ISS) might serve as a better model for space elevator development. In his 1984 State of the Union Address, President Ronald Reagan announced his intention for the United States to begin a space station program [12]. While this might have seemed like a ﬁrm commitment of national leadership at the time, Howard McCurdy of American University’s School of Public Affairs, argues that it was not. The Station was not funded all at once but rather in small increments. McCurdy states, ‘‘Had NASA executives insisted upon a stronger long-term commitment to the programme in 1984, y the Space Station probably would not have been approved’’. McCurdy goes on to explain that NASA often has accepted low initial funding for programs with the hope of gaining eventual long-term approval [13]. At best, space elevator development will have to be able to withstand a similar level of negotiation, compromise, and ‘‘incremental’’ [13] decision making. <br />

<br />
As is well understood, the space policies of the Bush administration were decidedly oriented toward military security concerns and independent action. The 2006 National Space Policy unabashedly proclaimed the U.S. intention to maintain a dominant position in space indefinitely. This policy orientation dismissed multilateral cooperation as impinging on U.S. “freedom of action,” throwing weight instead behind a wide range of technology development initiatives founded on the assumption that deployment of weapons in space was, if not already factual, certainly inevitable.2 U.S. commercial and civil engagement was overshadowed by these security concerns, expressed through the tightening of export control restrictions inhibiting a broad range of technology sharing. Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns. This background is essential for appreciating how the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails. The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3 Less broadly noticed was this policy’s clarity and coherence in articulating a vision for U.S. space activities on its own terms. The document is organized around core principles, subsidiary goals and implementing guidelines that exceed its predecessors in delineating a longer-term direction for U.S. space policy that is integrated with, rather than derivative of, broader U.S. global aims.4 The policy also was generated and issued far earlier in the tenure of the administration than either of its predecessors, indicating an increased prioritization of attention to space policy at higher levels of policy-making. To some degree, a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, new budget realities and unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds. The 2011 National Security Space Strategy, released February 4, is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation and greater attention to space policy in general. This first-of-its-kind strategic statement culminates a congressionally mandated space posture review.6 The initial section portraying the strategic environment to which U.S. security policy must be responsive highlights the growing problems of space debris, orbital congestion and coordination among a growing number of space actors — not state-based security threats per se. The Security Space Strategy features the objective of a “stable space environment in which nations exercise shared responsibility.”7 Specific provisions intended to implement this strategy, relevant to the preceding observations, include:8 • The strategy presents a full section on “Partnering with Responsible Nations, International Organizations, and Commercial Firms.” This category is not wholly multilateral in the traditional sense, displaying a symbiosis of alliance-building and collective cooperation not always carefully distinguished; i.e., “The United States will lead in building coalitions of like-minded space-faring nations and, where appropriate, work with international institutions to do so.” • The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and norms of behavior for responsible space operations.” [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements in the longer-term. • The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right. • The strategy commits to reforming export controls. “In particular, as new opportunities arise for international collaboration, a revised export control system will better enable the domestic firms competing for these contracts.” As noted above, the oppressive impact of current U.S. export controls not only impinges on U.S. commercial space actors but also epitomizes the high degree to which U.S. policy has subsumed commercial and civil interests to national security concerns. The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it. • The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent. For example, the strategy’s section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression” concludes that the U.S. “will retain the right and capabilities to respond in self-defense, should deterrence fail,” but immediately adds that the U.S. “will use force in a manner that is consistent with longstanding principles of international law, treaties to which the United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.” • The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting that “some actors may still believe counterspace actions could provide military advantage.” Counterspace capabilities, unarticulated in the document, include ASATs, ground-based directed energy weapons and satellite transmission jamming. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy Gregory Schulte explained at the strategy’s rollout that China is a principal concern in this regard, but so is the proliferation of these technologies: “If Ethiopia can jam a commercial satellite, you have to worry what others can do.”10 This section of the strategy does not, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities. Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria. The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps as striking as the prevalence of such passages, however, is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand the kind of independent space-based military capabilities that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. These policy movements toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 Critics also decried the strategy’s emphasis on “the old fallacious assumption that the power of example will prevent adversaries from doing the United States harm,” and endorsed maintaining the goal of U.S. retention of a “dominant position in military and intelligence space capabilities.”15 In fact, the administration’s warming toward normative commitments in general — and the EU Code of Conduct in particular — are in part intended to forestall pressure for more formal and binding measures that would definitively cut off the “hedge” of unilateral U.S. weapons development options.16 The balance of U.S. debate may have shifted toward greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same. In sum, the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also, and more importantly, a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details. <br />

Space elevators will be used to move weaponize space<br />
Foust 9 (Jeff, the editor and publisher of The Space Review, “Review: Heavenly Ambitions”, August)<br />
One of the talks at the just-completed Space Elevator Conference in Seattle dealt with how the US military might evolve, developing new roles and capabilities, should the promise of very low cost access to space ever be realized by the space elevator concept. The speaker, a US Air Force officer—speaking on his own behalf and not representing the service or the Defense Department—painted an elaborate picture of how the existing military branches could evolve space commands and arms to protect American interests in Earth orbit and beyond should they be opened up at some future time by low-cost space access. (Interestingly, he felt that model was more likely than the development of a “Space Force” branch of the military independent of the other services.) However, the central theme of his presentation was that the movement of military forces into space was inevitable.<br />

Multilateral cooperation against weaponization is vital to preventing miscalculation, first strike incentives and global war<br />
Hitchens, 8 – president of the Center for Defense Information (Theresa, “Space Wars - Coming to the Sky Near You?”, Scientific American, February, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11051:http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11051 -->)<br />

Perhaps of even greater concern is that several other nations, including one of China’s regional rivals, India, may feel compelled to seek ­offensive as well as defensive capabilities in space. The U.S. trade journal Defense News, for instance, quoted unidentified Indian defense officials as stating that their country had already begun developing its own kinetic-energy (nonexplosive, hit-to-kill) and laser-based antisatellite weapons. If India goes down that path, its archrival Pakistan will probably follow suit. Like India, Pakistan has a well-developed ballistic missile program, including medium-range missiles that could launch an antisatellite system. Even Japan, the third major Asian power, might join such a space race. In June 2007 the National Diet of Japan began considering a bill backed by the current Fukuda government that would permit the development of satellites for “military and national security” purposes. As for Russia, in the wake of the Chinese test President Vladimir Putin reiterated Moscow’s stance against the weaponization of space. At the same time, though, he refused to criticize Beijing’s actions and blamed the U.S. instead. The American efforts to build a missile defense system, Putin charged, and the increasingly aggressive American plans for a military position in space were prompting China’s moves. Yet Russia itself, as a major spacefaring power that has incorporated satellites into its national security structure, would be hard-pressed to forgo entering an arms race in space. Given the proliferation of spacefaring entities, proponents of a robust space warfare strategy believe that arming the heavens is inevitable and that it would be best for the U.S. to get there first with firepower. Antisatellite and space-based weapons, they argue, will be necessary not only to defend U.S. military and commercial satellites but also to deny any future adversary the use of space capabilities to enhance the performance of its forces on the battlefield. Yet any arms race in space would almost inevitably destabilize the balance of power and thereby multiply the risks of global conflict. In such headlong competition—whether in space or elsewhere—equilibrium among the adversaries would be virtually impossible to maintain. Even if the major powers did achieve stability, that reality would still provide no guarantee that both sides would perceive it to be so. The moment one side saw itself to be slipping behind the other, the first side would be strongly tempted to launch a preemptive strike, before things got even worse. Ironically, the same would hold for the side that perceived itself to have gained an advantage. Again, there would be strong temptation to strike first, before the adversary could catch up. Finally, a space weapons race would ratchet up the chances that a mere technological mistake could trigger a battle. After all, in the distant void, reliably distinguishing an intentional act from an accidental one would be highly problematic. Hit-to-Kill Interceptors According to assessments by U.S. military and intelligence officials as well as by independent experts, the Chinese probably destroyed their weather satellite with a kinetic-energy vehicle boosted by a two-stage medium-range ballistic missile. Technologically, launching such direct-ascent antisatellite weapons is one of the simplest ways to take out a satellite. About a dozen nations and consortia can reach low Earth orbit (between roughly 100 and 2,000 kilometers, or 60 to 1,250 miles, high) with a medium-range missile; eight of those countries can reach geostationary orbit (about 36,000 kilometers, or 22,000 miles, above Earth). But the real technical hurdle to making a hit-to-kill vehicle is not launch capacity; it is the precision maneuverability and guidance technology needed to steer the vehicle into its target. Just how well China has mastered those techniques is unclear. Because the weather satellite was still operating when it was destroyed, the Chinese operators would have known its exact location at all times. Ground-Based Lasers The test of China’s direct-ascent antisatellite device came on the heels of press reports in September 2006 that the Chinese had also managed to “paint,” or illuminate, U.S. spy satellites with a ground-based laser [see lower box on page 83]. Was Beijing actually trying to “blind” or otherwise damage the satellites? No one knows, and no consensus seems to have emerged in official Washington circles about the Chinese intent. Per¬haps China was simply testing how well its network of low-power laser-ranging stations could track American orbital observation platforms. Even so, the test was provocative. Not all satellites have to be electronically “fried” to be put out of commission. A 1997 test of the army’s MIRACL system (for midinfrared advanced chemical laser) showed that satellites designed to collect optical images can be temporarily disrupted—dazzled—by low-power beams. It follows that among the satellites vulnerable to such an attack are the orbital spies. The U.S. and the former Soviet Union began experimenting with laser-based antisatellite weapons in the 1970s. Engineers in both countries have focused on the many problems of building high-power laser systems that could reliably destroy low-flying satellites from the ground. Such systems could be guided by “adaptive optics”: deformable mirrors that can continuously compensate for atmospheric distortions. But tremendous amounts of energy would be needed to feed high-power lasers, and even then the range and effectiveness of the beams would be severely limited by dispersion, by attenuation as they passed through smoke or clouds, and by the difficulty of keeping the beams on-target long enough to do damage. During the development of the SDI, the U.S. conducted several laser experiments from Hawaii, including a test in which a beam was bounced off a mirror mounted on a satellite. Laser experiments continue at the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. Pentagon budget documents from fiscal years 2004 through 2007 listed antisatellite operations among the goals of the Starfire research, but that language was removed from budget documents in fiscal year 2008 after Congress made inquiries. The Starfire system incorporates adaptive optics that narrow the outgoing laser beam and thus increase the density of its power. That capability is not required for imagery or tracking, further suggesting that Starfire could be used as a weapon. Yet despite decades of work, battle-ready versions of directed-energy weapons still seem far away. An air force planning document, for instance, predicted in 2003 that a ground-based weapon able to “propagate laser beams through the atmosphere to [stun or kill low Earth orbit] satellites” could be available between 2015 and 2030. Given the current state of research, even those dates seem optimistic. Co-orbital Satellites Recent advances in miniaturized sensors, powerful onboard computers and efficient rocket thrusters have made a third kind of antisatellite technology increasingly feasible: the offensive microsatellite. One example that demonstrates the potential is the air force’s experimental satellite series (XSS) project, which is developing microsatellites intended to conduct “autonomous proximity operations” around larger satellites. The first two microsatellites in the program, the XSS-10 and XSS-11, were launched in 2003 and 2005. Though ostensibly intended to inspect larger satellites, such microsatellites could also ram target satellites or carry explosives or directed-energy payloads such as radio-frequency jamming systems or high-powered microwave emitters. Air force budget documents show that the XSS effort is tied to a program called Advanced Weapons Technology, which is dedicated to research on military laser and microwave systems. During the cold war the Soviet Union developed, tested and even declared operational a co-orbital antisatellite system—a maneuverable interceptor with an explosive payload that was launched by missile into an orbit near a target satellite in low Earth orbit. In effect, the device was a smart “space mine,” but it was last demonstrated in 1982 and is probably no longer working. Today such an interceptor would likely be a microsatellite that could be parked in an orbit that would cross the orbits of several of its potential targets. It could then be activated on command during a close encounter. In 2005 the air force described a program that would provide “localized” space “situational awareness” and “anomaly characterization” for friendly host satellites in geostationary orbit. The program is dubbed ANGELS (for autonomous nanosatellite guardian for evaluating local space), and the budget line believed to represent it focuses on acquiring “high value space asset defensive capabilities,” including a “warning sensor for detection of a direct ascent or co-orbital vehicle.” It is clear that such guardian nanosatellites could also serve as offensive weapons if they were maneuvered close to enemy satellites. And the list goes on. A “parasitic satellite” would shadow or even attach itself to a target in geostationary orbit. Farsat, which was mentioned in an appendix to the [Donald] Rumsfeld Space Commission report in 2001, “would be placed in a ‘storage’ orbit (perhaps with many microsatellites housed inside) relatively far from its target but ready to be maneuvered in for a kill.” Finally, the air force proposed some time ago a space-based radio-frequency weapon system, which “would be a constellation of satellites containing high-power radio-frequency transmitters that possess the capability to disrupt/¬destroy/disable a wide variety of electronics and national-level command and control systems.” Air force planning documents from 2003 envisioned that such a technology would emerge after 2015. But outside experts think that orbital radio-frequency and microwave weapons are technically feasible today and could be deployed in the relatively near future. Space Bombers Though not by definition a space weapon, the Pentagon’s Common Aero Vehicle/Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (often called CAV) enters into this discussion because, like an ICBM, it would travel through space to strike Earth-bound targets. An unpowered but highly maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle, the CAV would be deployed from a future hypersonic space plane, swoop down into the atmosphere from orbit and drop conventional bombs on ground targets. Congress recently began funding the project but, to avoid stoking a potential arms race in space, has prohibited any work to place weapons on the CAV. Although engineers are making steady progress on the key technologies for the CAV program, both the vehicle and its space plane mothership are still likely decades off. Some of the congressional sensitivity to the design of the CAV may have arisen from another, much more controversial space weapons concept with parallel goals: hypervelocity rod bundles that would be dropped to Earth from orbital platforms. For decades air force planners have been thinking about placing weapons in orbit that could strike terrestrial targets, particularly buried, “hardened” bunkers and caches of weapons of mass destruction. Commonly called “rods from God,” the bundles would be made up of large tungsten rods, each as long as six meters (20 feet) and 30 centimeters (12 inches) across. Each rod would be hurled downward from an orbiting spacecraft and guided to its target at tremendous speed. Both high costs and the laws of physics, however, challenge their feasibility. Ensuring that the projectiles do not burn up or deform from reentry friction while sustaining a precise, nearly vertical flight path would be extremely difficult. Calculations indicate that the nonexplosive rods would probably be no more effective than more conventional munitions. Furthermore, the expense of lofting the heavy projectiles into orbit would be exorbitant. Thus, despite continued interest in them, rods from God seem to fall into the realm of science fiction. Obstacles to Space Weapons What, then, is holding the U.S. (and other nations) back from a full-bore pursuit of space weapons? The countervailing pressures are threefold: political opposition, technological challenges and high costs. The American body politic is deeply divided over the wisdom of making space warfare a part of the national military strategy. The risks are manifold. I remarked earlier on the general instabilities of an arms race, but there is a further issue of stability among the nuclear powers. Early-warning and spy satellites have traditionally played a crucial role in reducing fears of a surprise nuclear attack. But if antisatellite weapons disabled those eyes-in-the-sky, the resulting uncertainty and distrust could rapidly lead to catastrophe. One of the most serious technological challenges posed by space weapons is the proliferation of space debris, to which I alluded earlier. According to investigators at the air force, NASA and Celestrak (an independent space-monitoring Web site), the Chinese antisatellite test left more than 2,000 pieces of junk, baseball-size and larger, orbiting the globe in a cloud that lies between about 200 kilometers (125 miles) and 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) above Earth’s surface. Perhaps another 150,000 objects that are a centimeter (half an inch) across and larger were released. High orbital velocities make even tiny pieces of space junk dangerous to spacecraft of all kinds. And ground stations cannot reliably monitor or track objects smaller than about five centimeters (two inches) across in low Earth orbit (around a meter in geostationary orbit), a capability that might enable satellites to maneuver out of the way. To avoid being damaged by the Chinese space debris, in fact, two U.S. satellites had to alter course. Any shooting war in space would raise the specter of a polluted space environment no longer navigable by Earth-orbiting satellites. Basing weapons in orbit also pre¬sents difficult technical obstacles. They would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all kinds of outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic signals, even natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against such threats would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is bulky and adds mass, thereby greatly increasing launch costs. Orbital weapons would be mostly autonomous mechanisms, which would make operational errors and failures likely. The paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to predict, which would make hiding large weapons problematic. And because satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many weapons. Finally, getting into space and operating there is extremely expensive: between $2,000 and $10,000 a pound to reach low Earth orbit and between $15,000 and $20,000 a pound for geostationary orbit. Each space-based weapon would require replacement every seven to 15 years, and in-orbit repairs would not be cheap, either. Alternatives to Space Warfare Given the risks of space warfare to national and international security, as well as the technical and financial hurdles that must be overcome, it would seem only prudent for spacefaring nations to find ways to prevent an arms race in space. The U.S. focus has been to reduce the vulnerability of its satellite fleet and explore alternatives to its dependence on satellite services. Most other space-capable countries are instead seeking multilateral diplomatic and legal measures. The options range from treaties that would ban antisatellite and space-based weapons to voluntary measures that would help build transparency and mutual confidence. The Bush administration has adamantly opposed any form of negotiations regarding space weapons. Opponents of multilateral space weapons agreements contend that others (particularly China) will sign up but build secret arsenals at the same time, because such treaty violations cannot be detected. They argue further that the U.S. cannot sit idly as potential adversaries gain spaceborne resources that could enhance their terrestrial combat capabilities. Proponents of international treaties counter that failure to negotiate such agreements entails real opportunity costs. An arms race in space may end up compromising the security of all nations, including that of the U.S., while it stretches the economic capacities of the competitors to the breaking point. And whereas many advocates of a space weapons ban concede that it will be difficult to construct a fully verifiable treaty—because space technology can be used for both military and civilian ends—effective treaties already exist that do not require strict verification. A good example is the Biological Weapons Convention. Certainly a prohibition on the testing and use (as opposed to the deployment) of the most dangerous class of near-term space weapons—destructive (as opposed to jamming) antisatellite systems—would be easily verifiable, because earthbound observers can readily detect orbital debris. Furthermore, any party to a treaty would know that all its space launches would be tracked from the ground, and any suspicious object in orbit would promptly be labeled as such. The international outcry that would ensue from such overt treaty violations could deter would-be violators. Since the mid-1990s, however, progress on establishing a new multilateral space regime has lagged. The U.S. has blocked efforts at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to begin negotiations on a treaty to ban space weapons. China, meanwhile, has refused to accept anything less. Hence, intermediate measures such as voluntary confidence-building, space traffic control or a code of responsible conduct for spacefaring nations have remained stalled. Space warfare is not inevitable. But the recent policy shift in the U.S. and China’s provocative actions have highlighted the fact that the world is approaching a crossroads. Countries must come to grips with their strong self-interest in preventing the testing and use of orbital weapons. The nations of Earth must soon decide whether it is possible to sustain the predominantly peaceful human space exploration that has already lasted half a century. The likely alternative would be unacceptable to all.<br />

A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of 'peace through strength' deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that '… the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use'.33 This drift toward usage is strengthened by a strategic fact elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, 'anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand'.34  The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent 'dual capability' of spaceborne weapon components. As Marc Vidricaire, Delegation of Canada to the UN Conference on Disarmament, explains: 'If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land'. 35 To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting 'Death Stars', capable of sending munitions hurtling through the Earth's atmosphere.  The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense 'use or lose' pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting Death Stars with automated 'hair trigger' devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict.  Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed 'complexly interactive, tightly coupled' industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other's flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, '[t]he odd term &quot;normal accident&quot; is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable'.36 Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to 'normal accidents'.  It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, 'even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage — even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!'. 37 In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: 'One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people'.38 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.<br />

Krepon 2007 – Stimson Center [Co-founder and contributor 3/5, Michael, “Will the Bush Administration Endorse a Space Code of Conduct?”, Space News, http:www.stimson.org/pub.cfm?id=402, accessed June 21, 2011)<br />
<br />
Support is growing for a specific kind of multilateral space agreement that borrows heavily from the Bush administration’s own preferences. The mechanism in question is a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations that could either take the form of political compacts or executive agreements among like-minded states that wish to continue to enjoy the national security and economic benefits that satellites provide. Like the Bush administration’s Proliferation Security Initiative, a Code of Conduct for space could be designed by a core group of states to clarify responsible and irresponsible behavior. The core group might then invite any other spacefaring nation that wishes to abide by these high standards to join the group.  The European Union has now joined Canada in endorsing a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations. The commercial satellite industry also has expressed a strong interest in “rules of the road” for space. The Bush administration has further distanced itself from America’s friends and allies by continuing to insist that new multilateral agreements related to space are “unnecessary and counterproductive.” No other nation in the world has adopted such a negative stance. Saying “hell no” to new multilateral agreements for space seems particularly questionable after China’s irresponsible test of an anti-satellite (A-Sat) weapon that endangers spaceflight in low Earth orbit for decades to come. George Washington’s farewell address warned against indulging in “habitual hatred” resulting in a slavish animosity that leads the United States to “stray from its duty and interest.” Rejecting a Code of Conduct for space because it smacks of arms control would seem to violate Washington’s sound admonition. The Bush administration has not yet taken a position towards a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations. Because rules of the road for space make so much sense, and because the Bush administration has championed other codes of conduct to prevent proliferation, it might still join in the emerging consensus on this issue. The administration’s reasoning against new multilateral agreements for space boils down to five arguments, none of which applies to the Code of Conduct.  First, administration officials argue that there is no likelihood of an arms race in space, therefore, there is no need for new multilateral arrangements. It is true that an arms race is unlikely, since arms racing has now been replaced by asymmetric warfare. But an arms race is not needed to do lasting damage to space, as the Chinese A-Sat test demonstrated. We can now see clearly that it takes very few kinetic energy kill tests and A-Sat weapons to result in significant damage to low Earth orbit. New diplomatic initiatives are needed precisely because an arms race isn’t needed to prevent the peaceful uses of outer space. The second argument advanced by the Bush administration is that arms control is a vestige of the Cold War and not terribly relevant to contemporary security concerns. Again, there is partial truth in this argument, because classic arms control arrangements dealt with a superpower competition that ended with the demise of the Soviet Union.  What used to be known as arms control has now morphed into cooperative threat reduction agreements, including rules of the road clarifying responsible behavior. Semantic arguments aside, the administration has itself championed multilateral agreements in the form of codes of conduct to prevent proliferation, such as The Hague Code of Conduct, as well as the Proliferation Security Initiative. We do not have to argue over whether these codes of conduct constitute arms control to conclude that these creative arrangements were sensible initiatives.  A Code of Conduct for space also would be quite useful in making the Chinese kinetic-kill ASAT test the very last of its kind. If codes of conduct relating to missiles and exports make sense for preventing proliferation – and do not, in the Bush administration’s vocabulary, constitute arms control – then surely a code of conduct also makes sense for activities in space. After all, troubling activities in space also could prompt vertical and horizontal proliferation on the ground.  The third argument that the Bush administration advances against new diplomatic initiatives for space activity is that there can be no agreed to definition of what constitutes “space weapons.” Moreover, verification is extremely problematic. Consequently, no multilateral agreement can be negotiated barring such weapons.  The administration is correct in pointing to the difficulties in defining and verifying space weapons. A code of conduct, however, focuses on activities, not on definitions of what constitutes a space weapon. For example, one key element of a Code of Conduct would surely be that responsible spacefaring nations do not engage in activities that deliberately produce persistent space debris, such as the Chinese A-Sat test.  This key element makes it unnecessary to define space weapons, since actions, not definitions, lie at the core of a rules of the road approach. Verification of noncompliance with this key element is quite straightforward, since it is very hard to hide the deliberate generation of persistent space debris.  The fourth argument advanced by the Bush administration to oppose new diplomatic initiatives for space is that the United States must preserve its right to self-defense – including the right to defend space assets. This argument is certainly valid, but it doesn’t justify rejecting a Code of Conduct. With such a code, the United States still would possess more capabilities than ever before to deter and, if necessary, punish states that take actions against U.S. satellites. The right of self-defense, however, is more likely to be invoked, and will be more difficult to execute, if there are no agreed rules of the road for outer space.  Lastly, the Bush administration contends that new diplomatic initiatives are unwise because U.S. freedom of action in space must not be constrained. By this standard, the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Outer Space Treaty, President Ronald Reagan’s Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and President George H. W. Bush’s Strategic Arms Reduction treaties were all dreadful errors in judgment, since every one of these agreements limit the U.S. military’s freedom of action in some key respects. Using the Bush administration’s reasoning, the Geneva Conventions for U.S. armed forces also are unwise, as are codes of conduct long in place for the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and gravity-bound Air Force. If freedom of action were the topmost U.S. national security objective, we would ditch all of these treaties and codes of conduct. Of course, no responsible political leader or public official would consider doing this. So why should we use this standard to oppose new diplomatic initiatives in space?<br />

Reportedly, the Obama Administration is nearing or has reached a decision to agree to the European Union's Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities. The EU proposal is a series of statements designed to establish a normative framework defining responsible behavior in outer space. It includes calls for states to take actions to minimize the prospect of collisions on orbit, to avoid purposefully creating space debris, and to agree to registration requirements for space launches and satellite maneuvers. Questions persist about the need for such a document. For example, as we noted in 2007, many of these issues already are being addressed through multilateral and bilateral processes as space-faring nations have found a need for them. How the Code's requirements will constrain U.S. security also is frequently cited as a reason to critically and thoroughly examine the utility of the Code of Conduct and similar proposals. And the lack of enforcement and verification provisions have led many to conclude that the Code inevitably will give way to more robust forms of arms control. Still, the Code has useful attributes, too. The Code (or the discussions that take place about a Code) could help further clarify debris mitigation standards and mature manuever and traffic management standards by providing top-level diplomatic cover for the ongoing dialogues. <br />

The Aff’s vision of space as a realm to be controlled results in an extension of violence and militaristic domination—This turns the aff by encouraging the very anti-democratic wars they hope to prevent<br />

<br />
Two things should now be clear. First, outer space is no longer remote from our everyday lives; it is already profoundly implicated in the ordinary workings of economy and society. Second, the import of space to civilian, commercial and, in particular, military objectives, means there is a great deal at stake in terms of the access to and control over Earth’s orbit. One cannot overstate this last point. The next few years may prove decisive in terms of establishing a regime of space control that will have profound implications for terrestrial geopolitics. It is in this context that I want to briefly introduce the emerging field of astropolitics, defined as ‘the study of the relationship between outer space terrain and technology and the development of political and military policy and strategy’ (Dolman, 2002: 15). It is, in both theory and practice, a geopolitics of outer space. Everett Dolman is one of the pioneers of the ﬁeld. An ex-CIA intelligence analyst who teaches at the US Air Force’s School of Advanced Airpower Fraser MacDonald: Anti-Astropolitik outer space and the orbit of geography 607 Studies , he publishes in journals that are perhaps unfamiliar to critical geographers, like the modestly titled Small Wars and Insurgencies. As what follows is uniformly critical of Dolman’s work, I should say that his Astropolitik: classical geopolitics in the space age (Dolman, 2002) is unquestionably a signiﬁcant book: it has deﬁned a now vibrant field of research and debate. Astropolitik draws together a vast literature on space exploration and space policy, and presents a lucid and accessible introduction to thinking strategically about space. (In the previous section I drew heavily on Dolman’s description of the astropolitical environment.) My critique is not founded on scientiﬁc or technical grounds but on Dolman’s construction of a formal geopolitics designed to advance and legitimate the unilateral military conquest of space by the United States. While Dolman has many admirers among neoconservative colleagues in Washington think-tanks, critical engagements (eg, Moore, 2003; Caracciolo, 2004) have been relatively thin on the ground. Dolman’s work is interesting for our purposes here precisely because he draw’s on geography’s back catalogue of strategic thinkers, most prominently Halford Mackinder, whose ideas gained particular prominence in America in the wake of the Russian Sputnik (Hooson, 2004: 377). But Dolman is not just refashioning classical geopolitics in the new garb of ‘astropolitics’; he goes further and proposes an ‘Astropolitik ’ – ‘ a simple but effective blueprint for space control’ (p. 9) – modelled on Karl Hausofer’s Geopolitik as much as Realpolitik. Showing some discomfort with the impeccably fascist pedigree of this theory, Dolman cautions against the ‘misuse’ of Astropolitik and argues that the term ‘is chosen as a constant reminder of that past, and as a grim warning for the future’ (Dolman, 2002: 3). At the same time, however, his book is basically a manual for achieving space dominance. Projecting Mackinder’s famous thesis on the geographical pivot of history (Mackinder, 1904) onto outer space, Dolman argues that: ‘who controls the Lower Earth Orbit controls near-Earth space. Who controls near-Earth space dominates Terra [Earth]. Who dominates Terra determines the destiny of humankind.’ Dolman sees the quest for space as already having followed classically Mackinderian principles (Dolman, 2002: 87). Like Mackinder before him, Dolman is writing in the service of his empire. ‘Astropolitik like Realpolitik’ he writes, ‘is hardnosed and pragmatic, it is not pretty or uplifting or a joyous sermon for the masses. But neither is it evil. Its benevolence or malevolence become apparent only as it is applied, and by whom’ (Dolman, 2002: 4). Further inspiration is drawn from Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose classic volume The inﬂuence of seapower upon history, has been widely cited by space strategists (Mahan, 1890; Gray, 1996; see also Russell, 2006). Mahan’s discussion of the strategic value of coasts, harbours, well-worn sea paths and chokepoints has its parallel in outer space (see France, 2000). The implication of Mahan’s work, Dolman concludes, is that ‘the United States must be ready and prepared, in Mahanian scrutiny, to commit to the defense and maintenance of these assets, or relinquish them to a state willing and able to do so’ (Dolman, 2002: 37). The primary problem for those advancing Astropolitik is that space is not a lawless frontier. In fact the legal character of space has long been enshrined in the principles of the OST and this has, to some extent, prevented it from being subject to unbridled interstate competition. ‘While it is morally desirable to explore space in common with all peoples’, writes Dolman without conviction, ‘even the thought of doing so makes weary those who have the means’ (Dolman, 2002: 135). Thus, the veneer of transcendent humanism with regard to space gives way to brazen self-interest. Accordingly, Dolman describes the res communist consensus 7 of the OST as ‘a tragedy’ that has removed any legal incentive for the exploitation of space (p. 137). Only a res nullius 8 legal order could construct space as ‘proper objects for which states may compete’ (p. 138). Under the paradigm of res nullius and Astropolitik, the moon and 608 Progress in Human Geography 31(5) other celestial bodies would become potential new territory for states. Here Dolman again parallels Karl Hausofer’s Geopolitik. Just as Hausofer desired a break from the Versailles Treaty (Ó Tuathail, 1996: 45), Dolman wants to see the USA withdraw from the OST, making full speed ahead for the moon (see also Hickman and Dolman, 2002). Non-spacefaring developing countries need not worry about losing out, says Dolman, as they ‘would own no less of the Moon than they do now’ (2002: 140). To his credit, Dolman does give some attention to the divisive social consequences of this concentrated power. Drawing on earlier currents of environmental determinism and on the terrestrial model of Antarctic exploration, he ponders the characteristics of those who will be ﬁrst to colonize space. They will be ‘highly educated, rigorously trained and psychologically screened for mental toughness and decision-making skills, and very physically ﬁ t’; ‘the best and brightest of our pilots, technicians and scientists’; ‘rational, given to scientific analysis and explanation, and obsessed with their professions’ (p. 26). In other words, ‘they are a superior subset of the larger group from which they spring’ (p. 27). As if this picture is not vivid enough, Dolman goes on to say that colonizers of space ‘will be the most capably endowed (or at least the most ruthlessly suitable, as the populating of America and Australia … so aptly illustrate[s])’ (p. 27; my emphasis). ‘Duty and sacriﬁce will be the highest moral ideals’ (p. 27). Society, he continues, must be prepared ‘to make heroes’ of those who undertake the risk of exploration (p. 146). At the same time, ‘the astropolitical society must be prepared to forego expenditures on social programs … to channel funds into the national space program. It must be embued with the national spirit’ (p. 146). Dolman slips from presenting what would be merely a ‘logical’ outworking of Astropolitik to advocating that the United States adopt it as their space strategy. Along the way, he acknowledges the full anti-democratic potential of such concentrated power, detaching the state from its citizenry: the United States can adopt any policy it wishes and the attitudes and reactions of the domestic public and of other states can do little to challenge it. So powerful is the United States that should it accept the harsh Realpolitik doctrine in space that the military services appear to be proposing, and given a proper explanation for employing it, there may in fact be little if any opposition to a fait accompli of total US domination in space. (Dolman, 2002: 156) Although Dolman claims that ‘no attempt will be made to create a convincing argument that the United States has a right to domination in space’, in almost the next sentence he goes on to argue ‘that, in this case, might does make right’, ‘the persuasiveness of the case’ being ‘based on the self-interest of the state and stability of the system’ (2002: 156; my emphasis). Truly, this is Astropolitik: a veneration of the ineluctable logic of power and the permanent rightness of those who wield it. If it sounds chillingly familiar, Dolman hopes to reassure us with his belief that ‘the US form of liberal democracy … is admirable and socially encompassing’ (p. 156) and it is ‘the most benign state that has ever attempted hegemony over the greater part of the world’ (p. 158). His sunny view that the United States is ‘willing to extend legal and political equality to all’ sits awkwardly with the current suspension of the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay as well as in various other ‘spaces of exception’ (see Gregory, 2004; Agamben, 2005). <br />

Conclusion: (bare) life under empire of the future In his Astropolitik Dolman calls upon U.S. defense policy-makers to weaponize orbital space so as to enhance U.S. hegemony over the planet. He does not address the astropolitical issues we have discussed here about what impact a space-based hegemony would have on the structure of the international system. Dolman, however, is confident that America would be responsible in using this awesome power to promote democracy and global capitalism. Setting aside the very contentious issues of whether or not America should be involved in &quot;promoting&quot; democracy and capitalism and whether or not current U.S. hegemony has been beneficial for the Earth's population, the moral and political implications of a space-based empire are not nearly as clear-cut as Dolman makes them out to be. One of the fundamental principles of classical geopolitics was that sea-based empires (such as Athens, Britain, and America) tended to be more democratic than land-based empires (such as Sparta, China, and Rome). The reason for this is that sea-based empires needed to disperse their forces away from the imperial center to exert control, whereas land-based empires exercised power through occupation. Military occupations made it increasingly likely that the army would seize power whenever it came into conflict with the government. Classical geopolitical theorist Otto Hintze argued that land powers tended toward dictatorships (Hintze 1975; see also Deudney 2007). Dolman builds upon these classical geopolitical insights by arguing that because space-based empires would not be able to occupy states, military coups would be less likely and democracy would be more likely (Dolman 2002a: 29). There is, however, a significant difference between space power and sea power. While neither is capable of occupying territory on its own, space power is capable of controlling territory from above through surveillance and precise projection of force control without occupation. While space power may not result in the dictatorships normally associated with land power, it would be a useful tool is establishing a disciplinary society over all the Earth. A second obstacle to the benevolent space-based empire that Dolman imagines is the lack of counterbalancing powers. Under the two other modes of protection/security we have considered here -the real-statist and the federal-republican there are checks that prevent even the most powerful scates in the system from dominating all the other units. In real-statism, the sovereignty of states means that any potential hegemon would have to pay a significant cost in blood and treasure to conquer other states. While this cost may not be enough to dissuade a superpower from conquering one or two states, the cumulative cost of conquest and occupation makes total domination over the Earth unlikely. In the federal-republican model, the collective security regime of the entire system should act as a sufficient deterrent to prevent one state from dominating the others. Conversely, in a space-based empire the entire world is placed under direct surveillance from above. There is no point on Earth where the imperial center cannot project force on very short notice. So long as the space-based empire can deny access to space to rival powers through missile defense and anti-satellite technologies, there is no possibility that other states can directly counteract this force. As such, the space-based empire erases all boundaries and places the Earth under its control. While the possibility to resist such an empire will exist, the dynamics of resistance will be considerably altered. Traditional insurgencies rely on physical occupation of territory by the conquering forces to provide targets of opportunity to the resistance. Because space weapons would orbit several hundred to several thousands of miles above the Earth, they would not be vulnerable to attack by anything except weapons systems possessed by the most advanced space powers, such as ballistic missiles and advanced laser systems. Even such counter-measures, however, would only raise the financial cost of space-based empire, not the COSt in human lives that insurgencies rely upon to diminish domestic support ti)f imperial occupations. Consequently a space-based empire would be freer to dominate the Earth from above than a traditional land-power occupation would be. Without obvious counterpowers or effective means of resistance, the space-based empire would be able to exercise complete bio-political control over the entire planet, turning all of Earth's inhabitants into &quot;bare life,&quot; Under such a political arrangement the likelihood that the imperial center would be a benevolent one, uncorrupted by its total domination of the Earth, is very slim indeed.<br />

Our alternative is to reject the affirmative and their representations of space as a place to be securitized and controlled. Our representation strategy matters and works—images of space as a site for control justifies and makes more likely the wars they hope to prevent<br />

Grondin, 06 David Grondin Assistant Professor, School of Political Studies, University of Ottawa (as of July 2006)   Paper presented at the ISA Convention, San Diego  March 25, 2006  Panel “Reading Outer Space I:  The International Politics of Outer Space - Approaches and Themes” THE (POWER) POLITICS OF SPACE:  THE US ASTROPOLITICAL DISCOURSE OF GLOBAL DOMINANCE  IN THE WAR ON TERROR<br />
<br />
Indeed, we have no way of knowing how other state leaders and non-state agents will react to US spatial policy and to a path of weaponization. The security dilemma or a new global arms race in space remain social constructions and are not automatic responses to a course of action taken by the US state. Will it be like Roger Handberg fears: that the “[w]eaponization of space is the signal for the next arms race, one that may start slow but inevitably will speed up as other states reject the US claim to permanent dominance?” (Handberg 2004: 88) Indeed, Handberg makes lots of sense to me when he asserts that a healthy skepticism must be exercised when drastic changes in existing policy positions are considered, especially policies which have not yet failed. Too often, in American defense debates, technology trumps ‘mere politics’ with often-unanticipated consequences. The security dilemma is not just an obscure academic concept but one that reflects real possibilities in terms of outcomes. […] There is an irony in that the analyses assume, especially since the advent of the George W. Bush administration, that such military space activities, including weaponization, will be approved. Approval may come but resources may not, given the administration’s penchant for tax cuts. Sustaining a level of resource commitment necessary to maintain the force levels assumed here is questionable in the absence of an explicit and very visible threat (Handberg 2004: 88). Or will it rather be like the space warriors expect, Dolman and Lambakis especially, that there is an opportunity to be grasped by the US that will make other actors of the global arena accept an American dominance in space? In my mind, such view is to be resisted at all costs. In fact, one must be aware that behind all the rhetoric for space weaponization and the “threat game”, other power considerations still pull much weight – and the spectre of a Cold War military-industrial complex is still very much alive. As Lambakis bluntly puts it: “Although it still must guard against the transfer of critical military technologies, capitalism ought to be set loose to advance the development of satellite technologies and services (including imagery services), which would allow US industry to play its strength – technological innovation and application – which in turn would provide the United States significant technologies advantages in the years ahead” (Lambakis 2001: 281; original emphasis). Freedom of Space, Space control, and the Technological As space is conceived as a common medium, the principle of the freedom of space lasts as long as there is no will to take a step further – which is what space warriors recommend. As they acknowledge, many reasons may motivate a state to develop “capabilities to control, if not dominate or claim ownership over, space orbits” (Lambakis 2001: 86; original emphasis). This line of argument is usually linked to technological capacities. By asserting that other countries operate in Space, that conflicts are “natural” between humans – which brings the obvious “so why would it be different in Space” – technologies of power take the lead and one is left with devising what space-control strategy will be best and what one wants “to control, for how long, and for what purposes?/ (Lambakis 2001: 281). And in a context where one portrays the situation as one where US aerospace industry is held back by the rest of the world only for fear of potential not guaranteed conflicts that will evolve into Space warfighting because of a renewed arms race (Lambakis 2001: 282), the claim to let technology drive the policy and the political is not disinterested – albeit ill-advised – and definitely not a sure bet. For space warriors such as Dolmnan and Lambakis, space weaponization then appears not to be all related to the security issue but also very much to the maintenance of a strong defense and aerospace industry. The technological takes over as the political is eclipsed by the military professionals. In effect, for space warriors, because of national security, “if a determination is made that space weapons would improve national security, further analysis would be required to map out a path to take to introduce these tools in the arsenal and military strategy and a time line from which to plan” (Lambakis 2001: 282). Contrary to US astropolitical analysts, I find myself at fault with the logic of national security and securitization of space that drives US governmentality, especially with regard to Outer Space. I do not believe that arms control is given a fair trial by its opponents or even by some of its main defenders in US astropolitical discourse. For me, the security game is what seems so scary; and if we consider the one assumption of an astropolitical argument such as that of Lambakis that because of the 9/11 context, “one thing is certain – we will not be able to bludgeon our enemies into cooperation. For those times, the United States needs to have in place more assertive means and doctrines to counter hostiles activities in space” (Lambakis 2001: 282; my emphasis). When people are certain and need enemies to develop one strategy, then maybe some questions have not been raised. There are “unknowns” and we cannot be sure of how the events will unfold if the US goes further along a path to space weaponization. In any case, it gets even more problematic when security is trumped with technology for there is no way – so it seems – to argue against the desire of global (read absolute) security, especially when it comes from the strongest of power. You are brought back to the realities of the global homeland security state. One is doomed to either accept the logic of terror – that inexorably goes with the logic of global security – or reject it. I choose the latter. CONCLUSION: THE SECURITIZATION AND AMERICANIZATION OF SPACE This paper allowed me to address how the frontiers of the US are redefined by the War on Terror as it relates to the US strategic thinking on Outer Space. What conditions of possibility does 9/11 bring for US astropolitical discourse that were not already there? This inquiry leads me directly to reconsider the securitization and reterritorialization project of the “last frontier”, that is the attempt to secure Outer Space as an American space. It is important to rethink the push for space weaponization and its politics in light of the context of the US Global War on Terror (GWOT), which produced a new security thinking towards the “homeland” – a homeland strategy of security, a military doctrine of pre- emption/prevention and a reterritorialization of American frontiers and global power. Outer Space concerns, apparently, “the outer frontiers of national security policy, where technology and grand strategy meet” (Krepon 2003). Within the context of the War on Terror, where US strategic discourse sees a global terrorist threat as being ever possible, it seems that there can be no exception for Space. It is even done preventively as a secured space while Others do not exist yet in Space (in fact, they do, with the International Space Station; but that’s another story…). In this spatial inscription of securitization of the American identity in Space, the frontiers of the homeland are made global and are secured through a representation of dangers (with the exception of debris in Space which they do not categorize as “dangers”). This familiar approach to territory and space is inscribed in the identity politics of the US, a moral practice based on spatial exclusion of Others deemed threatening to secure the American Self (Campbell 1998 [1992]; Shapiro 1999). By focusing on the Rumsfeld 2001 Space Commission for the Management of Space in the national security strategy, one sees the application of the same reading that would later come with the War on Terror. To that effect, a terrorist group or rogue state might try to hinder US spatial assets or those of its allies on which the US depends militarily and economically. In its 2004 National Military Stragegy, the US thus reaffirmed with force its will to constitute a global information grid and achieve a full spectrum-dominance in military matters. The US therefore wants to prevent any threat in Outer Space and protect its spatial activities and that of its allies. Informed by the events of 9/11, space warriors, such as Dolman or Lambakis, criticize opponents of a US policy for space weaponization as being stuck in a Cold War mindset. They believe a strategy of pre-emption and a resolve not to wait for the next “Pearl Harbor”, whether in space, on Earth or in the cyberspace is necessary and that the US must really be prepared to defend its (global) homeland: “How else can one explain [a] statement [such as] ‘as long as we remain vulnerable and so accessible to our adversaries, their incentives to attack us in space are likely to remain quite low’? In the post-September 11 world, events have underscored that weakness entices those who would do us harms and vulnerability provokes those who hate us. We need fresh thinking” (Lambakis 2003: 118). Space was seen as a sanctuary during the Cold War. But because of the context of the War on Terror, the US now seems to be ready to go against the second Article of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 that stipulates that “Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, orby any other means”, the treaty which set out the principle that Space is to be used for “the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind” (Article 1). In effect, since 2001, the US wished to be the one responsible for setting new rules in Outer Space and for creating the conditions of its military dominance of Space. For instance, the merger of the US Space Command with the Strategic Command in January 2004 stems from this logic that wishes Space operations to be integrated in all domains of US military power. Because the US still possesses control over much of the information gathering in Space, it is interested in securitizing and Americanizing the “last frontier”, especially in the context of the War on Terror. As it stands, the US neoliberal geopolitics discourse of the Bush Administration on Space power still leads to Space weaponization. US sovereignty is placed as higher than any other forms of rule and the US prepares itself militarily, just in case Outer Space would turn into a battlefield. In Donald Rumsfeld’s words: “Our goal is not to bring war into space, but rather to defend against those who would” (Rumsfeld, quoted in Waldrop 2005 [2002]: 39). This participates in the discourse of a global security state that sees Outer Space as the most “global” of space. “Insofar as the weaponization of space represents the ‘cutting edge’ and highest ambitions of military primacy, it also represents the height of this folly” (Huntley 2005: 83). If we consider that political rhetoric creates political reality that may serve as bases for decisions, it appears fundamental to assess how the US wishes to securitize Outer Space with its will to achieve full-spectrum dominance in all battlespaces, as stated in the 2004 and 1997 National Military Strategies. Deeply anchored in the War on Terror cartography, where 9/11 serves as the ultimate justification since “one must prepare militarily for the worst since the worst has happened” (or so it goes), the US places itself in a state of insecurity by saying that even if no one may inflict them casualty in Space, nothing can guarantee that it will not happen in the future. This is why they prefer to try this likelihood and securitize Outer Space as part of the homeland security strategy. The paradox of the securitization and Americanization of Outer Space is that it could lead to its very opposite by allowing space weaponization to still be possible, if not inevitable.<br />

NO SOLVENCY – SPACE ELEVATOR IS A PRIME ENEMY TARGET, AND AN ICBM IS UNSTOPPABLE<br />
<br />
BRYAN LAUBSCHER, JUNE 28, 2004, RESEARCHER AT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORIES, PH.D IN PHYSICS FROM UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO, HTTP://LIBRARY.LANL.GOV/CGI-BIN/GETFILE?00995649.PDF<br />
Introduction The Space Elevator (SE) represents a major paradigm shift in space access. If the SE’s promise of low-cost access is to be realized, everything becomes economically more feasible to accomplish in space. In this paper we describe a defensive system of the SE. The primary scenario adopted for this analysis is the SE based on a floating platform in the ocean along the equator. A second possible scenario is the SE stationed on land (island or continent) on or near the equator. The SE will capture the imaginations of people around the world. It will become a symbol of power, capability, wealth and prestige for the country that builds it. As such, it will become a prime terrorist target. Moreover, the tremendous economic leverage afforded by the SE might motivate rogue nations to plot its destruction. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the requirements for defense of the SE. For the purposes of this paper it is assumed that the SE is to be deployed by the United States or one of its companies, and the resources of the US are available for its defense. Worst Case Scenario Although it is currently beyond the capabilities of terrorists and rogue nations, a nuclear strike on the SE platform with an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) would represent an attack from space unstoppable with current technology. The only issue with it is effective targeting. Since the platform will be routinely move kilometers on the ocean to m i s s space debris and satellites, the terrorists must have knowledge of the platform’s position before launch. This could be obtained from surveillance satellites (if terrorists or rogue nations possess them) or potentially from commercial satellite imagery. The latency of such information could be on the order of one hour. Therefore, the SE platform could have maneuvered for an hour before the ICBM is launched, assuming a nominal flight time of 20 minutes means that a total time of eighty minutes may have elapsed between detection and detonation. The SE platform could be up to 10 or so kilometers away from the impact point. Depending on the yield and the type of burst, the platform and its SE could survive. If a spy, with a GPS and a satellite phone, is on the platform and is willing to give up his life for the success of the attack, then the information latency is only the ICBM flight time. <br />

Star Inc. president Jerome Pearson was one of the early pioneers of space elevators; in 1975, Pearson wrote a paper on the subject that inspired Arthur C. Clarke’s description of a space elevator in his popular science fiction book The Fountains of Paradise. Consisting of a long cable of nanomaterials, a space elevator would stretch from Earth to a point in geostationary orbit about 22,000 miles above the surface, carrying people and objects into space on its shuttles. However, one of the biggest obstacles to building a space elevator is space debris: defunct satellites, fragments of rockets, and any unused object originally built and launched by humans that is no longer used. At the conference two years ago, former NASA scientist Ivan Bekey pointed out that, if a space elevator were built, every single piece of space debris would eventually collide with the elevator cables at some point. <br />

Turn – Space elevators increase launches<br />

Since the dawn of the Space Age, people and hardware have thundered into orbit, shoved skyward by barely controlled explosions. Now, a loosely connected group of scientists and engineers hopes to make a launch as easy - and nearly as gentle - as pushing the &quot;penthouse&quot; button on an elevator.  To proponents, space elevators promise to slash the cost of sending cargo and people into space. And, they say, elevators would eliminate the costly need to overengineer satellites and other payloads to survive the rigors of a launch.  And where once even supporters held that space elevators were decades away, some scientists and engineers suggest that the first elevator could be running in 15 years. That bold prediction involves two big assumptions, they acknowledge. First, new materials currently in the laboratory will live up to their potential; second, potential environmental and political hurdles will be overcome  <br />

<br />
Basing weapons in orbit also pre­sents difficult technical obstacles. They would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all kinds of outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic signals, even natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against such threats would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is bulky and adds mass, thereby greatly increasing launch costs. Orbital weapons would be mostly autonomous mechanisms, which would make operational errors and failures likely. The paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to predict, which would make hiding large weapons problematic. And because satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many weapons.<br />

Massive ozone loss now<br />

The ozone layer that shields us from the sun's harmful rays has depleted by a record 40 percent over the Arctic, experts have said. The long, cold winter and lingering CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) in the atmosphere have resulted in its 40 percent plunge, they said. The record loss has caused alarm because it allows more harmful ultraviolet (UV) light to reach the Earth's surface, raising the odds of sunburn, skin cancer and eye damage, Daily Mail reported on its website Wednesday, citing experts. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Wednesday revealed that ozone column loss had reached 40 percent this spring. A WMO spokesperson said: 'Depletion of the ozone has reached an unprecedented level over the Arctic this spring because of the continuing presence of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere and a very cold winter in the stratosphere. 'If the ozone depleted area moves away from the pole and towards lower latitudes one can expect increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation as compared to the normal for the season. 'Some crops and forms of marine life can also suffer adverse effects.' The highest ozone loss previously recorded over the Arctic was about 30 percent and occurred in several seasons over the past 15 years, the WMO said. Any increase in UV radiation over lower latitudes away from the Arctic could affect parts of Canada, the Nordic countries, Russia and Alaska in the US. UV-B rays have been linked to skin cancer, cataracts and damage to the human immune system. The record ozone loss over the Arctic comes despite the 'very successful' Montreal Protocol aimed at cutting production and consumption of ozone-destroying chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, the Mail reported. The substances were once present in refrigerators, spray cans and fire extinguishers, but have been phased out.<br />

No threat to Hegemony – US forces can function without space assets<br />

Third, we need to make our space systems more resilient, and our combat power less reliant on their full functioning. This will help deny adversaries the benefit from an attack in space. Just as in the cyber domain, denying the benefit of attack in space can join retaliatory deterrence as a disincentive to adversaries. To maintain our combat power, we are learning how to operate in a degraded information environment. Training exercises where we disrupt space-based capabilities help our forces become proficient at operating with interference. To improve resiliency, we are developing technology to help us mitigate the loss or degradation of on-orbit systems. For instance, we now have ground, air, and naval-based platforms which can increasingly augment or replace space assets. The U.S. military is one of the few militaries today with the capability to operate in all domains on a global basis, and this ability provides a strategic advantage when space capabilities come under threat. Responsive space capabilities which rapidly launch replacements can also play an important role in reconstituting functionality either during or after an attack. And broader partnerships with commercial firms which enable national security payloads to ride on commercial satellites will further improve our resiliency. Hosting military payloads on commercial spacecraft, as we are already doing with a missile warning sensor, is not only cost-effective, it also enables a more diverse, robust, and distributed set of space systems. Finally, the United States views free access to space as a vital national interest. Consistent with our inherent right of self-defense, we will respond accordingly to attacks on it, at a time and place of our choosing and not necessarily in space. Ultimately, deterrence must impact the decision-making of particular countries and leaders in specific scenarios. A multilayered approach to deterrence offers the greatest likelihood of encouraging restraint, and thereby protecting our vital space capabilities from attack.<br />

Most in Washington still embraces the notion that America is, and forever will be, the world’s indispensable nation. Some scholars, however, questioned the logic of hegemonic stability theory from the very beginning. A number continue to do so today. They advance arguments diametrically at odds with the primacist consensus. Trade routes need not be policed by a single dominant power; the international economy is complex and resilient. Supply disruptions are likely to be temporary, and the costs of mitigating their effects should be borne by those who stand to lose — or gain — the most. Islamic extremists are scary, but hardly comparable to the threat posed by a globe-straddling Soviet Union armed with thousands of nuclear weapons. It is frankly absurd that we spend more today to fight Osama bin Laden and his tiny band of murderous thugs than we spent to face down Joseph Stalin and Chairman Mao. Many factors have contributed to the dramatic decline in the number of wars between nation-states; it is unrealistic to expect that a new spasm of global conflict would erupt if the United States were to modestly refocus its efforts, draw down its military power, and call on other countries to play a larger role in their own defense, and in the security of their respective regions. But while there are credible alternatives to the United States serving in its current dual role as world policeman / armed social worker, the foreign policy establishment in Washington has no interest in exploring them. The people here have grown accustomed to living at the center of the earth, and indeed, of the universe. The tangible benefits of all this military spending flow disproportionately to this tiny corner of the United States while the schlubs in fly-over country pick up the tab.<br />

VAN ALLEN RADIATION MAKES TRANSPORTING PEOPLE AND EQUIPMENT UP A SPACE ELEVATOR IMPOSSIBLE<br />
<br />
JORGENSEN ET AL, 2006, B.S. PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY, PH.D. ASTRONOMY, ACTA ASTRONAUTICA, “PASSIVE RADIATION SHIELDING CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE PROPOSED SPACE ELEVATOR”, 60 (2007) 198 – 209, A PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL<br />
 The Earth’s natural van Allen radiation belts present a serious hazard to space travel in general, and to travel on the space elevator in particular. The average radiation level is sufficiently high that it can cause radiation sickness, and perhaps death, for humans spending more than a brief period of time in the belts without shielding. The exact dose and the level of the related hazard depends on the type or radiation, the intensity of the radiation, the length of exposure, and on any shielding introduced. For the space elevator the radiation concern is particularly critical since it passes through the most intense regions of the radiation belts. The only humans who have ever traveled through the radiation belts have been the Apollo astronauts. They received radiation doses up to approximately 1 rem over a time interval less than an hour. A vehicle climbing the space elevator travels approximately 200 times slower than the moon rockets did, which would result in an extremely high dose up to approximately 200 rem under similar conditions, in a timespan of a few days. Technological systems on the space elevator, which spend prolonged periods of time in the radiation belts, may also be affected by the high radiation levels. In this paper we will give an overview of the radiation belts in terms relevant to space elevator studies. We will then compute the expected radiation doses, and evaluate the required level of shielding. We concentrate on passive shielding using aluminum, but also look briefly at active shielding using magnetic fields. We also look at the effect of moving the space elevator anchor point and increasing the speed of the climber. Each of these mitigation mechanisms will result in a performance decrease, cost increase, and technical complications for the space elevator. © 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd. <br />

CAN’T DEFEND THE ELEVATOR - SEA IS TOO HARD TO DEFEND<br />
<br />
BRYAN LAUBSCHER, JUNE 28, 2004, RESEARCHER AT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORIES, PH.D IN PHYSICS FROM UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO, HTTP://LIBRARY.LANL.GOV/CGI-BIN/GETFILE?00995649.PDF<br />
Air and Sea Defense Perimeters The stationing of the SE in the ocean isolates it physically from ground-based attacks. This rules out the types of attacks that terrorist groups use most often, albeit not their most spectacular or successful. Two types of attacks are left, seaborne attacks on or below the water, and air attacks. Thus the technical requirements that led to the location of the SE on the equator and out in the ocean also determines the security considerations. This choice points to the US Navy as the obvious force to defend the SE. defense perimeter to be defined and enforced around the nominal position of the SE platform. This perimeter would be patrolled by ships and aircraft. A ship wandering into the secure area would be challenged and possibly boarded. Aircraft straying into the area would be intercepted and, if not persuaded to exit the area, shot down. The air defense perimeter might be of differing size than the sea defense perimeter. The radius of this circular air defense perimeter would need to be hundreds of kilometers. A commercial jet liner covers 100 kilometers in about 7 minutes. In order to have a reasonable response time a “no fly zone” defense perimeter would need to be very large indeed: the larger the area, the more difficult to properly patrol and secure. At sea, radar has a horizon based upon the height of the transmitter above the water surface. Beyond that horizon, aircraft can approach at low altitude and not be detected until that horizon is crossed. Beyond the practical difficulties of securing and enforcing such a large airspace, there are certain to be international legal issues with “staking out” such a large area of the sky over the ocean. The Sea perimeter size would be set to keep hostile ships at bay. Deck guns of large ships have a maximum range of about 40 kilometers. Also, patrol ships must have the time to intercept ships encroaching on the defense perimeter. A 100 kilometer radius may be reasonable but is a large amount of ocean to defend. As with an air perimeter, international, legal issues need to be considered. The undersea perimeter is even more problematic. Submarines could attack the platform in multiple ways. Sonar ranges are much smaller than radar ranges, so an undersea defense perimeter would be much smaller and centered on the SE platform itself. A reasonable estimate for the undersea sonar perimeter is about 10 kilometers. <br />

A. Interpretation - Exploration means to expand human presence to space<br />
<br />
Logsdon, 9 – professor of political science at George Washington, former director of the Space Policy Institute (John, “Fifty Years of Human Spaceflight Why Is There Still a Controversy?,”  <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11060:http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11060 -->)<br />
<br />
Exploration as a Compelling Rationale Many believe that the only sustainable rationale for a government-funded program of human spaceflight is to take the lead in exploring the solar system beyond low Earth orbit.20 The MIT white paper provides an insightful definition of exploration: Exploration is a human activity, undertaken by certain cultures at certain times for particular reasons. It has components of national interest, scientific research, and technical innovation, but is defined by none of them. We define exploration as an expansion of the realm of human experience, bringing people into new places, situations, and environments, expanding and redefining what it means to be human. What is the role of Earth in human life? Is human life fundamentally tied to the earth, or could it survive without the planet? Human presence, and its attendant risk, turns a spaceflight into a story that is compelling to large numbers of people. Exploration also has a moral dimension because it is in effect a cultural conversation on the nature and meaning of human life. Exploration by this definition can only be accomplished by direct human presence and may be deemed worthy of the risk of human life.21 In the wake of the 2003 Columbia accident that took the lives of seven astronauts and the report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board that criticized the absence of a compelling mission for human spaceflight as “a failure of national leadership,”22 the United States, in January 2004, adopted a new policy to guide its human spaceflight activities. The policy directed NASA to “implement a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond” and to “extend human presence across the solar system, starting with a human return to the Moon by the year 2020, in preparation for human exploration of Mars and other destinations.”23 This policy seems totally consistent with the definition of exploration provided in the MIT white paper. The issue is whether such a policy and its implementation, focusing on human exploration beyond Earth orbit, can provide an adequate and sustainable justification for a continuing program of government-sponsored spaceflight that will make contributions that will outweigh the costs and risks involved to the “primary objectives” of national pride and prestige, and also to some of the several “secondary objectives.”<br />

The rate of asteroid discoveries shows an exponential growth. After astronomer Guiseppe Piazzi of Palermo, Sicily, discovered the ﬁrst asteroid on January 1, 1801, the number of new ﬁnds per year increased to ﬁve by 1865, 15 per year by 1895, 25 by 1910 and up to about 40 by 1930. By the end of September of 2007, the number of numbered asteroids was more than 160,000 including about 800 Potential Hazardous Asteroids (PHA). (see <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11061:http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/" rel="nofollow">http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11061 -->) According to NASA’s report (NASA 2007), the further objectives of NEO Survey Program are to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of NEO equal to or larger than 140 meters in diameter with a perihelion distance of less than 1.3 AU from the Sun, achieving 90% completion of the survey within 15 years after enactment of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005. Chinese scientists have contributed substantially to the ﬁeld of asteroid survey and related aspects. In the early 1960s, Purple Mountain Observatory began observations of asteroids and found over 130 new numbered asteroids during the following decades. The Schmidt CCD Asteroid Program (SCAP) of Beijing Astronomical Observatory started in 1995 and found 575 asteroids in several years (Ma, Zhao &amp; Yao 2007). <br />

Coming at the problem from the same direction as Romney, the Senate this week passed a bill to impose higher taxes on imports on China if the government fails to allow the yuan to rise in value faster. The bill is unlikely to pass the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders oppose it. And, as Huntsman noted, the Chinese could easily retaliate with penalties against American goods aided by the Federal Reserve's pumping of hundreds of billions of dollars into the U.S. economy. The Obama and Bush administrations have approached China more carefully, targeting with higher import taxes those Chinese goods they felt were selling at artificially low prices while negotiating with Beijing for a fairer currency exchange rate. Despite limited success, they've avoided a blanket punishment of all Chinese goods and any breakdown in relations that would surely make it harder for American products to reach China's booming internal market.<br />

When a scientist expresses probabilistic concerns about the impending doom of our planet from a cataclysmic change of a major impact event, say, in the next 100, 1,000, or 10,000 years, it requires just too much risk of political capital and tax-payer dollars to divert significant budget resources to something that might only be a concern for our uber-great grandchildren. “Earth Impact Effects Program: A Web-based computer program for calculating the regional environmental consequences of a meteoroid impact on Earth” [PDF] Gareth S.

Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Charles Schumer aldso have signaled plans to push for a vote on legislation to pressure China to revalue its currency in conjunction with the free trade pacts. That would inflame relations with Beijing and possibly trigger tit-for-tat trade retaliation if Obama does not expend political capital to block it. The early start of the 2012 U.S. election campaigns, however, may dampen Obama's appetite to lead aggressively on trade. But &quot;if the administration spends the effort and actually finishes the job (the trade deals) with Congress, that will send a very positive signal,&quot; said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.<br />

<br />
There are two common options in government policies to curb trade imbalances: adjusting the exchange rate or turning to protectionism. The past two years have seen China falling victim to U.S. protectionist measures adopted in the wake of the global financial crisis. The motives for the mounting pressure on China over the yuan have been widely questioned, even in the United States. As the U.S. mid-term elections approach, the political clamoring will expectedly turn increasingly shrill. Many wonder if the lawmakers are really speaking against China for the benefit of Americans or only out of their selfish desire to please their constituents and gain more votes ahead of the coming elections. A common view is that, to some extent, the lawmakers are looking to improve their public image in an effort to pocket more political capital. On Tuesday, 36 U.S. farm and business groups, including the U.S.-China Business Council, the American Soybean Association and the American Meat Institute, urged the Congress not to pass any legislation threatening China with new duties if Beijing does not revalue the yuan. &quot;Estimations of the correct currency value would be inherently subjective, unilateral and potentially politicized since there is no agreed upon method to determine what a country's exchange rate should be in the absence of a market-based determination,&quot; the groups said. Another reason to question the lawmakers' motives is based on the credibility of the data they cite in accusing Beijing of undervaluing the yuan by 24 percent to as much as 40 percent. The figures the lawmakers cite were drawn from previous IMF predictions that China's current account would represent 8 percent of its gross domestic product by 2015. Based on that prediction, the Chinese yuan needs to appreciate 24.2 percent to achieve the current account/GDP target ratio of 3 percent. Please forget the predictions that always vary widely from what happens in reality. China's real current account represented 6 percent of its yearly GDP in 2009, a figure that means the yuan needs only to appreciate 10 percent to reach the target ratio of 3 percent. The true situation this year shows China does not need to revalue the yuan at all, considering China's decreased trade surplus during the past nine months and a likely drop in its current account/GDP ratio to below 4 percent. At the same time, many people worry that the yuan issue could spark a trade war between the world's two largest economies and trigger a spate of protectionism that might endanger the fragile global economic recovery. Past experience shows that global peace and prosperity is impossible without China's participation, and as the world's biggest developing country, China cannot develop itself without the help of other countries. Therefore, the U.S. should rein in those congressmen yapping for Beijing to revalue the yuan and join hands with China to build a positive, cooperative and comprehensive relationship for the 21st century.<br />

Spicer, Olin Foundation, 96 (The Challenge from the East and the Rebirth of the West, p. 121)<br />
<br />
The choice facing the West today is much the same as that which faced the Soviet bloc after World War II: between meeting head-on the challenge of world trade with the adjustments and the benefits that it will bring, or of attempting to shut out markets that are growing and where a dynamic new pace is being set for innovative production. The problem about the second approach is not simply that it won’t hold: satellite technology alone will ensure that consumers will begin to demand those goods that the East is able to provide most cheaply. More fundamentally, it will guarantee the emergence of a fragmented world in which natural fears will be fanned and inflamed. A world divided into rigid trade blocs will be a deeply troubled and unstable place in which suspicion and ultimately envy will possibly erupt into a major war. I do not say that the converse will necessarily be true, that in a free trading world there will be an absence of all strife. Such a proposition would manifestly be absurd. But to trade is to become interdependent, and that is a good stop in the direction of world stability. With nuclear weapons at two a penny, stability will be at a premium in the years ahead. <br />

The aff’s narrative of technological salvation from the rock guarantees unchecked space militarization<br />

Since the late 1980s, a small group of astronomers and planetary scientists has repeatedly warned of the threat of an asteroid impacting with Earth and causing global destruction. They foretell a large impact causing global fires, the failure of the world’s agriculture and the end of human civilization. But, these scientists assure us, we live at a unique moment in history when we have the technological means to avert disaster. They call for support for dedicated astronomical surveys of near-Earth objects to provide early warning of an impactor and they have regularly met with defence scientists to discuss new technologies to deflect any incoming asteroids. The scientists who have promoted the asteroid impact threat have done so by invoking narratives of technological salvation – stories which, like the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), promise security through a superweapon in space. The asteroid impact threat can therefore be located within the broader cultural history of fantasies about security and power, which, Bruce Franklin (1988) has argued, is inextricably linked to the century-old idea that a new superweapon could deliver world peace. Howard McCurdy (1997: 78–82), in his study of the ways in which the US space programme was shaped by popular culture, has suggested that the promotion of the impact threat can be seen as the completion of Cold War fantasies, which had used a politics of fear to justify space exploration. McCurdy highlights the alignment between the promotion of the impact threat and works of fiction. In this paper, I consider the reconceptualization of asteroid science that this alignment entailed. It is beyond the scope of this paper to give a complete history of the science of planetary impacts. My focus is on how a group of scientists moved from seeing impacts as significant events in Earth history to seeing them as threatening events in the human future – a move from historical to futurological narratives. Nor is there space to give a full account of the empirical developments that were used to support the construal of asteroids as a threat. Rather, I wish to make the case that these empirical developments were given meaning within a specific narrative context which drew civilian astronomers into contact with defence scientists, especially those working on SDI. A number of studies (for example, McDougall, 1985; Forman, 1987; Kevles, 1990; DeVorkin, 1992; Leslie, 1993; Dennis, 1994) have revealed the ways in which US research programmes and nominally-civilian scientific institutions originated in military programmes.1 One aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the boundary between civilian and military science is blurred not just institutionally, but also at a fundamental conceptual level. The civilian scientists discussed here followed different working practices and traded in different forms of expertise than did the defence scientists. They were typically astronomers or planetary scientists who worked for NASA or on NASA-funded research programmes at universities and private institutes. They saw themselves as distinct from the defence scientists who were typically physicists and engineers working on new weapons systems or other technologies of national security at the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories or at armed services institutions. 2 Yet the two groups came to share an interest in asteroids and with that a set of assumptions about the nature of human society, the role of technology and our place in outer space. As they came into contact, their differing backgrounds meant they disagreed over a number of issues, yet both sides pursued the collaboration despite the tensions. Many studies of the interaction between military and civilian science have focused on sources of funding and shared technologies.3 Important as these are, they fail to capture fully the dynamic between the two communities. In particular, a cynical picture of scientists simply pursuing sources of funding on any terms cannot reveal the far-reaching ways in which civilian research can become entrenched in particular patterns of thinking which are supportive of militaristic programmes. For military/civilian collaborations to be sustained, civilian scientists need to share with their counterparts in the defence sector an understanding of the overall trajectory of their research. For shared technologies to be developed, they need first to be imagined. Military/civilian interactions are therefore predicated on, and mediated through, a shared technoscientific imaginary. Despite expressing concerns about the motives and methods of the weapons scientists, the civilian scientists who promoted the asteroid impact threat drew on narratives that configured a human role in space in a similar way to SDI. These narratives helped make asteroids conceivable as a threat, yet they also served to make acceptable, and even necessary, the idea of space-based weaponry. Despite their disagreements, at the level of their shared narratives the discourses of the civilian and defence scientists were mutually supportive.<br />

Space weapons establish the U.S. as global sovereign, rendering all life bare<br />
<br />

<br />
This scenario is fascinating for the political logic at work within it—space weapons are required to launch an attack at an otherwise inaccessible target. The three reasons that the target might be inaccessible all have to do with potential gaps in imperial power. Either the defenses of the target country have not been suppressed, or other states have not consented to let the forces fly through their airspace, or other coalition members—presumably in NATO or the UN—have not consented to the action. The first “justification” for the use of the weapon involves clear erasure of the sovereignty of the targeted state, as it eliminates any pretense of that country’s defensibility. The second and third “justifications” diminish, by circumvention, the sovereignty of other states. All three buttress the exclusive capacity of the U.S. to act unilaterally in deciding the exception globally. In all three cases, the only practical use for this weapon is in an imperial project! The chief advantage of space weapons is their ability on very short notice to attack a target that is out of reach of conventional forces. What places these targets “out of reach” is the sovereignty of other states as exercised through those states’ abilities to defend their territory, control their airspace, and/or participate (jointly) in authorized decision of the (global) exception. The constitutive effect of these weapons, then, is to strip states of their sovereignty—they are constituted as subjects lacking authorization of decision, and lacking boundary effectively demarcating inside from outside. What modern sovereignty does (as identified in section I. above) is taken from them. Furthermore, given the potential targets that these weapons could destroy, and how they are used, space-based systems are most useful against small groups and individuals. While the purpose of the use of space-based weapons in the above example was to prevent genocide, the means by which this attack was carried out was essentially assassination—the assassination of those driving the vehicle to carry out the ethnic cleansing. Space-based weapons, then, are most useful at targeting individuals and groups on short notice in order to achieve a political objective. We have already seen potential glimpses of this type of warfare in recent years. Consider, for example, that the Iraq War began with a so called “decapitation strike” aimed at assassinating Saddam Hussein in the hope of ending the war before it began. Similar tactics have been used by the Israeli Defense Forces to kill specific leaders of the Palestinians. Also, the U.S. has used Unmanned Aerial Vehicles equipped with missiles to target specific members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Placing weapons in space aimed at terrestrial targets would only accelerate the ability to carry out these types of “targeted killings” (a.k.a. assassinations). Space weapons would enable those who control them to kill any person at any point on Earth on extremely short notice. Thus, application of force from outer space would have at least three crucially important constitutive effects. First, it would constitute the possessor of these weapons—presumably the U.S.—as the center of a globally extensive, late-modern empire,68 a sovereign of the globe. But this global sovereign would exercise its power in a new way. Rather than needing to control the land, sea, and airspace of all of the Earth, it could rely on space weapons— because they enable the precise application of force at any point on earth, on short notice— to control the globe. While these weapons are not particularly useful in fighting large-scale wars, or in the conquest of territory, they make such conventional uses of military power moot, in large part. There is no longer a need to exercise sovereign power through the control of territory, all one has to do is kill—or perhaps even threaten to kill—potential adversaries around the world in order to gain one’s wishes. In short, the type of power potentially wielded by such a sovereign would be far more absolute than any encountered throughout history.69 Second, these weapons, just as space-based missile defense was seen above to do, would effectively strip states of their ability to exercise sovereignty over their territories. While de jure sovereignty may remain intact, their de facto sovereignty would be effectively erased. For decades, realist international relations scholars have promoted the idea that states secure their sovereignty through self-help.70 If states lack the capacity to defend themselves from adversaries they are particularly vulnerable to attack and conquest. While other scholars from liberal and constructivist schools of thought have questioned how closely sovereignty is linked to military capability, throughout history states with disproportionate military power have repeatedly violated the sovereignty of weaker states.71 While space-based weapons in and of themselves would not enable conquest of another state, they could be used very effectively to achieve precise political objectives without a credible possibility of retaliation. Imagine what impact these weapons would have on U.S. foreign policy with respect to two of its most pressing objectives at this point in time. Consider, for one, how useful such weapons might be with respect to preventing a rival state such as Iran or North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons. While there has been speculation that the U.S. or Israel may launch air strikes against potential nuclear weapons manufacturing facilities in these countries, the logistics—getting access to airspace from neighboring countries, and the possibility of retaliation against military forces in the area—make such operations difficult to carry out. Using weapons in space to conduct such missions would avoid these logistical difficulties, thereby making them easier (and presumably more likely). The threat of using space weapons on either the manufacturing sites of weapons of mass destruction or on the political leadership of an adversary in most cases probably would be sufficient to alter the behaviour of governments. In short, if the U.S. were to deploy such weapons in space, they would likely be used to much the same effect as the gunboat diplomacy of the 19th century. A second contemporary policy objective is to fight specific non-state actors. The 9/11 Commission Report discussed in great detail the logistical obstacles that prevented the Clinton administration from capturing or killing Osama Bin Laden.72 The primary obstacle was the difficulty in either launching cruise missiles into Afghanistan through another state’s airspace or deploying U.S. Special Forces in an area so remote from U.S. military bases. Again, had the U.S. had space-based weapons at the time, they probably would have been the weapons of choice. When combined with intelligence about the location of a potential target, they could be used to kill that target on very short notice without violating the air space of other states, or needing to have a military base nearby to offer a support role. In effect, any person or group of people anywhere on Earth could be targeted on very short notice, thereby constituting everyone everywhere as objects of the global sovereign. All would be subject to the rule of the U.S. state. The sovereignty of states would no longer be an obstacle to killing enemies, and these assassinations could be carried out rather easily without the threat of retaliation by the state whose sovereignty has been violated. The example of using space weapons to target non-state actors such as Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda points to a third constitutive effect of space weapons. Because these weapons could target anyone, anywhere, at anytime, everyone on the Earth is effectively reduced to “bare life.”73 As Agamben demonstrates in Homo Sacer (1998), one of the constitutive powers of the sovereign is to determine who is outside the laws and protections of the state. While human rights regimes and the rule of law may exist under a late-modern global empire policed by space weapons,74 the global sovereign will have the ability to decide the exception to this rule of law, and this state of exception in many cases may be exercised by the use of space weapons that constituted this sovereign in the first place.<br />

Reject the aff’s politics of fear to fragment the ideology of asteroid paranoia<br />

<br />
But the focus on narrative also begs a question: Which stories would we prefer to frame our science? Should science be driven by fear or by curiosity? Should it be aimed at creating technologies of war or cultures of compassion? These are normative questions, but they are also precisely the questions that make the military influence on science such an important issue. Narratives are inherently ideological and a refusal to see them as such does no more to enhance the scholar’s objectivity than it does the scientist’s. The stories told by the asteroid scientists led them into collaborations with weapons scientists and helped fuel a discourse of fear that served a particular ideological purpose. This should be both recognized and challenged, not for the sake of regaining some impossible ideal of an undistorted science but because there are other stories, based on different ideological assumptions, that we could tell in order to guide science towards more peaceful ends.<br />

1. Zero impact to large asteroids – either too improbable or too small to matter<br />
<br />

Olin Institute for Employment Practice and Policy, “The Chicken Littles of Big Science; or, Here Come the Killer Asteroids!” THE DOOMSDAY LOBBY 2010, 139-185, DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4419-6685-8_6]<br />

The smallest falling bodies, those with diameters under a few meters, are of “no practical concern,” says Chapman, and in fact they are to be desired, at least by those who keep their eyes on the skies watching for brilliant fireballs whose burning up in the atmosphere provides a show far more spectacular than the most lavish Fourth of July fireworks. Even bodies with diameters of 10–30 meters, of which Chapman estimates six may fall to earth in a century, cause little more than broken windows. They explode too high in the atmosphere to cause serious harm. The next largest potential strikers of Earth are those in the Tunguska range of 30 meters–100 meters. The shock waves from the atmospheric explosion would “topple trees, wooden structures and ignit[e] fires within 10 kilometers,” writes Chapman. Human deaths could result if the explosion took place over a populated area. Though Chapman estimates the likelihood of a Tunguska occurring in any given century at four in ten, it is worth noting that there is no evidence that such an explosion has killed a single human being in all of recorded history. Either we’re overdue or that 40 percent is high. Moreover, given that the location of such an explosion is utterly unpredictable, it would be far more likely to happen over an ocean or a desert than over, say, Tokyo or Manhattan. The after effects would be minimal, and Chapman says that “nothing practical can be done about this modest hazard other than to clean up after the event.” In fact, “It makes no sense to plan ahead for such a modest disaster… other than educating the public about the possibility.” The cost of a telescopic survey capable of picking up bodies of such diminutive size would be prohibitive. It would be the ultimate Astronomers Full Employment Act. A body of 100 meters–300 meters in diameter would either explode at low altitude or upon impact with the ground; it would be “regionally devastating,” but Chapman pegs the chances of such a catastrophe at 1 percent per century. A small nation could be destroyed by the impact of a body of 300 meters—1 km in diameter, or a “flying mountain” of sorts, which would explode with energy yield ten times more than “the largest thermonuclear bomb ever tested.” If striking land, it would carve out a crater deeper than the Grand Canyon. If it hit a populated area, the death toll could be in the hundreds of thousands. The likelihood of such a collision Chapman estimates at 0.2 percent per century. An asteroid or comet of 1–3 kilometers in diameter would cause “major regional destruction,” possibly verging on “civilization-destruction level.” Chapman puts the chances of this at 0.02 percent per century. The impact of a body more than 3 kilometers in diameter might plunge the Earth into a new Dark Age, killing most of its inhabitants, though the chances of this are “extremely remote” — less than one in 50,000 per century. Finally, mass extinction would likely occur should a body greater than 10 kilometers pay us a visit, though the chances of this are less than one in a million every century, or so infinitesimal that even the most worry-wracked hypochondriac will not lose sleep over the possibility. In fact, for any impact with a Chapman-calculated likelihood of less than one in a thousand per century, he concedes that there is “little justification for mounting asteroid-specific mitigation measures.” The chance of a civilization-ender is so remote that he counsels no “advance preparations” — or almost none. For Chapman recommends further study of NEOs, as well as investigation into methods of their diversion. 82 This is exactly what the NEO lobby wants. <br />

2. Status quo surveys solve for extinction-level asteroids<br />
<br />

<br />
Although the impact hazard was treated with substantial skepticism two decades ago when surveys were i rst proposed, it has become conventional wisdom that we should carry out the Spaceguard Survey for asteroids large enough to threaten global disaster (e.g., Posner 2004; Clarke 2007; Slovic 2007; Morrison 2007). The question whether need a much more expensive survey for sub-km asteroids is still being debated, however (Atkinson et al. 2000; Chapman 2000, 2007a; Morrison et al. 2003; Stokes 2003; Sidle 2007; NRC Report 2010). As the original Spaceguard Survey goals are within reach, the residual hazard lies in the few undiscovered asteroids larger than 1 km and in the sparsely sampled sub-km asteroids. The largest hazard will be from tsunamis caused by impactors several hundred meters in diameter, but this is primarily a risk to property since fatalities can be greatly reduced by the application of tsunami warning systems. The most life-threatening hazard from sub-km impacts is associated with airbursts over land. The survey results have already transformed our understanding of the impact risk. For asteroids with diameter of 5 km or more, which is roughly the threshold for an extinction event, our knowledge is complete today. Astronomers have already assured us that we are not due for an extinction-level impact from an asteroid within the next century<br />
. Barring a very unlikely strike by a large comet, we are not about to go the way of the dinosaurs. Thus, the rest of this paper focuses on the more frequent impacts by asteroids with diameters from 5 km down to the atmospheric cut-off at about 50 m diameter, spanning the range from global catastrophic disasters at the top end down to local endurable disasters at the lower end of the energy range. <br />
<br />
3. Self-interest means we won’t deflect<br />
<br />
Schweickart, 4 [Russell, AIAA Associate Fellow, Chairman, B612 Foundation, “ THE REAL DEFLECTION DILEMMA,” 2004 Planetary Defense Conference: Protecting Earth from Asteroids Orange County, California February 23-26, 2004 ]<br />
<br />
This challenge is, by its nature, international. While there is the exceptional circumstance where the deflection path will lie entirely within the bounds of a single nation state, the general case is one where the path of risk will cross several, or even many, national borders. It would therefore seem appropriate that the many legal and risk sharing issues embedded in deflecting asteroids be addressed by either the United Nations or some other authoritative international policy institution. The timing for such policy consideration is a challenging issue in itself. The quality of information on a pending NEO impact is highly variable over time. It ranges from a surprise impact with no prior knowledge to the case of 1950 DA 2 where we know today that there is a probability between 0 and 0.33% that this 1.1 km asteroid will impact Earth on March 16, 2880. For all other known NEOs between these two cases we can only state that with the exception of ~ 45 of them the remaining 2700 pose no threat to the Earth for the next 100 years. The residual 45 pose a very small but non-zero threat of an Earth impact at various times within the next 100 years. The issue then, of what will we know and when will we know it, becomes extremely critical to the timing and development of a coordinated international public policy on the NEO environmental threat. The natural temptation with such an improbable event is to wait until it becomes either a certainty or near-certainty before addressing it seriously. The price that would be paid for such an avoidance option in this instance will be the wielding of extreme selfserving national influence in the policy making process. If, e.g., it is discovered that a modest NEO will impact in Japan and that the deflection path would take it across Korea and over Beijing and China prior to liftoff, one can easily imagine the difficulty in only then initiating international deliberations on appropriate deflection policies. Clearly, rational mission planning criteria and risk sharing policies should be discussed and even put into formal treaty documents well before the specifics of a particular impact come to light. Objective evaluation of risk trade-offs and rational mission design will be far easier to achieve in such a proactive environment than in the power-politics confrontation that would dominate a wait and see alternative. An even more difficult, though similar, situation applies to the considerations of mission execution. What agency or agencies of any national government will be trusted to “truck” a 100+ MT bomb across the countryside in order to eliminate certain devastation in a neighboring country? Could one seriously imagine today the U.S. DoD being accepted by the world as the responsible agency for deflecting an asteroid from an impact in Afghanistan when the path of deflection would take it directly across Tehran? Of course this is a highly improbable example, but the likelihood that similar political considerations will not exist when we discover a probable NEO impact is dangerous wishful thinking. CONCLUSION The Real Deflection Dilemma will arise when the people of Earth awake to discover that a near Earth asteroid is headed for an impact with the planet. It will present itself as a terrible choice; do nothing to prevent it and suffer the consequences, or mount a mission to deflect it from impact thereby, in the process, placing a swath of people and property not otherwise at risk in jeopardy. In a very real sense, however, we are already ensnared in this dilemma, for we all know that such a moment in time will come. Therefore our own Real Deflection Dilemma is whether to confront the intractable policy choices implicit in protecting the Earth from asteroids now, or to avoid this terrible responsibility and force some future generation to face them in real time when they will become all but impossible to resolve.<br />

4. No solvency – total asteroid survey impossible<br />

<br />
Thus, assessing the completeness of the NEO surveys is subject to uncertainties: Some groups of NEOs are particularly difficult to detect. Asteroids and comets are continually lost from the NEO population because they impact the Sun or a planet, or because they are ejected from the solar system. Some asteroids have collisions that change their sizes or orbits. New objects are introduced into the NEO population from more distant reservoirs over hundreds of thousands to millions of years. The undiscovered NEOs could include large objects like 2009 HC82 as well as objects that will be discovered only months or less before Earth impact (“imminent impactors”). Hence, even though 85 percent of NEOs larger than 1 kilometer in diameter might already have been discovered, and eventually more than 90 percent of NEOs larger than 140 meters in diameter will be discovered, NEO surveys should nevertheless continue, because objects not yet discovered pose a statistical risk: Humanity must be constantly vigilant. Finding: Despite progress toward or completion of any survey of near-Earth objects, it is impossible to identify all of these objects because objects’ orbits can change, for example due to collisions. Recommendation: Once a near-Earth object survey has reached its mandated goal, the search for NEOs should not stop. Searching should continue to identify as many of the remaining objects and objects newly injected into the NEO population as possible, especially imminent impactors.<br />

<br />
Once-in-a-Century Mini-Tunguska Atmospheric Explosion Consider a 30-40 m office-building-sized object striking at 100 times the speed of a jetliner. It would explode ~15 km above ground, releasing the energy of ~100 Hiroshima-scale bombs. Some researchers consider that such an event would be spectacular to witness but would not have lethal consequences. Our review of the literature suggests, however, that weak structures might be damaged or destroyed by the overpressure of the blast wave out to 20 km. The death toll might be hundreds; although casualties would be far higher in a densely populated place, they would much more likely be zero (i.e., if the impact were in the ocean or in a desolate location). Such an event is likely to occur before or during our grandchildren's lifetimes, although most likely over the ocean rather than land. Even with the proposed augmented Spaceguard Survey, it is unlikely that such a small object would be discovered in advance; impact would occur without warning. Since it could occur literally anywhere, there are no location-specific kinds of advance measures that could or should be taken, other than educating people (perhaps especially military forces that might otherwise mistake the event as an intentional attack) about the possibilities for such atmospheric explosions. In the lucky circumstance that the object is discovered years in advance, a relatively modest space mission could deflect such a small body, preventing impact (see ref. 65).<br />

<br />
False Alarms False alarms, often referred to within the NEO community as “one day wonders,” are another unique characteristic of NEO impact threats, and deserve special attention. In the early phases of discovery and orbit refinement the impact time and location will be very imprecise. False alarms, even and perhaps especially from authoritative sources who may in fact believe in their projections, excite the media and engage the public. The periodic outbreak of attention from a false alarm may seem to be beneficial at first glance, as it serves to raise public awareness of the threat. However, any awareness enhancing features are outweighed by detrimental consequences including inducing panic and unnecessary anxiety; desensitizing the public or trivializing the threat; and diverting the attention and damaging the [credibility] credible of the NEO community.<br />

As previously pointed out, humankind now possesses the technology to provide the first two essential elements necessary to protect the planet from asteroid impacts. Early impact warning is already underway for the largest objects of concern and new telescopes will soon increase the capability to provide impact warning for more numerous smaller objects of concern. Asteroid deflection capability, while not yet proven, is possible with current spaceflight technology and is being actively investigated by several of the world’s space agencies. The missing third element is the readiness and determination of the international community to take concerted action in response to a perceived threat to the planet. An adequate global action program must include deflection criteria and campaign plans which, can be implemented rapidly and with little debate by the international community. In the absence of an agreed-upon decision-making process, we may lose the opportunity to act against a NEO in time, leaving evacuation and disaster management as our only response to a pending impact. A single such missed opportunity will add painful fault-finding to the devastating physical effects of an impact. The international community should begin work now on forging its warning, technology, and decision-making capacities into an effective shield against a future collision.<br />

The “any risk” logic would make all decisionmaking impossible—evaluate probability over magnitude<br />

<br />
Tom Friedman's piece today in the Times on the environment is one of the flimsiest pieces by a major columnist that I can remember ever reading. He applies Cheney's &quot;one percent doctrine&quot; (which is similar to the environmentalists' &quot;precautionary principle&quot;) to the risk of environmental armageddon. But this doctrine is both intellectually incoherent and practically irrelevant. It is intellectually incoherent because it cannot be applied consistently in a world with many potential disaster scenarios. In addition to the global-warming risk, there's also the asteroid-hitting-the-earth risk, the terrorists-with-nuclear-weapons risk (Cheney's original scenario), the super-duper-pandemic risk, etc. Since each of these risks, on the &quot;one percent doctrine,&quot; would deserve all of our attention, we cannot address all of them simultaneously. That is, even within the one-percent mentality, we'd have to begin prioritizing, making choices and trade-offs. But why then should we only make these trade-offs between responses to disaster scenarios? Why not also choose between them and other, much more cotidien, things we value? Why treat the unlikely but cataclysmic event as somehow fundamentally different, something that cannot be integrated into all the other calculations we make? And in fact, this is how we behave all the time. We get into our cars in order to buy a cup of coffee, even though there's some chance we will be killed on the way to the coffee shop. We are constantly risking death, if slightly, in order to pursue the things we value. Any creature that adopted the &quot;precautionary principle&quot; would sit at home - no, not even there, since there is some chance the building might collapse. That creature would neither be able to act, nor not act, since it would nowhere discover perfect safety. Friedman's approach reminds me somehow of Pascal's wager - quasi-religious faith masquerading as rational deliberation (as Hans Albert has pointed out, Pascal's wager itself doesn't add up: there may be a God, in fact, but it may turn out that He dislikes, and even damns, people who believe in him because they've calculated it's in their best interest to do so). As my friend James points out, it's striking how descriptions of the environmental risk always describe the situation as if it were five to midnight. It must be near midnight, since otherwise there would be no need to act. But it can never be five *past* midnight, since then acting would be pointless and we might as well party like it was 2099. Many religious movements - for example the early Jesus movement - have exhibited precisely this combination of traits: the looming apocalypse, with the time (just barely) to take action.<br />
<br />
High-magnitude logic doesn’t apply—asteroid strike is so improbable that we can just ignore it<br />
<br />
BENNETT 2010 (James, Prof of Economics at George Mason, The Doomsday Lobby: Hype and Panic from Sputniks, Martians, and Marauding Meteors, p. 175)<br />
<br />
Now, it makes sense for the appropriate agencies to make plans for the evacuation of cities in the event of a levee breaking or a power plant disaster. These “incidents” are plausible, or at least thinkable. Better safe than sorry. A collision with an asteroid or comet, on the other hand, is so highly implausible, so exceedingly unlikely, that “planning” for it is a potent blend of the useless and the expensive. Boosting the DHS’s National Response Plan was Evan R. Seamone, writing in 2004 in the Georgetown International Environmental Law Review. Seamone bemoaned that “Current legal and policy efforts to enable adequate defense against potential asteroid or comet collisions with the earth are insufficient because they are indirectly premised upon theories that require verification of a clear and imminent threat before governmental agencies can act.” In other words, the antediluvian theories that underlay our system and the systems of most other governments of the world require that there be an actual threat before the state is mobilized to meet that threat. Obviously the philosophers who spin such theories never saw Armageddon on DVD. As an alternative for the 21st century, Seamone proposed a “precautionary principle” as the cornerstone of a governmental asteroid defense program. This tenet — which might also be known as the fling-open-the-doors-to-the-Treasury principle — “requires governments to take action to prevent harm even when it is uncertain if, when, or where the harm will occur.”<br />

Privilege short-timeframe impacts:<br />
A) Intervening actors—the longer the timeframe the more likely other agents are to solve their impact<br />
<br />
B) Impact access—short timeframe impacts can turn long timeframe ones, but not the other way around—by the time the later event has occurred our shorter timeframe impact will already be irreversible<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
C)Probability—Long timeframes decrease it—the more distant the prediction, the more likely it is to be wrong <br />
POSNER 2004 (Richard, US Court of Appeals judge and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, Catastrophe: Risk and Response  17)<br />
A compelling reason for not giving a great deal of thought to the remote future is the difficulty, often the impossibility, of making accurate predictions beyond a few years.  People in the year 1000 could have had only the vaguest conception of what the world would be like in the year 2004, and we can have only the vaguest conception of what it will be like in the year 3000, let alone the year 1,000,000.  We have better predictive methods than people in 1000 did, but on the other had the rate of technological change is higher now than it was then.  Lacking the requisite foreknowledge we can’t know what we should be doing now to forestall the disasters that are possible, maybe even likely, on that timescale.<br />
<br />
D) Conditional probability—short-timeframe existential risks effectively decrease the probability of long-timeframe ones—we can only die once<br />
BOSTROM 2011 (Nick, Prof. of Philosophy at Oxford, The Concept of Existential Risk (Draft), <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11075:http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11075 -->)<br />
Finally, when considering existential-risk probabilities, we must recognize that one existential catastrophe can preempt another.  If a meteor wipes us out next year, the existential risk from future machine superintelligence drops to zero.  The sum of all-things-considered probabilities of disjoint (mutually exclusive) existential risks cannot exceed 100%.  Yet conditional probabilities of disjoint existential risks (conditional, that is to say, on no other existential disaster occurring preemptively) could well add up to more than 100%.  For example, some pessimist might coherently assign an 80% probability to humanity being destroyed by machine superintelligence, and a 70% conditional probability to humanity being destroyed by nanotechnological warfare given that humanity is not destroyed by machine superintelligence.  However, if the unconditional (all-things-considered) probability of our being eradicated by superintelligence is 80%, then the unconditional probability of our being eradicated by nanotech war must be no greater than 20%, since we can only be eradicated once.<br />
<br />
Extremely low probabilities should count as zero—even if there’s some risk, policy decisions can’t be justified by vanishingly small probabilities<br />
RESCHER 2003 (Nicholas, Prof of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, Sensible Decisions: Issues of Rational Decision in Personal Choice and Public Policy, p. 49-50)<br />
On this issue there is a systemic disagreement between probabilists working on theory-oriented issues in mathematics or natural science and decision theorists who work on practical decision-oriented issues relating to human affairs.  The former takes the line that small number are small numbers and must be taken into account as such—that is, the small quantities they actually are.  The latter tend to take the view that small probabilities represent extremely remote prospect and can be written off.  (De minimis non curat lex, as the old precept has it: in human affairs there is no need to bother with trifles.)  When something is about as probable as a thousand fair dice when tossed a thousand times coming up all sixes, then, so it is held, we can pretty well forget about it as a worthy of concern.  As a matter of practical policy, we operate with probabilities on the principle that when x ≤ E, then x = 0.  We take the line that in our human dealings in real-life situations a sufficiently remote possibility can—for all sensible purposes—be viewed as being of probability zero.  Accordingly, such remote possibilities can simply be dismissed, and the outcomes with which they are associated can accordingly be set aside.  And in “the real world” people do in fact seem to be prepared to treat certain probabilities as effectively zero, taking certain sufficiently improbable eventualities as no long representing real possibilities.  Here an extremely improbable event is seen as something we can simply write off as being outside the range of appropriate concern, something we can dismiss for all practical purposes.  As one writer on insurance puts it: [P]eople…refuse to worry about losses whose probability is below some threshold.  Probabilities below the threshold are treated as though they were zero.  No doubt, remote-possibility events having such a minute possibility can happen in some sense of the term, but this “can” functions somewhat figuratively—it is no longer seen as something that presents a realistic prospect.<br />
<br />
We must weigh competing probabilities and dismiss threats to survival if they are very unlikely—the alternative is that we do nothing about any existential risk<br />
POSNER 2004 (Richard, US Court of Appeals judge and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, Catastrophe: Risk and Response  19)<br />
The reason for the hedge in “essentially” is that I want to avoid making claims of metaphysical certainty.  From a scientific standpoint, anything is possible.  But some possibilities really are too remote to be worth worrying about, such as the possibility that my next breath will create a black hole or that the entire human population will be persuaded to commit suicide.  To put this differently, we have to be selective in responding to the catastrophic risks because if we allow our imaginations to multiply their number indefinitely we’ll end up doing nothing about any of them.<br />

<br />
Deflection and destruction of the approaching comet are both viable options. While some proposals suggest avoiding fragmentation because of the potential to create multiple assailants on course for Earth, fragments may cause less damage by spreading out the energy. Fragmentation is the most efficient method of moving the comet, since a larger fragment can deliver the same impulse to the comet with less energy. Given the uncertain composition of a comet and its unknown response to high-yield detonations, not enough information is available to determine whether a surface-burst nuclear explosion would cause it to fragment. If so, the goal should be to spread the pieces out over an area much larger than Earth, so that most will pass by harmlessly. Additionally, the rest should be reduced to a size that cannot penetrate the atmosphere. A strategy incorporating multiple sequential explosions, delivered by separately propelled vehicles, lends itself quite well: after fragmentation by the initial explosion, any large pieces remaining on course for Earth become the new targets for the later interceptions. If, however, the comet remains essentially cohesive, the goal must be to deflect it far enough to definitively avoid impact. In each case, the velocity (of either the main comet body or the majority of the fragments) must be enough that the orbit is displaced by two Earth radii before it crosses Earth orbit. In the first case, this spreads the material over a diameter twice that of Earth, while in the second it ensures a miss by a safe margin. The velocity change VC to accomplish this shift is given as a function of the interception time by the same numerical simulation used for modelling the flight of the interceptors (discussed in section 5.2).<br />

<br />
Since the dawn of the nuclear era, substantial thought and effort have gone into preventing accidental and inadvertent nuclear war.  Nuclear powers have attempted to construct the most reliable technology and procedures for command and control of nuclear weapons, including robust, fail-safe early warning systems for verifying attacks.  The United States and the Soviet Union also maintained secure second-strike capabilities to reduce their own incentives to launch a preemptive strike against each other during crisis situations or out of fear of a surprise attack. The two nuclear superpowers worked bilaterally to foster strategic stability by means of arms control and confidence-building measures and agreements.  Several confidence-building agreements were negotiated between the two-superpowers to reduce the risk of an accidental nuclear war: the 1971 Agreement on Measures to Reduce the Risk of Outbreak of Nuclear War, the 1972 Agreement on the Prevention of Incidents on and over the High Seas, and the 1973 Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War.  Following the end of the Cold War, the United States and the Russian Federation have continued to offer unilateral initiatives and to negotiate bilateral agreements on dealerting and detargeting some of their nuclear forces to further reduce the likelihood of a catastrophic nuclear accident.  They have concluded agreements on providing each other with notifications in the event of ballistic missile launches or other types of military activities that could possibly be misunderstood or misconstrued by the other party.<br />
<br />
5. No nuclear accidents<br />
<br />
PERROW 1999 (Charles, Professor of Sociology at Yale, Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technology, p 257-258)<br />
<br />
No such encouraging lessons come from the section on nuclear weapons and early warning systems.  We will not dwell on “the fate of the earth,” that is, the destructive power of nuclear weapons, but on the limits of human capabilities and the even narrower limits of organizational capabilities.  There is much to fear from accidents with nuclear weapons such as dropping them or an accidental launch, but with regard to firing them after a false warning we reach a surprising conclusion, one I was not prepared for: because of the safety systems involved in a launch-on-warning scenario, it is virtually impossible for well-intended actions to bring about an accidental attack (malevolence or derangement is something else).  In one sense this is not all that comforting, since if there were a true warning that the Russian missiles were coming, it looks as if it would also be nearly impossible for there to be an intended launch, so complex and prone to failure is this system.  It is an interesting case to reflect upon: at some point does the complexity of a system and its coupling become so enormous that a system no longer exists?  Since our ballistic weapons system has never been called upon to perform (it cannot even be tested), we cannot be sure that it really constitutes a viable system.  It just may collapse in confusion!<br />

Ground-based groups of microphones, called infrasonic arrays, can distinguish atomic blasts from exploding asteroids up to a few hundred kilometres away, say Brown, Tagliaferri and colleagues1. The arrays pick up the very-low-frequency sounds that penetrate hundreds of kilometres of the Earth's atmosphere. Multiple arrays pinpoint the position and size of a blast almost as accurately as the satellites used by US Space Command, the researchers show. Right now, there are 12 such arrays. Sixty will be built within the next 5 years as part of the CTBT International Monitoring Network. The rules of the treaty dictate that their data must be available to all. A global array should spot meteor explosions from most areas of the world, says Brown. The infrasonic network will also be important for research. Meteorites smaller than 10 metres across are hard to detect with telescopes, so scientists have little idea of how often they breach our atmosphere. An idea of how frequently small asteroids occur is important for estimating the likelihood of larger ones, such as the one that devastated thousands of square kilometres of Siberian forest in Tunguska in 1908. The microphone array, says Matthew Genge of the Natural History Museum in London, UK, &quot;will help us tell just how many Tunguskas we can expect&quot;.<br />

While most of the data are approximately consistent with a power law, the lunar-derived NEO population curve of Werner et al. (2002) shows an obvious departure, usually interpreted as a shortage of small (diameter less than a few hundred meters) impactors, although it might also suggest an early excess of large asteroids or comets not currently represented in the NEA flux. Interpreted in the usual way, however, the lunar curve indicates that the frequency of Tunguska-size impactors is roughly one per 10,000 yr, more than an order of magnitude below the usually quoted frequency of such impacts, and a surprising result given that we experienced such an event within the last century. We don’t know where the problem lies, but we suggest that the NEA population derived by Werner et al. from the lunar cratering statistics warrants consideration of alternative interpretations of the data <br />

War can happen<br />
Ferguson 2008 - sr. fellow @ the Hoover Institute and professor of History @ Harvard (Niall, Hoover Digest no1 47-53 Wint 2008)<br />
The risk of a major geopolitical crisis in 2007 is certainly lower than it was in 1914. Yet it is not so low as to lie altogether beyond the realm of probability. The escalation of violence in the Middle East as Iraq disintegrates and Iran presses on with its nuclear program is close to being a certainty, as are the growing insecurity of Israel and the impossibility of any meaningful U.S. exit from the region. All may be harmonious between the United States and China today, yet the potential for tension over trade and exchange rates has unquestionably increased since the Democrats gained control of Congress. Nor should we forget about security flashpoints such as the independence of Taiwan, the threat of North Korea, and the nonnuclear status of Japan. To consign political risk to the realm of uncertainty seems almost as rash today as it was in the years leading up the First World War. Anglo-German economic commercial ties reached a peak in 1914, but geopolitics trumped economics. It often does.<br />

8. Small asteroid will strike over water and cause negligible damage <br />
<br />

K., Tsunami Laboratory, Institute of Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Geophysics Siberian Division, Russian Academy of Sciences, Ch.14: Tsunami as a Destructive Aftermath of Oceanic Impacts, in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society: An Interdisciplinary Approach, SpringLink)<br />
<br />
Since evidence for asteroid impact on Earth exists, we have to conclude that there is a four-to-one chance that they hit oceans, seas or even large internal water reservoirs and therefore tsunami or tsunami-like water waves can be generated by an extra-terrestrial impact. There has been a general concern that the tsunami from a deep-water impact of a 1-km asteroid could contribute substantially to its overall hazard for the people living near coasts and would wash out all coastal cities of the entire ocean (Chapman 2003; Morrison 2003). However, a 1-km asteroid is quite close to the global disaster threshold (impact of a 2–3 km object) and tsunami could therefore contribute somewhat to other hazardous aftermaths of this natural catastrophe that would have a large enough potential to end our modern civilization era. Fortunately for humankind, it is indeed a very rare event, available estimates of its return period vary in the range of 100 000 to 1 000 000 years. Much more frequent are the Tunguska-class impacts (the size of an object being 100 m or less) with the return period being more relevant to the human time scale and spanning from several hundred to one thousand years. Unless the small asteroid is made of solid metal (iron or nickel), it would likely explode in the upper atmosphere with a TNT equivalent in the first tens of megatons. Available estimates, based mainly on nuclear tests results, show that tsunami from such an airblast should be from several tens of centimeters to one meter (Glasstone and Doland 1977), so the water impact of such a small, once-per-century asteroid could be in general less hazardous than an equivalent explosion above land. <br />
<br />
9. Zero risk of a small asteroid crashing—1 every 1000 years <br />
<br />
MacCracken ‘7 (Michael C., fellow at the Climate Institute, Ch. 16: The Climatic Effects of Asteroid and Comet Impacts: Consequences for an Increasingly Interconnected Society, in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society: An Interdisciplinary Approach, SpringLink)<br />
<br />
Depending on an impactor’s composition and the speed and angle of impact, objects with diameters of up to roughly 50[m] to 100 m typically create blast effects of up to of order 50 to 100 MT without impacting the surface. The Tunguska event of 30 June 1908, for example, created a shock wave that leveled the forest over an area of roughly 2000 km2 (Kolesnikov et al. 2007). This event is variously estimated to have resulted from an atmospheric explosion of 10 to 100 MT from an object estimated to be between about 60 and 100 m in diameter (Covey 2002; Yazev 2002). Based on astronomical evidence, such events are statistically expected to occur approximately every few centuries, with an event occurring over land roughly every 500 to 1000 years, which is not inconsistent with historical records. <br />

NASA personnel at the centers reported that reductions in budgets supporting fundamental research have had several consequences: Equipment and support have become inadequate. Centers are unable to provide adequate and stable funding and manpower for the fundamental science and technology advancements needed to support long-term objectives. Research has been deferred. Researchers are expending inordinate amounts of time writing proposals seeking funding to maintain their laboratory capabilities. Efforts are diverted as researchers seek funding from outside NASA for work that may not be completely consistent with NASA’s goals. <br />

The call for space development is based on an imperialist frontier mythology that unifies adventure and material exploitation, Columbus and technological progress—this necessitates the expansion of colonial social relations and the denigration of “earthly” concerns <br />
<br />
Redfield, 2 – Department of Anthropology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Peter, “The Half-Life of Empire in Outer Space,” Social Studies of Science, Vol. 32, No. 5/6 (Oct. - Dec., 2002), pp. 791-82, JSTOR)<br />
<br />
The rhetorical link between outer space and colonial history requires little introduction. Anyone with a passing acquaintance of the Space Age is familiar with its frontier metaphors and allusions to European colonial expansion, from the frequent appearance of male explorers past in NASA presentations to the imaginary exploits of increasingly varied Star Trek crews. The above quotation thus constitutes a reflexive, though casual, reference; its intended import lies less in the actual words transcribed than the reminder of a larger pattern echoing through them.12 Just like colonial history itself, the field of representation running through outer space is complex, multiple and full of tension, encompassing the possibility of reversals and counter-themes, such as the reverse colonialism of alien abductions.13 However, at the base of rockets we can identify a consistent and optimistic reading of history through the future. In the aftermath of the 20th century, advocates of space exploration constitute perhaps the last unabashed enthusiasts of imperialism, cheerfully describing conquest, settlement and expansion, and hesitating not a whit before employing the term 'colony'. Theirs is a Columbus of exploration, nation building and risk taking, not of invasion, domination and genocide. History is cleansed above the planet; unlike a group of Native American scholars meeting in the immediate aftermath of the Apollo landing, it would never occur to participants of workshops such as the one cited above to 'pity the Indians and the buffalo of Outer Space' [Young (1987): 271]. Here I will take the explicit tie of human activity in outer space to the vocabulary of earlier periods of colonial expansion and imperial rule - its blatant historical resonance - as seriously as possible, in order briefly to examine the ancestry and legacy of exploration, on and over the globe. To do so I first refer to two fictions of import to space history, Jules Verne's mid-19th-century sardonic fantasy of a moon voyage, and Fritz Lang's early-20th-century film epic on the same topic, both of which employ imperial tropes prominently in their narration. Between the two we can recall variant definitions of the key term 'adventure', and its implied personal or financial risk, part way between exploration and exploitation. I want to position 'adventure' to describe a form of extending networks, an ambiguous and plural category of movement, but one that is hardly neutral. The history of rocketry describes an undeniably fertile intersection between fantasy and fact, a veritable garden of grafts between narrative, engineering and the legacy of adventure. No one embodies this observa- tion better than Jules Verne, the one-time stockbroker who, in the relative bourgeois comfort of the French seaport of Nantes, penned tale after tale of breathless, male adventure in the far reaches of geography and machin- ery.14 Verne was not only a remarkably productive author himself, but also proved seminal in the second sense of encouraging productivity on the part of others. Among the most interesting of his devoted readers were not only future writers of what would come to be called science fiction, but also the pioneering figures of spaceflight: Tsiolkovsky, Oberth, Goddard, Korolev and Von Braun [McDougall (1985): 20; McCurdy (1997): 12-16]. Verne's 1865 work, From the Earth to the Moon [De la terre a la lune], in particular, is frequently lauded for its foreshadowing of events a century later.15 For our purposes, I would like to dwell on a passage found in the 1870 completion of the moon adventure, A Trip Around It [Autour de la lune]. Here our three protagonists, Impey Barbicane, the gun club president and instigator of the lunar shot, Captain Nicholl, his old rival and vigorous sceptic, and Michel Ardan, the impulsive Frenchman who inspired them to climb aboard, are hurtling through space en route to the moon. Under the influence of a surfeit of oxygen, they engage in a giddy discussion of their voyage and significance, and Barbicane admits he has not considered what they might do on the moon should they get there. Nicholl then demands to know why they are going in the first place: 'Why?' exclaimed Michel, jumping a yard high, 'why? To take possession of the moon in the name of the United States; to add a fortieth state to the Union; to colonize the lunar regions; to cultivate them, to people them, to transport hither all prodigies of art, of science, and industry; to civilize the Selenites, unless they are more civilized than we are; and to constitute them a republic, if they are not already one!' 'And if there are no Selenites?' retorted Nicholl, who, under the influence of this unaccountable intoxication, was very contradictory. ... The two adversaries were going to fall upon each other, and the incoherent discussion threatened to merge into a fight, when Barbicane intervened with one bound. 'Stop, miserable men', said he, separating his two companions; 'if there are no Selenites, we will do without them'. 'Yes', exclaimed Michel, who was not particular; 'yes, we will do without them. We have only to make Selenites. Down with the Selenites!' 'The empire of the moon belongs to us', said Nicholl ... [Verne (1958 [1865/1870]): 140-42] 1This passage is notable both for its farcical tone and for the central importance of the topic under discussion: the very goal of the voyage. Only at this advanced point in the narrative - long after the characters can claim any semblance of control over their circumstances - does Verne raise the issue of why they have embarked in the first place, or what they might hope to accomplish. The characters quickly resort to a vocabulary of colonial adventure. Theirs will be a civilizing mission, but one in which natives prove ultimately dispensable. Should their destination prove a lifeless orb, then they will simply proclaim what they otherwise would have to enforce: a recognizable social order modelled on their point of departure. I suggest that this passage neatly encapsulates the assumed political geography of most later descriptions of humanity's future beyond Earth's atmosphere (the fact that it was written before the final push of European rule through Africa and Asia should give us additional pause, since it foreshadows high imperialism as well). In stories, at least, adventure can serve as its own justification, and achieve a momentum that renders its exact goal an afterthought. Extending a network can itself be an end.'7 But what of more calculating interests, and less farcical possibilities of political economy? As a materialist counterweight, let us add another early cultural artefact of the Space Age, Fritz Lang's 1929 film, Woman on the Moon [Frau im Mond]. Lang's work is particularly significant because, as with Verne, the project sought a certain realism amid its romance (employ- ing the rocket virtuoso Hermann Oberth as a technical advisor), and inspired the young Germans who would later make up the V-2 team [McCurdy (1997): 15]. In contrast to Verne's novel, a material motivation for this flight is clear from the very start of the story, and it is Columbus' very dream - the acquisition of gold. At the heart of this modern quest lurks a traditional sin of greed. Against the mad genius of Professor Manfeldt (who first declares the abundance of gold on the moon) and the idealism of Wolf Helius (the romantic hero who dreams of space travel), stands the villainous Herr Turner, agent of the financiers who fund the rocket and care only about returning profit to earth.18 In addition to moving elements of family drama into space, Lang's film also features the establishment of a colonial environment, featuring displaced, closed social relations and an expanded ecosystem bent on export, such that the moon can acquire calculable value. Here the pure dream of space travel becomes tied to a less genteel promise of material gain. And yet a version of that dream not only remains, but also shapes the possibility of heroism. I want to underscore three observations about these two famous moments of space fantasy. The first is simply an affirmation of deep rhetorical connections between exploration above and below the atmos- phere. Despite the particularities of the cultural imagination displayed in them, when taken together these two works remind us of the greater narrative inertia inside the drive for adventure. While focus shifts to a wondrous horizon, and new, exacting techniques of exploration such as rockets and astronomical navigation, the field of vision retains earthly assumptions, desires and fears. As interesting as what each set of explorers seeks in the moon is what they bring with them: frock coats and a sense of civilization on the one hand, and campfire sweaters and a lust for profit on the other. The material is there for an effort to 'provincialize' these fictions by revealing the specificity of their historical debts. Such a project would remain a scholastic exercise, however, and well within the bounds of the literary end of postcolonial studies, were it not for the uncomfortable fact that these fictions provided space exploration with a recognizable future, and thus helped engender fantastic practices. These dreams found engi- neers, eager to materialize them. My second observation is about the form of colonization being im- agined: like the occupants of Verne's projectile for whom the 'Selenites' are ultimately superfluous, or Lang's heroic protagonist who stays behind on the moon, the history of space representation is full of visions of settler colonization. This point is not surprising, given the narrative topology of any act of leaving the earth or extending human life through the galaxy, but it has effects when placed next to the fissures of terrestrial history. Even the planners of the German V-2 dreamed beyond their engines of destruction, imagining an era of peaceful exploration, while American and Soviet cold warriors alternated geopolitical fears of final conflict with calls to embrace a new dawn for humanity.'9 Amid explicitly imperial tropes of representa- tion, space offered the prospect of a renewed form of settlement, this time into a zone safely free from human difference. Returning to etymological roots, humans could find new domains to culture, together, as a species.20 By considering the earth as a planetary entity, then, fantasies of space exploration have presented a 'limit case' of one measure of scale. Within them - and their potential realization - the atmosphere serves as the threshold of human unity. My final observation involves a potential dynamic of representation created by the interaction of the first two points. Like Verne's protagonists, committed to their trajectory and inventing a goal on the fly, the language of space exploration returns to history post hoc, within a planetary frame implying common humanity. Thus it should come as no surprise that the sense of history commonly invoked in space narratives is a species narra- tive, full of giant leaps. Here we have a variation of Chakrabarty's dilemma, only posed in scalar, rather than chronological terms. Just as European history naturally defines the categories of modernity by virtue of prece- dence, outer space naturally defines the globe by virtue of bounding it. Those people claiming this new realm seem to leave old ones - at least their more unpleasant details - behind. Such a space fantasy involves 'scale', both in the sense of a motion of expansion and the sense of establishing a boundary. It is consequently impatient with concerns that remain local (the actual lives of any Selenites), or ultimately earthly (the calculations of Lang's financiers). Space is a higher calling. In order to interrogate the continued resonance of this higher calling on the ground, moving from general discourse more deeply into specific practice, I will shift closer to the material present and briefly sketch a tropical outpost of high technology.<br />

The impact is extinction—the moral law of the frontier combined with a call for resource exploitation allows genocide and infinite destruction<br />

Berry, 75 – poet, novelist, farmer, teacher (Wendell, “Comment on O’Neill’s Space Colonies,” Co-Evolution, Winter 1975-76, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11079:http://space.alglobus.net/CoEvolutionBook/DEBATE.HTML --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://space.alglobus.net/CoEvolutionBook/DEBATE.HTML" rel="nofollow">http://space.alglobus.net/CoEvolutionBook/DEBATE.HTML</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11079 -->)<br />
<br />
The correspondence between the proposed colonization of &quot;the high frontier&quot; of outer space and the opening of the American frontier is irresistible to Mr. O'Neill. I find it at least as suggestive as he does, and a lot more problematical. The American prospect after, say, 1806 inspired the same sense of spatial and mental boundlessness, the same sense of limitlessness of physical resources and of human possibility, the same breathless viewing of conjectural vistas. But it is precisely here that Mr. O'Neill's sense of history fails. For the sake, perhaps, of convenience he sees himself and his American contemporaries as the inheritors of the frontier mentality, but not of the tragedy of that mentality. He does not speak as a Twentieth Century American, faced with the waste and ruin of his inheritance from the frontier. He speaks instead in the manner of a European of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, privileged to see American space and wealth as conveniently distant solutions to local problems. That is to say that, upon examination, Mr. O'Neill's doctrine of &quot;energy without guilt&quot; is only a renewal, in &quot;space-age&quot; terms, of an old chauvinism: in order to make up for deficiencies of materials on earth we will &quot;exploit&quot; (i.e., damage or destroy) the moon and the asteroids. This is in absolute obedience to the moral law of the frontier: humans are destructive in proportion to their supposition of abundance; if they are faced with an infinite abundance, then they will become infinitely destructive. Mr. O'Neill sets it down as a false premise &quot;That any realistic solutions to our problems of food, population, energy and materials must be based on a kind of zero-sum game, in which no resources can be obtained by one nation or group without being taken from another.&quot; That is the lesson that the closing of the earthly frontiers puts before us; it calls for an authentic series of changes in the human character and community that, if made, will afford us the spiritual resources to live both within our material means and with each other. Mr. O'Neill proposes to learn no such lesson and to make no such changes. He proposes to outflank the lesson entirely. What we obviously need - as any old buffalo hunter or strip miner would also tell us - is a &quot;new frontier :&quot; some place, that is, where the mentality of exploitation may proceed without restraint, &quot;correcting&quot; the ruin of one place by the ruin of another. But it seems to me that, in essence, Mr. O'Neill's false premise is true everywhere in the universe. All we have to do is rephrase it in terms of what we know of our history and of the insights of the ecologists, so that it reads this way: Whatever human beings use they must take from the rest of creation, either temporarily or permanently. So phrased, this allegedly false premise is seen to be a practical truth with profound cultural implications. Instead of the moral escape valve of yet another &quot;new frontier&quot; to be manned by an elite of experts, it proposes certain limits, restraints, and disciplines that apply to all of us. It avoids the corporate and governmental big-dealing that will be bound to accompany the expenditure of a hundred billion dollars. And it avoids the open-ended chauvinism, perfected by the strip miners, that is always willing to advocate the destruction (for money, jobs, and the general amelioration of the human condition) of some other place. It has always been possible to export bad character and disrespect, but that can be understood as a solution only by misunderstanding the problem. This brings me to the central weakness of Mr. O'Neill's case: its shallow and gullible morality. Space colonization is seen as a solution to problems that are inherently moral, in that they are implicit in our present definitions of character and community. And yet here is a solution to moral problems that contemplates no moral change and subjects itself to no moral standard. Indeed, the solution is based upon the moral despair of Mr. O'Neill's assertion that &quot;people do not change.&quot; The only standards of judgment that have been applied to this project are technical and economic. Much is made of the fact that the planners' studies &quot;continue to survive technical review.&quot; But there is no human abomination that has not, or could not have, survived technical review. Strip mining, fire-bombing, electronic snooping, various forms of genocide and political oppression - all have been technically feasible, and usually economically feasible as well. Stripped of the glamour that we associate with adventures in &quot;space&quot; and of the romantic escapism left over from our frontier experience, Mr. O'Neill's project is clearly not a solution, in any meaningful sense, to any problem. It is only a desperate attempt to revitalize the thug morality of the technological specialist, by which we blandly assume that we must do anything whatever that we can do. Mr. O'Neill's testimony is littered with the evidence of his moral bewilderment. His concern for the environment leads him directly to a plan to strip mine the moon. He says, &quot;I have a deep suspicion of governments,&quot; but he does not hesitate to promote a scheme that would vastly increase the power and influence of government. He apparently sees no chance of political corruption in an expenditure of a hundred billion public dollars. He says that he &quot;would far prefer to see a cooperative multinational program formed&quot; to carry out his project, but only flve paragraphs later he speaks of the project as a way to return to the &quot;traditional role [of the U.S.] as a generous donor of wealth to those in need.&quot; Nowhere does he see the absurdity of trying to solve on a grand scale by expensive technology a problem that can probably be solved on a small scale, and cheaply, by moral means (see E.F. Schumacher's article, same issue). Nowhere does he see the absurdity of trying to solve with existing technology a problem that, as Schumacher suggests, &quot;has been produced by the existing technology.&quot; Mr. O'Neill predicts readily that his scheme will promote diversity and freedom. But he neglects to consider that the machine is already a renegade concept that sees people as spare parts, and uses them as such. Exactly how, one wonders, is this to be corrected by building an even bigger machine and causing people to live inside it, in absolute dependence on it? What, exactly, would be the effect of a completely controlled environment on human character and community? What, exactly, would be the influence of space colonization on earthly political and social forms? Mr. O'Neill does not know, and he has no way to know. He is not, then, merely asking for a public subsidy in the amount of a hundred billion dollars. He is proposing that he and his colleagues should be permitted to experiment with fundamental values. This is the violence of the specialist. This kind of thing is familiar enough. What is new here is the scale. <br />

Our alternative is a postcolonial analysis of spaceflight that problematizes nationalist narratives like the frontier myth—we deprivilege borders and emphasize communities and transnational connections<br />

<br />
The case of the Indian space program specifically—but postcolonial studies in general—points to fruitful avenues of research for historians of technology grappling with the conundrums posted by multiple and conflicting narratives that make claims for the universal. A growing body of scholarship on the history, sociology, and anthropology of postcolonial science has rendered problematic such essentialist identifiers as &quot;Western&quot; and &quot;colonial&quot; when describing the development of science and technology [End Page 434] outside of Europe and the United States. This body of postcolonial theory questions the authority of Western knowledge systems as being objective and universally valid. Warwick Anderson recently underscored that &quot;postcolonial studies have enabled [a] sort of decentered, diasporic, or 'global' rewriting of earlier nation-centered imperial grand narratives.&quot; In other words, the field has rephrased &quot;modernity within the framework of 'globalisation.'&quot; 26 As such, postcolonial theory prompts us to reconsider received wisdom about existing power relations and to avoid distinct markers such as &quot;colonial&quot; and &quot;indigenous&quot; and instead focus on cultural and historical spaces where various types of interaction and exchange can occur. One way to begin such a project would be—in the words of postcolonial theorist Dipesh Chakrabarty—to &quot;provincialize&quot; Europe, i.e., to question the received structures that make it impossible for us to conceive of modernity (and by extension, one might argue, modernization) without reference to Europe. Chakrabarty argued that there is an &quot;asymmetric ignorance&quot; whereby historians within postcolonial locales must inevitably refer to Europe as a point of orientation without any expectation of the reverse.27 Postcolonial thought makes possible a provocative rethinking of both the Indian space program and the history of space exploration in general. Western evaluations of the Indian space program have reflexively been grounded in assumptions about the marriage of poverty and high technology, i.e., a rhetorical questionmark about why a nation so poor should have a space program at all. Because the project of space exploration has been a normatively Western idea, non-Western space programs such as the Indian one are understood in relation to aspirations for a Western modernity. But the Indian space program, as manifested in its technology, its goals, and its architects, represents a kind of modernity that is neither completely Western nor fully postcolonial—it is a vision of modernity that is decentered, constantly mutating, often contradictory, and globalized.28 We see these processes in India in the 1960s as an influential domestic constituency invested in space exploration &quot;sold&quot; their goals of self-reliance and social benefit to consecutive governments. This was not easy, given the significant amounts of international collaboration as well as domestic opposition from local advocacy groups who believed that India had more pressing concerns.29 By rhetorically linking the &quot;modern&quot; space program with the [End Page 435] alleviation of poverty, the architects of the space program not only overcame local opposition but created a new vision of space exploration that could exist in the postcolonial context. If previously the question had been &quot;Why should India have a space program when it is so poor?&quot; the answer was now &quot;India should have a space program precisely because it is poor.&quot; Here, on the one hand, the space program with its advanced technologies allows India to be modern, a Western metric of modernity that harks back to the European &quot;machines as the measure of men.&quot; On the other hand, the Indian space program fundamentally depends on the existence of those markers that Vikram Sarabhai, the founder of the effort, identified as less than modern—poverty, illiteracy, and economic underdevelopment. This built-in tension is complicated by other factors, including migration (both of people and knowledge) across borders, evolving aspirations, contingent metrics of &quot;how to be modern,&quot; and military and strategic questions. In a sense, what is modern about the Indian space program betrays complexities, contradictions, and considerations that are not easily parsed into conventional Western ideals of modernity. This new postcolonial vision of space exploration is as much part of the fabric of space history as the more well-known American and Soviet models grounded in the cold war.30 These multiple perspectives on space travel suggest that our view of the long history of spaceflight may benefit from a standpoint that no longer privileges borders—demarcations that create rigid analytical categories such as ownership, indigeneity, and proliferation. The Indian space program was at the intersection of multiple flows of knowledge from a variety of sources, including, of course, local expertise. Likewise, the history of spaceflight has been part of a consistent flow of knowledge and technology across (geographical) space and time—among Germans, Soviets, Americans, British, French, Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Israelis, Brazilians, and so on. By rethinking the relationship between modernity and the postcolonial state, postcolonial thought challenges us to rethink the connection between modernity and spaceflight, and, ultimately, to replace the &quot;national&quot; with the &quot;global&quot; when thinking of space exploration, an exercise that has become doubly important as dozens of developing countries in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East are now spending money on space exploration. Writing on the history of nuclear power, Itty Abraham has noted that &quot;practically no state travelled alone.&quot;31 Further, Abraham adds: [End Page 436] One of the most enduring tropes of nuclear histories is the idea that atomic energy programs are always national programs. The close relation between nuclear power and national power has led to the assumption that, for reasons of security especially, nuclear programs must be uniquely identified with particular countries. Official histories and scientists encourage this belief, for obvious parochial reasons, but it is rarely true. No atomic program anywhere in the world has ever been purely indigenous.32 Abraham's argument in favor of moving toward a global history of nuclear energy has much to offer to the case of rocketry and space exploration. The available evidence points strongly to similar processes of knowledge flows in the evolution of ballistic missiles and space technology. 33Every nation engaged in this technology has been a proliferator and has benefited from proliferation; this process of proliferation began in the 1920s when an informal and international network of spaceflight enthusiasts in Europe—particularly in Germany, Austria, France, Poland, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union—and in the United States generated the first substantive exchange on topics related to rocketry and space exploration.34 The development of sophisticated German ballistic missiles in the 1930s benefited from this discourse, as did parallel but less ambitious Soviet efforts to build rockets. In the aftermath of WorldWar II, the remainder of the German missile program—the most developed effort at that point—then fed into several different postwar missile programs, including, of course, those of the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Great Britain. The Soviet Union in turn passed both German and &quot;indigenous&quot; technology to the Chinese while the Americans did the same for the Japanese. By the mid-1970s, the &quot;space club&quot; included all of these countries, joined in the 1980s by India and Israel, both of which depended on flows from the United States, Western Europe, and the Soviet Union. Europe itself—in the form of international agreements—had many cooperative efforts that blurred distinctions of ownership, even as it gained the &quot;indigenous&quot; capacity for space activity in 1979.35 I am not suggesting that we should ignore nations, national identity, or vital indigenous innovation. But I believe that nation-centered approaches, useful and instructive as they were, occlude from view important phenomena [End Page 437] in the history of space exploration. My hope is that by deemphasizing ownership and national borders, the invisible connections and transitions of technology transfer and knowledge production will be become clear in an abundantly new way. Such an approach would inform a project encompassing the entire history of modern rocketry and space exploration, from the late nineteenth century to the present, focusing on Europe, America, Russia, and Asia. Most important, a global history of rocketry and space exploration would avoid the pitfalls of the &quot;discursive battles&quot; between nation-centered histories and open up the possibility to revisit older debates in the historiography of space exploration in entirely new ways. Taking a global history approach, one that favors decentering the conventional narrative, would allow historians to redirect their attentions in three ways: we can shift our gaze from nations to communities, from&quot;identification&quot; to identities, and from moments to processes. These three strategies, in one way or another, are inspired by the problems posed by historicizing the ambitions and achievements of emerging space powers, which operate in a postcolonial context where categories such as indigenous, modern, and national are problematic. I offer some brief examples of each below. In the space imagination, nations typically represent airtight constituencies despite evidence to the contrary that communities cutting across borders and cultures—national, institutional, and disciplinary—represent important actors and actions. The most obvious example here, of course, is the German engineers who formed the core of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency in the United States in the 1950s and who later directed the development of the Saturn V rocket that put Americans on the surface of the Moon. Wernher von Braun's team represented a unique mix of Germans and Americans who worked together with several different communities, from Boeing, North American Aviation (including its separate Space and Rocketdyne divisions), Douglas Aircraft Company, and International Business Machines. These communities represented scientists and engineers, the government and private industry, and customers and contractors. In the rush to draw up airtight national narratives, we inevitably tend to gloss over the ambiguities and flows among each of these communities. By highlighting communities, we can also avoid the reductive problems of essentialization (another way of talking about &quot;national styles&quot; of science and technology) that aspire to explain everything but fail to elucidate much at all.36 Instead, one might think in terms of fluid identities of scientists and engineers engaged in particular projects, identities which are not only tied to national identification but also regional, professional, cultural, religious, and educational markers, to name only a few categories. Using the perspective of mutable identity—different in different circumstances—we might be [End Page 438] able to understand more clearly the ways in which space exploration has not only been a project of national consideration but also the result of communities (or individuals) who identify with a whole host of other markers that are not connected to national claims. In other words, it is a way to prob-lematize the notion that space exploration represents national aspirations. Finally, space historians have tended to focus on moments in history that define the story. For example, we use the notion of &quot;achieving a capability&quot; (the space equivalent of &quot;going nuclear&quot;) as shorthand for encompassing a variety of complex processes. Whether it be the first indigenous launch of a satellite or the first test of a liquid hydrogen rocket engine, these moments become historical signposts, turning points, bereft of the messiness inherent in the process of innovation. As a result, space history slips into the comfort mode of &quot;what and when&quot; instead of the more illuminating path of &quot;how and why.&quot; The focus on process would highlight the ambiguities instead of the binary poles (success, failure) inherent in isolated moments, thus encompassing both the material event and how the event becomes constructed as a historical moment. All of these approaches also reinforce and foster the kind of social history that has become fundamental to most histories of technology but is largely absent in the literature on spaceflight, a lacuna explicable by the fetish for nation-centered cold-war geopolitics as the central organizing framework for most histories of space exploration. Barring a few notable examples, space historians have avoided in-depth inquiries into the lived experiences of large demographics such as engineers, servicemen and -women, military and intelligence personnel, launch crews, staff workers, and spouses and families of engineers. Likewise, little work has been done on public enthusiasm for the space program, mass campaigns in support of space exploration, and popular participation in programs usually identified with state-centered institutions.37 <br />

Each new space launch drastically increases the risk of space debris<br />

Since the start of the space age the problem of unwanted material or debris in space has been growing. Each space launch usually leaves considerably more than the desired satellite in orbit. Expended rocket boosters, attachment bolts, shields, solid rocket motor slag, and innumerable other items are placed into Earth orbit. Some of these decay (lose altitude) and burn up in the atmosphere - some are large enough to escape complete destruction by ablation and then may pose a potential hazard to life and property on the Earth's surface. In space, materials degrade and detach from satellites; stored energy in the form of unspent fuel and battery vapours may cause explosive rupture and fragmentation of space objects. Collisions between space objects at hypervelocity not only causes damage, but also creates thousands of other space objects (ie fragments of the original objects) which themselves then pose collision hazards to active spacecraft.<br />

Although the probability of catastrophic collisions caused by space debris has increased over the years, it remains relatively low and there have been only four known collisions between objects larger than ten centimeters (Wright 2009, 6). Nevertheless, the real concern is the predicted runaway growth of space debris over the coming decades. Such uncontrolled growth would prohibit the ability of satellites to provide their services, many of which are now widely used by the global community. Indeed, in a testimony to Congress for a hearing on “Keeping the Space Environment Safe for Civil and Commercial Uses,” the Director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, Dr. Scott Pace, stated that, …space systems such as satellite communications, environmental monitoring, and global navigation satellite systems are crucial to the productivity of many types of national and international infrastructures such as air, sea, and highway transportation, oil and gas pipelines, ﬁnancial networks, and global communications (Pace 2009).  <br />

Increased Potential for Global Conflict<br />
<br />
Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces. With so many possible permutations of outcomes, each with ample Revisiting the Future opportunity for unintended consequences, there is a growing sense of insecurity. Even so, history may be more instructive than ever. While we continue to believe that the Great Depression is not likely to be repeated, the lessons to be drawn from that period include the harmful effects on fledgling democracies and multiethnic societies (think Central Europe in 1920s and 1930s) and on the sustainability of multilateral institutions (think League of Nations in the same period). There is no reason to think that this would not be true in the twenty-first as much as in the twentieth century. For that reason, the ways in which the potential for greater conflict could grow would seem to be even more apt in a constantly volatile economic environment as they would be if change would be steadier. In surveying those risks, the report stressed the likelihood that terrorism and nonproliferation will remain priorities even as resource issues move up on the international agenda. Terrorism’s appeal will decline if economic growth continues in the Middle East and youth unemployment is reduced. For those terrorist groups that remain active in 2025, however, the diffusion of technologies and scientific knowledge will place some of the world’s most dangerous capabilities within their reach. Terrorist groups in 2025 will likely be a combination of descendants of long established groups_inheriting organizational structures, command and control processes, and training procedures necessary to conduct sophisticated attacks_and newly emergent collections of the angry and disenfranchised that become self-radicalized, particularly in the absence of economic outlets that would become narrower in an economic downturn. The most dangerous casualty of any economically-induced drawdown of U.S. military presence would almost certainly be the Middle East. Although Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is not inevitable, worries about a nuclear-armed Iran could lead states in the region to develop new security arrangements with external powers, acquire additional weapons, and consider pursuing their own nuclear ambitions. It is not clear that the type of stable deterrent relationship that existed between the great powers for most of the Cold War would emerge naturally in the Middle East with a nuclear Iran. Episodes of low intensity conflict and terrorism taking place under a nuclear umbrella could lead to an unintended escalation and broader conflict if clear red lines between those states involved are not well established. The close proximity of potential nuclear rivals combined with underdeveloped surveillance capabilities and mobile dual-capable Iranian missile systems also will produce inherent difficulties in achieving reliable indications and warning of an impending nuclear attack. The lack of strategic depth in neighboring states like Israel, short warning and missile flight times, and uncertainty of Iranian intentions may place more focus on preemption rather than defense, potentially leading to escalating crises. 36 Types of conflict that the world continues to experience, such as over resources, could reemerge, particularly if protectionism grows and there is a resort to neo-mercantilist practices. Perceptions of renewed energy scarcity will drive countries to take actions to assure their future access to energy supplies. In the worst case, this could result in interstate conflicts if government leaders deem assured access to energy resources, for example, to be essential for maintaining domestic stability and the survival of their regime. Even actions short of war, however, will have important geopolitical implications. Maritime security concerns are providing a rationale for naval buildups and modernization efforts, such as China’s and India’s development of blue water naval capabilities. If the fiscal stimulus focus for these countries indeed turns inward, one of the most obvious funding targets may be military. Buildup of regional naval capabilities could lead to increased tensions, rivalries, and counterbalancing moves, but it also will create opportunities for multinational cooperation in protecting critical sea lanes. With water also becoming scarcer in Asia and the Middle East, cooperation to manage changing water resources is likely to be increasingly difficult both within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world. <br />

And, “United States Federal Government should” means the debate is solely about the outcome of a policy established by governmental means<br />
Ericson, 03 (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts – California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater’s Guide, Third Edition, p. 4)<br />
<br />
The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions, each topic contains certain key elements, although they have slightly different functions from comparable elements of value-oriented propositions. 1. An agent doing the acting ---“The United States” in “The United States should adopt a policy of free trade.” Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of value, the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. The verb should—the first part of a verb phrase that urges action. 3. An action verb to follow should in the should-verb combination. For example, should adopt here means to put a program or policy into action though governmental means. 4. A specification of directions or a limitation of the action desired. The phrase free trade, for example, gives direction and limits to the topic, which would, for example, eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs, discussing diplomatic recognition, or discussing interstate commerce. Propositions of policy deal with future action. Nothing has yet occurred. The entire debate is about whether something ought to occur. What you agree to do, then, when you accept the affirmative side in such a debate is to offer sufficient and compelling reasons for an audience to perform the future action that you propose. <br />
<br />
The affirmative does not meet this because they read science fiction rather than affirming federal government action <br />
<br />
This is a voting issue – <br />
<br />
First, they are non-topical because they don’t defend the enactment of a policy by the United States federal government.  Topicality is an a-priori voting issue – as judge you are only allowed to affirm those policies within your jurisdiction dictated by the resolution.<br />
<br />
Second is fairness – it is impossible to be negative in their world. If the affirmative is not constrained by the topic, they get to just speak in general about the horrors of racism, talk about their personal experiences or interpret the resolution any way they see fit. <br />
<br />
Third, defending a topical affirmative is the only way to ensure that teams must research and debate both sides of an argument and learn from multiple perspectives about the topic. Forcing a rigid adherence to the topic facilitates switch-side debating – the advocacy of things you sometimes don’t necessarily believe in. Topic based education and ground should be prioritized because it encourages students to learn in-depth about new and important public policy issues each year.  <br />
<br />
This is a prior question that must be resolved first – it is a pre-condition for debate to occur<br />

(Ruth Lessl, Partisan Politics and Political heory, p. 181-2)<br />
The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The ambiguists must say &quot;no&quot; to-they must reject and limit-some ideas and actions. In what follows, we will also find that they must say &quot;yes&quot; to some things. In particular, they must say &quot;yes&quot; to the idea of rational persuasion. This means, first, that they must recognize the role of agreement in political contest, or the basic accord that is necessary to discord. The mistake that the ambiguists make here is a common one. The mistake is in thinking that agreement marks the end of contest-that consensus kills debate. But this is true only if the agreement is perfect-if there is nothing at all left to question or contest. In most cases, however, our agreements are highly imperfect. We agree on some matters but not on others, on generalities but not on specifics, on principles but not on their applications, and so on. And this kind of limited agreement is the starting condition of contest and debate. As John Courtney Murray writes: We hold certain truths; therefore we can argue about them. It seems to have been one of the corruptions of intelligence by positivism to assume that argument ends when agreement is reached. In a basic sense, the reverse is true. There can be no argument except on the premise, and within a context, of agreement. (Murray 1960, 10) In other words, we cannot argue about something if we are not communicating: if we cannot agree on the topic and terms of argument or if we have utterly different ideas about what counts as evidence or good argument. At the very least, we must agree about what it is that is being debated before we can debate it. For instance, one cannot have an argument about euthanasia with someone who thinks euthanasia is a musical group. One cannot successfully stage a sit-in if one's target audience simply thinks everyone is resting or if those doing the sitting have no complaints. Nor can one demonstrate resistance to a policy if no one knows that it is a policy. In other words, contest is meaningless if there is a lack of agreement or communication about what is being contested. Resisters, demonstrators, and debaters must have some shared ideas about the subject and/or the terms of their disagreements. The participants and the target of a sit-in must share an understanding of the complaint at hand. And a demonstrator's audience must know what is being resisted. In short, the contesting of an idea presumes some agreement about what that idea is and how one might go about intelligibly contesting it. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony. <br />
This solves better:<br />
Citizens are losing sight of political IR and policy discussions are being replaced with theoretical speculation- Only a methodology that embraces current political IR theory has the ability to understand IR and create politically relevant practices<br />
Lepgold and Nincic 2K1 (Joesph, associate professor of Government at Georgetown and Miroslav professor of Poly Sci at UC-Davis, Beyond the Ivory Tower: International Relations Theory and the Issue of Policy Relevance pg. 6-7) (SIR = Scholastic International Relations, the term for thinkers who discuss the theory behind real world processes) CS<br />
Unlike literature, pure mathematics, or formal logic, the study of inter- national relations may be valued largely for its practical implications and insights. SIR, like the major social-science disciplines, initially gained a firm foundation in academia on the assumption that it contributes to improved policy.9 It is part of what August Comte believed would constitute a new, “positive” science of society, one that would supersede the older tradition of metaphysical speculation about humanity and the social world. Progress toward this end has been incomplete as well as uneven across the social sciences. But, in virtually all of these fields, it has been driven by more than just curiosity as an end in itself. Tightening our grip on key social processes via improved understanding has always been a major incentive for new knowledge in the social sciences, especially in the study of international relations. This broad purpose covers a lot of specific ground. Policymakers want to know what range of effective choice they have, the likely international and domestic consequences of various policy decisions, and perhaps whether, in terms of more general interests and values, contemplated policy objectives are really desirable, should they be achievable. But the practical implications of international issues hardly end there. How wars start and end, the causes and implications of economic interdependence, and what leverage individ- ual states might have on trans-state problems greatly affects ordinary citizens’ physical safety, prosperity, and collective identity. Today, it is hard to think of any major public-policy issue that is not affected by a state’s or society’s relationships with other international actors. Because the United States looms so large within the international system, its citizens are sometimes unaware of the range and impact of international events and processes on their condition. It may take an experience such as the long gas lines in the 1970s or the foreign-inspired terrorist bombings in the 1990s to remind them how powerfully the outside world now impinges upon them. As Karl Deutsch observed, even the smallest states can no longer effectively isolate themselves, and even the largest ones face limits on their ability to change others’ behavior or values.11 In a broad sense, globalization The Theory-Practice Gap in International Relations means that events in many places will affect people’s investment opportu- nities, the value of their money, whether they feel that their values are safe or under attack, and perhaps whether they will be safe from attack by weap- ons of mass destruction or terrorism. These points can be illustrated by observing university undergraduates, who constitute one of the broadest categories of people who are potentially curious about IR. Unlike doctoral students, they care much less about po- litical science than about the substance of politics. What they seem to un- derstand is that the subject matter of SIR, regardless of the level of theoretical abstraction at which it is discussed, inherently has practical implications.<br />
Sci-fi empirically can’t understand or affect policy <br />
Berger 1976 – award winning science fiction author (July, Albert I., “ The Triumph of Prophecy: Science Fiction and Nuclear Power in the Post-Hiroshima Period”  Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 3, No. 2, JSTOR)<br />
This naivete about politics and preoccupation with technological solutions was the obverse of the prevailing SF distaste for politics. Politics had always had a bad press in the science-fiction magazines, being portrayed as the captive of technologically, if not socially reactionary special interests. The appalling scientific ignorance and prejudice displayed by Congress after Hiroshima, and its general unwillingness to be educated, merely compounded the problem in the eyes of science-fiction writers and readers. This distaste for politics was testified to not only by letters-to-the-editor in Astounding and the fan magazines but also by an article by W.B. de Graeff, &quot;Congress is too Busy&quot; (Sept 1946), detailing with a gleeful contempt the most mundane and ridiculous chores of a member of Congress. By 1950 even an old stalwart like E.E. Smith could take up nearly a third of a novel-First Lensman (not serialized; Fantasy Press 1950)-with a detailed account of an election in which military heroes act both as police forces and as candidates arrayed against a corrupt political machine. The use of conspicuously armed poll watchers and what amounts to a military coup are justified by the criminal tactics of the opposition. Smith's villains are supposed to be the pawns of a sinister conspiracy of aliens, but their methods are described as normal American practice.<br />

In science fiction, the ‘other’ as ‘alien’ is deployed to concretise the deeply divisive dichotomies of race and gender embedded in the repressive structures and relations of dominance and subordination. Modernity remains intact, the moral guardian of the future, whilst the ‘other’ emerges demonised and thus can be justifiably annihilated. ‘The centre,’ as John Rutherford has argued, ‘invests the “other” with its terrors. It is the threat of dissolution of self that ignites the irrational hatred and hostility as the centre struggles to assert its boundaries, that constructs self from not self.’2Of all the categories of cinema, ‘alien invader’ films are the most prolific and conservative for, as Susan Hayward notes, ‘They point at otherness as threatening to life and/or social mores’ and ‘represent the most “worrying” category of all with their innate potential for misogyny, racism and nationalistic chauvinism’.3 <br />

<br />
Science fiction explores space – ‘in a galaxy far, far away’, The Outer Limits, Space: Above and Beyond. It projects us into imagined futures – ‘Beam me up, Scottie.’ Yet as a genre the space that science fiction most intimately explores is interior and human; to tell future stories it recycles the structure and tropes of ancient narrative tradition and to devise dramatic tension it deploys issues and angst that are immediately present. The fiction in science fiction is the fiction of space, outer space, and time, future time. Far from being the essential object of its concern the devices of space and time are window dressing, landscape and backdrop. The ‘science’ offered by science fiction is populist dissection of the psyche of Western civilisation, its history, preoccupations and project of future domination – past, present and future. Science fiction is a time machine that goes nowhere, for wherever its goes it materialises the same conjunctions of the space-time continuum: the conundrums of Western civilisation. Science fiction shows us not the plasticity but the paucity of the human imagination that has become quagmired in the scientist industrial technological, culturo-socio-psycho babble of a single civilisational paradigm. Science fiction is the fiction of mortgaged futures. As a genre it makes it harder to imagine other futures, futures not beholden to the complexes, neuroses and reflexes of Western civilisation as we know it. ‘Houston, we have a problem.’<br />
<br />
Turn—The very essence of science fiction is purely western thought. This turns their case because SCI-FI instigates the same narrow vision of the future which it claims to solve.<br />

<br />
So the basic ingredients out of which science fiction has been fashioned exist everywhere, in different civilisations and cultures, in the past and the present. Yet science fiction, the genre as we know it, does not. Science fiction is a very particular possession of just one tradition – Western civilisation. It does not exist in India, China (leaving out the special case of Hong Kong), Indonesia or Egypt – countries with flourishing and -- ensive film industries.3Moreover, only one kind of science provides the backdrop for science fiction, while its creators, contributors and in large part its audience are drawn from the West. This particularity is not accidental. An examination of the structure, themes and dramatic devices of science fiction provides an explanation for this particular and necessary relationship. What distinguishes science fiction is a particular view of science; a scientistic view of humanity and culture; the recycling of distinctive narrative tropes and conventions of storytelling. In each case science fiction employs the particular constellations of Western thought and history and projects these Western perspectives on a pan-galactic scale. Science fiction re-inscribes Earth history, as experienced and understood by the West, across space and time. <br />

Science fiction links to their criticism, by creating the very doomsday discourse it tries to prevent.<br />

Science fiction has deep roots in the narrative tradition of Western Civilisation, but its most immediate impetus is horror, fear, disquiet and disaffection at the power of the human intellect. It begins with Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, who is not the monster (though that is, interestingly, the predominant popular misconception) but the scientist creator of the name less monster, Dr Frankenstein; and up the narrative thread where alchemists, magi, witches and wizards left off. Science fiction begins by viewing science as dabbling with dark arts and all their dangers. It begins as a nightmare Gothic horror story. Mary Shelley said she conceived the story in a nightmare, it was written as her contribution to a collective challenge Is used to the guests at a weekend party to produce ghost stories. Science fiction in all its guises has never shed the essential characteristic of an air of menace. In some senses the essence of the science and the futures such fiction imagines is pervasive, potential doom. Science fiction, from the out set, has been the narrative of dooms day scenarios.<br />
<br />
To maintain its status as a mainstream literary genre, Sience fiction must constantly Otherize the alien, therefore claiming no solvency.<br />

<br />
Alien presence is basic to science fiction. Yet, when science fiction makes the great leap of imagination and concludes we are not alone its speculation is mostly grounded in the present and past of Western civilisation. Outer space, distant galaxies, the whole universe is populated by fictional creatures intimately familiar from the narrative conventions of Western civilisation, springing almost unchanged from the pages of travel literature of the history of Western expansion on planet Earth. Alien presence is basic in another sense. It is the brooding menace of another kind of Gothic horror story. Alien creatures serve the purpose of ghosts, ghouls and things that go bump in the night – they are the dark antithesis that illuminates the patches of light within the structure of stories, throwing into relief what it is to be human. Aliens demonstrate what is not human the better to exemplify that which is human. Difference and otherness are the essence of aliens, for only then can they stiffen the sense of self and self-defence that completes the chain of science fiction as normative genre. Coming full circle, aliens are often devils incarnate, ready and willing to offer the Faustian bargain. Across space and time science fiction materialises the constellations of ideas and narrative tradition that personify and are distinctive of Western civilisation. Without aliens space and time, that is outer and future, would indeed be novel, unlike anything that had gone before. The possibilities of ethical questioning and morality plays would be limited, lacking the dynamics in which such questions present and have presented themselves within the history and experience of Western civilisation. <br />

The film unashamedly elevates American ideology as the last bastion of universal independence, so that in one swift move America becomes both ‘globo cop’ and ‘interstellar guardian’. This reification of American hegemony as the ‘end of history’4is arguably just about tolerable as a piece of Hollywood fiction but American foreign policy and her military presence in the Gulf is metaphorically and symbolically vindicated via the narrative of the film. Put another way Independence Day becomes a libratory tract emphasising the ‘moral’ right to obliterate ‘difference’ – to annihilate all that is not Western.<br />

As third-order simulacra, science fiction is not necessarily different from the technologies and the sciences it narrativizes, and in fact it creates the conditions for their possibility. In fact, science fiction is necessary in order for biotech and biomedicine to continue constructing their narratives of technological advancement and the increasing sophistication of a biotechnology of the population. In other words, the functions and attributes of genre science fiction (which still exist in genre science fiction, but which can now only belatedly keep up with developments in science and technology) have been incorporated by the technosciences. As a powerful political tool, science fiction enables the biotech industry to create a narrative of a bioinformatically based, disease-free, corporate-managed future. In doing so, it is also creating a history, a self-fulfilling narrative of progress. What is unique about the manifestation of science fiction at the opening of the biotech century is that science fiction is no longer the proper domain of culture (that is, of culture's critically commenting upon the intersection of society, science and technology). Instead, science fiction has come to be self-consciously embodied as part and parcel of the domains of biotech and biomedicine. To take two examples: researchers at the NASA Ames Center for Virtual Surgery explicitly utilize the rhetoric of science fiction in a language infused with the giddiness of new technologies. They clearly envision a future of telemedicine that would be at home in the Cyberpunk worlds of Gibson, Sterling or Cadigan .13 Their experiment in the spring of 1999 of a three-way, fully simulated, telesurgical collaboration is a concrete manifestation of what the discourse of science fiction can make possible. <br />

The problem is, the land of the free and home of the brave is in danger of becoming — not to put too fine a point on it — the land of the dunderhead, and my trip to Cape Canaveral, Fla., drove that point home. It's no secret that as a people, we're rapidly losing the basic fund of knowledge we need if we're going to function well in a complex world. Just last week, another dispiriting poll was released revealing how little some of us know about our national history. Only 58% of Americans can say with certainty what happened on July 4, 1776 — a figure that falls to a jaw-dropping 31% in the under-30 cohort. Fully 25% of Americans who do know that we seceded from some country or another to become a nation don't know what that former parent country was. This follows on the heels of other polls showing similar numbers of folks believing that we fought the Russians in World War II and beat them with the help of our stalwart German allies. Being historically illiterate is bad. Being scientifically illiterate, however, is even worse — if only because having a working knowledge of how the world operates is essential to understanding critical areas of national policy. Type the words &quot;global warming&quot; and &quot;hoax&quot; into Google and you get an appalling 10.1 million hits. The polls are all over the map on this one, but they show that rising numbers of Americans think climate science is fraudulent or exaggerated — up to 41% in one survey. It's not merely opinion to say that those people are simply wrong. There may be raging debates among scientists about the precise severity, mechanisms and trajectory of global warming, but the basic science is established and accepted, whether you want to admit it or not. Then of course there are the 18% of Americans who believe the sun revolves around Earth and the 28% who think the moon landings were faked. Google that last one and you're taken to sites that profess to be forums for political debate. Political debate? About faking the moon landings? This isn't the Roman Senate, folks, it's fantasyland. What got me thinking about all this was a stop I made after the launch at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex — a combination museum and theme park on the Cape Canaveral grounds. The center's special feature this season is called Sci-Fi Summer 2011 — and it delivers just what it promises. Adjacent to the rocket garden, with its full-size mock-ups of the U.S.'s most legendary boosters, is a massive maplike display comparing the sizes of the Saturn 1B, the Saturn 5, the Mercury Redstone, the space shuttle and the International Space Station to the Starship Enterprise. Which is fine, except that all the other spacecraft actually existed and the Enterprise, um, didn't. The spacesuits worn by Neil Armstrong, Gordon Cooper and other astronauts are similarly commingled throughout the exhibit with uniforms worn by the Klingons and Romulons. There is also an entire pavilion set aside for a Star Trek display. O.K., it's cranky to begrudge people a little fun and Star Trek is undeniably cool. But do we really not get enough fun and cool elsewhere? Is there anyone alive who thinks that what Americans need right now are more ways to divert and amuse ourselves? Mix Cooper with the Klingons or the shuttle Enterprise with the Starship Enterprise long enough and the kids who consume all this stuff will no longer be able to tell them apart. Scientific literacy is part of good citizenship. And when it comes to space science, you don't need a lick of fiction to make it fun. An engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who works in the interplanetary program once explained why he loves his job by saying, &quot;If you can't have a good time coming to work and building robots to send to Mars, give it up, man.&quot; The same used to be true of merely learning about such things. It must become true again if the U.S. is going to keep its edge.<br />
The US is not an empire-our economic ties and agreements with other countries don’t mean we’re trying to control them, it means we are interested in maintaining an integrated role in the global order and because we believe these ties are key to our own personal well-being.

Johnson also offers little beyond passing mention about the societies presumed to be under Washington's thumb. <br />
Domination and exploitation are, of course, not always self-evident. Military pacts and security partnerships are clearly part of the structure of U.S. global power, and they often reinforce fragile and corrupt governments in order to project U.S. influence. But countries can also use security ties with the United States to their own advantage. Japan may be a subordinate security partner, but the U.S.-Japan alliance also allows Tokyo to forgo a costly buildup of military capacity that would destabilize East Asia. Moreover, countries do have other options: they can, and often do, escape U.S. domination simply by asking the United States to leave. The Philippines did so, and South Korea may be next. The variety and complexity of U.S. security ties with other states makes Johnson's simplistic view of military hegemony misleading.<br />
Capitalism is Good – only capitalism sustains freedom and value to life<br />

[“The Myth of the Welfare State”, p. 42-43, Google Books <em> Reuben]<br />
<br />
The modernist welfare state is ultimately, if unknowingly, built on the logic of totalitarian collectivism: when the goal of the state becomes that of pursuing the common welfare, without basic constraints of custom, moral principle, or constitutional law, then the welfare of any individual or subgroup rapidly approaches zero. Thus, we eventually arrive at the logical conclusion of the egalitarian welfare state, the conclusion Rousseau and socialist revolutionaries in Europe reached two centuries ago: the equal welfare of all demands that the individual welfares of everyone be totally sacrificed to the state that is rhetorically committed to the common welfare. And so the Juggernaut of the modernist welfare state trundles onward, slowly but relentlessly crushing beneath its bureaucratic powers our ancient freedoms one after another--to serve the common welfare of all, of course. Today the businesspeople, the gas producers, and the steel makers; tomorrow the doctors; then the parents; and someday the entire world.  The opposite of the logic of totalitarian collectivism is the logic of individual freedom within the System of Natural Liberty. The logic of collectivism computes the individual welfare, if at all, in terms of the collective welfare, that is, in terms of aggregates like gross national product, income distribution, relative poverty, and, above all distributive justice--equality. The logic of individualist freedom does the opposite, that is, it computes the general welfare in terms of all the individuals' welfare as defined and experienced by the individuals. Certainly the individuals define their welfare in good part in terms derived from their family and community ties, in communion with their own consciences and with the embodiments of their consciences in the constitution; for we human beings are profoundly loving beings who identify with our ancestors, our communities, and our posterity. But it is we alone, acting as individuals, who can know in our hearts what is right and good for us and our loved ones. It is we alone who can most truthfully define our own welfare.  The American Constitution was built upon the logic of individual freedom. The American government was founded to promote the general welfare, but to the eighteenth-century classic liberals that meant the exact opposite of what the common welfare means to the American statists today. Because they assumed that welfare could only be defined individually, most Americans intended the government to promote the general welfare by remaining as small and weak as it could while serving the two obviously, specific, and explicitly bounded forms of general welfare: that of defense against foreign powers that wanted to impose absolutist tyranny on Americans and that against the domestic oppression of crime and rebellion. Thus it was that they discovered that revolutionary idea of individual freedom: minimizing the power of government will optimize the welfare of all. Liberty was both the greatest blessing in itself and the fount from which would spring all others by enabling individuals to use all their potentially vast spiritual energy and creativity. Thus it was that when Tocqueville visited America in the early 1830s, he found a remarkable &quot;absence&quot; of government and an equally remarkable high level of general welfare--a land of freedom and, thus, of peace and plenty.<br />

Capitalism key to ethics – gives individuals freedom to determine their own morality <br />
Romar, Lecturer in Management, ‘09<br />
[Journal of Business Ethics, “Noble Markets: The Noble/Slave Ethic in Hayek’s Free Market Capitalism”, p. 57-66, Google Scholar </em> Lack]<br />
Like Nietzsche, Hayek, though acutely aware of  the importance of ethics in a world based upon  maximum freedom, did not develop a complete  ethical theory to support the functioning of free  market capitalism. Like Nietzsche, Hayek does not  claim to know the meaning of morality or, in  Nietzsche’s case, good and evil.3 Beyond support for  the principles needed to anchor the functioning of  free markets and the institutions needed to support  them, Hayek left it to individual actors to develop  their own moral principles, so long as these did not  contradict those needed to support free markets. It  was not his intention to prescribe a detailed ethical  system to support free market capitalism because to  do so would violate his principle of freedom and  curtail the creativity of markets. Yet, the world described  by Hayek is one where individuals have  substantial power to control their destiny and seek  their own level, a world where talent and risk  dominate, a world governed by self interest, a world  where individuals have few responsibilities to others,  and a world driven by competition where reward  goes to the successful. He described a world open to  Nietzschean ethics.  In The Road to Serfdom (1994) and The Fatal  Conceit (1988) Hayek presents a powerful and eloquent  attack on twentieth century totalitarianism. In  The Road to Serfdom he argues that the socialist  experiment must inevitably lead to totalitarianism  and the complete elimination of individual liberty  and freedom. In the name of principles of social  justice, society installs a system of centralized social  and economic planning, substitutes collective decisions  for individual ones, and requires each person to  adopt an identical and complete set of social values.  Furthermore, to achieve its objectives, the socialist  state must determine in great detail the allocation of  resources and insure that each individual performs precisely his/her assigned role. Planned economies  must substitute collectivist thought, values and  behavior and eliminate any room for individualism.  Hayek labels this weltanschauung the ‘‘fatal conceit.’’  It is fatal because it cannot achieve its objectives  and it is conceit because it overestimates the  role of human rationality and man’s ability to control  social and economic processes. He sees constructivist  continental European philosophic thought, primarily  Cartesian rationalism, as the source of this error  (Hayek, 1948, pp. 9–10; 1973, pp. 9–12). This  philosophic tradition argues that man can understand  the world completely and, therefore, social and  economic processes can be understood completely  and molded to fit human will.  Hayek considers this a foolish, self-serving and  arrogant position.4 Certainly, humans have a powerful  intellect and reasoning skills. Human reason,  though powerful, has its limitations and cannot  completely understand with any certainty how human  institutions and social processes evolved and  how they operate. He views the evolution and  development of human institutions, be they money,  markets, or ethics as spontaneous, self-generating  orders. Systems, if you will, evolving gradually,  accidentally, on the basis of incremental change; not  as a result of human design. He labels this ‘‘between  instinct and reason.’’ Humans can understand to  some extent how human society evolved from clan  based societies into modern, complex ones based  upon individualism and abstract rules, but we cannot  know the processes or mechanisms of this evolution  in sufficient detail to bend them to our will. We can  tweak the social and moral systems but cannot  engineer them. Man can modify social processes and  their underlying ethical foundations; but, in the final  analysis, we must accept them as is.5  Since social process and institutions obey their  own set of evolutionary principles which man cannot  know completely, it is best for these to evolve  on their own, without much human interference. In  The Constitution of Liberty (1960) and Law, Legislation  and Liberty (3 vols., 1973, 1976, 1979) Hayek  develops his ideas about the proper principles of  economic and political organizations and their  underlying ethical foundations. The fundamental principle of social organization must be based upon  the principle of liberty, which may be defined as  ‘‘that condition of men in which coercion of some  by others is reduced as much as possible in society’’6  (Hayek, 1960, p. 11). Hayek’s conception of the  free, just and moral society is not one where there is  a complete absence of coercion but where coercion  is limited to those situations where it is required to  prevent a reduction in the liberty of others. Society  may use coercion to protect private property and to  secure individual rights and conditions which allow  each person the maximum amount of personal  freedom to make choices of their own. This is  accomplished through a limited set of abstract rules  ‘‘that apply equally to all’’ which protect private or  several property, enforce contracts, and prevent  fraud and deception’’ (Hayek, 1960, pp. 140, 141,  143, 155).  While Hayek is concerned with just and moral  principles of economic, political and social organization,  he views attempts to achieve ‘‘distributive  justice’’ as the root cause of the immorality brought  about by planned economies. In order to achieve the  desired goals, human behavior must be planned in  minute detail, thereby eliminating freedom of  choice. Achieving collectivist goals mean that there  can be no individual ones. Organizing to control  every outcome means there cannot be individual  choice. Social control means there will be little  individual control and it is all doomed because humans  cannot understand completely the mechanisms  needed to reach their objectives. The only solution  must be the free market and the minimal organizational  principles required for it to operate efficiently.  Since these are few and well known, it will be easier to succeed and create a just and moral society. Allow  the market free reign and the just and moral society  will follow according to its own principles.<br />

Capitalism prevents war – history proves<br />
Bernstein, Senior Writer @ Ayn Rand Institute, ‘2<br />

To understand the cause of war, consider the major wars of the 20th century. World War I was started by the dictatorial monarchies of Germany and Russia. Nazi Germany caused World War II by invading Poland. Totalitarian Soviet Russia repeatedly initiated war by first aligning with Hitler in the conquest of Poland, then by swallowing up Eastern Europe in 1945, and later by supporting the Communist invasion of South Korea.    And consider recent but less global conflicts: Saddam Hussein instigated the Persian Gulf War by conquering Kuwait. The Taliban, former dictators of Afghanistan, warred against other factions in Afghanistan and then spread its terror overseas by arming and abetting Osama bin Laden's attacks against the United States. Observe the pattern. It is the less free nations--those in which power is concentrated in the hands of the state at the expense of the individual--that attack their freer neighbors. Such statist regimes, which deny any rights to the individual, are the cause of history's most savage wars. Statist regimes launched the wars that ravaged much of the world in the 20th century. The reason why these regimes did so is not difficult to find. Dictators are in chronic war against their own people. Hitler murdered the Jews; Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot each murdered millions of businessmen, landowners and bourgeoisie; Milosevic slaughtered the Muslims, Saddam Hussein butchered the Kurds. In her seminal essay, &quot;The Roots of War,&quot; Ayn Rand observed: &quot;A country that violates the rights of its own citizens, will not respect the rights of its neighbors. Those who do not recognize individuals rights, will not recognize the rights of nations: a nation is only a number of individuals.&quot;    Statism is the cause of war. Statism rests on the idea that men can legitimately pursue their ends by initiating force against other men. In a free country such acts are properly regarded as criminal and punished by law; in a free country government uses force only in retaliation against those who initiate it. But statist regimes of all varieties--Nazi, Communist, Islamic Fundamentalist, etc.--initiate force ceaselessly against innocent victims, first within their own borders and then without. In a free country it is recognized that every individual has an inalienable right to his own life. In a statist country the individual exists in bondage to the state, his life to be sacrificed at the whim of the state.    Shamefully, the Nobel Committee has repeatedly awarded its Peace Prize to the bringers of war.    For example, it routinely bestows the prize on statists who condemn the United States--the world's freest, most individualistic country--while praising murderous Third World dictatorships. It awarded the 1994 prize to Yasser Arafat, the brutal dictator of the Palestinian Authority, who imposed a despotic regime on his own people and initiated a murderous war against the free citizens of Israel. Even worse, in 1973 it awarded the prize to Le Duc Tho, the North Vietnamese Communist, who, along with Ho Chi Minh and other Party leaders, imposed a vicious Communist dictatorship in North Vietnam that slaughtered at least 50,000 Vietnamese in the 1950s and then invaded and conquered South Vietnam. All told, the death toll caused by that Communist dictatorship and its warring totaled two million individuals.    If one admires men who cause war, one will ignore or vilify men who promote peace. Those who respect and support individual rights and political/economic freedom are the only true lovers of peace. Private capitalists and businessmen are outstanding examples. Business requires the barring of the initiation of force. Businessmen deal with one another peacefully, by means of trade, persuasion and voluntary contracts and agreements. Because businessmen respect the rights of all individuals, they have helped liberate the best minds to innovate, invent and advance, and thereby helped produce great general prosperity and peace. By helping to spread free trade across the globe, they have created peaceful relations among the individuals of many nations. Yet perversely, capitalists are denounced as exploiters of man. If we sincerely seek to attain the inestimable value that is world peace, it is individual rights and therefore capitalism that we must endorse. Capitalism is the only political-economic system that protects individual rights by banning the initiation of force. As Ayn Rand observed, it was capitalism that gave mankind its longest period of peace--an era in which there were no wars involving the entire civilized world--from the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914.  If we truly want to recognize and promote the cause of peace, let us award a peace prize to Capitalism.<br />

Environmentalists and globalization foes are united in their fear that greater population and consumption of energy, materials, and chemicals accompanying economic growth, technological change and free trade—the mainstays of globalization—degrade human and environmental well-being. Indeed, the 20th century saw the United States’ population multiply by four, income by seven, carbon dioxide emissions by nine, use of materials by 27, and use of chemicals by more than 100. Yet life expectancy increased from 47 years to 77 years. Onset of major disease such as cancer, heart, and respiratory disease has been postponed between eight and eleven years in the past century. Heart disease and cancer rates have been in rapid decline over the last two decades, and total cancer deaths have actually declined the last two years, despite increases in population. Among the very young, infant mortality has declined from 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1913 to just seven per 1,000 today. These improvements haven’t been restricted to the United States. It’s a global phenomenon. Worldwide, life expectancy has more than doubled, from 31 years in 1900 to 67 years today. India’s and China’s infant mortalities exceeded 190 per 1,000 births in the early 1950s; today they are 62 and 26, respectively. In the developing world, the proportion of the population suffering from chronic hunger declined from 37 percent to 17 percent between 1970 and 2001 despite a 83 percent increase in population. Globally average annual incomes in real dollars have tripled since 1950. Consequently, the proportion of the planet's developing-world population living in absolute poverty has halved since 1981, from 40 percent to 20 percent. Child labor in low income countries declined from 30 percent to 18 percent between 1960 and 2003. Equally important, the world is more literate and better educated than ever. People are freer politically, economically, and socially to pursue their well-being as they see fit. More people choose their own rulers, and have freedom of expression. They are more likely to live under rule of law, and less likely to be arbitrarily deprived of life, limb, and property. Social and professional mobility have also never been greater. It’s easier than ever for people across the world to transcend the bonds of caste, place, gender, and other accidents of birth. People today work fewer hours and have more money and better health to enjoy their leisure time than their ancestors. Man’s environmental record is more complex. The early stages of development can indeed cause some environmental deterioration as societies pursue first-order problems affecting human well-being. These include hunger, malnutrition, illiteracy, and lack of education, basic public health services, safe water, sanitation, mobility, and ready sources of energy. Because greater wealth alleviates these problems while providing basic creature comforts, individuals and societies initially focus on economic development, often neglecting other aspects of environmental quality. In time, however, they recognize that environmental deterioration reduces their quality of life. Accordingly, they put more of their recently acquired wealth and human capital into developing and implementing cleaner technologies. This brings about an environmental transition via the twin forces of economic development and technological progress, which begin to provide solutions to environmental problems instead of creating those problems. All of which is why we today find that the richest countries are also the cleanest. And while many developing countries have yet to get past the “green ceiling,” they are nevertheless ahead of where today’s developed countries used to be when they were equally wealthy. The point of transition from &quot;industrial period&quot; to &quot;environmental conscious&quot; continues to fall. For example, the US introduced unleaded gasoline only after its GDP per capita exceeded $16,000. India and China did the same before they reached $3,000 per capita. This progress is a testament to the power of globalization and the transfer of ideas and knowledge (that lead is harmful, for example). It's also testament to the importance of trade in transferring technology from developed to developing countries—in this case, the technology needed to remove lead from gasoline. This hints at the answer to the question of why some parts of the world have been left behind while the rest of the world has thrived. Why have improvements in well-being stalled in areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world? The proximate cause of improvements in well-being is a “cycle of progress” composed of the mutually reinforcing forces of economic development and technological progress. But that cycle itself is propelled by a web of essential institutions, particularly property rights, free markets, and rule of law. Other important institutions would include science- and technology-based problem-solving founded on skepticism and experimentation; receptiveness to new technologies and ideas; and freer trade in goods, services—most importantly in knowledge and ideas. In short, free and open societies prosper. Isolation, intolerance, and hostility to the free exchange of knowledge, technology, people, and goods breed stagnation or regression. <br />

Where Levinas and his family were victims of Nazism, Habermas was pulled into the Hitler Youth. Both thinkers emerged from the nightmare of Nazism deeply concerned about justification: Levinas with the ethical failure of metaphysics, Habermas with the absolute necessity of communicative rationality. If it sounds like these two concerns are in tension with one another, that’s understandable, because we have been taught to see absolutism and relativism as opposites. For Habermas, however, absolutism and relativism are two sides of the same coin: Both represent a failure to live up to the norm of communicative rationality. In the case of absolutism, communication is cut off in favor of authoritative pronouncements. In the case of relativism, rationality is abandoned, the proverbial baby thrown out with the bathwater. The Nazis were absolutists, but this absolutism rested on an abandonment of rational processes. In a world where we cannot arrive at truth through rational consensus, we are left with the will to power as the only possible determinant.<br />

Debate is a dialogue is key to check back dogmatism and allows real-world activism<br />
Galloway 2007 (Ryan Galloway, Samford Debate Coach, Professor of Communication Studies at Samford, Contemporary Argumentation and Debate, Vol. 28, 2007, LEQ) <br />
Such tolerance is predictable since debate is firmly grounded in respect for the other through the creation of a fair dialogue. Ironically, opponents of a debate as dialogue risk falling prey to dogmatism and the requisite failure to respect potential middle grounds. Perceiving the world through the lens of contingency and probability can be beneficial to real-world activism when its goal is creating consensus out of competing interests. The anti-oppression messages of critical teams would benefit from a thorough investigation of such claims, and not merely an untested axiological assumption. <br />

<br />
Statements as clear-cut as these are, however, rare in the academic postmodernist literature. More often one finds assertions that are ambiguous but can nevertheless be interpreted (and quite often are interpreted) as implying what the foregoing quotations make explicit: that science as I have defined it is an illusion, and that the purported objective knowledge provided by science is largely or entirely a social construction. For example, Katherine Hayles, professor of English at UCLA and former president of the Society for Literature and Science, writes the following as part of her feminist analysis of uid mechanics: Despite their names, conservation laws are not inevitable facts of nature but constructions that foreground some experiences and marginalize others. . . . Almost without exception, conservation laws were formulated, developed, and experimentally tested by men. If conservation laws represent particular emphases and not inevitable facts, then people living in di erent kinds of bodies and identifying with different gender constructions might well have arrived at di erent models for [fluid] flow. (What an interesting idea: perhaps: people living in different kinds of bodies&quot; will learn to see beyond those masculinist laws of conservation of energy and momentum.) And Andrew Pickering, a prominent sociologist of science, asserts the following in his otherwise-excellent history of modern elementary-particle physics: [G]iven their extensive training in sophisticated mathematical techniques, the preponderance of mathematics in particle physicists' accounts of reality is no more hard to explain than the fondness of ethnic groups for their native language. On the view advocated in this chapter, there is no obligation upon anyone framing a view of the world to take account of what twentieth-century science has to say. But let me not spend time beating a dead horse, as the arguments against postmodernist relativism are by now fairly well known - rather than plugging own writings, let me suggest the superb book by Canadian philosopher of science James Robert Brown, Who Rules in Science?: An Opinionated Guide to the Wars. Suffice it to say that postmodernist writings systematically confuse truth with claims of truth, fact with assertions of fact, and knowledge with pretensions to knowledge - and then sometimes go so far as to deny that these distinctions have any meaning. Now, it's worth noting that the postmodernist writings I have just quoted all come from the 1980s and early 1990s. In fact, over the past decade, academic postmodernists and social constructivists seem to have backed off the most extreme views that they previously espoused. Perhaps I and like-minded critics of postmodernism can take some small credit for this, by initiating a public debate that shed a harsh light of criticism on these views and forced some strategic retreats. But most of the credit, I think, has to be awarded to George W. Bush and his friends, who have shown just where science-bashing can lead in the real world. Nowadays, even sociologist of science Bruno Latour, who spent several decades stressing the so-called “social construction of scientific facts&quot;, laments the ammunition he fears he and his colleagues have given to the Republican right-wing, helping them to deny or obscure the scientific consensus on global warming, biological evolution and a host of other issues. 14 He writes: While we spent years trying to detect the real prejudices hidden behind the appearance of objective statements, do we now have to reveal the real objective and incontrovertible facts hidden behind the illusion of prejudices? And yet entire Ph.D. programs are still running to make sure that good American kids are learning the hard way that facts are made up, that there is no such thing as natural, unmediated, unbiased access to truth, that we are always prisoners of language, that we always speak from a particular standpoint, and so on, while dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives. That, of course, is exactly the point I was trying to make back in 1996 about socialconstruction talk taken to subjectivist extremes. I hate to say I told you so, but I did. As did, several years before me, Noam Chomsky, who recalled that in a not-so-distant past, Left intellectuals took an active part in the lively working class culture. Some sought to compensate for the class character of the cultural institutions through programs of workers' education, or by writing best-selling books on mathematics, science, and other topics for the general public. Remarkably, their left counterparts today often seek to deprive working people of these tools of emancipation, informing us that the “project of the Enlightenment&quot; is dead, that we must abandon the “illusions&quot; of science and rationality - a message that will gladden the hearts of the powerful, delighted to monopolize these instruments for their own use.<br />

Representing global threats attention to global affairs – The alternative makes crisis-driven responses inevitable<br />
<br />
Ungar, president – Goucher College, 2005 [sanford, “compassion fatigue: the next wave?”, winter, www.goucher.edu/x4726.xml]<br />
<br />
There is a temptation to worry that before long, we will be hit by one more severe case of what has come to be known as “compassion fatigue”—a deadening of our sensibilities by the unrelenting bombardment of shallow and sensationalist media coverage of disease, famine, death, and war. Susan D. Moeller, a well-traveled observer who now teaches at the University of Maryland, has written tellingly of this phenomenon. “Through a choice of language and images,” she says, “the newest event is represented as more extreme than a similar past situation.” When we use the same extreme words to describe very different events, we undermine our ability to differentiate among them. Our sense of tragedy and cataclysm can be ratcheted only so high before we simply become overwhelmed. Some news organizations try to hold our attention by personalizing the events—pointing out, for example, that U.S. citizens perished in the tsunami, or drawing comparisons between this disaster overseas and others closer to home. But eventually, a limit is reached, and our ability to identify and sympathize disappears. Reporting the more troubling events of the world without turning people off is a tricky proposition, even when it’s done well. I recently attended a gathering of higher education leaders that was addressed by a well-regarded political pundit from Washington. He was sharply critical of my alma mater, National Public Radio, for its overcoverage of international problems. “Why, to listen to NPR,” he complained, “you would think that there is trouble everywhere. It’s exhausting.” Visitors from across the country—sufferers all from compassion fatigue, I suppose—nodded their heads in agreement. “Well,” I said, as I attempted to confront him later, “there really is a lot to worry about in the world, and someone has to call our attention to it.” He was not about to be persuaded, preferring instead to focus on the customary agenda of parochial issues facing Americans. There’s a real danger in that attitude. If we allow our exhaustion to keep us from thinking about global concerns, we risk ignoring some important issues that may deserve a place in our consciousness alongside our domestic debates. By now it should be obvious that events and conditions around the world can have a profound impact on Main Street America. One would think there is plenty of evidence to make the point: the crisis- inspired fluctuation in gasoline prices at the pump; the international shortage of steel and concrete due to the construction boom in China; and the ebb and flow of immigration to the United States on the basis of circumstances in Mexico and Central America, among other places. Not to mention the consequences we have all experienced, in varying ways and to varying degrees, as a result of the Iraq war.                                                                              The tsunami has ramifications for Americans beyond what might seem immediately apparent. It has been suggested that American generosity toward these countries with large Muslim populations could have an important restorative effect on the United States’ image throughout the Muslim world. It’s a shame it took a catastrophe like this to get us interested in what’s going on there. Perhaps if we paid closer attention to the concerns of others over a sustained period of time, we would gain a better understanding of the global disparities that breed problems like terrorism—and, in the process, go a long way toward making the world safer for everyone. In the heat of political battle, in the midst of some of our own legitimate preoccupations, it may have become more difficult to sustain the argument that Americans’ lives are meaningfully affected by poverty, disease, and tragedy in distant, hard-to-pronounce places. But we must not turn our attention away, and we must demand that those we entrust to report the news be not only vigilant, but also responsible, in their presentation of global events. Otherwise, we will be doomed to await the tsunamis of history, literal and figurative, to help us figure out what is really going on.<br />

Rejecting strategic predictions of threats makes them inevitable—decisionmakers will rely on preconceived conceptions of threat rather than the more qualified predictions of analysts<br />
<br />
Fitzsimmons, 07  (Michael, Washington DC defense analyst, “The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning”, Survival, Winter 06-07, online)<br />
<br />
But handling even this weaker form of uncertainty is still quite challeng-  ing. If not sufficiently bounded, a high degree of variability in planning factors  can exact a significant price on planning. The complexity presented by great  variability strains the cognitive abilities of even the most sophisticated decision-  makers.15 And even a robust decision-making process sensitive to cognitive  limitations necessarily sacrifices depth of analysis for breadth as variability and  complexity grows. It should follow, then, that in planning under conditions of  risk, variability in strategic calculation should be carefully tailored to available  analytic and decision processes.  Why is this important? What harm can an imbalance between complexity  and cognitive or analytic capacity in strategic planning bring? Stated simply,  where analysis is silent or inadequate, the personal beliefs of decision-makers  fill the void. As political scientist Richard Betts found in a study of strategic sur-  prise, in ‘an environment that lacks clarity, abounds with conflicting data, and  allows no time for rigorous assessment of sources and validity, ambiguity allows  intuition or wishfulness to drive interpretation ... The greater the ambiguity, the  greater the impact of preconceptions.’16 The decision-making environment that  Betts describes here is one of political-military crisis, not long-term strategic  planning. But a strategist who sees uncertainty as the central fact of his environ-  ment brings upon himself some of the pathologies of crisis decision-making.  He invites ambiguity, takes conflicting data for granted and substitutes a priori  scepticism about the validity of prediction for time pressure as a rationale for  discounting the importance of analytic rigour.  It is important not to exaggerate the extent to which data and ‘rigorous  assessment’ can illuminate strategic choices. Ambiguity is a fact of life, and  scepticism of analysis is necessary. Accordingly, the intuition and judgement of  decision-makers will always be vital to strategy, and attempting to subordinate  those factors to some formulaic, deterministic decision-making model would be  both undesirable and unrealistic. All the same, there is danger in the opposite  extreme as well. Without careful analysis of what is relatively likely and what  is relatively unlikely, what will be the possible bases for strategic choices? A  decision-maker with no faith in prediction is left with little more than a set of  worst-case scenarios and his existing beliefs about the world to confront the  choices before him. Those beliefs may be more or less well founded, but if they  are not made explicit and subject to analysis and debate regarding their application to particular strategic contexts, they remain only beliefs and premises, rather than rational judgements. Even at their best, such decisions are likely to  be poorly understood by the organisations charged with their implementation.  At their worst, such decisions may be poorly understood by the decision-makers  themselves<br />

A. Uniqueness – Prompt Global Strike is dead now due to lack of launch vehicles – START limited the use of missiles<br />
<br />
Brookes 2010 – American Enterprise Institute (Peter, Senior Fellow for National Security Affairs [<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11090:http://www.realclearpolitics.com/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11090 --> articles/2010/05/15/a_late_look_at_a_troubling_treaty_105593.html] AD: 6/30/10)JM<br />

That's right: Moscow can actually raise the number of its launch/delivery platforms under new START. In other words, the &quot;reduction&quot; in START applies mostly to us . . .   * US conventional warheads on ICBMs are counted toward the treaty's nuclear-warhead limit. This would strangle Prompt Global Strike -- a new ICBM armed with a non-nuclear payload that could be used globally on short notice.      That sort of quick, reach-out-and-touch-you capability would sure be nice if you knew where Osama bin Laden was going to be in an hour but didn't have any forces nearby.  The same is true for other quick-turnaround military scenarios that don't require nukes, such as taking out a WMD-armed ballistic missile ready for launch or vaporizing some counterspace weapons before they strike your satellites. <br />

B. Link - ORS allows the U.S. to develop a PGS system – it provides a launch vehicle<br />

<br />
Development of responsive space may in turn enable new concepts. We could use a highly responsive and inexpensive space-launch capability to precisely deliver conventional ordnance anywhere in the world (a Prompt Global Strike system). Low-cost spacecraft could enable space systems to provide direct support to the operational and tactical levels of warfare, as envisioned by the Air Force's concept document on joint war-fighting space. (16) Development of quick-response spacecraft capable of augmenting existing capabilities might allow transition to an expeditionary space forces concept whereby we deploy the full system capability only when needed. Counterspace missions will benefit from improvements to small spacecraft and responsive-launch technologies associated with ORS. Ultimately, technologies that improve the responsiveness of new missions and small spacecraft will transform the way we perform traditional space missions.<br />

C. The Impact - PGS kills nonproliferation efforts leading to Taiwanese conflict. <br />
<br />
Davis 2006 - former executive director of the British American Security Information Council [Ian Davis, Ph.D., independent human security and arms control consultant, , and Robin Dodd, researcher at BASIC, June 2006 [BASIC Paper No. 51, US ‘Prompt Global Strike’ Capability: A New Destabilising Sub-State Deterrent in the Making? www.basicint.org/pubs/Papers/BP51.pdf, BBQ]<br />
<br />
The PGS capability also raises serious non-proliferation issues. First, it is likely to lead to a new arms race in ballistic missiles and countermeasures as other countries seek to match the US system and/or seek to protect their sovereignty by building weapon systems to counter US capabilities. It seems likely, for example, that other nuclear powers, such as China and Russia, would embark on similar SLBM and ICBM conversion projects. This could in turn ratchet up the potential for major armed conflict in areas, such as the Taiwan Straits, where tensions already run high. Second, PGS clearly undermines ballistic missile non-proliferation efforts, such as the 2002 Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation, which calls for greater restraint in developing, testing, using, and spreading ballistic missiles.22 At the signing of the Code, John Bolton, then US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, affirmed US support for it, but also highlighted a number of qualifying factors and reservations. One such reservation concerning pre-launch notifications was that the United States ‘reserves the right in circumstances of war to launch ballistic missile and space-launch vehicles without prior notification’.23 If the US administration is also asserting its ‘right’ to pre-emptive launch of a PGS capability the Code is as good as dead and buried. Third, it will lower the threshold of use for such weapons. And as Steve Andreason, a former US Nation Security Council staffer has pointed out: “Long-range ballistic missiles have never been used in combat in 50 years”. But once the United States starts indicating that it views these missiles as no different than any other weapon, “other nations will adopt the same logic”, he said.24 4 <br />

<br />
The main argument for US weaponization of space turns on the inherent vulnerability of space assets and the fundamental need for them to ensure national security and prevent another Pearl Harbor. Space-based weapons and ASAT systems seem to reduce vulnerability either through active defense or deterrence (though that assertion becomes questionable if one takes into account the likely weapons race that would result). They do nothing, however, to address the dependence of military forces upon such systems and create a requirement for a permanent “global fortress” in space. But recently, near-space technologies such as high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles have shown potential for reducing military dependence upon space-based assets by performing command and control, communication, and ISR missions similar to those conducted by satellites.42 Sensible policy making requires debating the implications of trying to directly defend space assets versus developing alternative military capabilities that would reduce our military reliance upon space and thus diminish the attractiveness of space assets as targets for our adversaries. Though long-term investments, both space-based defenses and near-space vehicles create very different potentials for US space policy. Uncontested control of the high ground of space seems tempting, especially for a superpower. It is unrealistic to base US policy on this school of thought, however, due to the ability of other spacefaring states to counter US interests by developing their own space weapons and beginning a new arms race—or simply bypassing deployed defenses. 43 Though stable, current US space policy cannot last without a strong diplomatic structure. The rise of another nation to challenge the United States in space will surely alter the status quo in a manner unacceptable to us. Bruce DeBlois articulates a better choice: “The decision to weaponize space does not lie within the military (seeking short-term military advantage in support of national security) but at the higher level of national policy (seeking long-term national security, economic well-being, and world­wide legitimacy of US constitutional values).”44 This view uses the current US ability to lead negotiations from a position of authority and power to ensure the creation of rules of the road and, eventually, treaties that will protect US space interests in the future. Combined with existing passive defenses and the development of near-space defenses for addressing security vulnerabilities and requirements, a “space sanctuary” provides economic, political, and even security advantages.<br />

The Aff’s vision of space as a realm to be controlled results in an extension of violence and militaristic domination—This turns the aff by encouraging the very anti-democratic wars they hope to prevent<br />

MacDonald 07, Fraser MacDonald, Professor of Anthropology, Geography, and Environmental Studies at Melbourne University in Australia, “Anti-Astropolitik – outer space and the orbit of geography,” Progress in Human Geography, 2007, Pages 592-615. <br />
<br />
Two things should now be clear. First, outer space is no longer remote from our everyday lives; it is already profoundly implicated in the ordinary workings of economy and society. Second, the import of space to civilian, commercial and, in particular, military objectives, means there is a great deal at stake in terms of the access to and control over Earth’s orbit. One cannot overstate this last point. The next few years may prove decisive in terms of establishing a regime of space control that will have profound implications for terrestrial geopolitics. It is in this context that I want to briefly introduce the emerging field of astropolitics, defined as ‘the study of the relationship between outer space terrain and technology and the development of political and military policy and strategy’ (Dolman, 2002: 15). It is, in both theory and practice, a geopolitics of outer space. Everett Dolman is one of the pioneers of the ﬁeld. An ex-CIA intelligence analyst who teaches at the US Air Force’s School of Advanced Airpower Fraser MacDonald: Anti-Astropolitik outer space and the orbit of geography 607 Studies , he publishes in journals that are perhaps unfamiliar to critical geographers, like the modestly titled Small Wars and Insurgencies. As what follows is uniformly critical of Dolman’s work, I should say that his Astropolitik: classical geopolitics in the space age (Dolman, 2002) is unquestionably a signiﬁcant book: it has deﬁned a now vibrant field of research and debate. Astropolitik draws together a vast literature on space exploration and space policy, and presents a lucid and accessible introduction to thinking strategically about space. (In the previous section I drew heavily on Dolman’s description of the astropolitical environment.) My critique is not founded on scientiﬁc or technical grounds but on Dolman’s construction of a formal geopolitics designed to advance and legitimate the unilateral military conquest of space by the United States. While Dolman has many admirers among neoconservative colleagues in Washington think-tanks, critical engagements (eg, Moore, 2003; Caracciolo, 2004) have been relatively thin on the ground. Dolman’s work is interesting for our purposes here precisely because he draw’s on geography’s back catalogue of strategic thinkers, most prominently Halford Mackinder, whose ideas gained particular prominence in America in the wake of the Russian Sputnik (Hooson, 2004: 377). But Dolman is not just refashioning classical geopolitics in the new garb of ‘astropolitics’; he goes further and proposes an ‘Astropolitik ’ – ‘ a simple but effective blueprint for space control’ (p. 9) – modelled on Karl Hausofer’s Geopolitik as much as Realpolitik. Showing some discomfort with the impeccably fascist pedigree of this theory, Dolman cautions against the ‘misuse’ of Astropolitik and argues that the term ‘is chosen as a constant reminder of that past, and as a grim warning for the future’ (Dolman, 2002: 3). At the same time, however, his book is basically a manual for achieving space dominance. Projecting Mackinder’s famous thesis on the geographical pivot of history (Mackinder, 1904) onto outer space, Dolman argues that: ‘who controls the Lower Earth Orbit controls near-Earth space. Who controls near-Earth space dominates Terra [Earth]. Who dominates Terra determines the destiny of humankind.’ Dolman sees the quest for space as already having followed classically Mackinderian principles (Dolman, 2002: 87). Like Mackinder before him, Dolman is writing in the service of his empire. ‘Astropolitik like Realpolitik’ he writes, ‘is hardnosed and pragmatic, it is not pretty or uplifting or a joyous sermon for the masses. But neither is it evil. Its benevolence or malevolence become apparent only as it is applied, and by whom’ (Dolman, 2002: 4). Further inspiration is drawn from Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose classic volume The inﬂuence of seapower upon history, has been widely cited by space strategists (Mahan, 1890; Gray, 1996; see also Russell, 2006). Mahan’s discussion of the strategic value of coasts, harbours, well-worn sea paths and chokepoints has its parallel in outer space (see France, 2000). The implication of Mahan’s work, Dolman concludes, is that ‘the United States must be ready and prepared, in Mahanian scrutiny, to commit to the defense and maintenance of these assets, or relinquish them to a state willing and able to do so’ (Dolman, 2002: 37). The primary problem for those advancing Astropolitik is that space is not a lawless frontier. In fact the legal character of space has long been enshrined in the principles of the OST and this has, to some extent, prevented it from being subject to unbridled interstate competition. ‘While it is morally desirable to explore space in common with all peoples’, writes Dolman without conviction, ‘even the thought of doing so makes weary those who have the means’ (Dolman, 2002: 135). Thus, the veneer of transcendent humanism with regard to space gives way to brazen self-interest. Accordingly, Dolman describes the res communist consensus 7 of the OST as ‘a tragedy’ that has removed any legal incentive for the exploitation of space (p. 137). Only a res nullius 8 legal order could construct space as ‘proper objects for which states may compete’ (p. 138). Under the paradigm of res nullius and Astropolitik, the moon and 608 Progress in Human Geography 31(5) other celestial bodies would become potential new territory for states. Here Dolman again parallels Karl Hausofer’s Geopolitik. Just as Hausofer desired a break from the Versailles Treaty (Ó Tuathail, 1996: 45), Dolman wants to see the USA withdraw from the OST, making full speed ahead for the moon (see also Hickman and Dolman, 2002). Non-spacefaring developing countries need not worry about losing out, says Dolman, as they ‘would own no less of the Moon than they do now’ (2002: 140). To his credit, Dolman does give some attention to the divisive social consequences of this concentrated power. Drawing on earlier currents of environmental determinism and on the terrestrial model of Antarctic exploration, he ponders the characteristics of those who will be ﬁrst to colonize space. They will be ‘highly educated, rigorously trained and psychologically screened for mental toughness and decision-making skills, and very physically ﬁ t’; ‘the best and brightest of our pilots, technicians and scientists’; ‘rational, given to scientific analysis and explanation, and obsessed with their professions’ (p. 26). In other words, ‘they are a superior subset of the larger group from which they spring’ (p. 27). As if this picture is not vivid enough, Dolman goes on to say that colonizers of space ‘will be the most capably endowed (or at least the most ruthlessly suitable, as the populating of America and Australia … so aptly illustrate[s])’ (p. 27; my emphasis). ‘Duty and sacriﬁce will be the highest moral ideals’ (p. 27). Society, he continues, must be prepared ‘to make heroes’ of those who undertake the risk of exploration (p. 146). At the same time, ‘the astropolitical society must be prepared to forego expenditures on social programs … to channel funds into the national space program. It must be embued with the national spirit’ (p. 146). Dolman slips from presenting what would be merely a ‘logical’ outworking of Astropolitik to advocating that the United States adopt it as their space strategy. Along the way, he acknowledges the full anti-democratic potential of such concentrated power, detaching the state from its citizenry: the United States can adopt any policy it wishes and the attitudes and reactions of the domestic public and of other states can do little to challenge it. So powerful is the United States that should it accept the harsh Realpolitik doctrine in space that the military services appear to be proposing, and given a proper explanation for employing it, there may in fact be little if any opposition to a fait accompli of total US domination in space. (Dolman, 2002: 156) Although Dolman claims that ‘no attempt will be made to create a convincing argument that the United States has a right to domination in space’, in almost the next sentence he goes on to argue ‘that, in this case, might does make right’, ‘the persuasiveness of the case’ being ‘based on the self-interest of the state and stability of the system’ (2002: 156; my emphasis). Truly, this is Astropolitik: a veneration of the ineluctable logic of power and the permanent rightness of those who wield it. If it sounds chillingly familiar, Dolman hopes to reassure us with his belief that ‘the US form of liberal democracy … is admirable and socially encompassing’ (p. 156) and it is ‘the most benign state that has ever attempted hegemony over the greater part of the world’ (p. 158). His sunny view that the United States is ‘willing to extend legal and political equality to all’ sits awkwardly with the current suspension of the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay as well as in various other ‘spaces of exception’ (see Gregory, 2004; Agamben, 2005). <br />

Conclusion: (bare) life under empire of the future In his Astropolitik Dolman calls upon U.S. defense policy-makers to weaponize orbital space so as to enhance U.S. hegemony over the planet. He does not address the astropolitical issues we have discussed here about what impact a space-based hegemony would have on the structure of the international system. Dolman, however, is confident that America would be responsible in using this awesome power to promote democracy and global capitalism. Setting aside the very contentious issues of whether or not America should be involved in &quot;promoting&quot; democracy and capitalism and whether or not current U.S. hegemony has been beneficial for the Earth's population, the moral and political implications of a space-based empire are not nearly as clear-cut as Dolman makes them out to be. One of the fundamental principles of classical geopolitics was that sea-based empires (such as Athens, Britain, and America) tended to be more democratic than land-based empires (such as Sparta, China, and Rome). The reason for this is that sea-based empires needed to disperse their forces away from the imperial center to exert control, whereas land-based empires exercised power through occupation. Military occupations made it increasingly likely that the army would seize power whenever it came into conflict with the government. Classical geopolitical theorist Otto Hintze argued that land powers tended toward dictatorships (Hintze 1975; see also Deudney 2007). Dolman builds upon these classical geopolitical insights by arguing that because space-based empires would not be able to occupy states, military coups would be less likely and democracy would be more likely (Dolman 2002a: 29). There is, however, a significant difference between space power and sea power. While neither is capable of occupying territory on its own, space power is capable of controlling territory from above through surveillance and precise projection of force control without occupation. While space power may not result in the dictatorships normally associated with land power, it would be a useful tool is establishing a disciplinary society over all the Earth. A second obstacle to the benevolent space-based empire that Dolman imagines is the lack of counterbalancing powers. Under the two other modes of protection/security we have considered here -the real-statist and the federal-republican there are checks that prevent even the most powerful scates in the system from dominating all the other units. In real-statism, the sovereignty of states means that any potential hegemon would have to pay a significant cost in blood and treasure to conquer other states. While this cost may not be enough to dissuade a superpower from conquering one or two states, the cumulative cost of conquest and occupation makes total domination over the Earth unlikely. In the federal-republican model, the collective security regime of the entire system should act as a sufficient deterrent to prevent one state from dominating the others. Conversely, in a space-based empire the entire world is placed under direct surveillance from above. There is no point on Earth where the imperial center cannot project force on very short notice. So long as the space-based empire can deny access to space to rival powers through missile defense and anti-satellite technologies, there is no possibility that other states can directly counteract this force. As such, the space-based empire erases all boundaries and places the Earth under its control. While the possibility to resist such an empire will exist, the dynamics of resistance will be considerably altered. Traditional insurgencies rely on physical occupation of territory by the conquering forces to provide targets of opportunity to the resistance. Because space weapons would orbit several hundred to several thousands of miles above the Earth, they would not be vulnerable to attack by anything except weapons systems possessed by the most advanced space powers, such as ballistic missiles and advanced laser systems. Even such counter-measures, however, would only raise the financial cost of space-based empire, not the COSt in human lives that insurgencies rely upon to diminish domestic support ti)f imperial occupations. Consequently a space-based empire would be freer to dominate the Earth from above than a traditional land-power occupation would be. Without obvious counterpowers or effective means of resistance, the space-based empire would be able to exercise complete bio-political control over the entire planet, turning all of Earth's inhabitants into &quot;bare life,&quot; Under such a political arrangement the likelihood that the imperial center would be a benevolent one, uncorrupted by its total domination of the Earth, is very slim indeed.<br />

Grondin, 06 David Grondin Assistant Professor, School of Political Studies, University of Ottawa (as of July 2006)   Paper presented at the ISA Convention, San Diego  March 25, 2006  Panel “Reading Outer Space I:  The International Politics of Outer Space - Approaches and Themes” THE (POWER) POLITICS OF SPACE:  THE US ASTROPOLITICAL DISCOURSE OF GLOBAL DOMINANCE  IN THE WAR ON TERROR<br />
<br />
Indeed, we have no way of knowing how other state leaders and non-state agents will react to US spatial policy and to a path of weaponization. The security dilemma or a new global arms race in space remain social constructions and are not automatic responses to a course of action taken by the US state. Will it be like Roger Handberg fears: that the “[w]eaponization of space is the signal for the next arms race, one that may start slow but inevitably will speed up as other states reject the US claim to permanent dominance?” (Handberg 2004: 88) Indeed, Handberg makes lots of sense to me when he asserts that a healthy skepticism must be exercised when drastic changes in existing policy positions are considered, especially policies which have not yet failed. Too often, in American defense debates, technology trumps ‘mere politics’ with often-unanticipated consequences. The security dilemma is not just an obscure academic concept but one that reflects real possibilities in terms of outcomes. […] There is an irony in that the analyses assume, especially since the advent of the George W. Bush administration, that such military space activities, including weaponization, will be approved. Approval may come but resources may not, given the administration’s penchant for tax cuts. Sustaining a level of resource commitment necessary to maintain the force levels assumed here is questionable in the absence of an explicit and very visible threat (Handberg 2004: 88). Or will it rather be like the space warriors expect, Dolman and Lambakis especially, that there is an opportunity to be grasped by the US that will make other actors of the global arena accept an American dominance in space? In my mind, such view is to be resisted at all costs. In fact, one must be aware that behind all the rhetoric for space weaponization and the “threat game”, other power considerations still pull much weight – and the spectre of a Cold War military-industrial complex is still very much alive. As Lambakis bluntly puts it: “Although it still must guard against the transfer of critical military technologies, capitalism ought to be set loose to advance the development of satellite technologies and services (including imagery services), which would allow US industry to play its strength – technological innovation and application – which in turn would provide the United States significant technologies advantages in the years ahead” (Lambakis 2001: 281; original emphasis). Freedom of Space, Space control, and the Technological As space is conceived as a common medium, the principle of the freedom of space lasts as long as there is no will to take a step further – which is what space warriors recommend. As they acknowledge, many reasons may motivate a state to develop “capabilities to control, if not dominate or claim ownership over, space orbits” (Lambakis 2001: 86; original emphasis). This line of argument is usually linked to technological capacities. By asserting that other countries operate in Space, that conflicts are “natural” between humans – which brings the obvious “so why would it be different in Space” – technologies of power take the lead and one is left with devising what space-control strategy will be best and what one wants “to control, for how long, and for what purposes?/ (Lambakis 2001: 281). And in a context where one portrays the situation as one where US aerospace industry is held back by the rest of the world only for fear of potential not guaranteed conflicts that will evolve into Space warfighting because of a renewed arms race (Lambakis 2001: 282), the claim to let technology drive the policy and the political is not disinterested – albeit ill-advised – and definitely not a sure bet. For space warriors such as Dolmnan and Lambakis, space weaponization then appears not to be all related to the security issue but also very much to the maintenance of a strong defense and aerospace industry. The technological takes over as the political is eclipsed by the military professionals. In effect, for space warriors, because of national security, “if a determination is made that space weapons would improve national security, further analysis would be required to map out a path to take to introduce these tools in the arsenal and military strategy and a time line from which to plan” (Lambakis 2001: 282). Contrary to US astropolitical analysts, I find myself at fault with the logic of national security and securitization of space that drives US governmentality, especially with regard to Outer Space. I do not believe that arms control is given a fair trial by its opponents or even by some of its main defenders in US astropolitical discourse. For me, the security game is what seems so scary; and if we consider the one assumption of an astropolitical argument such as that of Lambakis that because of the 9/11 context, “one thing is certain – we will not be able to bludgeon our enemies into cooperation. For those times, the United States needs to have in place more assertive means and doctrines to counter hostiles activities in space” (Lambakis 2001: 282; my emphasis). When people are certain and need enemies to develop one strategy, then maybe some questions have not been raised. There are “unknowns” and we cannot be sure of how the events will unfold if the US goes further along a path to space weaponization. In any case, it gets even more problematic when security is trumped with technology for there is no way – so it seems – to argue against the desire of global (read absolute) security, especially when it comes from the strongest of power. You are brought back to the realities of the global homeland security state. One is doomed to either accept the logic of terror – that inexorably goes with the logic of global security – or reject it. I choose the latter. CONCLUSION: THE SECURITIZATION AND AMERICANIZATION OF SPACE This paper allowed me to address how the frontiers of the US are redefined by the War on Terror as it relates to the US strategic thinking on Outer Space. What conditions of possibility does 9/11 bring for US astropolitical discourse that were not already there? This inquiry leads me directly to reconsider the securitization and reterritorialization project of the “last frontier”, that is the attempt to secure Outer Space as an American space. It is important to rethink the push for space weaponization and its politics in light of the context of the US Global War on Terror (GWOT), which produced a new security thinking towards the “homeland” – a homeland strategy of security, a military doctrine of pre- emption/prevention and a reterritorialization of American frontiers and global power. Outer Space concerns, apparently, “the outer frontiers of national security policy, where technology and grand strategy meet” (Krepon 2003). Within the context of the War on Terror, where US strategic discourse sees a global terrorist threat as being ever possible, it seems that there can be no exception for Space. It is even done preventively as a secured space while Others do not exist yet in Space (in fact, they do, with the International Space Station; but that’s another story…). In this spatial inscription of securitization of the American identity in Space, the frontiers of the homeland are made global and are secured through a representation of dangers (with the exception of debris in Space which they do not categorize as “dangers”). This familiar approach to territory and space is inscribed in the identity politics of the US, a moral practice based on spatial exclusion of Others deemed threatening to secure the American Self (Campbell 1998 [1992]; Shapiro 1999). By focusing on the Rumsfeld 2001 Space Commission for the Management of Space in the national security strategy, one sees the application of the same reading that would later come with the War on Terror. To that effect, a terrorist group or rogue state might try to hinder US spatial assets or those of its allies on which the US depends militarily and economically. In its 2004 National Military Stragegy, the US thus reaffirmed with force its will to constitute a global information grid and achieve a full spectrum-dominance in military matters. The US therefore wants to prevent any threat in Outer Space and protect its spatial activities and that of its allies. Informed by the events of 9/11, space warriors, such as Dolman or Lambakis, criticize opponents of a US policy for space weaponization as being stuck in a Cold War mindset. They believe a strategy of pre-emption and a resolve not to wait for the next “Pearl Harbor”, whether in space, on Earth or in the cyberspace is necessary and that the US must really be prepared to defend its (global) homeland: “How else can one explain [a] statement [such as] ‘as long as we remain vulnerable and so accessible to our adversaries, their incentives to attack us in space are likely to remain quite low’? In the post-September 11 world, events have underscored that weakness entices those who would do us harms and vulnerability provokes those who hate us. We need fresh thinking” (Lambakis 2003: 118). Space was seen as a sanctuary during the Cold War. But because of the context of the War on Terror, the US now seems to be ready to go against the second Article of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 that stipulates that “Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, orby any other means”, the treaty which set out the principle that Space is to be used for “the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind” (Article 1). In effect, since 2001, the US wished to be the one responsible for setting new rules in Outer Space and for creating the conditions of its military dominance of Space. For instance, the merger of the US Space Command with the Strategic Command in January 2004 stems from this logic that wishes Space operations to be integrated in all domains of US military power. Because the US still possesses control over much of the information gathering in Space, it is interested in securitizing and Americanizing the “last frontier”, especially in the context of the War on Terror. As it stands, the US neoliberal geopolitics discourse of the Bush Administration on Space power still leads to Space weaponization. US sovereignty is placed as higher than any other forms of rule and the US prepares itself militarily, just in case Outer Space would turn into a battlefield. In Donald Rumsfeld’s words: “Our goal is not to bring war into space, but rather to defend against those who would” (Rumsfeld, quoted in Waldrop 2005 [2002]: 39). This participates in the discourse of a global security state that sees Outer Space as the most “global” of space. “Insofar as the weaponization of space represents the ‘cutting edge’ and highest ambitions of military primacy, it also represents the height of this folly” (Huntley 2005: 83). If we consider that political rhetoric creates political reality that may serve as bases for decisions, it appears fundamental to assess how the US wishes to securitize Outer Space with its will to achieve full-spectrum dominance in all battlespaces, as stated in the 2004 and 1997 National Military Strategies. Deeply anchored in the War on Terror cartography, where 9/11 serves as the ultimate justification since “one must prepare militarily for the worst since the worst has happened” (or so it goes), the US places itself in a state of insecurity by saying that even if no one may inflict them casualty in Space, nothing can guarantee that it will not happen in the future. This is why they prefer to try this likelihood and securitize Outer Space as part of the homeland security strategy. The paradox of the securitization and Americanization of Outer Space is that it could lead to its very opposite by allowing space weaponization to still be possible, if not inevitable.<br />

<br />
Once again, U.S. space policy was subsumed by other national priorities, in this case dominated by military security concerns. This background is essential for appreciating how the space policies of the Obama administration are beginning to genuinely break new trails. The U.S. National Space Policy issued in June 2010 has been widely recognized for its cooperative and multilateral tone, including as explicit near-term goals the expansion of international cooperation on all activities and pursuing international as well as national measures to enhance space stability. Particularly notable are the document’s emphasis on orienting U.S. “leadership” toward fostering international cooperation, and its references, in its concluding section, to cooperation with other states and non-state actors in the pursuit of national security space objectives.3 To some degree, a turn toward multilateral cooperation in U.S. space policy was to be expected. China’s 2007 anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision increased awareness of the challenge of space debris and the need for better global information sharing on space situational awareness (SSA).5 Also, new budget realities and unpromising technological developments have scaled back ambitions in some quarters for solving U.S. space security concerns with new independent capabilities. Finally, the Obama administration has pursued a more cooperative disposition across a wide range of global policy challenges, from Iranian nuclear ambitions to global climate change. But the improved clarity of vision in the 2010 Space Policy suggests that the emphasis on fostering global cooperation on space-related activities is more grounded in deliberate foresight than sailing the prevailing political winds. The 2011 National Security Space Strategy, released February 4, is best interpreted against this background of the Obama administration’s turn toward both greater international space cooperation and greater attention to space policy in general. • The strategy intends to “encourage responsible behavior in space and lead by the power of example,” a significant observation given the tendency of U.S. policy-makers (as noted above) not to expect quid pro quo responses to cooperative gestures. Also, the strategy states the U.S. “will support development of data standards, best practices, transparency and confidence-building measures, and norms of behavior for responsible space operations.” [italics added] In the context of the section on “Preventing and Deterring Aggression,” the strategy similarly intends to “support diplomatic efforts to promote norms of responsible behavior in space” as well as “pursue international partnerships that encourage potential adversary restraint,” along with other measures. This emphasis on norm-building and the role of example suggests a near-term endorsement of the development of “codes of conduct” for space activities (such as the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct, discussed below), whether or not such concord leads to more formal arms control arrangements in the longer-term. • The Department of Defense is directed to “foster cooperative SSA relationships,” and to “expand provision of safety of flight services to U.S. Government agencies, other nations, and commercial firms.” Greater SSA information sharing has been a key suggestion for fostering international cooperation; the U.S. possesses globally superior SSA capabilities, but restricts the sharing of this information on the basis of national security concerns.9 Hence, this nominal commitment is significant in its own right. • The strategy commits to reforming export controls. “ The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective, highlighting those elements expressing consistency with the 2010 National Space Policy’s bend toward fostering greater international collaboration. Perhaps as striking as the prevalence of such passages, however, is the absence of expressed intention — even couched in hedging language — to sustain or expand the kind of independent space-based military capabilities that were the centerpiece of the prior administration’s aims (if not its accomplishments). Again, to some extent this turn in tone is overdetermined by extenuating global circumstances. But one must still be struck by the degree to which developments such as the Chinese ASAT test have not ignited the kind of response one might have anticipated only a few short years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its sends concerning U.S. policy toward the recently revised European Union Code of Conduct.12 The strategy did not explicitly endorse this EU initiative, but Mr. Schulte, at the February 4 presentation of the strategy, highlighted the initiative “as a potential way” to promote “transparency and confidence-building measures, which tend to be voluntary as opposed to legally binding.” A week earlier, Rose Gottemoeller, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, stated at the Conference on Disarmament that the administration was nearing a decision on whether the U.S. would sign on to the code, and what modifications might be required in order to do so.13 As U.S. interest in the Code of Conduct has increased, debates over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. These policy movements toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non-binding) mark a sharp departure from the stiff resistance to curtailing U.S. “freedom of action” in the previous administration, and have accordingly generated resistance from congressional opponents on just those terms. Prior to the release of the National Security Space Strategy, a group of 37 Republican senators led by Arizona Senator Jon Kyl issued a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressing concern over a potential multilateral commitment that might limit development and/or deployment of space-based missile defense interceptors and ASAT-defeating systems.14 In sum, the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing in U.S. policy toward greater global engagement but also, and more importantly, a step toward greater long-term coherence in thinking concerning the core goals of U.S. space activities. Even supporters of the general directions of the strategy noted its more-than-expected breadth of thought.17 But if this reading is sound, the strategy is still but one step on a long road, and ongoing debates over the role of U.S. space policy vis-à-vis broader national security interests will insure that road is bumpy. Suggesting such limitations, Mr. Schulte acknowledged that the classified version of the strategy is only four pages longer than the released version, indicating that more specific guidelines for military implementation of the strategy remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details. <br />

Although a less likely occurrence than interference with satellite ground stations or communications links, direct interference of satellites by conventional, nuclear, or directed energy weapons is much more difficult to defend against. In this case, the primary source of protection for satellites stems from the difficulties associated with launching an attack of conventional weapons into and through the space environment to specific locations. It is worth noting that, despite recent incidents involving ASATs impacting a country’s own spacecraft, no hostile attacks on an adversary’s satellite have been documented to date. The distinct nature of the space environment itself may provide a certain level of protection for space assets. For example, energy weapons must overcome atmospheric challenges and be effectively targeted at satellites, which orbit at great distances and move at very high speeds. Also, the distances and speeds involved in satellite engagements can be exploited to enhance protection. Satellites in lower-altitude orbits are more difficult to detect with spacebased infrared sensors because of their proximity to the Earth’s atmosphere. The fact that Low Earth Orbit (LEO) can be reached in a matter of minutes, while Geostationary Orbit (GEO) takes about a half-day to reach by completing a Hohmann transfer orbit, illustrates the unique protection of dynamics associated with different orbits.30 Lower orbits are also less predictable because of greater atmospheric effects, such as fluctuations in density in the upper atmosphere, which alter satellite drag. For example, at an altitude of about 800 km, the predictability of orbits is limited to an error of approximately one kilometer one day in advance of the calculation, using readily available models. Higher operational orbits also raise the power demands for terrestrial radars, leaving only optical systems capable of tracking satellites in altitudes beyond 5,000 km. Some military systems are being placed into higher orbits such as Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) or GEO, but orbits are largely dictated by function. Surface finishes and designs optimized for heat dissipation and radar absorption can also reduce the signatures of a satellite and the ability to observe it, further complicating negation targeting efforts, as in the US stealth satellite program Misty (cancelled in 2007).31<br />

Turn – Small Satellites undermine space capabilities – power and communication limitations <br />

Small satellites do suffer from some disadvantages. A primary disadvantage is that their smaller size limits their ability to generate power. There is simply less volume in which to place batteries for power storage, and less surface area to employ solar panels for power conversion. This means they are less capable of accommodating design demands such as redundant systems, fine pointing requirements, onboard processing, and multiple payloads. The restrictions on power also limit their communications data rates and subsequently their missions. It is a major reason why small satellites are well suited for simple mission tasking. However, there are singular missions that small satellites cannot currently accomplish as well as larger satellites. Imaging is a mission that is severely hindered by the satellite’s small size. These small satellites have limits to the size of the payloads that can be placed on them. For example, the size of the imaging aperture that can be placed on a small satellite is smaller than what could fit on a larger satellite, and subsequently limits the obtainable resolution. Another aspect that is tied to the satellite’s power limitations is the orbit the satellite is placed in. With minimal capability to generate power, signals transmitted to and from the satellites are limited in their range. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is the primary orbit for small satellites due to this limitation. LEO has its own list of advantages, such as minimal range, and disadvantages, such as shortened lifetimes as compared with higher orbiting middle earth and geostationary/geosynchronous orbits. These advantages and disadvantages inherently belong to the satellites that reside there. As summarized by the Chairman and Director of SSTL, small satellite manufactures balance these advantages and disadvantages following the general principle of the 80/20 rule, 80% of the performance for 20% of the price [4][7]. <br />

No solvency – they don’t solve for Cyber Attacks<br />

<br />
Are we prepared for GPS-jammed operations? Twenty or 30 years ago, we were primarily worried about anti-satellite weapons as the major threat. Now, we still have to worry about ASAT [anti-satellite] weapons], but we also have to worry about cyberattacks [and] jamming. And we have to worry that these weapons might have proliferated beyond the Soviet Union. So part of the strategy, and the programs that follow from it, is to address exactly those kinds of threats and to ensure that we can continue to operate and leverage our space capabilities to make sure, for example, GPS jamming doesn't disable the great benefits we get militarily from space. Last year at the National Space Symposium, you said our space assets are more vulnerable than ever. Do you feel that there needs to be some sort of cohesive effort to focus on this problem? The first indication of [increased] focus is that we developed this strategy—the first space strategy the department's developed. The second indication is that we've named the secretary of the Air Force as the executive agent for space, and he chairs the Defense Space Council, which pulls together all of our space efforts and establishes a coherent approach across all the agencies and organizations that contribute to space. <br />

ORS has been defined broadly by the Department of Defense as “assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of Joint Force Commanders’ needs . . . while also maintaining the ability to address other users’ needs for improving the responsiveness of space capabilities to meet national security requirements” (Department of Defense, 2007). The purpose of ORS is to reduce the time lag associated with space system acquisition to allow the national space architecture to keep pace with changing missions, environments, and technologies. The fundamental idea is to trade off the reliability and performance achieved by satellites under the “Big Space” paradigm (the currently accepted way of conceptualizing, and operating space systems) for the speed, responsiveness, and customization which may be achieved by architectures that incorporate elements such as small, modular spacecraft (Government Accounting Office, 2006, 2008).<br />

Turn – Chinese Militarization – plan makes it impossible to criticize China’s tests and causes massive backlash at US unilateralism<br />
<br />
Milowicki 2008 United States Naval War College [with Freese Strategic Choices: Examining the United States Military Response to the Chinese ASAT Test, Astropolitics, Volume 6, Issue 1 January 2008 JSTOR]<br />
<br />
Current U.S. space and counterspace policy and doctrine makes it difficult for the U.S., particularly the military, to protest very loudly regarding China's test. The U.S. has been developing and has been in possession of ASAT technology for over 45 years. Furthermore, other dual-use “defensive” systems such as the Airborne Laser and National Missile Defense systems can easily be applied to the offensive ASAT task. China and the rest of the world are keenly aware of this. In fact, it is a much easier physics problem to target and destroy a single orbiting satellite in a fixed path than it is to engage a ballistic missile with its many multiple independently targeted reentry vehicle (MIRV) warheads. Also, it is unlikely other countries have forgotten that the most aggressive and spectacular ASAT test in history was executed in the Cold War and involved the detonation of a 1.4 megaton thermonuclear warhead in LEO above the Pacific Ocean. This event, known as Starfish Prime, took place on 9 July 1962. The resulting electromagnetic pulse took out six U.S. and foreign satellites (i.e., about one third of the world's LEO total at the time) and knocked out over 300 streetlights on the island of Oahu in Hawaii while producing an eerie artificial glow in the sky for 20 minutes for the entire world to see.31 If comparing immediate negative impact due to the 10% increase in overall known debris created by the Chinese test, the January 2007 ASAT event can be viewed as relatively minor. It should also be noted that at the time of the Starfish Prime test, the knowledge base regarding potential debris created from ASAT tests was far less than it is now. With the most assets to be negatively impacted by debris, the U.S. has good reason to be attentive now that the issues are known. In the case of the Chinese test, it appears increasing likely that Chinese space debris experts were not consulted prior to the test, and that debris estimates generated by test supporters in the military likely downplayed whatever debris information was provided to politicians. This supports the view that the test was a “chest-thumping” exercise by the PLA and hardliners in China. The U.S. defense establishment's reaction to the ASAT test is guided and constrained by the National Space Policy of 2006 and the military doctrine that proceeds from it. Specifically, under paragraph 2 of the National Space Policy, one of the principles (cited below) clearly gives the military a mandate to react as it currently has to bolster both its defensive and offensive counterspace capabilities. Two underlying principles of the policy that are typically cited as unilateral and jingoistic by critics read as follows:32 The United States considers space capabilities—including the ground and space segments and supporting links—vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so; take those actions necessary to protect its space capabilities; respond to interference; and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests. The United States will oppose the development of new legal regimes or other restrictions that seek to prohibit or limit U.S. access to or use of space. Proposed arms control agreements or restrictions must not impair the rights of the United States to conduct research, development, testing, and operations or other activities in space for U.S. national interests.33 While the principle of preserving its rights, capabilities and freedom of action in space is absolutely reasonable for the U.S. to claim, the language of the principle makes it unclear if other countries are expected to be able to claim similar rights or if they accrue only to the U.S. If the latter, it is not reasonable to expect that other countries will forego the same rights claimed by the U.S. Regarding the second principle, rejecting arms control, this language makes public what has been U.S. government policy since the Space Commission Report first questioned whether space arms control was in the interest of the U.S. Given that the rest of the world regularly votes in support of resolutions toward preventing an arms race in space through the United Nations (UN), with the U.S. standing alone against those resolutions, this principle becomes perceived as another example of the U.S. ignoring the perspectives of other countries in favor of a unilateralist approach—not necessarily an effective approach if the U.S. is trying to get the rest of the world to accept it as a benevolent hegemon in space. Intentionally or not, this bellicose and overtly unilateral section of the document has effectively tied the hands of the U.S. military establishment in diplomatically or politically responding to actions too negatively. Perhaps, in order to provide more options, the policy should be revisited in light of geopolitical realities. With only a few changes, the U.S. could alter its course and establish the U.S. as a constructive player in the international community rather than as a perceived “bad actor” bent on preemptive and hegemonic use of space for its own purposes;34 a perception that possibly prompts or, at a minimum, provides an excuse for bad actions on the part of other countries. Theresa Hitchens' observation in her Congressional Testimony of 23 May 2007 captures the situation. She states, “if nothing else, U.S. declaratory policy gives Beijing an excuse to pursue a similar course. China's actions—despite its public dedication to the non-weaponization of space—make it abundantly clear that U.S. space dominance strategy will not go unchallenged.”35<br />

7. Turn – ORS forces dependence on outdated technology because it requires prepositioned replacements<br />

<br />
Whether the DOD will decide to develop any small satellites to perform reconnaissance, communications, warning, weather, or other missions and then store them for launch on short notice is, at best, uncertain. Appropriators in the Congress would probably view with suspicion a long-term storage strategy for satellites deployed only as part of some sort of reconstitution strategy. That is, they would not support storage of satellites ‘‘in the barn’’ or on-orbit unless the move was part of a viable and cost-effective sustainment strategy. This is not to say long-term storage cannot be used as part of a large constellation storage and sustainment strategy. Such a strategy could provide unique opportunities to upgrade, repair, or replace specific capabilities before it is too late do so upon launch of the spacecraft. The DOD already employs a replenishment launch campaign strategy to sustain its GPS precision navigation and timing system, and that system’s acquisition and sustainment approaches, while a bit imperfect, could be adopted at a minimum. Still, long-term storage of satellites could present a vexing dilemma—launching relatively old, outdated, and marginally useful systems if the storage continues too long. Taking a satellite that was designed 20 or 30 years ago, and built five to 10 years ago, and keeping it in storage does not appear to support a winning space strategy.<br />

<br />
Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed government contracts to companies that comply.<br />

13. Turn – Chinese Nuclear Deterrent - US Domination of space threatens China’s Nuclear Deterrent because it is perceived as BMD – this drives the arms race<br />

<br />
The second factor adding to the security dilemma in the U.S.-China military space relationship involves U.S. efforts to rewrite the established rule of nuclear deterrence, i.e., mutually assured destruction (MAD), that prevailed during the Cold War era. According to Glasner and Fetter, the U.S. has been pursuing a new deterrence posture that combines offensive and defensive capabilities.25 Chinese strategists believe that the U.S. military space program, to a significant extent, is driven by missile defense. For example, in a study organized by the General Staff of the PLA, Major General Xu Hezhen charges that the U.S. is developing space-based laser weapons for missile defense. According to him, “A total of 14–24 satellites deployed on different orbits will constitute a defensive system. Relying on data from early warning systems, it can intercept ballistic missiles launched from anywhere in the world.”26 In another study, Major General Ling Yongshun argues that the U.S. is implementing a coherent plan to neutralize other countries’ strategic deterrence through the deployment of space-based missile defense. As he observes: Using space weapons to attack ballistic targets is a major goal of space weapon development. The U.S. believes that others’ ballistic missiles pose significant threats to its security. To be immune from this threat, the U.S. is putting major efforts into ballistic missile defense, with space-based weapons being one of the important intercepting platforms.27 In October 2008, the U.S. Congress approved $5 million for an independent study of possible space-based missile defense. This move gravely alarmed the Chinese military, which believed that the deployment of space-based missile defense could become inevitable. In fact, some PLA experts have claimed that “Star Wars has come back.”28 Li Daguang even charged that this decision by the U.S. Congress amounted to “declaring a new Cold War against China.”29 Chinese military strategists believe U.S. missile defense poses a real threat to China’s nuclear deterrent. Until recently, the Chinese military tended to believe that U.S. missile defense could not effectively deter a major nuclear power like China or Russia. It was thought that a range of countermeasures, such as deploying decoys and multiple warheads, could be employed to deceive and overwhelm U.S. missile defense. Now, however, with the maturing of a multilayered missile defense system by the U.S. and its allies, Chinese nuclear experts are losing confidence in China’s offensive capabilities. This pessimism was illustrated in a 2008 interview of Wang Wenchao in a Chinese military magazine. Wang, credited with being the chief designer of China’s sea-based strategic missiles, expressed grave pessimism about China’s offensive nuclear capability against U.S. missile defense. He said, “I have done research: Facing a multi-tiered missile defense system, if any single layer can achieve a success rate of 70%, then 100 single warhead missiles could all be intercepted even if they are mounting a simultaneous attack.”30 This is why Wu Tianfu—arguably the most important deterrence strategist of the Second Artillery of the PLA, which runs China’s strategic nuclear forces—charges that the U.S. has “forced China to engage in a space arms race.”31 More specifically, U.S. missile defense has forced China to integrate space war with its strategic nuclear deterrence. China must possess the ability to weaken American space-based assets such as early-warning satellites, to ensure the credibility of its own offensive nuclear forces. Thus, space war and nuclear war are now intertwined in Chinese strategic thinking. Indeed, China’s official media have credited Wu with establishing the PLA’s first space war research institute.32<br />

Russian nuclear weapons. Russian nuclear weapons appear to be under the generally good control of elite troops. There is no evidence in open-source material that a single nuclear warhead, from any national arsenal or another source, has ever made its way into the world’s illegal arms bazaars, let alone into terrorist hands. No actual aspiring nuclear-weapon state has ever claimed to have nuclear weapons without also having all of the technical infrastructure necessary to produce them ab initio, although they could, if the ‘loose nukes’ arguments were sound, easily have brought a few on the black market. Even the extravagant sums sometimes mentioned as the alleged asking price for stolen weapons would be tiny fractions of the amount required to develop and indigenous nuclear-weapons capability, yet circumstances seem to have compelled states to choose the more expensive course. The nuclear black market. There is no evidence in the open-source literature of a true international black market in nuclear materials. Virtually all known cases of nuclear theft or smuggling have involved amateurs hoping for rich returns, despite the seeming absence of anyone interested in buying the material. To the extent that a market exists, it is almost entirely driven by supply; there appears to be no true demand, except where the buyers were government agents running a sting. Organized crime, with one known exception, has not been involved in nuclear trafficking. Even the notorious A.Q. Khan network concentrated on nuclear technology, especially centrifuge uranium enrichment, rather than fissile materials, although there have been suggestions that Khan, a Pakistani nuclear engineer, sold uranium hexafluoride, the feedstock for enrichment , to Libya. ‘Do-it-yourself’ nuclear weapons. It is most improbable that any terrorist group could become a do-it-yourself nuclear power: unlike rough conceptual outlines, the detailed plans and engineering drawings necessary to build a bomb are not easily available. It would also be very difficult, not effectively impossible, to acquire sufficient quantities of suitable fissile materials. The expertise and facilities required to build a functional bomb, even a crude one, are of a higher order than those possessed by any known terrorist organization. Developing nuclear weapons requires state-level resources, and the process takes years. Dirty bombs and radiation dispersal devices. Dirty bombs (also known as radiation dispersal devices or RDDs), are unlikely to kill anyone immediately, except via the direct effects of the conventional explosives involved. Neither uranium nor plutonium is particularly radioactive in pure form, and the widespread belief that plutonium is the world’s most toxic substance is an outright myth, although both metals are toxic to some degree. Other radioactive materials, such as cesium0137 or strontium-90, could be dangerous, although they might kill or disable any would-be dirty-bomb maker before they could complete such work. Depending on the substance used and the size of the radiation release, a RDD might cause a small statistical increase in cancer deaths among those affected, although it might never be possible to attribute individual deaths to the RDD. A large RDD using spent but still hot reactor fuel could be very dangerous. The economic, social, and psychological effects of a a dirty bomb could be considerably more serious than its physical or radiological effects. State sponsors of nuclear terrorism. Nuclear-weapon states, even ‘rogues;, are most unlikely to be foolish enough to hand nuclear weapons, which are among their dearest national treasures, to such unreliable, unpredictable and potentially dangerous characters as terrorists, especially when the chances of a suspected state are high. <br />

Taken together, the changes in military power wrought by the information revolution are still in their early stages, and they still have serious limitations. Even the best surveillance systems can be stymied by simple countermeasures like camouflage, smoke, and decoys, by bad weather, or by terrain like the deep sea, mountains, or jungles. Sensors have limited ability to penetrate solid objects, so that they cannot tell what is happening in underground bunkers such as those that North Korea and Iran likely use to hide their nuclear weapons programs. Urban areas present a particularly difficult challenge: There are far more things to track (individuals) and far more obstructions (buildings, vehicles, trees, signs) than at sea or in the sky. Figuring out whether a person is a civilian or an insurgent is a lot harder than figuring out whether an unidentified aircraft is a civilian airliner or an enemy fighter. It is harder still to figure out how many enemy soldiers will resist or what stratagems they will employ. No machine has yet been invented that can penetrate human thought processes. Even with the best equipment in the world, U.S. forces frequently have been surprised by their adversaries. Some strategists expect that advances in information technology will greatly diminish if not altogether obliterate some of these difficulties. The Pentagon is creating a Global Information Grid that will pool data from all U.S. assets, whether an infantryman on the ground or a satellite in space. The ultimate goal: to provide a perfect operational picture—a “God’s-eye view” of the battlespace. This ambitious objective could be furthered by the development of better microwave radars that could see through walls, foliage, or soil; cheaper, more pervasive sensors that could provide 24/7 coverage of the battlefield; better data compression and transmission techniques that could allow more bytes to be sent much faster; and more powerful computers that might make it possible to create, for example, a real-time, three-dimensional model of a city showing all the people who reside in it. Yet no matter how far information technology advances, it is doubtful that the Pentagon will ever succeed, as some utopians dream, in “lifting the fog of war.” The fallibility of American soldiers and the cunning of their enemies will surely continue to frustrate the best-laid plans. Moreover, America’s growing reliance on high-tech systems creates new vulnerabilities of its own: Future enemies have strong incentives to attack U.S. computer and communication nodes. Strikes on military information networks could blind or paralyze the armed forces, while strikes on civilian infrastructure, such as banking or air control systems, could cause chaos on the home front. Adversaries will almost certainly figure out ways to blunt the U.S. informational advantage. From Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan to numerous misadventures in Iraq, they already have. Whether fighting in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan or in the alleys of Ramadi and Fallujah, U.S. soldiers have been ambushed by insurgents who managed to elude their sensor networks through such simple expedients as communicating via messengers, not cell phones.<br />

Coming at the problem from the same direction as Romney, the Senate this week passed a bill to impose higher taxes on imports on China if the government fails to allow the yuan to rise in value faster. The bill is unlikely to pass the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders oppose it. And, as Huntsman noted, the Chinese could easily retaliate with penalties against American goods aided by the Federal Reserve's pumping of hundreds of billions of dollars into the U.S. economy. The Obama and Bush administrations have approached China more carefully, targeting with higher import taxes those Chinese goods they felt were selling at artificially low prices while negotiating with Beijing for a fairer currency exchange rate. Despite limited success, they've avoided a blanket punishment of all Chinese goods and any breakdown in relations that would surely make it harder for American products to reach China's booming internal market.<br />

<br />
A multilayered missile defense will use a variety of different systems to try and kill the missile and its warhead during each of these phases. Obviously, if a missile is caught and destroyed during the first phase of its flight, the result is better for all concerned. During the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, this goal led to the so-called Brilliant Pebbles program of space-based heat-seeking interceptors, designed to hit missiles in the boost phase. The program was canceled by Bill Clinton and Les Aspin in 1993. At the time, Aspin reportedly said that he was going to “take the stars out of Star Wars.” Since then, there have been several efforts to develop a non-space-based boost-phase interceptor system. None of them have been satisfactory, since they all require the interceptor to get as close as possible to the target missile and then chase it after it has been launched. As they used to say in the days of sailing navies, “a stern chase is a long chase.” From orbit, however, an interceptor does not have to follow its target; instead, it dives onto it. Brilliant Pebbles relied for its effectiveness on the law of gravity, not on having a bigger rocket engine. George W. Bush never revived Brilliant Pebbles, as the arms-control establishment, liberals in Congress, and the forces of inertia inside the Defense Department successfully blocked any attempt to restart the program. Bush was content to fund the Clinton-designed, ABM Treaty–compliant National Missile Defense mid-course intercept system, which is what we have now. If Romney is elected, and if he is serious about defending the homeland from missile attack, he will have to be ready to spend considerable political capital, as well as time and money, to make it happen. One promising program, the Miniature Kill Vehicle (MKV), which was intended to be launched in large numbers from the ground, was killed by the Obama administration. But a space-based version of MKVs, which are about the size of a loaf of bread, could make space-based missile defense a reality within the first term of a Romney presidency. Earlier this year, Rep. Trent Franks (R., Ariz.) persuaded the House Armed Services Committee to allocate $8 million for the Defense Department “to conduct a study examining the technical and operational considerations associated with developing and operating a limited space-based interceptor capability.” It is doubtful that this will survive the legislative process, and even if it did, the forces inside the Pentagon that have long opposed space-based missile defense will fight hard to ensure that the results of the study will be negative. Still, the mere fact that a few gutsy members of Congress have not given up on effective missile defense shows that if Romney wants to fight this fight, he will not be without allies. Make no mistake: If Mitt Romney is serious about a multilayered national missile defense, he is going to have a major struggle ahead of him. He will have to be prepared to junk Obama’s National Space Policy on January 21, 2013, and will have to fight hard against the arms-control establishment, the liberals, the Russians, the Chinese, and probably also the Europeans. (Officially, the EU is terrified of a so-called and much-hyped “Arms Race in Space.”) Even before the election, Romney will come under serious pressure to promise not to deploy weapons in space, which means conservatives will have a chance to see how he stands up under liberal assault. This should be interesting.<br />

Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Charles Schumer also have signaled plans to push for a vote on legislation to pressure China to revalue its currency in conjunction with the free trade pacts. That would inflame relations with Beijing and possibly trigger tit-for-tat trade retaliation if Obama does not expend political capital to block it. The early start of the 2012 U.S. election campaigns, however, may dampen Obama's appetite to lead aggressively on trade. But &quot;if the administration spends the effort and actually finishes the job (the trade deals) with Congress, that will send a very positive signal,&quot; said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.<br />

<br />
There are two common options in government policies to curb trade imbalances: adjusting the exchange rate or turning to protectionism. The past two years have seen China falling victim to U.S. protectionist measures adopted in the wake of the global financial crisis. The motives for the mounting pressure on China over the yuan have been widely questioned, even in the United States. As the U.S. mid-term elections approach, the political clamoring will expectedly turn increasingly shrill. Many wonder if the lawmakers are really speaking against China for the benefit of Americans or only out of their selfish desire to please their constituents and gain more votes ahead of the coming elections. A common view is that, to some extent, the lawmakers are looking to improve their public image in an effort to pocket more political capital. On Tuesday, 36 U.S. farm and business groups, including the U.S.-China Business Council, the American Soybean Association and the American Meat Institute, urged the Congress not to pass any legislation threatening China with new duties if Beijing does not revalue the yuan. &quot;Estimations of the correct currency value would be inherently subjective, unilateral and potentially politicized since there is no agreed upon method to determine what a country's exchange rate should be in the absence of a market-based determination,&quot; the groups said. Another reason to question the lawmakers' motives is based on the credibility of the data they cite in accusing Beijing of undervaluing the yuan by 24 percent to as much as 40 percent. The figures the lawmakers cite were drawn from previous IMF predictions that China's current account would represent 8 percent of its gross domestic product by 2015. Based on that prediction, the Chinese yuan needs to appreciate 24.2 percent to achieve the current account/GDP target ratio of 3 percent. Please forget the predictions that always vary widely from what happens in reality. China's real current account represented 6 percent of its yearly GDP in 2009, a figure that means the yuan needs only to appreciate 10 percent to reach the target ratio of 3 percent. The true situation this year shows China does not need to revalue the yuan at all, considering China's decreased trade surplus during the past nine months and a likely drop in its current account/GDP ratio to below 4 percent. At the same time, many people worry that the yuan issue could spark a trade war between the world's two largest economies and trigger a spate of protectionism that might endanger the fragile global economic recovery. Past experience shows that global peace and prosperity is impossible without China's participation, and as the world's biggest developing country, China cannot develop itself without the help of other countries. Therefore, the U.S. should rein in those congressmen yapping for Beijing to revalue the yuan and join hands with China to build a positive, cooperative and comprehensive relationship for the 21st century.<br />

C. Impacts - Trade wars cause global war<br />
<br />
Spicer, Olin Foundation, 96 (The Challenge from the East and the Rebirth of the West, p. 121)<br />
<br />
The choice facing the West today is much the same as that which faced the Soviet bloc after World War II: between meeting head-on the challenge of world trade with the adjustments and the benefits that it will bring, or of attempting to shut out markets that are growing and where a dynamic new pace is being set for innovative production. The problem about the second approach is not simply that it won’t hold: satellite technology alone will ensure that consumers will begin to demand those goods that the East is able to provide most cheaply. More fundamentally, it will guarantee the emergence of a fragmented world in which natural fears will be fanned and inflamed. A world divided into rigid trade blocs will be a deeply troubled and unstable place in which suspicion and ultimately envy will possibly erupt into a major war. I do not say that the converse will necessarily be true, that in a free trading world there will be an absence of all strife. Such a proposition would manifestly be absurd. But to trade is to become interdependent, and that is a good stop in the direction of world stability. With nuclear weapons at two a penny, stability will be at a premium in the years ahead. <br />

By far, the most important arms control success of the past year has been the entry-into-force of the New START Treaty with Russia in February. The Treaty responsibly limits the number of strategic nuclear weapons and launchers that the United States and Russia may deploy. When the Treaty is fully implemented, it will result in the lowest number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads since the 1950s, the first full decade of the nuclear age. The implementation of the Treaty is well underway. We have exchanged data on our strategic nuclear facilities and forces. This information forms the foundation of the Treaty’s database, which will be updated by the Parties continuously through a notification process and exchanged anew every six months throughout the life of the Treaty. As of April, the Parties began conducting on-site inspections of each other’s Treaty-related facilities.<br />

<br />
Russia sees the planned U.S. missile defense system as a potential threat to its nuclear forces and may review its participation in a landmark nuclear arms treaty, officials said Monday. The New START deal, the centerpiece of President Obama’s efforts to reset ties with Russia and the most significant arms control pact in nearly two decades, took effect last week. It limits each country to 1,550 strategic warheads, down from the previous ceiling of 2,200. The treaty doesn’t prevent the U.S. from building missile defense systems, but Russia has warned that it reserves the right to withdraw from the treaty if the United States significantly boosts its missile shield. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov reaffirmed Monday that a buildup in the U.S. missile defense capability would prompt Moscow to reconsider its obligations under the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. “If the U.S. increases the qualitative and quantitative potential of its missile defense … a question will arise whether Russia should further abide by the treaty or would have to take other measures to respond to the situation, including military-technical measures,” Mr. Ryabkov said, according to Russian news agencies. Russia was strongly critical of the previous U.S. administration’s plan to deploy missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic and hailed Mr. Obama’s decision to scrap it. But the Kremlin has remained concerned about revamped U.S. missile defense plans and continued to see them as potentially dangerous to its security. <br />

<br />
The START Treaty has led to significant reductions in the U.S. and Russian Cold War nuclear stockpiles. According to data from the State Department, the United States had more than 10,500 accountable warheads deployed on an estimated 2,250 delivery vehicles and Russia had more than 10,000 accountable warheads deployed on 2,500 delivery vehicles in September 1990, prior to the treaty’s entrance into force. During the Cold War, each one of these 20,000 U.S. and Russian nuclear warheads was maintained on a hair trigger alert, keeping the world’s two superpowers locked in a dangerous military posture, known as mutually assured destruction. The risk of nuclear war was real and posed an existential threat to both countries as well as the world. Beyond the threat of an intentional attack, there was a possibility of inadvertent war from an unauthorized or accidental launch. Although data on Russian nuclear incidents are unavailable, according to conservative figures from the Department of Defense, there were 32 nuclear weapons incidents involving U.S. nuclear weapons between 1950 and 1980 – twenty of which, experts say, could have started an accidental nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia.[7] With the implementation of the START, both sides have markedly reduced their stockpiles – and markedly reduced the risk of nuclear war. As of July 2009, the United States had 5,916 accountable warheads on 1,188 delivery vehicles and Russia had 3,897 accountable warheads on 809 delivery vehicles. These mutual reductions have ensured stability in our nuclear relationship, while significantly contributing to American, Russian, and global security.[8] <br />

A No First Use prevents Proliferation – it reduces the Salience of Nuclear Weapons<br />

The Case for No First Use Throughout the Cold War, the United States reserved the right to use nuclear weapons first in a conflict, in large part because the Soviet Union had overwhelming conventional military advantages in Europe, and the United States sought to level the battlefield. However, now that the Cold War is over, conference participants agreed that the United States no longer faces a similar force imbalance. “There is a serious mismatch between current US nuclear weapons doctrine and declaratory policy and the major nuclear threats the United States faces in the world today,” said one participant. Moreover, while the value of a first-use posture has gone down, the value of strengthening norms against the acquisition, production, and use of nuclear arms has gone up. Many conference participants argued that by reducing the salience of nuclear arms in US war plans, a NFU posture could help the United States strengthen international antinuclear norms and aid its nonproliferation efforts. Conference participants noted that there is a difference between declaratory policy and war plans, and that a doctrine of NFU would not necessarily change US nuclear weapons targeting policy. However, they also noted that declaratory policy helps shape the intellectual atmosphere in which US nuclear weapons policy is made. Military planners take declaratory policy into account, and its effects trickle down into procurement decisions, alert procedures, and operational war plans. A NFU policy would send a signal to American war planners that nuclear weapons are not appropriate in almost all contingencies. This would encourage them to develop capabilities and plans for using conventional arms to destroy hardened and deeply buried targets, biological weapons laboratories, and other sites that the current administration has suggested could only be destroyed by nuclear attack. Expanding conventional capabilities in turn reduces the likelihood that the United States would feel the need to use nuclear weapons. As one conference participant noted, “If you rule out the use of nuclear force, you push war planners to think with more discipline…You can’t just let military planners assume that it’s all right to use nuclear weapons to cover a wide range of targets.” Without the discipline imposed by a change in guidance doctrine, one participant said, military planners are prone to including nuclear options in war plans simply because they need a mission for weapons they already have. By cultivating a culture of nonuse within the military, NFU could smooth the way toward adoption of a purely retaliatory nuclear posture, with a nuclear force likely consisting only of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Indeed, conference participants noted that the US armed forces are already far less enthusiastic about nuclear arms than they were during the Cold War. One participant said that the Joint Chiefs now argue about which military branches have to maintain nuclear weapons, rather than which ones get to. One participant suggested that the Air Force is unenthusiastic about maintaining intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), bombs, and nuclear cruise missiles and would not resist a new doctrine diminishing the relevance of nuclear arms. Faced with the nonnuclear culture of today’s Air Force, this person said, “Curtis LeMay would be rolling in his grave.” Participants noted that declaratory statements also shape public and legislative debate about nuclear weapons issues. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review created the widespread perception that US political leaders have sought new uses for nuclear arms, and it justified development of the Reliable Replacement Warhead and the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator to Congress. Public and congressional debate on the proper role of nuclear weapons, the adequacy of the current nuclear arsenal, potential arms control agreements and weapons reductions, and future arms development programs are all conducted against the backdrop of declared US nuclear doctrine. If the United States adopted NFU, that debate would change. NFU could also affect US policy abroad. International nuclear norms are constructed of what countries think, say, and do about nuclear weapons, and US statements about its nuclear doctrine can affect those norms by signaling to others what it believes to be reasonable and legitimate potential uses of nuclear weapons. NFU would indicate that the United States was reducing the salience of nuclear arms in its military policy and would therefore signal that we value our disarmament commitments under Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). In turn, this could strengthen norms against the spread and use of nuclear weapons and assist US nonproliferation efforts. As one participant noted, “A new NFU declaratory policy would make US engagement in…a global debate about nuclear weapons and other WMD appear credible and thus potentially more effective. It would put the United States in a more tenable position in the ongoing effort to create a broader global consensus against the use of any weapon of mass destruction against noncombatants.” Currently, the United States is in a less tenable position. One conference participant noted that the 1999 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) “Strategic Concept” explicitly placed a high value on the utility of nuclear weapons: “The Alliance will maintain for the foreseeable future an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces based in Europe…The Alliance’s conventional forces alone cannot ensure credible deterrence. Nuclear weapons make a unique contribution in rendering the risks of aggression against the Alliance incalculable and unacceptable. Thus, they remain essential to preserve peace.” Such language signals the importance of nuclear weapons and makes it harder to convince states that they do not need them. One participant invoked Ambassador Max Kampelman, who said that trying to convince countries to denuclearize while maintaining a first-use posture is like “lighting up while telling your children not to smoke.” Participants were concerned that the September 2002 US National Security Strategy—which calls for strategic dominance potent enough to dissuade any state from becoming a potential rival and, more specifically, for exploration of new types of nuclear weapons—signals a repudiation of the US commitment to nuclear disarmament under Article VI of the NPT. Similarly, conference participants worried that when the current administration promises to leave “all options on the table” in regards to Iran—a statement usually construed to include a nuclear option—it reduces the US ability to bring international pressure to bear against Iran’s enrichment program. In addition, there is some empirical evidence to suggest that US nuclear doctrine influences the nuclear doctrines of other states. India, for example, has copied innovations in US nuclear doctrine since the late 1990s, when its Draft Nuclear Doctrine emulated negative security assurances that the United States had developed in the 1980s, directly copying the so-called “Warsaw Pact exception” clause—which allowed the United States to target Soviet satellite states with nuclear arms during a major European war—from US and NATO doctrine. In 2002 the Indian National Security Advisory Board recommended complete abandonment of no first use, citing the need to emulate the doctrine of other nuclear weapon states: “India must consider withdrawing from this [NFU] commitment as the other nuclear weapon states have not accepted this policy…All five nuclear weapon states…reserve the right to launch nuclear weapons first. Then why should India not do so?” In 2003 New Delhi adopted a nuclear doctrine comparable to the United States’ strategic ambiguity regarding response to a chemical or biological attack. That said, conference participants were divided as to how, and how much, a NFU doctrine would affect nuclear-weapons-use norms and the nuclear weapons calculus of other states. The link between US declaratory policy and the strategic decisions of other nations is not always so clear. Iran, North Korea, and other countries have often protested US nuclear policy, citing these “nuclear threats” as a justification for their own arms programs. But conference participants generally agreed that Iran’s nuclear program is more likely a response to current US conventional superiority, and before now to Iraq’s nuclear program in the Saddam Hussein years. Indeed, the North Korean, Indian, and Pakistani nuclear weapons programs all accelerated during the 1990s, when the United States was moving to delegitimize nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, adopting NFU would at the very least deprive other states of one argument for their arsenals. Participants were universally concerned that we do not have enough empirical data about how proliferators and potential nuclear weapon states make decisions, meaning that we cannot be sure how much a NFU doctrine (and similar measures) would affect the global nonproliferation regime. Nevertheless, some warned against an excessive focus on tabulating the costs and benefits of NFU in hypothetical situations and allowing that analysis to slow progress toward reducing the salience of nuclear weapons. These participants insisted that developing momentum was essential and that NFU could help create a culture of nonuse that smoothes the way toward eventual disarmament—a goal for which there is increasing support, as demonstrated in the January 2007 Wall Street Journal op-ed by George Shultz and others. At the same time, participants agreed that in trying to reduce the salience of nuclear weapons, NFU was not as important as certain other steps, notably US ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). <br />

The 1AC depicts proliferation as a spreading cancerous infection—this abstracted focus on the technological threat posed by nuclear weapons obscures the underlying motives for proliferation—results in poorly formed policy like safeguards that makes proliferation irresolvable<br />
Mutimer, 2k—Assistant Professor of Political Science at York University (The Weapons State, Questia) ***[make sure to highlight the part of this card that talks about foreign nuclear power programs]<br />
<br />
When the language of proliferation was used in thinking about the development of nuclear technology after the discovery of controlled fission in the U. S. Manhattan Project, a process similar to that which produces cancer was imagined as a result. 18 The U.S. nuclear program was the original technology that would multiply and spread. Such spread, when imagined as “proliferation, ” is a natural process and is inevitable without active outside intervention. Once the development of nuclear technology is imagined as “proliferation, ” this entailment of a natural process of spread leads to the expectation of inevitable growth in the number of nuclear powers. This, of course, is precisely what was expected. Because such a condition was considered dangerous and undesirable, attempts were made to establish external controls over the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Again, this follows from imagining the problem in terms of “proliferation. ” Some form of external control is necessary to prevent the prolific growth of nuclear weapons outside the United States. Attempts to place such external, international controls on nuclear proliferation resulted in the NPT of 1970, which remains the principal mechanism of proliferation control. What are the implications of this image—with its understandings of autonomous, natural growth and external control—for the policy response to the development of nuclear technology? The first implication is that something imagined in terms of “proliferation” is seen to grow or multiply from a single source. Although animal reproduction involves two individuals, the father is quickly forgotten, and it is the mother who is proliferous. The budding of cells, which gives rise to the proliferation of some plants and, of course, cancers, begins with a single, or source, cell and spreads from there—in the case of a cancer, both to produce a single tumor and to create a number of separate tumors throughout the host body. Similarly, the problem of weapons proliferation is one of a source or sources proliferating, that is, reproducing by supplying the necessary technology to a new site of technological application. This form of imagining highlights the transmission process from source to recipient. Hence, the dominant response to nuclear proliferation has been the creation of supplier groups—the Zangger Committee and the NSG— that seek to control the spread of nuclear technology. In other words, to paraphrase Murray and Hunt, they attempt to provide the checks and balances that normally ensure orderly transfer and prevent the spread of nuclear technology resulting in the “cancer” of a prolific number of nuclear weapons. The second implication of the proliferation metaphor for the problem of nuclear weapons spread is an extreme technological determinism. Animal reproduction is an internally driven phenomenon, and so the metaphor of proliferation applied to the development of nuclear technology highlights the autonomy in the growth of that technology and its problematic weapons variant. It is worth recalling Frank Barnaby's words: “A country with a nuclear power program will inevitably acquire the technical knowledge and expertise, and will accumulate the fissile material necessary to produce nuclear weapons. ” 19 In fact, the text from which this quotation is drawn presents an interesting example of the autonomy of the proliferation metaphor. The book is entitled How Nuclear Weapons Spread: NuclearWeapon Proliferation in the 1990s. Notice that the weapons themselves spread; they are not spread by some form of external agent—say, a human being or a political institution. Under most circumstances such a title would be unnoticed, for the implications are so deeply ingrained in our conceptual system that they are not recognized as metaphorical. <br />
This image, by highlighting the technological and autonomous aspects of a process of spread, downplays or even hides important aspects of the relationship of nuclear weapons to international security. To begin with, the image hides the fact that nuclear weapons do not spread but are spread—and, in fact, are spread largely by the Western states. Second, the image downplays—to the point of hiding—any of the political, social, economic, and structural factors that tend to drive states and other actors both to supply and to acquire nuclear weapons. Finally, the image downplays the politics of security and threat, naturalizing the security dilemma to the point that it is considered an automatic dynamic. The image of “proliferation” thus privileges a technical, apolitical policy by casting the problem as a technical one. The NPT controls and safeguards the movement of the technology of nuclear energy. The supporting supplier groups jointly impose controls on the supply—that is, the outward flow—of this same technology. The goal in both cases is to stem or at least slow the outward movement of material and its attendant techniques. These entailments suggest that to reimagine another problem of weapons technology in terms of “proliferation” is to construct that problem as technologically autonomous and to privilege solutions that attempt to control this natural growth by means of interventions aimed at the constituent technologies. This is precisely the strategy institutionalized within the chemical weapons convention. The general obligations of the states party to the CWC—set out in its first article—are to refrain from developing, producing, or holding any CW; to refrain from using CW or making military preparations for their use; and to refrain from assisting anyone else from doing anything prohibited by the convention. 20 These obligations are usefully compared with those assumed by states in the first two articles of the NPT. 21 In both cases the obligations of states party are to refrain from producing or procuring the weapon in question and to forego transferring the weapon to others. The difference—and it is an important difference—is that in the case of the NPT, five nuclear weapon states do not have to renounce their nuclear weapons capability. Otherwise, the obligations are identical. More to the point than the initial obligations, however, are the practices each treaty institutionalizes to prevent the spread of weapons. In both cases direct international supervision and control are placed on precursor technologies to ensure that they do not “spread” to weapons. The NPT obliges all NNWSs party to place their nuclear industries under IAEA safeguards, and the NWSs party to the NPT have also placed their nonmilitary nuclear facilities under international safeguard. 22 These safeguards are an internationally monitored material accountancy, designed to ensure that all fissile material used to produce nuclear energy is accounted for throughout the nuclear fuel cycle—and thus has not been diverted to produce nuclear weapons. Similarly, the CWC establishes an extensive machinery to verify that chemicals from the chemical industries of the states party are not used to produce CW. The mechanics of the CW system vary from those of the nuclear safeguards, but the essentials do not. In both cases potential industrial sources of technological spread are declared to the international agency, which can then monitor those industries to ensure that the declarations are accurate and that the material of concern is properly accounted for. The CWC is therefore a “proliferation” control instrument, in the same way the 1989 and 1990 bilateral agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States over chemical weapons were “arms control” agreements. The centrality to the CWC regime of the practices monitoring chemical industries to ensure they are not used to spread chemical weapons marks it as an instrument to control proliferation, not one designed to achieve disarmament, for instance. Only in the context of a reimagining of the problem of chemical weapons from one of “arms control” or “disarmament” to one of “proliferation” did the CWC become possible. As chemical weapons came to be imagined as a “proliferation” problem in the late 1980s, the CWC as a nonproliferation agreement for chemical technology (but without the overtly discriminatory features of the nuclear NPT) became realizable. The end of the Cold War not only produced a limited arms control agreement between the superpowers concerning chemical weapons but, more important, created the conditions for realizing what reimagining in terms of the “proliferation” image made possible. A “proliferation” image produces a particular kind of object. It imagines a technology that reproduces naturally and autonomously, moving outward from an identifiable origin by relentlessly multiplying. The image imagines this technology as essentially benign but with the possibility of excess—reproduction is natural, expected, and even desirable, but prolific reproduction is dangerous. To permit the benign spread of technology while preventing the dangerous conclusion to that spread, external controls are required. Because the object of “proliferation” is imagined in this fashion, the forms of control that can be applied are constrained. Put another way, the particular imagination of the object of “proliferation” enables a specific series of control practices. The reverse is also true: creating given practices will construct the object of those practices in particular ways. The result is a neatly closed circle it is simple to reify—we face this particular problem with these practices; these practices are employed, so we are facing this problem. Read in either direction, the contingent becomes seen as the natural. <br />
<br />
Representations of “proliferation” as a threat legitimize an unenforceable security paradox and displace concerns for justice—this relies on an ethnocentric and racialized view of third world people<br />
Biswas, 1 – Professor of Political Science at Whitman College (Shampa, Nuclear Apartheid&quot; as Political Position: Race as a Postcolonial Resource? Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, Vol. 26, , Questia)<br />
<br />
International relations in general, and security studies more specifically, have tended to privilege the &quot;problem of order&quot; over the &quot;concern for justice.&quot; Coming from a critical perspective, Simon Dalby points out that national security is in general premised on the &quot;desirability of order,&quot; and hence has often been &quot;a conservative formulation, equating the political status quo with desirable order.&quot; (90) This political status quo has been somewhat unsettled by the dissolution of the Soviet threat; the primary bipolar balance-of-power framework that for so long dominated security studies has been rendered obsolete in the post-Cold War period. In the words of another critical security-studies scholar, David Mutimer: &quot;Proliferation is a problem enunciated to fill the gap left by the Cold War.&quot; (91) Examining the use of the dominant metaphors that structure thinking about global security issues, Mutimer has shown how the increasing salience of the &quot;proliferation issue&quot; in the post-Cold War world builds on underlying anxieties about instability and disorder, so that the very use of the metaphor of proliferation entails a conservative normative commitment to the maintenance of stable and balanced orders--a commitment that &quot;naturalizes a particular set of relations of power and interest, privileging those who are able to set the metaphorical agenda, and render invisible the political basis of their claims.&quot; (92) This article has attempted to demonstrate that taking the &quot;nuclear apartheid&quot; argument seriously is to reveal that underlying this fear of proliferation is a series of racialized constructions of Third World people. With the discrediting of scientific racism and with the increasing recognition by scholars of race that &quot;color&quot; is not necessarily the prime index or the only marker of racialization, it may not be entirely surprising that the question of race in global politics has been so intractable. Yet many scholars have argued that contemporary racism exists in a far more invidious form precisely because it often rejects a biologized concept of race in favor of culturalist forms, or what has been called the &quot;new racisms.&quot; (93) The invidiousness of such racism lies in that it often exists without making any explicit reference to race, so that it has been said that we now live in a world with &quot;a lot of racism but very few racists.&quot; (94) If the process of racialization and racism--a process of hierarchization, inferiorization, and subordination of racialized groups (99)--can use all kinds of signifiers or markers, a biological and cultural tracing of its operations in global politics requires innovative conceptual lenses a nd new analytical tools. However, &quot;race,&quot; as Roxanne Doty points out, &quot;has most fundamentally been about being human. Racist discourses historically have constructed different kinds and degrees of humanness through representational practices that have claimed to be and have been accepted as 'true' and accurate representations of 'reality.&quot;' (96) This article has argued that if one takes &quot;rationality&quot; as fundamental to what makes us fully human--the premise of most Enlightenment-inspired narratives--fears of proliferation that rely on presuppositions of the irrationality of &quot;others&quot; draw on racist discourses that deny a degree of humanity to &quot;others&quot; in the very constitution of the &quot;self&quot; as human. However, this article is also premised on the claim that rather than a generalized formulation of a singular, monolithic racism, it is more useful to talk of historical racisms, examining processes of racializations in the contexts in which they exist. Hence, in addition to the construction of a racialized Third World in nuclear proliferation discourses, I have also examined the racializations of religious and other minorities in the BJP's discourses of the Hindu/Indian nation as well as the operations of a racist global discourse on Islam and Muslims that serves this project.<br />

The terminal impact’s extinction—a division of the world into the elect and the deviant privileges a mentality that sanctions genocidal apocalypse<br />
Fasching, 93 – Professor of Religious Studies at University of South Florida (Darrell, The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, p. 175-176)<br />
<br />
The fundamental problem as Richard Rubenstein viewed it is how we treat the stranger. The problem is the human penchant for creating &quot;the self-defeating ethos of exclusivism and intol¬erance . . . derived from a religious tradition that insists upon the dichotomous division of mankind into the elect and the reprobate.&quot;36 The logical outcome of such a civilization, Rubenstein argued, is noth¬ing less than an apocalyptic &quot;world-wide catastrophe in which hun¬dreds of millions of human beings are destroyed and civilization as we know it disappears. . . . [And] we have the weaponry to bring it about.&quot;37 The ethical task as Arthur Cohen conceived it is to excavate the demonic, to descend into the abyss of the demonic. One must demythologize its overwhelming reality and uncover the human roots of its inhumanity. One must come to understand the many faces and hid¬den depths of its manifestations so as to be able to build a wall of containment around it and a bridge capable of sustaining the traffic of human life over it. The challenge is to divert our present historical trajectory away from any possible apocalyptic outcome. &quot;The task of excavating the demonic,&quot; said Cohen, &quot;is no metaphor. How can we regard the atomic bomb, or Vietnam, or the revelations of Sol-zhenitzyn's Gulag, if not as modalities of the abyss, excavations and elaborations of the human penchant to self-infinity, to the ultimate hubris which brings not o=nly Jews but all creatures to the borderlands from which there is return for none. It begins with the Jews and it may end with the habitable world.&quot;38 This self-infinitizing sacralization (absolutizing) of some portion of the finite as a substitute for the infinite leads to a dualistic division of the world into the elect (sacred) and the reprobate (profane) and the demand for unquestioning obe¬dience to the genocidal imperative—killing in order to heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Alternative is Renunciation—rather than projecting our fears upon the identities of another, we should criticize the existence of the bomb itself.  The problem is not that it’s spreading, but that it exists.  Vote negative to repudiate the existence of weapons of mass destruction.<br />

This article has critiqued policy talk grounded in an unsustainable binary opposition between nations that can be trusted with nuclear weapons and nations that cannot—an opposition that can be found in some antinuclear as well as establishment discourse in the West. I do not want to minimize the potential dangers of nuclear proliferation, which are, surely, clear enough. I do want to argue that these dangers, such as they are, should not be spoken about in terms that demean the peoples of the Third World. Nor should they be represented in ways that obscure both the dangers inherent in the continued maintenance of our own nuclear arsenals and the fact that our own actions are often a source of the instabilities we so fear in Third World nations. So, where does this leave us? This article has set out to critique not a particular policy but the way our conversations about policy choices on the nuclear issue may unthinkingly incorporate certain neocolonial hierarchies and assumptions that, when drawn to our attention, many of us would disown. Nor is this just a matter of policing language, for the embedded orientalist assumptions I have been critiquing here underpin a global security regime that sanctifies a particular kind of Western military dominance in the world. Because I have set out to criticize a particular kind of policy talk rather than a specific policy, I will conclude not with a prescribed policy but by suggesting that there are three different discursive positions on proliferation, each pointing in the direction of a very different global security regime, that do not embody the double standard I have been concerned to criticize here. I call them &quot;exclusion,&quot; &quot;participation,&quot; and &quot;renunciation.&quot; The strategy of exclusion is based pragmatically in the conventions of realpolitik. It involves the candid declaration that, while nuclear weapons may be no more dangerous in the hands of Muslims or Hindus than in those of Christians, they are a prerogative of power, and the powerful have no intention of allowing the powerless to acquire them. This is a position that, in its rejection of easy racism and phony moralism, is at least honorable in its frankness. It is the position of New York Times columnist Flora Lewis in her remark that &quot;the `rights' of nations are limited, and the limits must be imposed by those who can. They may not be more virtuous, but they must strive for it. That is the reason to keep insisting on nonproliferation&quot; (1990:23). The second position, participation, is based on Kenneth Waltz's argument that all countries benefit from acquiring nuclear weapons. This position may have more appeal in certain parts of the Third World than in the West. It is the position of India, Israel, and Pakistan, for example, who have, like the older nuclear nations, sought to maximize their power and freedom by acquiring a nuclear capability. These countries pursued nuclear weapons in search of greater security vis-à-vis regional rivals and out of a desire to shift the balance of power in their client relationships with the superpowers. The third strategy would be renunciation. This strategy breaks down the distinctions we have constructed between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; and asks whether nuclear weapons are safe in anyone's hands. &quot;What-must-on-no-account-beknown,&quot; says Salman Rushdie, is the &quot;impossible verity that savagery could be concealed beneath decency's well-pressed shirt&quot; (1984:219). Our orientalist discourse on nuclear proliferation is one of our ways not to know this. By breaking down the discourse, confronting those parts of our own personality and culture which appear as the childish, irrational, lawless, or feminine aspects of the Other, we could address our doubts about ourselves instead of harping continually on our doubts about others. Then we might accept that &quot;the fact that we urge other nations not to depend on nuclear weapons in this way—and urge very strenuously—suggests that we have mixed feelings about how safe they make us&quot; (Ground Zero 1982:221). This acceptance would lead us to the same conclusion reached by George Kennan, former ambassador to the Soviet Union and the originator of the policy of containment in the Cold War: I see the danger not in the number or quality of the weapons or in the intentions of those who hold them but in the very existence of weapons of this nature, regardless of whose hands they are in. I believe that unless we consent to recognize that the nuclear weapons we hold in our hands are as much a danger to us as those that repose in the hands of our supposed adversaries there will be no escape from the confusions and dilemmas to which such weapons have brought us, and must bring us increasingly as time goes on. For this reason, I see no solution to the problem other than the complete elimination of these and all other weapons of mass destruction from national arsenals; and the sooner we move toward that solution, and the greater courage we show in doing so, the safer we will be.

Butt, 2010 - physicist in the High-Energy Astrophysics Division at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Former fellow in the Committee on International Security and Arms Control at the National Academy of Sciences, nuclear physics Ph.D., 5/8/10 (Yousaf, “The myth of missile defense as a deterrent,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11107:http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/the-myth-of-missile-defense-deterrent --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/the-myth-of-missile-defense-deterrent" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/the-myth-of-missile-defense-deterrent</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11107 -->.)<br />
<br />
Exaggerating the abilities of missile defense is downright dangerous and military leaders ought to make sure that it doesn't happen; unfortunately, it does. Take, for example, these claims made in the February 2010 Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR) report PDF: &quot;The United States now possesses a capacity to counter the projected threats from North Korea and Iran for the foreseeable future.&quot; And: &quot;The United States is currently protected against the threat of limited ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] attack, as a result of investments made over the past decade in a system based on ground-based midcourse defense.&quot; Neither of these statements is remotely true. The current system cannot even reliably intercept a single missile that's launched at a known time and on a known trajectory. None of the various missile defense systems, sea- or land-based, have ever been tested in a realistic setting: For instance, a surprise attack with salvos of missiles with decoy warheads (and other countermeasures) and unknown trajectories. J. Michael Gilmore, the director of the Operational Test and Evaluation Office of the Secretary of Defense, recently testified PDF that &quot;it will take as many as five to seven years to collect&quot; just the necessary data to determine whether the administration's planned missile defense architecture is even sensible. And if future tests do prove it to be an empirical failure will the administration really roll back missile defense? It's unlikely. The long-range plans appear to be unencumbered by any realistic testing requirements. Unfounded claims of missile defense's effectiveness create a serious risk that political leaders might be misled into mistakenly believing that missile defenses actually work. And if they incorrectly think that missile defense has secured the country by neutralizing the threat of ballistic missile attack, policy makers might be emboldened to stake out riskier and more aggressive regional policies than in the absence of missile defense. A similar mistaken confidence in overwhelming U.S. conventional firepower misled Washington into the Iraq War debacle; nuclear miscalculations would be much more costly. For this reason, missile defense should not, as the NPR claims it would, play any role in &quot;reassuring allies and partners around the world&quot;; no ally should feel secured by a defensive system that can be penetrated by nuclear-tipped missiles. If allies do feel they have neutralized their adversaries' deterrent forces, they too might be tempted to undertake riskier actions, possibly leading to conflict and ultimately even U.S. nuclear intervention. A misplaced confidence in missile defenses could even lull Washington into complacency regarding the spread of WMD and ballistic missile technology: Imagining that they have largely addressed the threat from ballistic missiles, policy makers might feel less urgency to fight proliferation.<br />

3. Brilliant Pebbles Fail – if it is used, it causes a debris cloud that disables it<br />
<br />
Globalsecurity.org 2010 (January 11 2010, “Chinese Anti-Satellite [ASAT] Capabilities and ABM Capability” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11108:http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/china/asat.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/china/asat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/china/asat.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11108 --> SG)<br />
<br />
In that novel study, Westwood showed that space-based 'Brilliant Pebbles' component of the national missile defense system, sponsored by Dr. Lowell Wood (Edward Teller's protégé), of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, was a fundamentally flawed concept of operations because (1) it required less than one percent of the total constellation contemplated by the LLNL model to perform effectively and (2) because, like as the PRC anti-satellite event over fifteen years later, every successive, successful, kinetic-kill impact would increase the volume of an orbiting debris cloud, itself ever-more ruinous of the jth &quot;pebble's&quot; reliability .<br />

4. No solvency – ballistic missile defense causes nations to develop cruise missiles<br />
<br />
Dutra 2004 (Michael Dutra, Associate, White &amp; Case LLP, 2004, “Strategic Myopia: The United States, Cruise Missiles, and the Missile Technology Control Regime,” Journal of Transnational Law &amp; Policy, Vol. 14, No. 1)<br />
<br />
Cruise missiles represent a way for Third World states to offset the technological superiority of the United States and exploit the weaknesses of extant U.S. systems. The U.S. focus on building theater anti-ballistic missile systems such as the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) program will only push nations such as North Korea and Iran, which have long sought to acquire long-range means to threaten U.S. interests, to look for an alternative to ballistic missiles. As the effectiveness of U.S. antiballistic missile defenses increases, potential foes are likely to turn to LACMs as an alternative. 54 In the 2003 war in Iraq, the effectiveness of U.S. Patriot SAMs at shooting down approximately fifty percent of Iraqi Scud ballistic missiles launched at U.S. forces should be contrasted with the failure of U.S. missile defenses to intercept any of the antiquated Iraqi Seersucker cruise missiles fired at U.S. forces. 55 David Tanks, an analyst with the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, notes that “[i]f we start fielding ballistic missile defense, other countries will start developing more cruise missiles. It is cheap and relatively easy.” 56 The logical choice for such nations is to start a cruise missile program, which is increasingly technologically feasible, or to try to obtain LACMs from another source. As cruise missiles are more accurate than firstgeneration ballistic missiles like the Scud, less technologically complex, and less expensive to develop, they are the most attractive choice for a state seeking long-range strike capability as the technology required for indigenous LACM development becomes easier to obtain. 57<br />

5. Turn - SBMD causes Russia and China to respond with cyber weapons and ASATs – that causes war and deterrence breakdown<br />
<br />
Van Ness 2010 - Department of International Relations in the College of Asia and the Pacific at the ANU. Peter, PhD (Berkley),  lectures on security and peace building in the Previously faculty at the Graduate School of International Studies, University of Denver ’10 (ASIAN PERSPECTIVE, “ THE TIME HAS COME FOR A TREATY TO BAN WEAPONS IN SPACE” Vol. 34, No. 3, 2010, pp. 215-225)<br />
<br />
First and foremost in designing an agreement is the need to ban space-based weapons before any are deployed. Both China and Russia are adamantly opposed to these weapons, and Chinese analysts make a strong case that a U.S. space-based, boost-phase missile defense system would indeed threaten the PRC’s basic nuclear deterrent.12 Space-based weapons, if they are ever devel-oped, would be hugely expensive, difficult to deploy, and vulnera-ble to attack by China’s and Russia’s existing ASAT capabilities. What China seems to be saying to the United States, by its actions more than its words, is: If you go to the expense of devel-oping and deploying space-based weapons, we will be able to defend against them with our current ASAT, missile defense, and cyber war capabilities. If it should come to a military conflict between us, we could destroy those weapons in space or confound their command and control by means of cyber attacks. As a result, the United States would be engaged in a one-sided arms race in space, trying to gain dominance by means of space-based weapons, while ignoring the fact that the weapons are vulnerable to asymmetrical attack. Protection of satellites is a more difficult problem. One fact that should help in their defense is that all countries are increas-ingly dependent upon the communication, surveillance, and geo-positioning functions of earth satellites, so they all have a huge stake in their defense. Secondly, attacks on satellites are likely to produce debris (as the Chinese ASAT test of January2007 did), which endangers the proper operation of everyone’s satellites. A major attack on several satellites could have a disastrous impact on global military and commercial communications. So there exists a contradictory situation in which the United States, China, and Russia all have the capability to attack and destroy each other’s satellites, but if they did attack, they would very likely destroy as well their own use of satellites in space. In that sense, an attack would be suicidal. One answer with regard to the protection of satellites might be to use the lesson of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of1963. After the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, both the United States and the USSR realized that they had weapons that could not be used, and they agreed with each other to begin to limit their use. They maintained the capacity to use them, but realized that any use would be counterproductive. If the United States and China began to think about their ASAT capabilities in these terms, it seems to me that agreement could be reached to limit the testing, deployment, and use of ASAT weapons. <br />

[    ] Saudi Arabia can’t and has no incentive to proliferate<br />
<br />
Lippman ‘8 /Thomas, former Middle East correspondent and a diplomatic and national security reporter for The Washington Post/<br />
<br />
It is far from certain, however, that Saudi Arabia would wish to acquire its own nuclear arsenal or that it is capable of doing so. There are compelling reasons why Saudi Arabia would not undertake an effort to develop or acquire nuclear weapons, even in the unlikely event that Iran achieves a stockpile and uses this arsenal to threaten the Kingdom. Money is not an issue — if destitute North Korea can develop nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia surely has the resources to pursue such a program. In the fall of 2007, the Saudis reported a budget surplus of $77 billion, and with oil prices above $90 a barrel, Riyadh is flush with cash. But the acquisition or development of nuclear weapons would be provocative, destabilizing, controversial and extremely difficult for Saudi Arabia, and ultimately would likely weaken the kingdom rather than strengthen it. Such a course would be directly contrary to the Kingdom’s longstanding stated goal of making the entire Middle East a nuclear weapons free zone. According to Sultan bin ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, the Defense Minister and Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons by their nature contravene the tenets of Islam. Pursuing nuclear weapons would be a flagrant violation of Saudi Arabia’s commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), and would surely cause a serious breach with the United States. Saudi Arabia lacks the industrial and technological base to develop such weapons on its own. An attempt to acquire nuclear weapons by purchasing them, perhaps from Pakistan, would launch Saudi Arabia on a dangerously inflammatory trajectory that could destabilize the entire region, which Saudi Arabia’s leaders know would not be in their country’s best interests. The Saudis always prefer stability to turmoil. Saudi Arabia and the NPT Saudi Arabia, like Iran, is a signatory to the NPT and participates in the safeguard regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It signed the treaty only under duress, but its reluctance was not based on a desire to develop nuclear wepons. The Kingdom’s position was that it would be happy to join the NPT system when Israel did so. But then in 1988 it was virtually forced to sign the NPT because of intense pressure from the United States. <br />

However, the involvement of nuclear installations in the Indo-Pak crises of 1984–85 does not qualify these events as nuclear crises. Similarly speculative reports have suggested that a nuclear dimension imbued the Brasstacks and Kashmir-related 1990 crisis, but evidence here is tenuous. However, the Indo-Pakistani crises that followed their reciprocal nuclear tests in May 1998 had a nuclear dimension; they include the Kargil conflict and the border confrontation following a Pakistan-sponsored terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament on December 13, 2001. The situation that arose could have erupted into a “shooting war.” The danger of Indo-Pakistani crises escalating across the nuclear threshold is apparent, but a thesis has gained currency in India that limited wars can be fought under the rubric of nuclear deterrence. As stated by George Fernandes, India’s Defence Minister, “Pakistan did hold out a nuclear threat during the Kargil War last year. But it had not absorbed the real meaning of nuclearization; that it can deter only the use of nuclear weapons, but not all and any war…. [S]o the issue was not that war had been made obsolete by nuclear weapons, and that covert war by proxy was the only option, but that conventional war remained feasible though with definite limitations.” 9 India and Pakistan have conducted proxy wars and sub rosa operations against each other and fought a limited war under the aegis of nuclear weapons. Hence, there is optimism that limited conflicts can be fought and will not escalate to general war and further to a nuclear exchange, despite the prevailing atmosphere of mistrust and convictions regarding the irrationality of the “Other.” <br />

A. Our Interpretations<br />
<br />
First – Space development includes one of seven types of projects<br />
Hsu and Cox Feng, Ph.D. is a Sr. Fellow, Aerospace Technology Working Group and Ken, Ph.D., is a  Founder and Director Aerospace Technology Working Group ‘9 ( An Aerospace Technology Working Group White Paper Version 2.1.1, “ Sustainable Space Exploration and Space Development: A Unified Strategic Vision”, March 29, 2009, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11110:http://www.spacerenaissance.org/papers/A-UnifiedSpaceVision-Hsu-Cox.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacerenaissance.org/papers/A-UnifiedSpaceVision-Hsu-Cox.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacerenaissance.org/papers/A-UnifiedSpaceVision-Hsu-Cox.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11110 -->)<br />
Even with adequate reform in its governance model, NASA would not be the right institution to lead or manage the nation’s business in Space Development projects. Human space development activities, such as creation of affordable launch vehicles, RLVs, space-based solar power, space tourism, communication satellites, and transEarth or trans-lunar space transportation infrastructure systems are primarily commercial development endeavors that are not only cost-benefit-sensitive in project management, but also subject to fundamental business principles related to profitability, sustainability, and market development<br />
<br />
Second – Space Exploration is the investigation of the physical condition of space via artificial satellites, space probes, or manned spacecrafts<br />
Columbia Encyclopedia 2007(The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia: “Space Exploration” &lt;<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11111:http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/space+exploration --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/space+exploration" rel="nofollow">http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/space+exploration</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11111 -->&gt;)<br />
<br />
space exploration, the investigation of physical conditions in space and on stars, planets, and other celestial bodies through the use of artificial satellites (spacecraft that orbit the earth), space probes (spacecraft that pass through the solar system and that may or may not orbit another celestial body), and spacecraft with human crews <br />
<br />
B. Violation – the aff is not included on the list of development projects AND does explore space with probes or spacecrafts.<br />
<br />
C. Voting Issue – <br />
<br />
1. Limits – world of unlimited plans makes it impossible to be negative – explodes the research burden to the point we lose topic-specific and in-depth education<br />
<br />
2. Ground – they steal key core negative ground – their aff is the Capitalism Kritik – we lose this argument against this aff – they have to defend that space policies are good. <br />

Text: The United States federal government should withdraw from the Outer Space Treaty.<br />
<br />
The plan solidifies a tragedy of the anti-commons which discourages space exploration<br />
<br />
Hickman, ‘7 – John, associate professor in the Department of Government and International Studies at Berry College in Mt. Berry, Georgia [9/24, The Space Review, “ Still crazy after four decades: The case for withdrawing from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11112:http://www.thespacereview.com/article/960/1 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/960/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/960/1</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11112 -->] <br />
<br />
The core legal principle of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty declared that everywhere beyond the atmosphere to be res communis, an international commons rather akin to the “international waters” of the open oceans on Earth, rather than terra nullius, the sort of territory that is unclaimed yet claimable by states as sovereign territory. In what was then stirring, and today preposterous, language of the agreement, all of outer space was declared the “Common Home of Mankind” to be explored and exploited by all countries and for the benefit of all humanity. There are two patently obvious flaws in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, one tragic and the other silly. The tragic flaw is that it created an “anti-commons.” The general problem is that establishing a commons runs the risk of creating perverse incentives. Where the commons is easy to exploit the likely result is the degradation of its renewable resources. That much has been understood by public policymakers at least since publication of Garret Hardin‘s influential essay “The Tragedy of the Commons.” Less appreciated is that establishing a commons can also establish an “anti-commons.” Eliminating the possibility of reaping rewards from a desired activity discourages that desired activity. When the 1967 Outer Space Treaty eliminated the possibility that states could claim territory on the final frontier it also extinguished an important motivation for states and private firms to engage in exploration and development. Had the policy purpose of the treaty been wilderness preservation in outer space then today it would be declared a smashing success. Beyond low Earth orbit, outer space remains a wilderness that benefits no one except astronomers and stargazing lovers. Yet the ostensible policy purpose of the agreement was to encourage space exploration and development in a manner that benefits humanity as a whole. As such, the 1967 Outer Space Treaty was an abysmal failure. While there are other reasons for the effective closing of the space frontier beyond low Earth orbit with the last Apollo Missions to the Moon—the relaxation of Cold War tensions in the 1970s gave the superpowers less reason to compete and their other budget priorities competed with space programs—the diplomats and politicians who foisted the treaty onto an unwitting humanity in 1967 deserve much of the credit. Their negotiations resulted in a near-quarantine of humans on Earth and low Earth orbit and only anemic efforts to explore our solar system via unmanned space programs. Depriving states of the right to claim sovereign national territory on solid celestial bodies has discouraged more energetic space exploration and development in the same manner that depriving property developers of the right to purchase real property would discourage their investment. One need to not applaud each and every property development project to recognize the economic value of property development to society, and the same may be said of the efforts of states in claiming and governing new territories. That idea that states are no longer interested in claiming new territory is belied by the Russian Federation’s recent claim under the Convention on the Laws of the Sea to the 1.2 million square kilometers of the Lomonosov Ridge in the Arctic.<br />

Extinction is inevitable without acquiring space resources<br />

<br />
Resources and Other Benefits: Since we live in a world of finite resources and the global population continues to grow, at some point the human race must utilize resources from space in order to survive. We are already constrained by our limited resources, and the decisions we make today will have a profound affect on the future of humanity. Using resources and energy from space will enable continued growth and the spread of prosperity to the developing world without destroying our planet. Our minimal investment in space exploration (less than 1 percent of the U.S. budget) reaps tremendous intangible benefits in almost every aspect of society, from technology development to high-tech jobs. When we reach the point of sustainable space operations we will be able to transform the world from a place where nations quarrel over scarce resources to one where the basic needs of all people are met and we unite in the common adventure of exploration. The first step is a sustainable permanent human lunar settlement. <br />

A. Republicans are pushing a UN Bill that cuts funding for the organization. Obama has threatened to Veto it. It will not make it through the Senate now.<br />
<br />
New York Sun, Oct 16, 2011 [It’s Clinton v. Ros-Lehtinen <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11114:http://www.nysun.com/editorials/its-clinton-v-ros-lehtinen/87525/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nysun.com/editorials/its-clinton-v-ros-lehtinen/87525/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nysun.com/editorials/its-clinton-v-ros-lehtinen/87525/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11114 -->    <br />
<br />
It looks like the efforts to reform U.S. funding of the United Nations are turning into a significant showdown between two of the most powerful women in Washington — President Obama's state secretary, Hillary Clinton, and the chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. This came into focus during a hearing Thursday at which the Foreign Affairs Committee approved — by a wide margin and over Mrs. Clinton’s objections — a bill that would give America much more say over what, if any, United Nations programs it underwrites. The bill, which is being pressed by Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen, has emerged as the most serious and radical reform effort directed at the U.N. since the institution was incorporated in the late 1940s. Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen began the hearings with an opening statement in which she spoke of the U.N.s bid, in the middle of a fiscal crisis in Washington, for a bigger budget. She quoted the Obama administration’s own envoy to the U.N. budget process as saying, that the budget presented by the U.N. “does not represent a break from ‘business as usual,’ but rather a continuation of it.” “What are we paying for?” Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen demanded. Then she ticked off the scandals: “A UN Human Rights Council that includes such gross human rights violators as China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and its vice-chair, Cuba. Two years after the Administration joined the Council, the Council still has undergone zero fundamental reforms, continues to pass resolution after resolution condemning Israel, and its permanent agenda item on Israel remains in place. We’re paying for the Durban process, which has been hijacked to spread anti-Israel and anti-Semitic venom.” Continued she: “Then there’s the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, recently chaired by North Korea. So serial proliferator North Korea presided over the UN’s disarmament body, and Iran, a regime which stones women to death, is a member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. We’re paying for a U.N. that just appointed as the head of its Kosovo mission an individual involved with the infamous Oil-for-Food scandal, and a U.N. that goes after whistleblowers while protecting the corrupt.” Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen disclosed that Secretary of State Clinton sent a letter at the outset of the hearings Thursday coming out directly in opposition to the bill. “The Secretary claims, if we move to a system of voluntary funding, it will hurt our soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, because other member states won’t do the ‘burden-sharing’ to pay for UN missions in those countries,” Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen said. “Does the Administration have such little faith in our allies and in our diplomacy — which they pride themselves on — to think that they would not share the burden of fighting Islamist extremists unless the UN forced them to? And given that the U.S. paid billions and billions of dollars to the UN last year, I think it’s clear who is actually carrying the burden without any say: the U.S. taxpayer.” The ranking member on the Democratic side of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Howard Berman, offered a substitute bill designed to gut Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen’s reform. Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen argued that, among other flaws, Mr. Berman’s measure would mean “ no consequences if any UN body upgrades the Palestinian status.” In the event, the committee turned aside Mr. Berman’s substitute measure and Mrs. Clinton’s objections and passed the United Nations Transparency, Accountability, and Reform Act by a comfortable margin. In the full House, the bill has something like 125 sponsors. They are, at least at the moment, all Republicans, according to a dispatch of CNS News. Even if the measure clears the House, it will still have a hard time in the Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats. Mrs. Clinton’s letter to the committee warned that if, by some miracle, the measure does pass, she’ll urge President Obama to veto it. This strikes us as an opportunity for the Republicans to bring the issue of the United Nations into the presidential campaign now under way and so that the American people can let the dictators, kleptocrats, and anti-Semites in the United Nations know where America stands.<br />

B. Links -  Political capital is key to Veto Credibility – it will deter Congress from acting against the President<br />
<br />

<br />
Congressional Anticipation. The last alternative explanation proposes that Congress drafts favorable legislation in response to the president’s increase in political capital. In contrast to the investment explanation, where the president uses veto threats differently depending on his capital and the legislation stays constant, this theory suggests that Congress changes its actions. The president’s use of the veto is constant, but Congress changes its legislation depending on the president’s approval rating. In recent years, the majority leadership in the House has aggressively used its power to control the agenda. If a measure seems likely to divide the majority party or face a presidential veto, then it will probably not reach a House floor vote in the first place (Simendinger 2003). When the president’s approval ratings increase, the Congress anticipates a stronger veto threat. This anticipation creates favorable legislation rather than unfavorable legislation that will trigger a veto. Therefore, when the president’s political capital is at its highest, the presidential veto will be least likely. In the current 109th Congress, however, there were signs of strain between the White House and the House Republican Leadership, possibly caused by the president’s decrease in political capital (“Bush Vows Stem Cell Veto” 2005).<br />

The assertion is getting louder: President Obama is a socialist, a wealth-redistributing wolf in Democrat's clothing gnawing at America's entrepreneurial spirit. It's easy to buy &quot;Obama is a socialist&quot; bumper stickers on the Internet. Political commentator Dick Morris said, in a column circulated on GOPUSA.com, that conservatives are &quot;enraged at Barack Obama's socialism and radicalism.&quot; Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich titled his new book &quot;To Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular-Socialist Machine.&quot; So, is Mr. Obama trying to form The Socialist Republic of America? Or are the accusations mainly a political weapon, meant to stick Obama with a label that is poison to many voters and thus make him a one-term president? As is often the case in politics, the answer is in the eye of the beholder. Some people feel genuinely certain that Obama aims to make America into a workers' paradise – a land where government-appointed pay czars tell Wall Street tycoons how much they can make and where the feds take large ownership positions in companies like General Motors (GM) and insurance giant American International Group (AIG). Even if Obama is not a card-carrying Socialist, they say, he displays a disdain of the private sector. &quot;You start with his apparent acceptance that there are major segments of the US economy for which it is reasonable for the US government to own or manage,&quot; says Michael Johns, Heritage Foundation policy analyst, &quot;tea party&quot; movement leader, and former speechwriter for President Bush. &quot;Look at the auto industry, mortgage industry, the health-care industry to some extent, and, obviously, banking.&quot; Others just as assuredly refute the idea that government involvement in failing industries defines a president as socialist – or that wealth is being redistributed from the Forbes 500 richest Americans to the nation's &quot;Joe the plumbers.&quot; What Mr. Johns, Mr. Gingrich, and others brandishing the &quot;socialist&quot; s-word are really complaining of is a return to the policies of John Maynard Keynes, the English economist who advocated vigorous government involvement in the economy, from regulation to pump priming, says labor historian Peter Rachleff of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. &quot;Socialism suggests getting rid of capitalism altogether,&quot; says Dr. Rachleff. &quot;Mr. Obama is not within a million miles of an ideology like that.&quot; For what it's worth, socialists deny that Obama is one of them – and even seem a bit insulted by the suggestion. &quot;I have been making a living telling people Obama is not a socialist,&quot; says Frank Llewellyn, national director of the Democratic Socialists of America. &quot;It's frustrating to see people using our brand to criticize programs that have nothing to do with our brand and are not even working.&quot; Adds Billy Wharton,co-chair of the Socialist Party USA: &quot;I am not even sure he's a liberal. I call him a hedge fund Democrat.&quot; The socialism tag is nothing new for the White House. In speeches, Obama chalks up the criticism to &quot;just politics.&quot; But he also works to counter it, sprinkling speeches with words about the appropriate role of government. &quot;Government cannot and should not replace businesses as the true engine of growth and job creation,&quot; he said June 2 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. That may be one reason some tea partyers doubt that Obama himself is humming &quot;The Internationale&quot; before breakfast. &quot;I'm reluctant to call him a socialist, but his policies are socialistic,&quot; says Don Adams, treasurer of the Independence Hall tea party in the Delaware Valley of Pennsylvania. Which policies qualify, precisely? Gingrich, in his book, cites a &quot;government takeover&quot; of GM as specific evidence of the socialistic political shift. The United States owned 60.8 percent of the common stock of GM and 9.9 percent of Chrysler as of April 21, the latest figures available. The government's goal, according to the Treasury, is not to be long-term investors. &quot;With the successful restructuring of GM and Chrysler behind us, the primary goal of the administration's auto efforts now is to monitor the investments and facilitate smooth exits from our investments in the companies,&quot; says US Treasury spokesman Mark Paustenbach. OK, so maybe Obama wants to get out of owning the companies, allows Johns of the Heritage Foundation. But the government has already used its ownership stake to impose sweeping mandates and regulations on the companies, such as closing hundreds of dealerships, he says. &quot;They forced changes in management that should more properly have been left to the company's private shareholders,&quot; says Johns. Not true, according to GM. The US did not exert pressure to close the 1,100 shuttered dealerships, says spokeswoman Noreen Pratscher. &quot;The government has taken a very hands-off approach.&quot; How about the Obama response to the crisis in the financial services industry? Has it veered into socialism? The largest ownership stake for Uncle Sam in the financial world is AIG, which ran into financial difficulties (not bankruptcy) in September 2008 after a complex series of financial transactions turned bad. The US government still owns almost 80 percent of AIG, which has received at least $182 billion in government assistance. In his book, Gingrich implies that government officials stormed into AIG's headquarters and took over the company. &quot;They have taken over AIG, America's largest insurer,&quot; he writes. The actual &quot;takeover&quot; of AIG occurred under President Bush in 2008, right after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The Congressional Oversight Panel, which lawmakers created in 2008 to review the regulation of financial markets, detailed in a recent report how it became impossible for AIG to find $75 billion in private funding to save itself as the financial markets crumbled that fall. The takeover of an ailing company whose collapse might ruin the US economy is not socialism, says Van Gosse, a Socialist and historian at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. &quot;Let's just say AIG was profitable, and you thought it was better if it was in public hands. That would be socialistic.&quot; To Dr. Gosse, the most socialistic move by the Obama administration to date is the massive reorganization of student lending. In late March, as part of the health-care overhaul, Congress voted to force out commercial lenders. The government was guaranteeing loans made by private companies who turned a profit on the loans. As for the assertion that Obama is pushing through policies that redistribute income from rich to poor, to some extent that is happening, says economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com. About half the growth in personal income during the Obama presidency has come from an increase in government payments for unemployment insurance, Social Security, and welfare, he says. &quot;The economic recovery act increased those transfer payments,&quot; says Mr. Zandi, noting that, regardless, the government would pay out more in jobless benefits and welfare during a recession. Tax rates for the wealthy may also rise: Obama has said he will allow the Bush income-tax cuts to expire. The highest marginal tax rate would climb to 39.6 percent, up from 35 percent. The new health-care law, moreover, raises taxes on people making more than $250,000 a year. &quot;Does that make it socialistic?&quot; asks Zandi, who supported Sen. John McCain in the 2008 election. &quot;It's not what I would define as socialism, but there is certainly a redistributional aspect to all this. The changes are taking place at the margins; there is not a sea change.&quot; Probably the last president to be tagged as a socialist was Franklin Roosevelt, who took office during the Great Depression. &quot;FDR tried all kinds of things and was accused of all kinds of things,&quot; says Tom Cronin, a presidential scholar at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. &quot;But in retrospect, he is someone who helped capitalism survive.&quot; He suspects that Obama and his appointees are firm believers in the free-market system. But, he adds, &quot;It's a free country, and people can say what they want about their president.&quot;<br />

<br />
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday warned House Republicans about pushing ahead with a bill to cut funds for the United Nations, saying she would recommend that President Barack Obama veto the legislation. In a letter to lawmakers, Clinton said the bill would severely limit U.S. participation in the world body, undercut U.S. interests and damage the security of Americans at home and abroad. The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans to consider the legislation on Clinton said international cooperation is critical to push American interests such as &quot;staunching nuclear proliferation, combatting terrorism, fully implementing sanctions on countries such as Iran and North Korea, preventing conflict around the globe, and supporting elections in countries just undergoing transition to democracy.&quot; She also said the legislation undermines the ability of the United State to share costs with other countries. &quot;This bill would effectively cede American leadership, creating a void for our adversaries to fill,&quot; Clinton wrote. The legislation, which has more than 50 Republican co-sponsors, would pressure the U.N. to adopt a voluntary funding system by withholding 50 percent of the U.S. non-voluntary regular budget contributions if, after two years, 80 percent of the U.N. regular budget is not funded on a voluntary rather than assessed basis. In the 2010 budget year, the U.S. provided $7.7 billion to the U.N. for its regular budget, peacekeeping and other programs, up from $6.1 billion the previous year. The bill also would block U.S. funds for any United Nations entity that supports giving Palestine an elevated status at the U.N. and ban U.S. contributions to the U.N. Human Rights Council and an anti-racism conference seen as a platform for anti-Israel rhetoric. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., chairwoman of the committee, is a frequent critic of the United Nations. In defending her legislation, she has said the international organization is plagued by scandal, mismanagement and inaction, and is biased against the United States and Israel. Clinton acknowledged problems with the U.N. but said that &quot;for all its imperfections, (it) is indispensable to advancing&quot; U.S. goals. Although Clinton raised the specter of a presidential veto, the legislation has little chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate.<br />

Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.<br />

On one hand there is nothing to say, really. You are surrounded by the blessings of capitalism. The buffet table, which you and your lunch partners only had to walk into a building to find, has a greater variety of food at a cheaper price than that which was available to any living person — king, lord, duke, plutocrat, or pope — in almost all of the history of the world. Not even fifty years ago would this have been imaginable.    All of history has been defined by the struggle for food. And yet that struggle has been abolished, not just for the rich but for everyone living in developed economies. The ancients, peering into this scene, might have assumed it to be Elysium. Medieval man conjured up such scenes only in visions of Utopia. Even in the late 19th century, the most gilded palace of the richest industrialist required a vast staff and immense trouble to come anywhere near approximating it.    We owe this scene to capitalism. To put it differently, we owe this scene to centuries of capital accumulation at the hands of free people who have put capital to work on behalf of economic innovations, at once competing with others for profit and cooperating with millions upon millions of people in an ever-expanding global network of the division of labor. The savings, investments, risks, and work of hundreds of years and uncountable numbers of free people have gone into making this scene possible, thanks to the ever-remarkable capacity for a society developing under conditions of liberty to achieve the highest aspirations of the society's members.    And yet, sitting on the other side of the table are well-educated people who imagine that the way to end the world's woes is through socialism. Now, people's definitions of socialism differ, and these persons would probably be quick to say that they do not mean the Soviet Union or anything like that. That was socialism in name only, I would be told. And yet, if socialism does mean anything at all today, it imagines that there can be some social improvement resulting from the political movement to take capital out of private hands and put it into the hands of the state. Other tendencies of socialism include the desire to see labor organized along class lines and given some sort of coercive power over how their employers' property is used. It might be as simple as the desire to put a cap on the salaries of CEOs, or it could be as extreme as the desire to abolish all private property, money, and even marriage.    Whatever the specifics of the case in question, socialism always means overriding the free decisions of individuals and replacing that capacity for decision making with an overarching plan by the state. Taken far enough, this mode of thought won't just spell an end to opulent lunches. It will mean the end of what we all know as civilization itself. It would plunge us back to a primitive state of existence, living off hunting and gathering in a world with little art, music, leisure, or charity. Nor is any form of socialism capable of providing for the needs of the world's six billion people, so the population would shrink dramatically and quickly and in a manner that would make every human horror ever known seem mild by comparison. Nor is it possible to divorce socialism from totalitarianism, because if you are serious about ending private ownership of the means of production, you have to be serious about ending freedom and creativity too. You will have to make the whole of society, or what is left of it, into a prison.    In short, the wish for socialism is a wish for unparalleled human evil. If we really understood this, no one would express casual support for it in polite company. It would be like saying, you know, there is really something to be said for malaria and typhoid and dropping atom bombs on millions of innocents.    Do the people sitting across the table really wish for this? Certainly not. So what has gone wrong here? Why can these people not see what is obvious? Why can't people sitting amidst market-created plenty, enjoying all the fruits of capitalism every minute of life, see the merit of the market but rather wish for something that is a proven disaster?    What we have here is a failure of understanding. That is to say, a failure to connect causes with effects. This is a wholly abstract idea. Knowledge of cause and effect does not come to us by merely looking around a room, living in a certain kind of society, or observing statistics. You can study roomfuls of data, read a thousand treatises on history, or plot international GDP figures on a graph for a living, and yet the truth about cause and effect can still be evasive. You still might miss the point that it is capitalism that gives rise to prosperity and freedom. You might still be tempted by the notion of socialism as savior.    Let me take you back to the years 1989 and 1990. These were the years that most of us remember as the time when socialism collapsed in Eastern Europe and Russia. Events of that time flew in the face of all predictions on the Right that these were permanent regimes that would never change unless they were bombed back to the Stone Age. On the Left, it was widely believed, even in those times, that these societies were actually doing quite well and would eventually pass the United States and Western Europe in prosperity, and, by some measures, that they were already better off than us.    And yet it collapsed. Even the Berlin Wall, that symbol of oppression and slavery, was torn down by the people themselves. It was not only glorious to see socialism collapse. It was thrilling, from a libertarian point of view, to see how states themselves can dissolve. They may have all the guns and all the power, and the people have none of those, and yet, when the people themselves decide that they will no longer be governed, the state has few options left. It eventually collapses amid a society-wide refusal to believe its lies any longer.    When these closed societies suddenly became open, what did we see? We saw lands that time forgot. The technology was backwards and broken. The food was scarce and disgusting. The medical care was abysmal. The people were unhealthy. Property was polluted.    It was also striking to see what had happened to the culture under socialism. Many generations had been raised under a system built on power and lies, and so the cultural infrastructure that we take for granted was not secure. Such notions as trust, promise, truth, honesty, and planning for the future — all pillars of commercial culture — had become distorted and confused by the ubiquity and persistence of the statist curse.    <br />

B) – Turns their moral obligation – only capitalism sustains freedom and value to life<br />
Douglas, Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ UC San Diego, ‘91<br />
[“The Myth of the Welfare State”, p. 42-43, Google Books <em> Reuben]<br />
The modernist welfare state is ultimately, if unknowingly, built on the logic of totalitarian collectivism: when the goal of the state becomes that of pursuing the common welfare, without basic constraints of custom, moral principle, or constitutional law, then the welfare of any individual or subgroup rapidly approaches zero. Thus, we eventually arrive at the logical conclusion of the egalitarian welfare state, the conclusion Rousseau and socialist revolutionaries in Europe reached two centuries ago: the equal welfare of all demands that the individual welfares of everyone be totally sacrificed to the state that is rhetorically committed to the common welfare. And so the Juggernaut of the modernist welfare state trundles onward, slowly but relentlessly crushing beneath its bureaucratic powers our ancient freedoms one after another--to serve the common welfare of all, of course. Today the businesspeople, the gas producers, and the steel makers; tomorrow the doctors; then the parents; and someday the entire world.  The opposite of the logic of totalitarian collectivism is the logic of individual freedom within the System of Natural Liberty. The logic of collectivism computes the individual welfare, if at all, in terms of the collective welfare, that is, in terms of aggregates like gross national product, income distribution, relative poverty, and, above all distributive justice--equality. The logic of individualist freedom does the opposite, that is, it computes the general welfare in terms of all the individuals' welfare as defined and experienced by the individuals. Certainly the individuals define their welfare in good part in terms derived from their family and community ties, in communion with their own consciences and with the embodiments of their consciences in the constitution; for we human beings are profoundly loving beings who identify with our ancestors, our communities, and our posterity. But it is we alone, acting as individuals, who can know in our hearts what is right and good for us and our loved ones. It is we alone who can most truthfully define our own welfare.  The American Constitution was built upon the logic of individual freedom. The American government was founded to promote the general welfare, but to the eighteenth-century classic liberals that meant the exact opposite of what the common welfare means to the American statists today. Because they assumed that welfare could only be defined individually, most Americans intended the government to promote the general welfare by remaining as small and weak as it could while serving the two obviously, specific, and explicitly bounded forms of general welfare: that of defense against foreign powers that wanted to impose absolutist tyranny on Americans and that against the domestic oppression of crime and rebellion. Thus it was that they discovered that revolutionary idea of individual freedom: minimizing the power of government will optimize the welfare of all. Liberty was both the greatest blessing in itself and the fount from which would spring all others by enabling individuals to use all their potentially vast spiritual energy and creativity. Thus it was that when Tocqueville visited America in the early 1830s, he found a remarkable &quot;absence&quot; of government and an equally remarkable high level of general welfare--a land of freedom and, thus, of peace and plenty.<br />

2. Turn – the Commons would be controlled by the government – this snowballs into totalitarianism <br />
Douglas, Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ UC San Diego, ‘91<br />
[“The Myth of the Welfare State”, p. 40, Google Books </em> Lack]<br />
The logic of totalitarian collectivism is simple, brutal, and entirely consistent. Once a people has decided--whether actively or, more commonly, by default, by not actively stopping them--to allow politicians to decide by legislation, and without severe constraints of custom, moral principle and constitutional law, what is right and wrong in such basic realms of life as economic property rights, then there is no longer any logical constraint upon their exercise of power in all other realms of life. As classical liberals saw, even in the vastly more simple and self-contained society of the eighteenth century, without inviolate property rights no other rights can long be sustained. The government that controls our property rights must ultimately control our right to the pursuit of happiness, our right to free speech and to the publication of that speech, our right to take a spouse or have children, our right to work and choose an occupation, our right to life itself--for all things of life are ultimately dependent upon material goods and, thus, upon the controls of those goods we call property rights.  The government that has the right to legislate gas prices in Texas, or income redistribution nationwide, has every logical right to dictate research standards in physics, hiring standards in sociology, wage rates for black teenagers in New York, parental care standards for all parents, the right to bear children, the right to redefine life, and--the right to everything. When the American people, tempted by the ancient enabling myth of the welfare state, used the power of their votes to give the politicians and, by inaction, the courts the power to legislate away and rule away our ancient economic rights--our freedoms from unconstrained government control of our property for the common welfare--they unknowingly gave them power to legislate away and rule away all our ancient rights. Almost a hundred years ago, Theodore Roosevelt, one of the first heroes of the rationalistic state planning of American progressivism proclaimed, &quot;Every man holds his property subject to the general right of the community to regulate its use to whatever degree the public welfare may require it.&quot; The insidious implications of that &quot;to whatever degree&quot; for the counterrevolution against the System of Natural Liberty became clear only slowly, but for almost a century now the American state has been pursuing that relentless logic of totalitarian collectivism at an accelerating rate.<br />

3. Capitalism key to ethics – gives individuals freedom to determine their own morality <br />
Romar, Lecturer in Management, ‘09<br />
[Journal of Business Ethics, “Noble Markets: The Noble/Slave Ethic in Hayek’s Free Market Capitalism”, p. 57-66, Google Scholar // Lack]<br />
Like Nietzsche, Hayek, though acutely aware of  the importance of ethics in a world based upon  maximum freedom, did not develop a complete  ethical theory to support the functioning of free  market capitalism. Like Nietzsche, Hayek does not  claim to know the meaning of morality or, in  Nietzsche’s case, good and evil.3 Beyond support for  the principles needed to anchor the functioning of  free markets and the institutions needed to support  them, Hayek left it to individual actors to develop  their own moral principles, so long as these did not  contradict those needed to support free markets. It  was not his intention to prescribe a detailed ethical  system to support free market capitalism because to  do so would violate his principle of freedom and  curtail the creativity of markets. Yet, the world described  by Hayek is one where individuals have  substantial power to control their destiny and seek  their own level, a world where talent and risk  dominate, a world governed by self interest, a world  where individuals have few responsibilities to others,  and a world driven by competition where reward  goes to the successful. He described a world open to  Nietzschean ethics.  In The Road to Serfdom (1994) and The Fatal  Conceit (1988) Hayek presents a powerful and eloquent  attack on twentieth century totalitarianism. In  The Road to Serfdom he argues that the socialist  experiment must inevitably lead to totalitarianism  and the complete elimination of individual liberty  and freedom. In the name of principles of social  justice, society installs a system of centralized social  and economic planning, substitutes collective decisions  for individual ones, and requires each person to  adopt an identical and complete set of social values.  Furthermore, to achieve its objectives, the socialist  state must determine in great detail the allocation of  resources and insure that each individual performs precisely his/her assigned role. Planned economies  must substitute collectivist thought, values and  behavior and eliminate any room for individualism.  Hayek labels this weltanschauung the ‘‘fatal conceit.’’  It is fatal because it cannot achieve its objectives  and it is conceit because it overestimates the  role of human rationality and man’s ability to control  social and economic processes. He sees constructivist  continental European philosophic thought, primarily  Cartesian rationalism, as the source of this error  (Hayek, 1948, pp. 9–10; 1973, pp. 9–12). This  philosophic tradition argues that man can understand  the world completely and, therefore, social and  economic processes can be understood completely  and molded to fit human will.  Hayek considers this a foolish, self-serving and  arrogant position.4 Certainly, humans have a powerful  intellect and reasoning skills. Human reason,  though powerful, has its limitations and cannot  completely understand with any certainty how human  institutions and social processes evolved and  how they operate. He views the evolution and  development of human institutions, be they money,  markets, or ethics as spontaneous, self-generating  orders. Systems, if you will, evolving gradually,  accidentally, on the basis of incremental change; not  as a result of human design. He labels this ‘‘between  instinct and reason.’’ Humans can understand to  some extent how human society evolved from clan  based societies into modern, complex ones based  upon individualism and abstract rules, but we cannot  know the processes or mechanisms of this evolution  in sufficient detail to bend them to our will. We can  tweak the social and moral systems but cannot  engineer them. Man can modify social processes and  their underlying ethical foundations; but, in the final  analysis, we must accept them as is.5  Since social process and institutions obey their  own set of evolutionary principles which man cannot  know completely, it is best for these to evolve  on their own, without much human interference. In  The Constitution of Liberty (1960) and Law, Legislation  and Liberty (3 vols., 1973, 1976, 1979) Hayek  develops his ideas about the proper principles of  economic and political organizations and their  underlying ethical foundations. The fundamental principle of social organization must be based upon  the principle of liberty, which may be defined as  ‘‘that condition of men in which coercion of some  by others is reduced as much as possible in society’’6  (Hayek, 1960, p. 11). Hayek’s conception of the  free, just and moral society is not one where there is  a complete absence of coercion but where coercion  is limited to those situations where it is required to  prevent a reduction in the liberty of others. Society  may use coercion to protect private property and to  secure individual rights and conditions which allow  each person the maximum amount of personal  freedom to make choices of their own. This is  accomplished through a limited set of abstract rules  ‘‘that apply equally to all’’ which protect private or  several property, enforce contracts, and prevent  fraud and deception’’ (Hayek, 1960, pp. 140, 141,  143, 155).  While Hayek is concerned with just and moral  principles of economic, political and social organization,  he views attempts to achieve ‘‘distributive  justice’’ as the root cause of the immorality brought  about by planned economies. In order to achieve the  desired goals, human behavior must be planned in  minute detail, thereby eliminating freedom of  choice. Achieving collectivist goals mean that there  can be no individual ones. Organizing to control  every outcome means there cannot be individual  choice. Social control means there will be little  individual control and it is all doomed because humans  cannot understand completely the mechanisms  needed to reach their objectives. The only solution  must be the free market and the minimal organizational  principles required for it to operate efficiently.  Since these are few and well known, it will be easier to succeed and create a just and moral society. Allow  the market free reign and the just and moral society  will follow according to its own principles.<br />

B. The Limits of Equitable Distribution Despite the purported benefits of equitable distribution, a second strand of critical jurisprudence posits the futility of such efforts. In the postmodern tradition, this approach dismisses equitable distribution, arguing that it is only a temporary solution to the fundamental problems facing the international system. Indeed, these &quot;crits&quot; would argue that equitable distribution itself perpetuates other forms of inequality and is, therefore, illegitimate. First, equitable distribution is premised upon the equality of states - a noble premise, but one that is wholly unrelated to reality. Like snowflakes, no two states are entirely alike. Even within classification schemes, states vary along a multitude of factors, including historical, political, demographic, economic, social, cultural, and linguistic features. Equitable distribution overlooks such variation in its efforts to promote the equality of states within international organizations. In doing so, equitable distribution may [*367] promote other forms of inequality. For example, equitable distribution policies do not take demographic factors into account. n297 Should India and Luxembourg have the same voting power in international organizations? n298 The problem of demographic disparity has worsened in recent years as new states, particularly small states, have entered the international community. n299 As noted by Professor Franck, &quot;this problem of unfair equality has become much more pressing as a new wave tribal nationalism ... swells the rank of mini-states, all of them claiming equal voice.&quot; n300 Second, equitable distribution assumes that states within any of the enumerated classification schemes share the same interests, concerns, and preferences - a dubious proposition at best. n301 Indeed, equitable distribution assumes state classification is a simple and uncontroversial process. In fact, distribution based upon geographic classification schemes may be difficult to support in every case. n302 Not all countries located within a particular geographic area are alike. n303 Among African states, for example, do Egypt, Nigeria, [*368] Rwanda, South Africa, and Sudan share similar interests and concerns? The same questions may be posed of states within Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. n304 Efforts to classify states based upon forms of civilization are also fraught with difficulty. Some states are not neatly categorized into any particular civilization. Indeed, there is significant controversy over the concept of civilization. n305 Even efforts to classify states based upon their respective legal systems must be undertaken with caution. n306 Many countries contain multiple legal systems within their borders which makes classification difficult. n307 In addition, the differences between legal systems are gradually diminishing, making such distinctions less relevant. n308 If the proxy theory is inaccurate, it severely undermines a key premise of equitable distribution. Third, there are no clear guidelines for establishing or prioritizing classification schemes. The traditional classification schemes have differentiated between geographic regions, legal systems, and forms of civilization. Is this list exclusive? Should demographic or economic factors be considered? Is this list outdated? Are geographic factors less relevant today? In addition, should particular classification schema be given priority? For example, should preference be given to equitable distribution based upon geographic region, legal system, or form of civilization? Fourth, equitable distribution policies do not always succeed in their efforts to promote equitable representation in international organizations. In this respect, it is important to recognize that equitable distribution policies do not guarantee equitable distribution. As currently drafted, most equitable distribution policies only [*369] encourage states to consider equitable distribution principles in determining membership for non-plenary treaty organs and the selection of staff for international organizations. There is no mechanism to ensure that equitable distribution is manifest in the final membership composition. For example, the Statute of the International Court of Justice does not require that the Court contain an equitable distribution of judges based upon civilization and legal system. Rather, Article 9 merely requests electors to &quot;bear in mind&quot; that the &quot;representation of the main forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems of the world should be assured.&quot; No formal sanction or remediation mechanism is available if equitable distribution is not accomplished. Because the principle of equitable distribution remains ambiguous and undefined, it can easily be co-opted by states to ensure that dominant powers are guaranteed a position in non-plenary treaty organs. For example, the practice of the United Nations has been to ensure that each permanent member of the Security Council is represented on the International Court of Justice. Thus, equitable distribution policies are subject to the vagaries of political and diplomatic intervention. Even if international organizations manifest equitable distribution in their composition, research data suggests that the underlying reasons for these policies may not be evident in the output of some organizations. In other words, the preferences of states that are not represented in non-plenary treaty organs may not always be expressed by proxy states. For example, studies of voting patterns in the International Court of Justice do not reveal significant correlation of voting patterns along regional or political lines. n309 Even voting patterns within the General Assembly do not always coincide along regional or political groupings. n310 Fifth, equitable distribution may promote the selection of less qualified candidates. n311 Thus, equitable distribution policies have been criticized because it &quot;means to some extent weaker candidates must be preferred to stronger on the ground of the civilization or the [*370] legal system which they represent.&quot; n312 For example, critics have argued that the priority given to equitable geographical distribution in the U.N. Secretariat &quot;has been responsible for a lowering of the quality of the staff.&quot; n313 Sixth, equitable distribution policies perpetuate other forms of inequality. Because they only recognize state representation, equitable distribution policies only promote the interests of those groups that dominate intra-state politics. There is no mechanism for representing the interests of minorities, including racial or religious groups. n314 While representation may be viewed as equitable at the inter-state level, it often remains inequitable at the intra-state level. In addition, equitable distribution policies disregard the plight of people with &quot;multiple subordinated identities.&quot; n315 Many groups, differentiated by such factors as race, religion, or gender, face several layers of subordination and marginalization in their own countries. n316 Women of color are a prominent example of people with multiple subordinated identities. Discrimination, both overt and implicit, has prevented women of color from attaining positions of power within their own countries. As a result, these women are often underrepresented within the power structures of their countries. n317 [*371] Because of their marginalization at the domestic level, the ability of these women to participate at the international level is severely diminished. n318 If these women are from countries that are themselves on the margins of international discourse, their plight becomes even more pronounced. n319 Thus, women do not benefit from efforts to promote equitable distribution at the international level. Racial and ethnic minorities face similar obstacles. n320 It is not surprising, therefore, that few women are members of the various international tribunals. n321 In the entire history of the International Court of Justice, there has only been one female judge on the Court. n322 Gender composition in other international tribunals is equally unbalanced. The European Court of Justice, one of the most successful international tribunals in history, did not have a woman on the Court until October 1999. n323 The European Court of [*372] Human Rights has only a slightly better record. n324 While the United Nations has sought to promote the development of women's rights within states, it has generally been less successful at the higher levels of power within the international level. n325 Finally, equitable distribution policies assume the state is the most appropriate governance structure to regulate human behavior. These policies do not change or challenge the fundamental structure of the international system; they merely work within the system. There is no effort (or apparent interest) in promoting structural change. Thus, the status quo remains protected against efforts to change the structure of the international system or the primacy of the state. Such policies overlook structural flaws of state governance. Do states adequately protect the interests of all individuals within their control? n326 Are there alternative governance structures capable of addressing the problems of humanity more effectively than the current regime? n327<br />

Common Heritage fails and is misinterpreted – massive resource disparities still exist<br />
Mickelson Associate Professor, University of British Columbia 2003<br />
Karin, Humanizing our Global Order, “Co-opting Common Heritage”, pg. 119-120<br />
Criticisms of how common heritage has been deployed in the scholarly literature might appear to be an exercise in finger-pointing were it not for the fact that the treatment of common heritage is symptomatic of a perspective that seems widespread. One has become accustomed to reading dismissals of the new international economic order, of the heady optimism of the 1960s and 1970s. What is unusual about common heritage is that instead of merely relegating a Third World doctrine to the dustbin of history, attempts have been made to retool it into a concept that is applicable to a different context. It may seem uncharitable to take issue with such attempts, especially when they are the work of young scholars whose enthusiasm, at least, cannot be faulted. However, I cannot help feeling that these attempts represent a fundamentally problematic approach to international legal scholarship. These writers are able to justify their approach through an elaborate array of reasons and authorities, underlying which is an attitude that verges on contempt for the original rationale of the concept, as well as for its proponent’s. Even if one were to accept the view that the `Third World' no longer exists (as I do not). vast disparities of wealth and access to resources are still with us, and these disparities have in fact been increasing over the past decades. This is either missing from the analysis or is mentioned only in passing. Where, then, does this leave common heritage? My own preference would be to allow the principle to rest in peace rather than have it exist as a simulacrum that not only fails to reflect the content of the original but in fact is almost wholly inconsistent with it. I would argue that politically and legally, such a decision has already been made. Common heritage has not been incorporated into multilateral environmental agreements; in its place, notions such as the ‘common concern of humankind' have emerged. which have the benefit of being unaccompanied by the baggage of 'political connotations.’ Yet this does not eliminate the underlying dilemma. Common concern, too, along with other principles of international law, must be interpreted and applied in ways that are sensitive and responsive to the needs of the South. And such sensitivity and responsiveness are sorely lacking in the types of analyses I have been considering here. <br />

Troposphere - lowest layer of the atmosphere where weather occurs. Temperature falls 3.5°F per 1000 feet. Top lies at about 6-7 miles. Temperature varies from an average of 60° at the surface to -60° at the top of the troposphere. Tropopause - top of the troposhere. Stratosphere - top of the tropopause to about 30 miles. Temperature is constant to about 20 miles then increases to the stratopause. At the stratopause the temperature is about 40°F. The temperature rise is due to the presence of an ozone layer. The ozone absorbs incoming UV radiation increasing the heat content of the gas. At about 18 miles the ozone reaches its maximum concentration, about 5ppm. Without the ozone layer the Earth's surface would be warmer and the UV level much higher. Mesosphere - extends from 30 miles to about 50 miles. Temperature falls to -120°F at the mesopause. Thermosphere - extends above the mesosphere more than 100 miles. Zone of increasing temperature, but this is meaningless since there is in effect no atmosphere present. <br />

Support is growing for a specific kind of multilateral space agreement that borrows heavily from the Bush administration’s own preferences. The mechanism in question is a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations that could either take the form of political compacts or executive agreements among like-minded states that wish to continue to enjoy the national security and economic benefits that satellites provide. Like the Bush administration’s Proliferation Security Initiative, a Code of Conduct for space could be designed by a core group of states to clarify responsible and irresponsible behavior. The core group might then invite any other spacefaring nation that wishes to abide by these high standards to join the group.  The European Union has now joined Canada in endorsing a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations. The commercial satellite industry also has expressed a strong interest in “rules of the road” for space. The Bush administration has further distanced itself from America’s friends and allies by continuing to insist that new multilateral agreements related to space are “unnecessary and counterproductive.” No other nation in the world has adopted such a negative stance. Saying “hell no” to new multilateral agreements for space seems particularly questionable after China’s irresponsible test of an anti-satellite (A-Sat) weapon that endangers spaceflight in low Earth orbit for decades to come. George Washington’s farewell address warned against indulging in “habitual hatred” resulting in a slavish animosity that leads the United States to “stray from its duty and interest.” Rejecting a Code of Conduct for space because it smacks of arms control would seem to violate Washington’s sound admonition. The Bush administration has not yet taken a position towards a Code of Conduct for responsible spacefaring nations. Because rules of the road for space make so much sense, and because the Bush administration has championed other codes of conduct to prevent proliferation, it might still join in the emerging consensus on this issue. The administration’s reasoning against new multilateral agreements for space boils down to five arguments, none of which applies to the Code of Conduct.  First, administration officials argue that there is no likelihood of an arms race in space, therefore, there is no need for new multilateral arrangements. It is true that an arms race is unlikely, since arms racing has now been replaced by asymmetric warfare. But an arms race is not needed to do lasting damage to space, as the Chinese A-Sat test demonstrated. We can now see clearly that it takes very few kinetic energy kill tests and A-Sat weapons to result in significant damage to low Earth orbit. New diplomatic initiatives are needed precisely because an arms race isn’t needed to prevent the peaceful uses of outer space. The second argument advanced by the Bush administration is that arms control is a vestige of the Cold War and not terribly relevant to contemporary security concerns. Again, there is partial truth in this argument, because classic arms control arrangements dealt with a superpower competition that ended with the demise of the Soviet Union.  What used to be known as arms control has now morphed into cooperative threat reduction agreements, including rules of the road clarifying responsible behavior. Semantic arguments aside, the administration has itself championed multilateral agreements in the form of codes of conduct to prevent proliferation, such as The Hague Code of Conduct, as well as the Proliferation Security Initiative. We do not have to argue over whether these codes of conduct constitute arms control to conclude that these creative arrangements were sensible initiatives.  A Code of Conduct for space also would be quite useful in making the Chinese kinetic-kill ASAT test the very last of its kind. If codes of conduct relating to missiles and exports make sense for preventing proliferation – and do not, in the Bush administration’s vocabulary, constitute arms control – then surely a code of conduct also makes sense for activities in space. After all, troubling activities in space also could prompt vertical and horizontal proliferation on the ground.  The third argument that the Bush administration advances against new diplomatic initiatives for space activity is that there can be no agreed to definition of what constitutes “space weapons.” Moreover, verification is extremely problematic. Consequently, no multilateral agreement can be negotiated barring such weapons.  The administration is correct in pointing to the difficulties in defining and verifying space weapons. A code of conduct, however, focuses on activities, not on definitions of what constitutes a space weapon. For example, one key element of a Code of Conduct would surely be that responsible spacefaring nations do not engage in activities that deliberately produce persistent space debris, such as the Chinese A-Sat test.  This key element makes it unnecessary to define space weapons, since actions, not definitions, lie at the core of a rules of the road approach. Verification of noncompliance with this key element is quite straightforward, since it is very hard to hide the deliberate generation of persistent space debris.  The fourth argument advanced by the Bush administration to oppose new diplomatic initiatives for space is that the United States must preserve its right to self-defense – including the right to defend space assets. This argument is certainly valid, but it doesn’t justify rejecting a Code of Conduct. With such a code, the United States still would possess more capabilities than ever before to deter and, if necessary, punish states that take actions against U.S. satellites. The right of self-defense, however, is more likely to be invoked, and will be more difficult to execute, if there are no agreed rules of the road for outer space.  Lastly, the Bush administration contends that new diplomatic initiatives are unwise because U.S. freedom of action in space must not be constrained. By this standard, the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Outer Space Treaty, President Ronald Reagan’s Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and President George H. W. Bush’s Strategic Arms Reduction treaties were all dreadful errors in judgment, since every one of these agreements limit the U.S. military’s freedom of action in some key respects. Using the Bush administration’s reasoning, the Geneva Conventions for U.S. armed forces also are unwise, as are codes of conduct long in place for the U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and gravity-bound Air Force. If freedom of action were the topmost U.S. national security objective, we would ditch all of these treaties and codes of conduct. Of course, no responsible political leader or public official would consider doing this. So why should we use this standard to oppose new diplomatic initiatives in space?<br />

Code of Conduct solves debris – clarifying mitigation standards<br />

Reportedly, the Obama Administration is nearing or has reached a decision to agree to the European Union's Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities. The EU proposal is a series of statements designed to establish a normative framework defining responsible behavior in outer space. It includes calls for states to take actions to minimize the prospect of collisions on orbit, to avoid purposefully creating space debris, and to agree to registration requirements for space launches and satellite maneuvers. Questions persist about the need for such a document. For example, as we noted in 2007, many of these issues already are being addressed through multilateral and bilateral processes as space-faring nations have found a need for them. How the Code's requirements will constrain U.S. security also is frequently cited as a reason to critically and thoroughly examine the utility of the Code of Conduct and similar proposals. And the lack of enforcement and verification provisions have led many to conclude that the Code inevitably will give way to more robust forms of arms control. Still, the Code has useful attributes, too. The Code (or the discussions that take place about a Code) could help further clarify debris mitigation standards and mature manuever and traffic management standards by providing top-level diplomatic cover for the ongoing dialogues. <br />

<br />
It looks like the efforts to reform U.S. funding of the United Nations are turning into a significant showdown between two of the most powerful women in Washington — President Obama's state secretary, Hillary Clinton, and the chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. This came into focus during a hearing Thursday at which the Foreign Affairs Committee approved — by a wide margin and over Mrs. Clinton’s objections — a bill that would give America much more say over what, if any, United Nations programs it underwrites. The bill, which is being pressed by Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen, has emerged as the most serious and radical reform effort directed at the U.N. since the institution was incorporated in the late 1940s. Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen began the hearings with an opening statement in which she spoke of the U.N.s bid, in the middle of a fiscal crisis in Washington, for a bigger budget. She quoted the Obama administration’s own envoy to the U.N. budget process as saying, that the budget presented by the U.N. “does not represent a break from ‘business as usual,’ but rather a continuation of it.” “What are we paying for?” Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen demanded. Then she ticked off the scandals: “A UN Human Rights Council that includes such gross human rights violators as China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and its vice-chair, Cuba. Two years after the Administration joined the Council, the Council still has undergone zero fundamental reforms, continues to pass resolution after resolution condemning Israel, and its permanent agenda item on Israel remains in place. We’re paying for the Durban process, which has been hijacked to spread anti-Israel and anti-Semitic venom.” Continued she: “Then there’s the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, recently chaired by North Korea. So serial proliferator North Korea presided over the UN’s disarmament body, and Iran, a regime which stones women to death, is a member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. We’re paying for a U.N. that just appointed as the head of its Kosovo mission an individual involved with the infamous Oil-for-Food scandal, and a U.N. that goes after whistleblowers while protecting the corrupt.” Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen disclosed that Secretary of State Clinton sent a letter at the outset of the hearings Thursday coming out directly in opposition to the bill. “The Secretary claims, if we move to a system of voluntary funding, it will hurt our soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, because other member states won’t do the ‘burden-sharing’ to pay for UN missions in those countries,” Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen said. “Does the Administration have such little faith in our allies and in our diplomacy — which they pride themselves on — to think that they would not share the burden of fighting Islamist extremists unless the UN forced them to? And given that the U.S. paid billions and billions of dollars to the UN last year, I think it’s clear who is actually carrying the burden without any say: the U.S. taxpayer.” The ranking member on the Democratic side of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Howard Berman, offered a substitute bill designed to gut Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen’s reform. Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen argued that, among other flaws, Mr. Berman’s measure would mean “ no consequences if any UN body upgrades the Palestinian status.” In the event, the committee turned aside Mr. Berman’s substitute measure and Mrs. Clinton’s objections and passed the United Nations Transparency, Accountability, and Reform Act by a comfortable margin. In the full House, the bill has something like 125 sponsors. They are, at least at the moment, all Republicans, according to a dispatch of CNS News. Even if the measure clears the House, it will still have a hard time in the Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats. Mrs. Clinton’s letter to the committee warned that if, by some miracle, the measure does pass, she’ll urge President Obama to veto it. This strikes us as an opportunity for the Republicans to bring the issue of the United Nations into the presidential campaign now under way and so that the American people can let the dictators, kleptocrats, and anti-Semites in the United Nations know where America stands.<br />

Congressional Anticipation. The last alternative explanation proposes that Congress drafts favorable legislation in response to the president’s increase in political capital. In contrast to the investment explanation, where the president uses veto threats differently depending on his capital and the legislation stays constant, this theory suggests that Congress changes its actions. The president’s use of the veto is constant, but Congress changes its legislation depending on the president’s approval rating. In recent years, the majority leadership in the House has aggressively used its power to control the agenda. If a measure seems likely to divide the majority party or face a presidential veto, then it will probably not reach a House floor vote in the first place (Simendinger 2003). When the president’s approval ratings increase, the Congress anticipates a stronger veto threat. This anticipation creates favorable legislation rather than unfavorable legislation that will trigger a veto. Therefore, when the president’s political capital is at its highest, the presidential veto will be least likely. In the current 109th Congress, however, there were signs of strain between the White House and the House Republican Leadership, possibly caused by the president’s decrease in political capital (“Bush Vows Stem Cell Veto” 2005).<br />

&quot;The buildup of debris is not a naturally reversible process. If we are to clean up space, it will certainly be complex and very expensive. If we continue, as we have, to use these very popular orbits in near-Earth space, the density of debris and collision events will surely increase,&quot; Kaplan told SPACE.com. The good news is that no immediate action is necessary in terms of removing debris objects, Kaplan advised, as experts estimate that the situation will not go unstable anytime soon. &quot;But, when it does, operational satellites will be destroyed at an alarming rate, and they cannot be replaced. We must prepare for this seemingly inevitable event,&quot; Kaplan said. While there are many options for debris removal that have been proposed, he feels that none are sensible. &quot;Barring the discovery of a disruptive technology within the next decade or so, there will be no practical removal solution,&quot; Kaplan added. &quot;We simply lack the technology to economically clean up space.&quot; [Lasers Could Zap Space Junk Clear From Satellites] For Kaplan, the issue of dealing with orbital debris will become dire. &quot;The proliferation is irreversible. Any cleanup would be too expensive. Given this insight, it is unlikely spacefaring nations are going to do anything significant about cleaning up space,&quot; Kaplan said. &quot;The fact is that we really can't do anything. We can't afford it. We don't have the technology. We don't have the cooperation. Nobody wants to pay for it. Space debris cleanup is a 'growth industry,' but there are no customers. In addition, it is politically untenable.&quot;<br />

<br />
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday warned House Republicans about pushing ahead with a bill to cut funds for the United Nations, saying she would recommend that President Barack Obama veto the legislation. In a letter to lawmakers, Clinton said the bill would severely limit U.S. participation in the world body, undercut U.S. interests and damage the security of Americans at home and abroad. The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans to consider the legislation on Clinton said international cooperation is critical to push American interests such as &quot;staunching nuclear proliferation, combatting terrorism, fully implementing sanctions on countries such as Iran and North Korea, preventing conflict around the globe, and supporting elections in countries just undergoing transition to democracy.&quot; She also said the legislation undermines the ability of the United State to share costs with other countries. &quot;This bill would effectively cede American leadership, creating a void for our adversaries to fill,&quot; Clinton wrote. The legislation, which has more than 50 Republican co-sponsors, would pressure the U.N. to adopt a voluntary funding system by withholding 50 percent of the U.S. non-voluntary regular budget contributions if, after two years, 80 percent of the U.N. regular budget is not funded on a voluntary rather than assessed basis. In the 2010 budget year, the U.S. provided $7.7 billion to the U.N. for its regular budget, peacekeeping and other programs, up from $6.1 billion the previous year. The bill also would block U.S. funds for any United Nations entity that supports giving Palestine an elevated status at the U.N. and ban U.S. contributions to the U.N. Human Rights Council and an anti-racism conference seen as a platform for anti-Israel rhetoric. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., chairwoman of the committee, is a frequent critic of the United Nations. In defending her legislation, she has said the international organization is plagued by scandal, mismanagement and inaction, and is biased against the United States and Israel. Clinton acknowledged problems with the U.N. but said that &quot;for all its imperfections, (it) is indispensable to advancing&quot; U.S. goals. Although Clinton raised the specter of a presidential veto, the legislation has little chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate.<br />

With just one laser facility, Mason's group says, the number of debris collisions could be almost halved. What's more, by mitigating the number of collisions, the amount of debris would lessen as it slowly burns up in Earth's atmosphere. And that would avoid the onset of Kessler syndrome, the researchers say. All the experts in space debris contacted by Nature said that the new proposal is feasible, but still has problems. &quot;It'll be ineffective against dense objects that are too heavy to move,&quot; says William Priedhorsky of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. &quot;To use a medical analogy, they propose not to cure the disease, but to manage it.&quot; And some are concerned that the laser could still be used to push enemy satellites out of orbit. Christophe Bonnal, a debris expert at the French space agency CNES, doesn't buy the researchers' claim that the laser's power would be too low for anti-satellite uses. &quot;Let's be logical,&quot; he says. &quot;If the power is low, you'll have no effect on the debris.&quot;<br />

Possible “offensive counterspace forces” the U.S. Air Force might use are identified as: aircraft, missiles (including for anti-satellite attack), special operations forces, dedicated offensive counterspace systems (such as the Counter Satellite Communications System), and anti-satellite weapons (defined as including “direct ascent and co-orbital systems that employ various mechanisms to affect or destroy an on-orbit spacecraft”), directed energy weapons (including destructive lasers), network warfare operations, electronic warfare weapons, C4ISR systems, and surface forces. Thus, the “Counterspace Operations” document makes it crystal clear that the U.S. Air Force now considers all satellites being used by adversaries as targets, including those commercially owned or owned by a neutral, third-party (possibly even allied) government. It also makes it clear that the U.S. Air Force sees any form of weapon -- whether terrestrially or space based, whether simply temporarily disrupting or whether destructive and debris-generating – as legitimate for attacking those targets. Finally, it raises the specter of U.S. preemptive attack against satellites.<br />

Many people believe that a deployed anti-satellite capability and an ability to attack targets on or near the Earth’s surface from space would create a global climate of insecurity both by enhancing current risks and by creating new problems. These new and increased risks would be the byproducts not only of systems to be deployed by the United States but also of the subsequent arms race in space which could be expected to result thanks to responses by China, Russia, the European Union, and perhaps Japan. Perhaps the most consequential impact would be increasing the probability of accidental nuclear war. Space-based weapons could shorten the road to armed conflict, whether nuclear or conventional. In the event that a space asset of one nation was attacked by another (on purpose or by accident), an immediate military response would be triggered, shortening the diplomatic process while escalating the armed conflict. Once employed regularly, anti-satellite systems and space weapons would litter LEO with debris, which in turn would permanently compromise our collective ability to explore the heavens and use space for constructive commercial purposes. The weaponization of space and the deployment of ASAT systems would undermine existing international arms control treaties that are already under stress. In addition, they would fly in the face of the collective will of the international community, which has demanded a ban on weapons in space for two decades and repeatedly been blocked by the United States. For those who share these concerns, one thing is certain: the time for international negotiations on a treaty to ban weapons in space is long overdue. Within a very few years, this potential development could become a reality.<br />

Offensive counterspace capabilities could permanently damage or destroy costly satellites and leave substantial harmful debris in space if they physically destroy the satellites. Space debris can collide with and destroy satellites and is an important element in thinking about space weapons. Like radioactive fallout from nuclear war, debris from space war can linger for many years. While the word “debris” sounds harmless based on common usage, most orbital debris moves at a speed of more than seventeen thousand miles per hour. Thus, relatively small debris pieces are highly destructive to a satellite in a collision. One only has to imagine what life would be like if thousands of bullets from World War II were still whizzing around to get some feel for the danger that debris growth poses for the future of space. At present, twelve thousand detectable debris pieces that are ten centimeters or larger orbit the earth, as well as millions of 6 China, Space Weapons, and U.S. Security smaller pieces. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) estimates China’s 2007 ASAT test alone increased orbital debris by 10 percent, and its fallout will take more than one hundred years to reenter the atmosphere. The implications of these new counterspace developments for peacetime and crisis stability, as well as the conduct of warfare, are profound. The sudden major loss of satellite function would quickly throw U.S. military capabilities back twenty years or more and substantially damage the U.S. and world economies. While backup systems could partially compensate for this loss, U.S. military forces would be significantly weakened. <br />

The concern over orbital debris has been building for several reasons, said Marshall Kaplan, an orbital debris expert within the Space Department at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. In Kaplan's view, spacefaring nations have passed the point of &quot;no return,&quot; with the accumulation of debris objects in low-Earth orbits steadily building over the past 50 years. Add to the clutter, the leftovers of China’s anti-satellite (ASAT) test in 2007. &quot;The fact that this single event increased the number of debris objects by roughly 25 percent was not as important as the location of the intercept. The event took place at an altitude of 865 kilometers, right in the middle of the most congested region of low-orbiting satellites,&quot; Kaplan pointed out. Toss into the brew the collision of an Iridium satellite with an expired Russian Cosmos spacecraft in February 2009 -- at an altitude similar to that of China’s ASAT test. As a result of 50 years of launching satellites and these two events, the altitude band from about 435 miles (700 km) to a little over 800 miles (1,300 km) has accumulated possibly millions of debris objects ranging from a few millimeters to a few meters, Kaplan said.<br />

Congress and the Administration to address these fiscal challenges. Is this the biggest financial crisis since 1987? Since the 1970s? Since the Second World War? Since the Great Depression? Since the word 'finance' was coined? Who knows - my economist can beat up your economist Like those American political commentators who try to predict the results of elections with absurd comparisons - 'A two-term Senator from Texas who hasn't ever been a three- term Governor has never taken the White House in a year divisible by 32' - history too often distorts our understanding of contemporary events more than it enlightens. What historical comparisons do show, however, is that the last three hundred years of liberal capitalism have been a never-ending series of crises and crashes. The economic history of the United States reads like a slapstick cartoon: there was the panic of 1797, the depression of 1807, panics in 1819, 1837, 1857 and 1873, the 'Long Depression between 1873 and 1896, further panics in 1893 and 1907, a recession following the First World War, the Great Depression, recessions in 1953 and 1957, and an oil crisis in 1973. A recession has opened each decade since the 1980s.* In Australia, when the financial journalist Trevor Sykes documented the continuous corporate failures that have dominated our history, that experience led him to tide his book on the topic Two Centuries of Panic. More recendy the former Reserve Bank Chairman Ian Macfarlane has described seven financial downturns since 1980. When Walter Russell Mead delivered the 2008 CD Kemp Lecture for the Institute of Public Affairs in Melbourne in December, he made an important point: our long history of crashes, depressions, panics and recessions are an integral part of the system. When firms fail - even when entire market structures fail, as it appears they have for the more aggressive Wall Street trading firms - we discover better ways to manage risks, better ways to seek profit. Mead argued that the history of liberal capitalism is the history of markets gaining complex- ity until they were beyond our understanding, leading to a spectacular crash, followed by a recovery based on what we have learnt went wrong, and then an- other, inevitable building up of complexity. Mead pointed out that since the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s, none of these crises had fundamentally shifted the West off its path of liberal economic development.

For instance, Article VIII of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty states that nations retain jurisdiction and control over their space objects and that “ownership of objects launched into outer space…and of their component parts…is not affected by their presence in outer space or on a celestial body or by their return to Earth.” This provision becomes signiﬁcant when combined with the 1972 Liability Convention, which states that nations are internationally liable for damages caused by their space objects both in space and on Earth. Accordingly, before any debris is removed from orbit, consent from the appropriate country will need to be obtained. Using commercial companies to operate debris removal systems would not get around this problem of liability, as Article VI of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty makes countries responsible for the outer space activities of both their governmental and non-governmental entities <br />

While Russian resentment towards the West is still palpable in some circles, especially around Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the economic crisis has forced Moscow to rein in its more grandiose ambitions. Already the Kremlin has spent around $200 billion to prop up banks, bail out favored oligarchs, and slow the devaluation of the ruble. It faces a budget deficit of nearly $125 billion this year, while foreign observers estimate the country's unemployment rate to be over 8% and climbing. Worried that the crisis will feed social unrest, the Kremlin increasingly cannot afford to merely blame the US for all its problems, especially a US led by a popular new president keen to restore the mantle of legitimacy to American leadership. Moscow needs Washington now more than in recent years, but Russia remains a prickly, defensive power sensitive to perceived slights. <br />

<br />
The stability of nuclear stalemate is predicated on an assumption that no rational actor will use nuclear weapons against an adversary who has the capacity to retaliate in kind. The resulting doctrine of “mutually assured destruction” might seem like madness, but it has lowered the risks of making serious miscalculations that could unleash a nuclear holocaust. States are not deterred from using nuclear weapons because of moral or ethical concerns; decision-makers make cold, hard calculations of self interest and have concluded that they cannot achieve their goals by using nuclear arsenals.  <br />

A. Interpretation - Exploration means to expand human presence to space<br />
<br />
Logsdon, 9 – professor of political science at George Washington, former director of the Space Policy Institute (John, “Fifty Years of Human Spaceflight Why Is There Still a Controversy?,”  <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11134:http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100025875_2010028362.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11134 -->)<br />
<br />
Exploration as a Compelling Rationale Many believe that the only sustainable rationale for a government-funded program of human spaceflight is to take the lead in exploring the solar system beyond low Earth orbit.20 The MIT white paper provides an insightful definition of exploration: Exploration is a human activity, undertaken by certain cultures at certain times for particular reasons. It has components of national interest, scientific research, and technical innovation, but is defined by none of them. We define exploration as an expansion of the realm of human experience, bringing people into new places, situations, and environments, expanding and redefining what it means to be human. What is the role of Earth in human life? Is human life fundamentally tied to the earth, or could it survive without the planet? Human presence, and its attendant risk, turns a spaceflight into a story that is compelling to large numbers of people. Exploration also has a moral dimension because it is in effect a cultural conversation on the nature and meaning of human life. Exploration by this definition can only be accomplished by direct human presence and may be deemed worthy of the risk of human life.21 In the wake of the 2003 Columbia accident that took the lives of seven astronauts and the report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board that criticized the absence of a compelling mission for human spaceflight as “a failure of national leadership,”22 the United States, in January 2004, adopted a new policy to guide its human spaceflight activities. The policy directed NASA to “implement a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond” and to “extend human presence across the solar system, starting with a human return to the Moon by the year 2020, in preparation for human exploration of Mars and other destinations.”23 This policy seems totally consistent with the definition of exploration provided in the MIT white paper. The issue is whether such a policy and its implementation, focusing on human exploration beyond Earth orbit, can provide an adequate and sustainable justification for a continuing program of government-sponsored spaceflight that will make contributions that will outweigh the costs and risks involved to the “primary objectives” of national pride and prestige, and also to some of the several “secondary objectives.”<br />

The rate of asteroid discoveries shows an exponential growth. After astronomer Guiseppe Piazzi of Palermo, Sicily, discovered the ﬁrst asteroid on January 1, 1801, the number of new ﬁnds per year increased to ﬁve by 1865, 15 per year by 1895, 25 by 1910 and up to about 40 by 1930. By the end of September of 2007, the number of numbered asteroids was more than 160,000 including about 800 Potential Hazardous Asteroids (PHA). (see <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11135:http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/" rel="nofollow">http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11135 -->) According to NASA’s report (NASA 2007), the further objectives of NEO Survey Program are to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of NEO equal to or larger than 140 meters in diameter with a perihelion distance of less than 1.3 AU from the Sun, achieving 90% completion of the survey within 15 years after enactment of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005. Chinese scientists have contributed substantially to the ﬁeld of asteroid survey and related aspects. In the early 1960s, Purple Mountain Observatory began observations of asteroids and found over 130 new numbered asteroids during the following decades. The Schmidt CCD Asteroid Program (SCAP) of Beijing Astronomical Observatory started in 1995 and found 575 asteroids in several years (Ma, Zhao &amp; Yao 2007). <br />

<br />
It looks like the efforts to reform U.S. funding of the United Nations are turning into a significant showdown between two of the most powerful women in Washington — President Obama's state secretary, Hillary Clinton, and the chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. This came into focus during a hearing Thursday at which the Foreign Affairs Committee approved — by a wide margin and over Mrs. Clinton’s objections — a bill that would give America much more say over what, if any, United Nations programs it underwrites. The bill, which is being pressed by Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen, has emerged as the most serious and radical reform effort directed at the U.N. since the institution was incorporated in the late 1940s. Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen began the hearings with an opening statement in which she spoke of the U.N.s bid, in the middle of a fiscal crisis in Washington, for a bigger budget. She quoted the Obama administration’s own envoy to the U.N. budget process as saying, that the budget presented by the U.N. “does not represent a break from ‘business as usual,’ but rather a continuation of it.” “What are we paying for?” Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen demanded. Then she ticked off the scandals: “A UN Human Rights Council that includes such gross human rights violators as China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and its vice-chair, Cuba. Two years after the Administration joined the Council, the Council still has undergone zero fundamental reforms, continues to pass resolution after resolution condemning Israel, and its permanent agenda item on Israel remains in place. We’re paying for the Durban process, which has been hijacked to spread anti-Israel and anti-Semitic venom.” Continued she: “Then there’s the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, recently chaired by North Korea. So serial proliferator North Korea presided over the UN’s disarmament body, and Iran, a regime which stones women to death, is a member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. We’re paying for a U.N. that just appointed as the head of its Kosovo mission an individual involved with the infamous Oil-for-Food scandal, and a U.N. that goes after whistleblowers while protecting the corrupt.” Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen disclosed that Secretary of State Clinton sent a letter at the outset of the hearings Thursday coming out directly in opposition to the bill. “The Secretary claims, if we move to a system of voluntary funding, it will hurt our soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, because other member states won’t do the ‘burden-sharing’ to pay for UN missions in those countries,” Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen said. “Does the Administration have such little faith in our allies and in our diplomacy — which they pride themselves on — to think that they would not share the burden of fighting Islamist extremists unless the UN forced them to? And given that the U.S. paid billions and billions of dollars to the UN last year, I think it’s clear who is actually carrying the burden without any say: the U.S. taxpayer.” The ranking member on the Democratic side of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Howard Berman, offered a substitute bill designed to gut Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen’s reform. Mrs. Ros-Lehtinen argued that, among other flaws, Mr. Berman’s measure would mean “ no consequences if any UN body upgrades the Palestinian status.” In the event, the committee turned aside Mr. Berman’s substitute measure and Mrs. Clinton’s objections and passed the United Nations Transparency, Accountability, and Reform Act by a comfortable margin. In the full House, the bill has something like 125 sponsors. They are, at least at the moment, all Republicans, according to a dispatch of CNS News. Even if the measure clears the House, it will still have a hard time in the Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats. Mrs. Clinton’s letter to the committee warned that if, by some miracle, the measure does pass, she’ll urge President Obama to veto it. This strikes us as an opportunity for the Republicans to bring the issue of the United Nations into the presidential campaign now under way and so that the American people can let the dictators, kleptocrats, and anti-Semites in the United Nations know where America stands.<br />

Congressional Anticipation. The last alternative explanation proposes that Congress drafts favorable legislation in response to the president’s increase in political capital. In contrast to the investment explanation, where the president uses veto threats differently depending on his capital and the legislation stays constant, this theory suggests that Congress changes its actions. The president’s use of the veto is constant, but Congress changes its legislation depending on the president’s approval rating. In recent years, the majority leadership in the House has aggressively used its power to control the agenda. If a measure seems likely to divide the majority party or face a presidential veto, then it will probably not reach a House floor vote in the first place (Simendinger 2003). When the president’s approval ratings increase, the Congress anticipates a stronger veto threat. This anticipation creates favorable legislation rather than unfavorable legislation that will trigger a veto. Therefore, when the president’s political capital is at its highest, the presidential veto will be least likely. In the current 109th Congress, however, there were signs of strain between the White House and the House Republican Leadership, possibly caused by the president’s decrease in political capital (“Bush Vows Stem Cell Veto” 2005).<br />

Many of us while growing up and listening to our bedtime stories learned to not freak out and run screaming through the streets if we thought that the “sky is falling.” As little chickens, we were taught at an early age that it was best to be brave, calm, and rational, else be considered a crazed lunatic. This childhood behavioral bias infiltrated adulthood in the relationship between professional astronomers, policy-makers and national budget-number crunchers. When a scientist expresses probabilistic concerns about the impending doom of our planet from a cataclysmic change of a major impact event, say, in the next 100, 1,000, or 10,000 years, it requires just too much risk of political capital and tax-payer dollars to divert significant budget resources to something that might only be a concern for our uber-great grandchildren.  The simultaneous efforts of two Hollywood studios in the late nineties of the last century tried to get something stirring in our cultural awareness with their mega-disaster flicks, Armageddon and Deep Impact. These features did bring us through the box office (which was certainly their primary goal!), but they did not push us en masse to the round table to prepare for the ultimate defensive plan for our planet. Combating Earth-bound asteroids, or “near-earth objects” (NEOs), is an unsolved problem, and one that citizen scientists largely ignore because it’s assumed that this issue must be only approached via the domain that has access to the massive amounts of taxpayer dollars and the international collaborations between those nations who can liberally spend all of that money. It’s this requirement of essentially unlimited funds that is the sticking point to making serious progress on defending against an event that may, or may not, happen in the upcoming budget cycle. <br />

<br />
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday warned House Republicans about pushing ahead with a bill to cut funds for the United Nations, saying she would recommend that President Barack Obama veto the legislation. In a letter to lawmakers, Clinton said the bill would severely limit U.S. participation in the world body, undercut U.S. interests and damage the security of Americans at home and abroad. The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans to consider the legislation on Clinton said international cooperation is critical to push American interests such as &quot;staunching nuclear proliferation, combatting terrorism, fully implementing sanctions on countries such as Iran and North Korea, preventing conflict around the globe, and supporting elections in countries just undergoing transition to democracy.&quot; She also said the legislation undermines the ability of the United State to share costs with other countries. &quot;This bill would effectively cede American leadership, creating a void for our adversaries to fill,&quot; Clinton wrote. The legislation, which has more than 50 Republican co-sponsors, would pressure the U.N. to adopt a voluntary funding system by withholding 50 percent of the U.S. non-voluntary regular budget contributions if, after two years, 80 percent of the U.N. regular budget is not funded on a voluntary rather than assessed basis. In the 2010 budget year, the U.S. provided $7.7 billion to the U.N. for its regular budget, peacekeeping and other programs, up from $6.1 billion the previous year. The bill also would block U.S. funds for any United Nations entity that supports giving Palestine an elevated status at the U.N. and ban U.S. contributions to the U.N. Human Rights Council and an anti-racism conference seen as a platform for anti-Israel rhetoric. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., chairwoman of the committee, is a frequent critic of the United Nations. In defending her legislation, she has said the international organization is plagued by scandal, mismanagement and inaction, and is biased against the United States and Israel. Clinton acknowledged problems with the U.N. but said that &quot;for all its imperfections, (it) is indispensable to advancing&quot; U.S. goals. Although Clinton raised the specter of a presidential veto, the legislation has little chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate.<br />

If U.S. policymakers fail to act and other powers continue to grow, it is not a question of whether but when a new international order will emerge. The closing of the gap between the United States and its rivals could intensify geopolitical competition among major powers, increase incentives for local powers to play major powers against one another, and undercut our will to preclude or respond to international crises because of the higher risk of escalation. The stakes are high. In modern history, the longest period of peace among the great powers has been the era of U.S. leadership. By contrast, multi-polar systems have been unstable, with their competitive dynamics resulting in frequent crises and major wars among the great powers. Failures of multi-polar international systems produced both world wars. American retrenchment could have devastating consequences. Without an American security blanket, regional powers could rearm in an attempt to balance against emerging threats. Under this scenario, there would be a heightened possibility of arms races, miscalculation, or other crises spiraling into all-out conflict. Alternatively, in seeking to accommodate the stronger powers, weaker powers may shift their geopolitical posture away from the United States. Either way, hostile states would be emboldened to make aggressive moves in their regions. As rival powers rise, Asia in particular is likely to emerge as a zone of great-power competition. Beijing’s economic rise has enabled a dramatic military buildup focused on acquisitions of naval, cruise, and ballistic missiles, long-range stealth aircraft, and anti-satellite capabilities. China’s strategic modernization is aimed, ultimately, at denying the United States access to the seas around China. Even as cooperative economic ties in the region have grown, China’s expansive territorial claims — and provocative statements and actions following crises in Korea and incidents at sea — have roiled its relations with South Korea, Japan, India, and Southeast Asian states. Still, the United States is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression.<br />

Since the late 1980s, a small group of astronomers and planetary scientists has repeatedly warned of the threat of an asteroid impacting with Earth and causing global destruction. They foretell a large impact causing global fires, the failure of the world’s agriculture and the end of human civilization. But, these scientists assure us, we live at a unique moment in history when we have the technological means to avert disaster. They call for support for dedicated astronomical surveys of near-Earth objects to provide early warning of an impactor and they have regularly met with defence scientists to discuss new technologies to deflect any incoming asteroids. The scientists who have promoted the asteroid impact threat have done so by invoking narratives of technological salvation – stories which, like the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), promise security through a superweapon in space. The asteroid impact threat can therefore be located within the broader cultural history of fantasies about security and power, which, Bruce Franklin (1988) has argued, is inextricably linked to the century-old idea that a new superweapon could deliver world peace. Howard McCurdy (1997: 78–82), in his study of the ways in which the US space programme was shaped by popular culture, has suggested that the promotion of the impact threat can be seen as the completion of Cold War fantasies, which had used a politics of fear to justify space exploration. McCurdy highlights the alignment between the promotion of the impact threat and works of fiction. In this paper, I consider the reconceptualization of asteroid science that this alignment entailed. It is beyond the scope of this paper to give a complete history of the science of planetary impacts. My focus is on how a group of scientists moved from seeing impacts as significant events in Earth history to seeing them as threatening events in the human future – a move from historical to futurological narratives. Nor is there space to give a full account of the empirical developments that were used to support the construal of asteroids as a threat. Rather, I wish to make the case that these empirical developments were given meaning within a specific narrative context which drew civilian astronomers into contact with defence scientists, especially those working on SDI. A number of studies (for example, McDougall, 1985; Forman, 1987; Kevles, 1990; DeVorkin, 1992; Leslie, 1993; Dennis, 1994) have revealed the ways in which US research programmes and nominally-civilian scientific institutions originated in military programmes.1 One aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the boundary between civilian and military science is blurred not just institutionally, but also at a fundamental conceptual level. The civilian scientists discussed here followed different working practices and traded in different forms of expertise than did the defence scientists. They were typically astronomers or planetary scientists who worked for NASA or on NASA-funded research programmes at universities and private institutes. They saw themselves as distinct from the defence scientists who were typically physicists and engineers working on new weapons systems or other technologies of national security at the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories or at armed services institutions. 2 Yet the two groups came to share an interest in asteroids and with that a set of assumptions about the nature of human society, the role of technology and our place in outer space. As they came into contact, their differing backgrounds meant they disagreed over a number of issues, yet both sides pursued the collaboration despite the tensions. Many studies of the interaction between military and civilian science have focused on sources of funding and shared technologies.3 Important as these are, they fail to capture fully the dynamic between the two communities. In particular, a cynical picture of scientists simply pursuing sources of funding on any terms cannot reveal the far-reaching ways in which civilian research can become entrenched in particular patterns of thinking which are supportive of militaristic programmes. For military/civilian collaborations to be sustained, civilian scientists need to share with their counterparts in the defence sector an understanding of the overall trajectory of their research. For shared technologies to be developed, they need first to be imagined. Military/civilian interactions are therefore predicated on, and mediated through, a shared technoscientific imaginary. Despite expressing concerns about the motives and methods of the weapons scientists, the civilian scientists who promoted the asteroid impact threat drew on narratives that configured a human role in space in a similar way to SDI. These narratives helped make asteroids conceivable as a threat, yet they also served to make acceptable, and even necessary, the idea of space-based weaponry. Despite their disagreements, at the level of their shared narratives the discourses of the civilian and defence scientists were mutually supportive.<br />

Space weapons establish the U.S. as global sovereign, rendering all life bare<br />

<br />
This scenario is fascinating for the political logic at work within it—space weapons are required to launch an attack at an otherwise inaccessible target. The three reasons that the target might be inaccessible all have to do with potential gaps in imperial power. Either the defenses of the target country have not been suppressed, or other states have not consented to let the forces fly through their airspace, or other coalition members—presumably in NATO or the UN—have not consented to the action. The first “justification” for the use of the weapon involves clear erasure of the sovereignty of the targeted state, as it eliminates any pretense of that country’s defensibility. The second and third “justifications” diminish, by circumvention, the sovereignty of other states. All three buttress the exclusive capacity of the U.S. to act unilaterally in deciding the exception globally. In all three cases, the only practical use for this weapon is in an imperial project! The chief advantage of space weapons is their ability on very short notice to attack a target that is out of reach of conventional forces. What places these targets “out of reach” is the sovereignty of other states as exercised through those states’ abilities to defend their territory, control their airspace, and/or participate (jointly) in authorized decision of the (global) exception. The constitutive effect of these weapons, then, is to strip states of their sovereignty—they are constituted as subjects lacking authorization of decision, and lacking boundary effectively demarcating inside from outside. What modern sovereignty does (as identified in section I. above) is taken from them. Furthermore, given the potential targets that these weapons could destroy, and how they are used, space-based systems are most useful against small groups and individuals. While the purpose of the use of space-based weapons in the above example was to prevent genocide, the means by which this attack was carried out was essentially assassination—the assassination of those driving the vehicle to carry out the ethnic cleansing. Space-based weapons, then, are most useful at targeting individuals and groups on short notice in order to achieve a political objective. We have already seen potential glimpses of this type of warfare in recent years. Consider, for example, that the Iraq War began with a so called “decapitation strike” aimed at assassinating Saddam Hussein in the hope of ending the war before it began. Similar tactics have been used by the Israeli Defense Forces to kill specific leaders of the Palestinians. Also, the U.S. has used Unmanned Aerial Vehicles equipped with missiles to target specific members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Placing weapons in space aimed at terrestrial targets would only accelerate the ability to carry out these types of “targeted killings” (a.k.a. assassinations). Space weapons would enable those who control them to kill any person at any point on Earth on extremely short notice. Thus, application of force from outer space would have at least three crucially important constitutive effects. First, it would constitute the possessor of these weapons—presumably the U.S.—as the center of a globally extensive, late-modern empire,68 a sovereign of the globe. But this global sovereign would exercise its power in a new way. Rather than needing to control the land, sea, and airspace of all of the Earth, it could rely on space weapons— because they enable the precise application of force at any point on earth, on short notice— to control the globe. While these weapons are not particularly useful in fighting large-scale wars, or in the conquest of territory, they make such conventional uses of military power moot, in large part. There is no longer a need to exercise sovereign power through the control of territory, all one has to do is kill—or perhaps even threaten to kill—potential adversaries around the world in order to gain one’s wishes. In short, the type of power potentially wielded by such a sovereign would be far more absolute than any encountered throughout history.69 Second, these weapons, just as space-based missile defense was seen above to do, would effectively strip states of their ability to exercise sovereignty over their territories. While de jure sovereignty may remain intact, their de facto sovereignty would be effectively erased. For decades, realist international relations scholars have promoted the idea that states secure their sovereignty through self-help.70 If states lack the capacity to defend themselves from adversaries they are particularly vulnerable to attack and conquest. While other scholars from liberal and constructivist schools of thought have questioned how closely sovereignty is linked to military capability, throughout history states with disproportionate military power have repeatedly violated the sovereignty of weaker states.71 While space-based weapons in and of themselves would not enable conquest of another state, they could be used very effectively to achieve precise political objectives without a credible possibility of retaliation. Imagine what impact these weapons would have on U.S. foreign policy with respect to two of its most pressing objectives at this point in time. Consider, for one, how useful such weapons might be with respect to preventing a rival state such as Iran or North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons. While there has been speculation that the U.S. or Israel may launch air strikes against potential nuclear weapons manufacturing facilities in these countries, the logistics—getting access to airspace from neighboring countries, and the possibility of retaliation against military forces in the area—make such operations difficult to carry out. Using weapons in space to conduct such missions would avoid these logistical difficulties, thereby making them easier (and presumably more likely). The threat of using space weapons on either the manufacturing sites of weapons of mass destruction or on the political leadership of an adversary in most cases probably would be sufficient to alter the behaviour of governments. In short, if the U.S. were to deploy such weapons in space, they would likely be used to much the same effect as the gunboat diplomacy of the 19th century. A second contemporary policy objective is to fight specific non-state actors. The 9/11 Commission Report discussed in great detail the logistical obstacles that prevented the Clinton administration from capturing or killing Osama Bin Laden.72 The primary obstacle was the difficulty in either launching cruise missiles into Afghanistan through another state’s airspace or deploying U.S. Special Forces in an area so remote from U.S. military bases. Again, had the U.S. had space-based weapons at the time, they probably would have been the weapons of choice. When combined with intelligence about the location of a potential target, they could be used to kill that target on very short notice without violating the air space of other states, or needing to have a military base nearby to offer a support role. In effect, any person or group of people anywhere on Earth could be targeted on very short notice, thereby constituting everyone everywhere as objects of the global sovereign. All would be subject to the rule of the U.S. state. The sovereignty of states would no longer be an obstacle to killing enemies, and these assassinations could be carried out rather easily without the threat of retaliation by the state whose sovereignty has been violated. The example of using space weapons to target non-state actors such as Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda points to a third constitutive effect of space weapons. Because these weapons could target anyone, anywhere, at anytime, everyone on the Earth is effectively reduced to “bare life.”73 As Agamben demonstrates in Homo Sacer (1998), one of the constitutive powers of the sovereign is to determine who is outside the laws and protections of the state. While human rights regimes and the rule of law may exist under a late-modern global empire policed by space weapons,74 the global sovereign will have the ability to decide the exception to this rule of law, and this state of exception in many cases may be exercised by the use of space weapons that constituted this sovereign in the first place.<br />

<br />
But the focus on narrative also begs a question: Which stories would we prefer to frame our science? Should science be driven by fear or by curiosity? Should it be aimed at creating technologies of war or cultures of compassion? These are normative questions, but they are also precisely the questions that make the military influence on science such an important issue. Narratives are inherently ideological and a refusal to see them as such does no more to enhance the scholar’s objectivity than it does the scientist’s. The stories told by the asteroid scientists led them into collaborations with weapons scientists and helped fuel a discourse of fear that served a particular ideological purpose. This should be both recognized and challenged, not for the sake of regaining some impossible ideal of an undistorted science but because there are other stories, based on different ideological assumptions, that we could tell in order to guide science towards more peaceful ends.<br />

Zero impact to large asteroids – either too improbable or too small to matter<br />

The smallest falling bodies, those with diameters under a few meters, are of “no practical concern,” says Chapman, and in fact they are to be desired, at least by those who keep their eyes on the skies watching for brilliant fireballs whose burning up in the atmosphere provides a show far more spectacular than the most lavish Fourth of July fireworks. Even bodies with diameters of 10–30 meters, of which Chapman estimates six may fall to earth in a century, cause little more than broken windows. They explode too high in the atmosphere to cause serious harm. The next largest potential strikers of Earth are those in the Tunguska range of 30 meters–100 meters. The shock waves from the atmospheric explosion would “topple trees, wooden structures and ignit[e] fires within 10 kilometers,” writes Chapman. Human deaths could result if the explosion took place over a populated area. Though Chapman estimates the likelihood of a Tunguska occurring in any given century at four in ten, it is worth noting that there is no evidence that such an explosion has killed a single human being in all of recorded history. Either we’re overdue or that 40 percent is high. Moreover, given that the location of such an explosion is utterly unpredictable, it would be far more likely to happen over an ocean or a desert than over, say, Tokyo or Manhattan. The after effects would be minimal, and Chapman says that “nothing practical can be done about this modest hazard other than to clean up after the event.” In fact, “It makes no sense to plan ahead for such a modest disaster… other than educating the public about the possibility.” The cost of a telescopic survey capable of picking up bodies of such diminutive size would be prohibitive. It would be the ultimate Astronomers Full Employment Act. A body of 100 meters–300 meters in diameter would either explode at low altitude or upon impact with the ground; it would be “regionally devastating,” but Chapman pegs the chances of such a catastrophe at 1 percent per century. A small nation could be destroyed by the impact of a body of 300 meters—1 km in diameter, or a “flying mountain” of sorts, which would explode with energy yield ten times more than “the largest thermonuclear bomb ever tested.” If striking land, it would carve out a crater deeper than the Grand Canyon. If it hit a populated area, the death toll could be in the hundreds of thousands. The likelihood of such a collision Chapman estimates at 0.2 percent per century. An asteroid or comet of 1–3 kilometers in diameter would cause “major regional destruction,” possibly verging on “civilization-destruction level.” Chapman puts the chances of this at 0.02 percent per century. The impact of a body more than 3 kilometers in diameter might plunge the Earth into a new Dark Age, killing most of its inhabitants, though the chances of this are “extremely remote” — less than one in 50,000 per century. Finally, mass extinction would likely occur should a body greater than 10 kilometers pay us a visit, though the chances of this are less than one in a million every century, or so infinitesimal that even the most worry-wracked hypochondriac will not lose sleep over the possibility. In fact, for any impact with a Chapman-calculated likelihood of less than one in a thousand per century, he concedes that there is “little justification for mounting asteroid-specific mitigation measures.” The chance of a civilization-ender is so remote that he counsels no “advance preparations” — or almost none. For Chapman recommends further study of NEOs, as well as investigation into methods of their diversion. 82 This is exactly what the NEO lobby wants. <br />

Status quo surveys solve for extinction-level asteroids<br />

Although the impact hazard was treated with substantial skepticism two decades ago when surveys were i rst proposed, it has become conventional wisdom that we should carry out the Spaceguard Survey for asteroids large enough to threaten global disaster (e.g., Posner 2004; Clarke 2007; Slovic 2007; Morrison 2007). The question whether need a much more expensive survey for sub-km asteroids is still being debated, however (Atkinson et al. 2000; Chapman 2000, 2007a; Morrison et al. 2003; Stokes 2003; Sidle 2007; NRC Report 2010). As the original Spaceguard Survey goals are within reach, the residual hazard lies in the few undiscovered asteroids larger than 1 km and in the sparsely sampled sub-km asteroids. The largest hazard will be from tsunamis caused by impactors several hundred meters in diameter, but this is primarily a risk to property since fatalities can be greatly reduced by the application of tsunami warning systems. The most life-threatening hazard from sub-km impacts is associated with airbursts over land. The survey results have already transformed our understanding of the impact risk. For asteroids with diameter of 5 km or more, which is roughly the threshold for an extinction event, our knowledge is complete today. Astronomers have already assured us that we are not due for an extinction-level impact from an asteroid within the next century<br />
. Barring a very unlikely strike by a large comet, we are not about to go the way of the dinosaurs. Thus, the rest of this paper focuses on the more frequent impacts by asteroids with diameters from 5 km down to the atmospheric cut-off at about 50 m diameter, spanning the range from global catastrophic disasters at the top end down to local endurable disasters at the lower end of the energy range. <br />

Self-interest means we won’t deflect<br />
<br />
Schweickart, 4 [Russell, AIAA Associate Fellow, Chairman, B612 Foundation, “ THE REAL DEFLECTION DILEMMA,” 2004 Planetary Defense Conference: Protecting Earth from Asteroids Orange County, California February 23-26, 2004 ]<br />
<br />
This challenge is, by its nature, international. While there is the exceptional circumstance where the deflection path will lie entirely within the bounds of a single nation state, the general case is one where the path of risk will cross several, or even many, national borders. It would therefore seem appropriate that the many legal and risk sharing issues embedded in deflecting asteroids be addressed by either the United Nations or some other authoritative international policy institution. The timing for such policy consideration is a challenging issue in itself. The quality of information on a pending NEO impact is highly variable over time. It ranges from a surprise impact with no prior knowledge to the case of 1950 DA 2 where we know today that there is a probability between 0 and 0.33% that this 1.1 km asteroid will impact Earth on March 16, 2880. For all other known NEOs between these two cases we can only state that with the exception of ~ 45 of them the remaining 2700 pose no threat to the Earth for the next 100 years. The residual 45 pose a very small but non-zero threat of an Earth impact at various times within the next 100 years. The issue then, of what will we know and when will we know it, becomes extremely critical to the timing and development of a coordinated international public policy on the NEO environmental threat. The natural temptation with such an improbable event is to wait until it becomes either a certainty or near-certainty before addressing it seriously. The price that would be paid for such an avoidance option in this instance will be the wielding of extreme selfserving national influence in the policy making process. If, e.g., it is discovered that a modest NEO will impact in Japan and that the deflection path would take it across Korea and over Beijing and China prior to liftoff, one can easily imagine the difficulty in only then initiating international deliberations on appropriate deflection policies. Clearly, rational mission planning criteria and risk sharing policies should be discussed and even put into formal treaty documents well before the specifics of a particular impact come to light. Objective evaluation of risk trade-offs and rational mission design will be far easier to achieve in such a proactive environment than in the power-politics confrontation that would dominate a wait and see alternative. An even more difficult, though similar, situation applies to the considerations of mission execution. What agency or agencies of any national government will be trusted to “truck” a 100+ MT bomb across the countryside in order to eliminate certain devastation in a neighboring country? Could one seriously imagine today the U.S. DoD being accepted by the world as the responsible agency for deflecting an asteroid from an impact in Afghanistan when the path of deflection would take it directly across Tehran? Of course this is a highly improbable example, but the likelihood that similar political considerations will not exist when we discover a probable NEO impact is dangerous wishful thinking. CONCLUSION The Real Deflection Dilemma will arise when the people of Earth awake to discover that a near Earth asteroid is headed for an impact with the planet. It will present itself as a terrible choice; do nothing to prevent it and suffer the consequences, or mount a mission to deflect it from impact thereby, in the process, placing a swath of people and property not otherwise at risk in jeopardy. In a very real sense, however, we are already ensnared in this dilemma, for we all know that such a moment in time will come. Therefore our own Real Deflection Dilemma is whether to confront the intractable policy choices implicit in protecting the Earth from asteroids now, or to avoid this terrible responsibility and force some future generation to face them in real time when they will become all but impossible to resolve.<br />

While most of the data are approximately consistent with a power law, the lunar-derived NEO population curve of Werner et al. (2002) shows an obvious departure, usually interpreted as a shortage of small (diameter less than a few hundred meters) impactors, although it might also suggest an early excess of large asteroids or comets not currently represented in the NEA flux. Interpreted in the usual way, however, the lunar curve indicates that the frequency of Tunguska-size impactors is roughly one per 10,000 yr, more than an order of magnitude below the usually quoted frequency of such impacts, and a surprising result given that we experienced such an event within the last century. We don’t know where the problem lies, but we suggest that the NEA population derived by Werner et al. from the lunar cratering statistics warrants consideration of alternative interpretations of the data <br />

<br />
Thus, assessing the completeness of the NEO surveys is subject to uncertainties: Some groups of NEOs are particularly difficult to detect. Asteroids and comets are continually lost from the NEO population because they impact the Sun or a planet, or because they are ejected from the solar system. Some asteroids have collisions that change their sizes or orbits. New objects are introduced into the NEO population from more distant reservoirs over hundreds of thousands to millions of years. The undiscovered NEOs could include large objects like 2009 HC82 as well as objects that will be discovered only months or less before Earth impact (“imminent impactors”). Hence, even though 85 percent of NEOs larger than 1 kilometer in diameter might already have been discovered, and eventually more than 90 percent of NEOs larger than 140 meters in diameter will be discovered, NEO surveys should nevertheless continue, because objects not yet discovered pose a statistical risk: Humanity must be constantly vigilant. Finding: Despite progress toward or completion of any survey of near-Earth objects, it is impossible to identify all of these objects because objects’ orbits can change, for example due to collisions. Recommendation: Once a near-Earth object survey has reached its mandated goal, the search for NEOs should not stop. Searching should continue to identify as many of the remaining objects and objects newly injected into the NEO population as possible, especially imminent impactors.<br />

Zero risk of a small asteroid crashing—1 every 1000 years <br />

<br />
Depending on an impactor’s composition and the speed and angle of impact, objects with diameters of up to roughly 50[m] to 100 m typically create blast effects of up to of order 50 to 100 MT without impacting the surface. The Tunguska event of 30 June 1908, for example, created a shock wave that leveled the forest over an area of roughly 2000 km2 (Kolesnikov et al. 2007). This event is variously estimated to have resulted from an atmospheric explosion of 10 to 100 MT from an object estimated to be between about 60 and 100 m in diameter (Covey 2002; Yazev 2002). Based on astronomical evidence, such events are statistically expected to occur approximately every few centuries, with an event occurring over land roughly every 500 to 1000 years, which is not inconsistent with historical records. <br />

Once-in-a-Century Mini-Tunguska Atmospheric Explosion Consider a 30-40 m office-building-sized object striking at 100 times the speed of a jetliner. It would explode ~15 km above ground, releasing the energy of ~100 Hiroshima-scale bombs. Some researchers consider that such an event would be spectacular to witness but would not have lethal consequences. Our review of the literature suggests, however, that weak structures might be damaged or destroyed by the overpressure of the blast wave out to 20 km. The death toll might be hundreds; although casualties would be far higher in a densely populated place, they would much more likely be zero (i.e., if the impact were in the ocean or in a desolate location). Such an event is likely to occur before or during our grandchildren's lifetimes, although most likely over the ocean rather than land. Even with the proposed augmented Spaceguard Survey, it is unlikely that such a small object would be discovered in advance; impact would occur without warning. Since it could occur literally anywhere, there are no location-specific kinds of advance measures that could or should be taken, other than educating people (perhaps especially military forces that might otherwise mistake the event as an intentional attack) about the possibilities for such atmospheric explosions. In the lucky circumstance that the object is discovered years in advance, a relatively modest space mission could deflect such a small body, preventing impact (see ref. 65).<br />

Small asteroid will strike over water and cause negligible damage <br />
<br />
Gusiakov ‘7 (V. K., Tsunami Laboratory, Institute of Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Geophysics Siberian Division, Russian Academy of Sciences, Ch.14: Tsunami as a Destructive Aftermath of Oceanic Impacts, in Comet/Asteroid Impacts and Human Society: An Interdisciplinary Approach, SpringLink)<br />
<br />
Since evidence for asteroid impact on Earth exists, we have to conclude that there is a four-to-one chance that they hit oceans, seas or even large internal water reservoirs and therefore tsunami or tsunami-like water waves can be generated by an extra-terrestrial impact. There has been a general concern that the tsunami from a deep-water impact of a 1-km asteroid could contribute substantially to its overall hazard for the people living near coasts and would wash out all coastal cities of the entire ocean (Chapman 2003; Morrison 2003). However, a 1-km asteroid is quite close to the global disaster threshold (impact of a 2–3 km object) and tsunami could therefore contribute somewhat to other hazardous aftermaths of this natural catastrophe that would have a large enough potential to end our modern civilization era. Fortunately for humankind, it is indeed a very rare event, available estimates of its return period vary in the range of 100 000 to 1 000 000 years. Much more frequent are the Tunguska-class impacts (the size of an object being 100 m or less) with the return period being more relevant to the human time scale and spanning from several hundred to one thousand years. Unless the small asteroid is made of solid metal (iron or nickel), it would likely explode in the upper atmosphere with a TNT equivalent in the first tens of megatons. Available estimates, based mainly on nuclear tests results, show that tsunami from such an airblast should be from several tens of centimeters to one meter (Glasstone and Doland 1977), so the water impact of such a small, once-per-century asteroid could be in general less hazardous than an equivalent explosion above land. <br />

Furthermore, the Report takes a totally backwards approach to characterization, saying that we first need to determine what deflection system we will use before addressing what characterization option we will try to build and implement.  The &quot;logic&quot; is not what it should be, namely that we will select (from a tool-kit of relevant technologies) what deflection approach would be appropriate for an *identified* threatening NEO of a particular size; rather, it says (specifically in the last paragraph of pg. 73) that we will soon select a one-approach-fits-all deflection system (e.g. stand-off nuclear) as the preferred generic deflection scheme and only then design a characterization effort that will address the needs of that sole deflection approach.  (The seriousness of this error is illustrated by the fact that the Report seems to select stand-off nuclear as the preferred approach -- because it is &quot;most effective&quot; -- and then ridiculously concludes that we need to know *less* about the physical nature of the NEO for stand-off nuclear than for all other deflection options!  [This absurd argument is &quot;developed&quot; in the middle paragraph of pg. 61.].)    The logical approach, instead (and of course!), is to have a tool-kit of deflection approaches that will address the range of feasible cases, then characterize any threatening NEO that is found, and finally fold the results of that characterization into designing the appropriate deflection mission (which may involve more than one deflection technique) from among the techniques in our tool-kit.<br />

Nuclear deflection works- fragmented pieces miss Earth or burn up in the atmosphere<br />

Deflection and destruction of the approaching comet are both viable options. While some proposals suggest avoiding fragmentation because of the potential to create multiple assailants on course for Earth, fragments may cause less damage by spreading out the energy. Fragmentation is the most efficient method of moving the comet, since a larger fragment can deliver the same impulse to the comet with less energy. Given the uncertain composition of a comet and its unknown response to high-yield detonations, not enough information is available to determine whether a surface-burst nuclear explosion would cause it to fragment. If so, the goal should be to spread the pieces out over an area much larger than Earth, so that most will pass by harmlessly. Additionally, the rest should be reduced to a size that cannot penetrate the atmosphere. A strategy incorporating multiple sequential explosions, delivered by separately propelled vehicles, lends itself quite well: after fragmentation by the initial explosion, any large pieces remaining on course for Earth become the new targets for the later interceptions. If, however, the comet remains essentially cohesive, the goal must be to deflect it far enough to definitively avoid impact. In each case, the velocity (of either the main comet body or the majority of the fragments) must be enough that the orbit is displaced by two Earth radii before it crosses Earth orbit. In the first case, this spreads the material over a diameter twice that of Earth, while in the second it ensures a miss by a safe margin. The velocity change VC to accomplish this shift is given as a function of the interception time by the same numerical simulation used for modelling the flight of the interceptors (discussed in section 5.2).<br />

<br />
False Alarms False alarms, often referred to within the NEO community as “one day wonders,” are another unique characteristic of NEO impact threats, and deserve special attention. In the early phases of discovery and orbit refinement the impact time and location will be very imprecise. False alarms, even and perhaps especially from authoritative sources who may in fact believe in their projections, excite the media and engage the public. The periodic outbreak of attention from a false alarm may seem to be beneficial at first glance, as it serves to raise public awareness of the threat. However, any awareness enhancing features are outweighed by detrimental consequences including inducing panic and unnecessary anxiety; desensitizing the public or trivializing the threat; and diverting the attention and damaging the [credibility] credible of the NEO community.<br />

As previously pointed out, humankind now possesses the technology to provide the first two essential elements necessary to protect the planet from asteroid impacts. Early impact warning is already underway for the largest objects of concern and new telescopes will soon increase the capability to provide impact warning for more numerous smaller objects of concern. Asteroid deflection capability, while not yet proven, is possible with current spaceflight technology and is being actively investigated by several of the world’s space agencies. The missing third element is the readiness and determination of the international community to take concerted action in response to a perceived threat to the planet. An adequate global action program must include deflection criteria and campaign plans which, can be implemented rapidly and with little debate by the international community. In the absence of an agreed-upon decision-making process, we may lose the opportunity to act against a NEO in time, leaving evacuation and disaster management as our only response to a pending impact. A single such missed opportunity will add painful fault-finding to the devastating physical effects of an impact. The international community should begin work now on forging its warning, technology, and decision-making capacities into an effective shield against a future collision.<br />

MESKILL 2009 (David, professor at Colorado School of Mines and PhD from Harvard, “The &quot;One Percent Doctrine&quot; and Environmental Faith,” Dec 9, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11151:http://davidmeskill.blogspot.com/2009/12/one-percent-doctrine-and-environmental.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://davidmeskill.blogspot.com/2009/12/one-percent-doctrine-and-environmental.html" rel="nofollow">http://davidmeskill.blogspot.com/2009/12/one-percent-doctrine-and-environmental.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11151 -->)<br />
<br />
Tom Friedman's piece today in the Times on the environment is one of the flimsiest pieces by a major columnist that I can remember ever reading. He applies Cheney's &quot;one percent doctrine&quot; (which is similar to the environmentalists' &quot;precautionary principle&quot;) to the risk of environmental armageddon. But this doctrine is both intellectually incoherent and practically irrelevant. It is intellectually incoherent because it cannot be applied consistently in a world with many potential disaster scenarios. In addition to the global-warming risk, there's also the asteroid-hitting-the-earth risk, the terrorists-with-nuclear-weapons risk (Cheney's original scenario), the super-duper-pandemic risk, etc. Since each of these risks, on the &quot;one percent doctrine,&quot; would deserve all of our attention, we cannot address all of them simultaneously. That is, even within the one-percent mentality, we'd have to begin prioritizing, making choices and trade-offs. But why then should we only make these trade-offs between responses to disaster scenarios? Why not also choose between them and other, much more cotidien, things we value? Why treat the unlikely but cataclysmic event as somehow fundamentally different, something that cannot be integrated into all the other calculations we make? And in fact, this is how we behave all the time. We get into our cars in order to buy a cup of coffee, even though there's some chance we will be killed on the way to the coffee shop. We are constantly risking death, if slightly, in order to pursue the things we value. Any creature that adopted the &quot;precautionary principle&quot; would sit at home - no, not even there, since there is some chance the building might collapse. That creature would neither be able to act, nor not act, since it would nowhere discover perfect safety. Friedman's approach reminds me somehow of Pascal's wager - quasi-religious faith masquerading as rational deliberation (as Hans Albert has pointed out, Pascal's wager itself doesn't add up: there may be a God, in fact, but it may turn out that He dislikes, and even damns, people who believe in him because they've calculated it's in their best interest to do so). As my friend James points out, it's striking how descriptions of the environmental risk always describe the situation as if it were five to midnight. It must be near midnight, since otherwise there would be no need to act. But it can never be five *past* midnight, since then acting would be pointless and we might as well party like it was 2099. Many religious movements - for example the early Jesus movement - have exhibited precisely this combination of traits: the looming apocalypse, with the time (just barely) to take action.<br />

High-magnitude logic doesn’t apply—asteroid strike is so improbable that we can just ignore it<br />
<br />
BENNETT 2010 (James, Prof of Economics at George Mason, The Doomsday Lobby: Hype and Panic from Sputniks, Martians, and Marauding Meteors, p. 175)<br />
<br />
Now, it makes sense for the appropriate agencies to make plans for the evacuation of cities in the event of a levee breaking or a power plant disaster. These “incidents” are plausible, or at least thinkable. Better safe than sorry. A collision with an asteroid or comet, on the other hand, is so highly implausible, so exceedingly unlikely, that “planning” for it is a potent blend of the useless and the expensive. Boosting the DHS’s National Response Plan was Evan R. Seamone, writing in 2004 in the Georgetown International Environmental Law Review. Seamone bemoaned that “Current legal and policy efforts to enable adequate defense against potential asteroid or comet collisions with the earth are insufficient because they are indirectly premised upon theories that require verification of a clear and imminent threat before governmental agencies can act.” In other words, the antediluvian theories that underlay our system and the systems of most other governments of the world require that there be an actual threat before the state is mobilized to meet that threat. Obviously the philosophers who spin such theories never saw Armageddon on DVD. As an alternative for the 21st century, Seamone proposed a “precautionary principle” as the cornerstone of a governmental asteroid defense program. This tenet — which might also be known as the fling-open-the-doors-to-the-Treasury principle — “requires governments to take action to prevent harm even when it is uncertain if, when, or where the harm will occur.”<br />

Privilege short-timeframe impacts:<br />
A) Intervening actors—the longer the timeframe the more likely other agents are to solve their impact<br />
<br />
B) Impact access—short timeframe impacts can turn long timeframe ones, but not the other way around—by the time the later event has occurred our shorter timeframe impact will already be irreversible<br />
<br />
C)Probability—Long timeframes decrease it—the more distant the prediction, the more likely it is to be wrong <br />
POSNER 2004 (Richard, US Court of Appeals judge and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, Catastrophe: Risk and Response  17)<br />
A compelling reason for not giving a great deal of thought to the remote future is the difficulty, often the impossibility, of making accurate predictions beyond a few years.  People in the year 1000 could have had only the vaguest conception of what the world would be like in the year 2004, and we can have only the vaguest conception of what it will be like in the year 3000, let alone the year 1,000,000.  We have better predictive methods than people in 1000 did, but on the other had the rate of technological change is higher now than it was then.  Lacking the requisite foreknowledge we can’t know what we should be doing now to forestall the disasters that are possible, maybe even likely, on that timescale.<br />
<br />
D) Conditional probability—short-timeframe existential risks effectively decrease the probability of long-timeframe ones—we can only die once<br />
BOSTROM 2011 (Nick, Prof. of Philosophy at Oxford, The Concept of Existential Risk (Draft), <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:11152:http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.existentialrisk.com/concept.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:11152 -->)<br />
Finally, when considering existential-risk probabilities, we must recognize that one existential catastrophe can preempt another.  If a meteor wipes us out next year, the existential risk from future machine superintelligence drops to zero.  The sum of all-things-considered probabilities of disjoint (mutually exclusive) existential risks cannot exceed 100%.  Yet conditional probabilities of disjoint existential risks (conditional, that is to say, on no other existential disaster occurring preemptively) could well add up to more than 100%.  For example, some pessimist might coherently assign an 80% probability to humanity being destroyed by machine superintelligence, and a 70% conditional probability to humanity being destroyed by nanotechnological warfare given that humanity is not destroyed by machine superintelligence.  However, if the unconditional (all-things-considered) probability of our being eradicated by superintelligence is 80%, then the unconditional probability of our being eradicated by nanotech war must be no greater than 20%, since we can only be eradicated once.<br />
<br />
Extremely low probabilities should count as zero—even if there’s some risk, policy decisions can’t be justified by vanishingly small probabilities<br />
RESCHER 2003 (Nicholas, Prof of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, Sensible Decisions: Issues of Rational Decision in Personal Choice and Public Policy, p. 49-50)<br />
On this issue there is a systemic disagreement between probabilists working on theory-oriented issues in mathematics or natural science and decision theorists who work on practical decision-oriented issues relating to human affairs.  The former takes the line that small number are small numbers and must be taken into account as such—that is, the small quantities they actually are.  The latter tend to take the view that small probabilities represent extremely remote prospect and can be written off.  (De minimis non curat lex, as the old precept has it: in human affairs there is no need to bother with trifles.)  When something is about as probable as a thousand fair dice when tossed a thousand times coming up all sixes, then, so it is held, we can pretty well forget about it as a worthy of concern.  As a matter of practical policy, we operate with probabilities on the principle that when x ≤ E, then x = 0.  We take the line that in our human dealings in real-life situations a sufficiently remote possibility can—for all sensible purposes—be viewed as being of probability zero.  Accordingly, such remote possibilities can simply be dismissed, and the outcomes with which they are associated can accordingly be set aside.  And in “the real world” people do in fact seem to be prepared to treat certain probabilities as effectively zero, taking certain sufficiently improbable eventualities as no long representing real possibilities.  Here an extremely improbable event is seen as something we can simply write off as being outside the range of appropriate concern, something we can dismiss for all practical purposes.  As one writer on insurance puts it: [P]eople…refuse to worry about losses whose probability is below some threshold.  Probabilities below the threshold are treated as though they were zero.  No doubt, remote-possibility events having such a minute possibility can happen in some sense of the term, but this “can” functions somewhat figuratively—it is no longer seen as something that presents a realistic prospect.<br />
<br />
We must weigh competing probabilities and dismiss threats to survival if they are very unlikely—the alternative is that we do nothing about any existential risk<br />
POSNER 2004 (Richard, US Court of Appeals judge and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, Catastrophe: Risk and Response  19)<br />
The reason for the hedge in “essentially” is that I want to avoid making claims of metaphysical certainty.  From a scientific standpoint, anything is possible.  But some possibilities really are too remote to be worth worrying about, such as the possibility that my next breath will create a black hole or that the entire human population will be persuaded to commit suicide.  To put this differently, we have to be selective in responding to the catastrophic risks because if we allow our imaginations to multiply their number indefinitely we’ll end up doing nothing about any of them.<br />

War can happen<br />
Ferguson 2008 - sr. fellow @ the Hoover Institute and professor of History @ Harvard (Niall, Hoover Digest no1 47-53 Wint 2008)<br />
The risk of a major geopolitical crisis in 2007 is certainly lower than it was in 1914. Yet it is not so low as to lie altogether beyond the realm of probability. The escalation of violence in the Middle East as Iraq disintegrates and Iran presses on with its nuclear program is close to being a certainty, as are the growing insecurity of Israel and the impossibility of any meaningful U.S. exit from the region. All may be harmonious between the United States and China today, yet the potential for tension over trade and exchange rates has unquestionably increased since the Democrats gained control of Congress. Nor should we forget about security flashpoints such as the independence of Taiwan, the threat of North Korea, and the nonnuclear status of Japan. To consign political risk to the realm of uncertainty seems almost as rash today as it was in the years leading up the First World War. Anglo-German economic commercial ties reached a peak in 1914, but geopolitics trumped economics. It often does. <br />

Obviously, when a nuclear bomb hits a target, it causes a massive amount of devastation, with the heat, blast and radiation killing tens or hundreds of thousands of people instantly and causing huge damage to infrastructure. But in addition to this, a nuclear explosion throws up massive amounts of dust and smoke. For example, a large nuclear bomb bursting at ground level would throw up about a million tonnes of dust. As a consequence of a nuclear war, then, the dust and the smoke produced would block out a large fraction of the sunlight and the sun's heat from the earth's surface, so it would quickly become be dark and cold - temperatures would drop by something in the region of 10-20ºC - many places would feel like they were in an arctic winter. It would take months for the sunlight to get back to near normal. The drop in light and temperature would quickly kill crops and other plant and animal life while humans, already suffering from the direct effects of the war, would be vulnerable to malnutrition and disease on a massive scale. In the case of an (e.g.) accidental nuclear exchange between the USA and Russia, the main effects would be felt in the northern hemisphere, as the dust and smoke would quickly circulate across this area. But even in this case, it would soon affect the tropics - where crops and other plant/ animal life are especially sensitive to cold. Hence, even in these areas there would be major problems.<br />

Twenty-five years ago international teams of scientists showed that a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union could produce a “nuclear winter.” The smoke from vast fires started by bombs dropped on cities and industrial areas would envelop the planet and absorb so much sunlight that the earth’s surface would get cold, dark and dry, killing plants worldwide and eliminating our food supply. Surface temperatures would reach winter values in the summer. International discussion about this prediction, fueled largely by astronomer Carl Sagan, forced the leaders of the two superpowers to confront the possibility that their arms race endangered not just themselves but the entire human race. Countries large and small demanded disarmament. Nuclear winter became an important factor in ending the nuclear arms race. Looking back later, in 2000, former Soviet Union leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev observed, “Models made by Russian and American scientists showed that a nuclear war would result in a nuclear winter that would be extremely destructive to all life on earth; the knowledge of that was a great stimulus to us, to people of honor and morality, to act.” Why discuss this topic now that the cold war has ended? Because as other nations continue to acquire nuclear weapons, smaller, regional nuclear wars could create a similar global catastrophe. New analyses reveal that a conflict between India and Pakistan, for example, in which 100 nuclear bombs were dropped on cities and industrial areas--only 0.4 percent of the world's more than 25,000 warheads--would produce enough smoke to cripple global agriculture. A regional war could cause widespread loss of life even in countries far away from the conflict.  Regional War Threatens the World    By deploying modern computers and modern climate models, the two of us and our colleagues have shown that not only were the ideas of the 1980s correct but the effects would last for at least 10 years, much longer than previously thought. And by doing calculations that assess decades of time, only now possible with fast, current computers, and by including in our calculations the oceans and the entire atmosphere--also only now possible--we have found that the smoke from even a regional war would be heated and lofted by the sun and remain suspended in the upper atmosphere for years, continuing to block sunlight and to cool the earth.  India and Pakistan, which together have more than 100 nuclear weapons, may be the most worrisome adversaries capable of a regional nuclear conflict today. But other countries besides the U.S. and Russia (which have thousands) are well endowed: China, France and the U.K. have hundreds of nuclear warheads; Israel has more than 80, North Korea has about 10 and Iran may well be trying to make its own. In 2004 this situation prompted one of us (Toon) and later Rich Turco of the University of California, Los Angeles, both veterans of the 1980s investigations, to begin evaluating what the global environmental effects of a regional nuclear war would be and to take as our test case an engagement between India and Pakistan.  The latest estimates by David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security and by Robert S. Norris of the Natural Resources Defense Council are that India has 50 to 60 assembled weapons (with enough plutonium for 100) and that Pakistan has 60 weapons. Both countries continue to increase their arsenals. Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapons tests indicate that the yield of the warheads would be similar to the 15-kiloton explosive yield (equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT) of the bomb the U.S. used on Hiroshima.  Toon and Turco, along with Charles Bardeen, now at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, modeled what would happen if 50 Hiroshima-size bombs were dropped across the highest population-density targets in Pakistan and if 50 similar bombs were also dropped across India. Some people maintain that nuclear weapons would be used in only a measured way. But in the wake of chaos, fear and broken communications that would occur once a nuclear war began, we doubt leaders would limit attacks in any rational manner. This likelihood is particularly true for Pakistan, which is small and could be quickly overrun in a conventional conflict. Peter R. Lavoy of the Naval Postgraduate School, for example, has analyzed the ways in which a conflict between India and Pakistan might occur and argues that Pakistan could face a decision to use all its nuclear arsenal quickly before India swamps its military bases with traditional forces.  Obviously, we hope the number of nuclear targets in any future war will be zero, but policy makers and voters should know what is possible. Toon and Turco found that more than 20 million people in the two countries could die from the blasts, fires and radioactivity--a horrible slaughter. But the investigators were shocked to discover that a tremendous amount of smoke would be generated, given the megacities in the two countries, assuming each fire would burn the same area that actually did burn in Hiroshima and assuming an amount of burnable material per person based on various studies. They calculated that the 50 bombs exploded in Pakistan would produce three teragrams of smoke, and the 50 bombs hitting India would generate four (one teragram equals a million metric tons).  Satellite observations of actual forest fires have shown that smoke can be lofted up through the troposphere (the bottom layer of the atmosphere) and sometimes then into the lower stratosphere (the layer just above, extending to about 30 miles). Toon and Turco also did some &quot;back of the envelope&quot; calculations of the possible climate impact of the smoke should it enter the stratosphere. The large magnitude of such effects made them realize they needed help from a climate modeler.  It turned out that one of us (Robock) was already working with Luke Oman, now at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, who was finishing his Ph.D. at Rutgers University on the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions, and with Georgiy L. Stenchikov, also at Rutgers and an author of the first Russian work on nuclear winter. They developed a climate model that could be used fairly easily for the nuclear blast calculations.  Robock and his colleagues, being conservative, put five teragrams of smoke into their modeled upper troposphere over India and Pakistan on an imaginary May 15. The model calculated how winds would blow the smoke around the world and how the smoke particles would settle out from the atmosphere. The smoke covered all the continents within two weeks. The black, sooty smoke absorbed sunlight, warmed and rose into the stratosphere. Rain never falls there, so the air is never cleansed by precipitation; particles very slowly settle out by falling, with air resisting them. Soot particles are small, with an average diameter of only 0.1 micron (μm), and so drift down very slowly. They also rise during the daytime as they are heated by the sun, repeatedly delaying their elimination. The calculations showed that the smoke would reach far higher into the upper stratosphere than the sulfate particles that are produced by episodic volcanic eruptions. Sulfate particles are transparent and absorb much less sunlight than soot and are also bigger, typically 0.5 μm. The volcanic particles remain airborne for about two years, but smoke from nuclear fires would last a decade.  Killing Frosts in Summer    The climatic response to the smoke was surprising. Sunlight was immediately reduced, cooling the planet to temperatures lower than any experienced for the past 1,000 years. The global average cooling, of about 1.25 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit), lasted for several years, and even after 10 years the temperature was still 0.5 degree C colder than normal. The models also showed a 10 percent reduction in precipitation worldwide. Precipitation, river flow and soil moisture all decreased because blocking sunlight reduces evaporation and weakens the hydrologic cycle. Drought was largely concentrated in the lower latitudes, however, because global cooling would retard the Hadley air circulation pattern in the tropics, which produces a large fraction of global precipitation. In critical areas such as the Asian monsoon regions, rainfall dropped by as much as 40 percent.  The cooling might not seem like much, but even a small dip can cause severe consequences. Cooling and diminished sunlight would, for example, shorten growing seasons in the midlatitudes. More insight into the effects of cooling came from analyses of the aftermaths of massive volcanic eruptions. Every once in a while such eruptions produce temporary cooling for a year or two. The largest of the past 500 years, the 1815 Tambora eruption in Indonesia, blotted the sun and produced global cooling of about 0.5 degree C for a year; 1816 became known as &quot;The Year<br />
