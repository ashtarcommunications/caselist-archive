SSP is inevitable globally- the US must pursue it with the technology that already exists

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Presently, </span>only the top industrialized nations have the technological, industrial and economic.........<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">which will be competitive with all other sources. </span>

<span class="boldunderline0">__First__ is resource control - it’s the keystone of US Hegemony- our dependence on foreign oil cripples power projection</span>

Defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment..........<span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">thus maintaining our position as the world’s preeminent military power.</span>

Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers...........will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.

==**India**== 
**Contention ___ is India__**

__**India’s space policy is in turmoil– cooperation with India allows us to define the partnership and prevent an arms buildup – treaties don’t solve**__

__<span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">India</span> is adamant that it <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">will not support any future treaties</span>……. and ill will on either or both sides later on.__

__<span style="color: #000000;">Similarly, the Chinese and American actions may lead to an Indian military……. and that may have negative effects for our own space capabilities.</span>__

__This is the second of two scenarios that consider how U.S. space weapons…….. the mere presence of such weapons is corrosive to the conﬁdence that allows national nuclear forces to operate safely.__

__Part of why <span style="font-size: 14.6667px; text-decoration: none;">India may be interested in developing an ASAT capability</span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">………</span>….. that its missile defense interceptors do, indeed, serve as able ASATs.__

Clean, efficient and available 24-7, space-based solar power……………..<span style="text-decoration: none;">jolt that people need to get them excited about the future again.</span>
