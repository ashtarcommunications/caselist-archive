I affirm: The United States ought to extend to non-citizens accused of terrorism the same constitutional due process protections it grants to citizens.<br />
Ought implies a moral obligation, thus I value morality. States are distinct from individuals and as such have different moral standards. Professor Bruce Williams writes:<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Bruce Williams, [Professor of Media Studies and Ph.D of Political Science at the University of Virginia], “State Morality in International Relations”, The American Political Science Review, Vol. 17, No. 1 (Feb.,1923). RK</span><br />
From this viewpoint, the conduct of the state, in its external relations,<br />
AND<br />
degree of development, morality must, in fact, of necessity exist.<br />
Because they are tools that are created for the sole purpose of protecting their citizens, states can never agree to any other system of moral norms. A state’s right to exist is founded upon the consent of its citizens, thus it has a moral obligation to uphold their interests. Philosopher John Locke explains:<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">John Locke, “Second Treatise On Government” (1685)</span><br />
If [a] man [person] in the state of Nature be so<br />
AND<br />
legislative and executive power as well as of the governments and societies themselves.<br />
Therefore, the standard is upholding national interests. My thesis is granting due process rights to non-citizens accused of terrorism is key to protecting national security.<br />
Contention 1: Denying due process rights harm American citizens because they are counterproductive to the war on terrorism in the long term. First, denying due process rights destroys international coalitions, which are vital to the US. Gerard Fogarty, Director General of the Australian Defence Force, writes:<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Gerard F. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Forgarty 05</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, [Director General, Workforce Planning and Retention, Australian Defence Force], “Is Guantanamo Bay Undermining the Global War on Terror?”, <em>Parameters</em>, August 2005. RFK</span><br />
The US strategy for winning the Global War on Terrorism is predicated on creating an<br />
AND<br />
—and in which direction—at this writing remains to be seen.<br />
International cooperation is vital because since terrorism is a global threat, we rely on other countries for military assistance and intelligence. Unless the world is united against terrorism, the threat will always find a place to thrive.<br />
AND- the practice of detention without trial harms our ability to prevent attacks and motivates terrorists. Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, writes:<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Kenneth </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Roth 2008</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, [American attorney and has been the executive director of Human Rights Watch since 1993],“After Guantanamo: The Case Against Preventive Detention”, <em>Foreign Affairs</em>, the Council on Foreign Relations, May/June 2008. RFK</span><br />
Criminal prosecution of terrorism suspects is not a perfect system. Not all suspects can<br />
AND<br />
a terrorist&quot;-- a &quot;species of criminal guilty of multiple attempted murders.&quot;<br />
AND- the absence of due process rights radicalizes terrorists. Professor Matthew Waxman writes:<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Matthew C. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Waxman 09</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, [Associate Professor, Columbia Law School; Adjunct Senior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations; Member of the Hoover Institution Task Force on National Security and Law], “ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION OF TERRORISTS: WHY DETAIN, AND DETAIN WHOM?”, JOURNAL OF NATIONAL SECURITY LAW &amp; POLICY, March 19, 2009. RFK</span><br />
Historically, detention practices – especially those viewed as overbroad – have sometimes proven counterproductive<br />
AND<br />
cautions about similar risks in setting up detention systems in battling insurgencies.122<br />
Finally- this links to the standard because effective counterterrorism is crucial to national security- terrorists can easily and have the motivation to cause mass civilian deaths. Wilkinson and Hartwig in 10:<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Wilkinson and Hartwig 10</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Claire Wilkinson, [Vice President – Global Issues], Robert P. Hartwig, [Ph.D., CPCU], “TERRORISM RISK: A REEMERGENT THREAT”, Insurance Information Institute, 2010, RFK. </span><br />
Despite the differing viewpoints, the overall consensus appears to be that ¶ terrorism risk<br />
AND<br />
and Afghanistan, with Thailand and ¶ Nepal showing higher levels of activity.<br />
Contention 2: The United States can grant due process rights to terrorists at no harm to national security. Mark Kende, Professor of Constitutional Law at Georgetown University, writes:<br />

AND- federal courts solve international legitimacy and have been effective in the past. Joshua T. Bell, Special Agent with the US Naval Criminal Investigative Service, writes:<br />

 <br />
Framework<br />
Part 1- My Impacts Matter<br />
Ought implies an obligation so I value consistency with obligations. THE STANDARD IS PROTECTING NATIONAL SECURITY.<br />
First, states are not in a position to be subject to the same ethical standards as individuals.<br />
George Kennan 85. [He is Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.]“Morality and Foreign Policy” Foreign Affairs, Vol. 64, No. 2 1985. pp. 205-218 AG<br />
Certain distinctions should be made before one wanders ¶ farther into this thicket of ¶<br />
AND<br />
it accept ¶ any moral reproach for acting on the basis of them.<br />
Second, even if states have obligations not to violate side constraints, there is no act omission distinction for states.<br />
Sunstein and Vermuele 05, Cass Sunstein [Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School] and Adrian Vermuele [Harvard professor of law], “Is Capital Punishment Morally Required? The Relevance of Life-Life Tradeoffs,” Chicago Public Law &amp; Legal Theory Working Paper No. 85 (March 2005), p. 17.<br />
The most fundamental point is that unlike individuals, governments always and necessarily face a<br />
AND<br />
a set of policy instruments that do not adequately or fully discourage it.<br />
Third, status quo bias- any moral norms against preventing harm is just a psychological bias towards the current state of affairs.<br />
Bostrom and Ord 06, Nick Bostrom [Swedish philosopher at the University of Oxford known for his work on existential risk and the anthropic principle. He holds a PhD from the London School of Economics] and Toby Ord [Professor of Philosophy University of Oxford], “The Reversal Test: Eliminating Status Quo Bias in Applied Ethics”, Ethics 116 (July 2006): 656–679. RFK<br />
Changes from the status quo will typically involve both gains and losses, with the<br />
AND<br />
enhancements? If so, how can the bias be diagnosed and removed?<br />
Fourth, cost-benefit analysis of national security is the only rational option available to policymakers.<br />
Felix E. Oppenheim 87, [Retired political science professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst], “National Interest, Rationality, and Morality”, Political Theory , Vol. 15, No. 3 (Aug., 1987), pp. 369-389. RFK<br />
The concept of practical necessity will be helpful to an understanding of international politics in<br />
AND<br />
because &quot;departure from the rational model imperils the survival of the state.&quot;<br />
And, ought implies can- if it is impossible for a table to perform an action, there cannot be a reason for a table to perform an action. If util is inevitable we ought to use it.<br />
Terrorism Advantage<br />
Part 2: The Terrorism Advantage<br />
In the status quo, citizens are tried in Article III federal courts, but non-citizens are either detained indefinitely or tried at military commission where they don’t get a full set of due process rights--- that’s counterproductive and hurts counterterrorism.<br />
A] Legitimacy- military commissions don’t provide sufficient due process rights and are viewed as illegitimate compared to federal courts.<br />
John Ip 12, [Professor of Law at the University of Auckland], “Military Commissions and Discrimination Against Non-Citizens (March 19, 2012). THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PREJUDICE: INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES ON CONTEMPORARY ISSUES, Nova, 2012. RFK<br />
Regardless of whether limiting the jurisdiction of military commission to non-citizens gives rise<br />
AND<br />
the judgment of history” (Glazier, 2008, p. 200).<br />
AND- legitimacy is the most important factor in thwarting militants because it eradicates their popular support base- granting due process rights is key to solve<br />
Lunday and Rishikof 08, KEVIN E. LUNDAY [Captain and judge advocate in the U.S. Coast Guard.] &amp; HARVEY RISHIKOF [professor of law and former chair of the Department of National Security Strategy, National War College], “DUE PROCESS IS A STRATEGIC CHOICE: LEGITIMACY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ARTICLE III NATIONAL SECURITY COURT”, CALIFORNIA WESTERN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL Vol. 39, 2008. RFK<br />
Legitimacy of action is a vital strategic weapon against terrorism. Sovereign states within the<br />
AND<br />
detainees, and the writ of habeas corpus in the war against terrorism.<br />
B] International Cooperation- the US relies on international cooperation to win the war on terror, but denying due process fosters anti-Americanism and destroys coalitions<br />
McCarthy and Velshi 09, Andrew C. McCarthy [Andrew C. McCarthy is Director of the Center for Law &amp; Counterterrorism at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies], Alykhan Velshi, [staff attorney at the Center for Law &amp; Counterterrorism, where he focuses on the international law of armed conflict and the use of force], “We Need a National Security Court”, American Enterprise Institute, 2009. RFK<br />
Because al Qaeda and its affiliates are a stateless transnational terror network, and terrorist<br />
AND<br />
proceedings are perfectly adequate (even exemplary) under our Constitution and laws.<br />
AND- support of Muslim countries is critical to counterterrorism<br />
Anthony H. Cordesman 10, [Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy], “The True Lessons of Yemen ¶ and Detroit¶ How the US Must Expand and Redefine ¶ International Cooperation in Fighting ¶ Terrorism”, Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2010. RFK<br />
The second answer is to put even more emphasis on international cooperation in ¶ counterterrorism<br />
AND<br />
our global economic and strategic interests would face ¶ far more serious threats.<br />
C] Extremism- violating due process mobilizes terrorists and alienates sources of assistance<br />
Matthew C. Waxman 09, [Associate Professor, Columbia Law School; Adjunct Senior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations; Member of the Hoover Institution Task Force on National Security and Law], “ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION OF TERRORISTS: WHY DETAIN, AND DETAIN WHOM?”, JOURNAL OF NATIONAL SECURITY LAW &amp; POLICY, March 19, 2009. RFK<br />
Historically, detention practices – especially those viewed as overbroad – have sometimes proven counterproductive<br />
AND<br />
cautions about similar risks in setting up detention systems in battling insurgencies.122<br />
AND- Denying due process rights justifies political repression which increases extremism and violence<br />
Abdulaziz Ayoub 12, [Assistant Professor of Education at Dhofar University], “Terrorism Prevention and Human Rights Violation”, Asian Transactions on Basic and Applied Sciences (ATBAS ISSN: 2221-4291) Volume 02 Issue 02, May 2012. RFK<br />
In spite of all these efforts, it is obvious that the campaign against terrorism<br />
AND<br />
selfcontradictory, and, in the long run, selfdefeating” (27).<br />
AND- the impact to terrorism is mass death<br />
Wilkinson and Hartwig 10, Claire Wilkinson, [Vice President – Global Issues], Robert P. Hartwig, [Ph.D., CPCU], “TERRORISM RISK: A REEMERGENT THREAT”, Insurance Information Institute, 2010, RFK.<br />
Despite the differing viewpoints, the overall consensus appears to be that ¶ terrorism risk<br />
AND<br />
and Afghanistan, with Thailand and ¶ Nepal showing higher levels of activity.<br />
AND- short term tactical counterterrorism is just a band-aid on the wound- the US MUST invest in long term strategies to effectively fight terrorism, so due process rights outweigh any disads<br />
Anthony H. Cordesman 10, [Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy], “The True Lessons of Yemen ¶ and Detroit¶ How the US Must Expand and Redefine ¶ International Cooperation in Fighting ¶ Terrorism”, Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2010. RFK<br />
At the same time, the US needs to reconsider its own strategy and pay<br />
AND<br />
compensate for ineffective local governance and losing an ideological struggle dominated by religion.<br />
Solvency<br />
Part 3: Plan: The USFG ought to try all non-citizens accused of terrorism at domestic Article III courts and expand the federal district court system as necessary. Article III courts are where citizens accused of terrorism are tried in the status quo.<br />
The most comprehensive analysis ever done of trying terrorists in Article III courts proves they’re effective and don’t harm national security.<br />
Zabel and Benjamin 09, Richard B. Zabel and James J. Benjamin Jr., [partners in the New York office of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP., former Assistant United States Attorneys in the Southern District of New York], “Prosecuting Terrorism Cases in Federal Courts: 2009 Update and Recent Developments”, Human Rights First, July 2009. RFK<br />
Because of the importance of resolving the question of when and how to try and<br />
AND<br />
has been and should continue to be an important tool in confronting terrorism.<br />
Article III courts grant due process rights and preserve the rule of law, and have been effective in the past.<br />

 Part 1- The Framework<br />
Ought implies a moral obligation so I value morality.<br />
The standard is protecting national security.<br />
First, states have an obligation to craft effective policies to prevent terrorism.<br />
OCHR 08, [Office of the United Nations¶ High Commissioner for Human Rights], “Human Rights, Terrorism¶ and Counter-terrorism”, Fact Sheet no. 32, United Nations, Geneva, 2008. RFK<br />
Terrorism aims at the very destruction of human rights, democracy and the¶ rule<br />
AND<br />
law, in particular international¶ human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.<br />
Second, focusing only on good intentions without consideration of mechanism is politically irresponsible and allow for atrocities<br />
Issac 02 (Jeffery, Professor of Political Science at Indiana University, “Ends, Means, and Politics”, Dissent, Vol. 49 No. 2, Spring)<br />
Politics, in large part, involves contests over the distribution and use of power<br />
AND<br />
not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness.<br />
Third, we shouldn’t prefer ineffective counterterrorism policies just because they’re implemented in the status quo- any moral norms against preventing harm are just a psychological bias towards the current state of affairs.<br />
Bostrom and Ord 06, Nick Bostrom [Swedish philosopher at the University of Oxford known for his work on existential risk and the anthropic principle. He holds a PhD from the London School of Economics] and Toby Ord [Professor of Philosophy University of Oxford], “The Reversal Test: Eliminating Status Quo Bias in Applied Ethics”, Ethics 116 (July 2006): 656–679. RFK<br />
Changes from the status quo will typically involve both gains and losses, with the<br />
AND<br />
enhancements? If so, how can the bias be diagnosed and removed?<br />
Part 2 is the terrorism advantage.<br />
Any court that treats non-citizens differently from citizens racializes terrorism and makes it inevitable because it would only apply to foreign Muslim men, whereas citizens are tried in Article III federal courts- that erodes the rule of law and alienates Muslim populations<br />
Sudha Setty 10, [Associate Professor of Law, Western New England College School of Law.], “Comparative Perspectives On Specialized Trials¶ For Terrorism”, MAINE LA W REVIEW Vol. 6. 2010. RFK<br />
The current iteration of the military commission system in the United States ¶ shares many<br />
AND<br />
that differ ¶ significantly from the basic protections of the ordinary justice system.<br />
AND- fairness is critical to counterterrorism- preserves international cooperation, prevents alienation, and decreases popular support for terrorists<br />
David S. Kris 11, [Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the U.S. Department of Justice from March 2009 to March 2011. This article was written and submitted for publication when Mr. Kris was Assistant Attorney General.], “Law Enforcement as a Counterterrorism Tool”, JOURNAL OF NATIONAL SECURITY LAW &amp; POLICY Vol. 5, 2011. RFK<br />
More generally, we need to recognize the practical impact of our treatment of the<br />
AND<br />
hostilities, while we abandon those tools here in the United States.84<br />
That has several implications towards preventing terrorism<br />
A] POPULAR SUPPORT- terrorist organizations cannot exist without constant support from surrounding populations- doing the aff would erode that support base<br />
Audrey Cronin 06, [Director of Studies of the Changing Character of War Program at Oxford Univer- sity. She is also on the university’s international relations faculty.], “How al-Qaida Ends¶ The Decline and Demise of Terrorist Groups”, International Security, Vol. 31, No. 1 (Summer 2006), pp. 7–48. RFK<br />
Terrorist groups are strategic actors that usually deliberate about their targets and calculate the effects<br />
AND<br />
loss of local popular support for Chechen terrorist groups is a good example.<br />
B] International cooperation- the US relies on international cooperation to capture terrorists and glean intelligence- further erosion of relations would gut our counterterrorism capabilities<br />
David S. Kris 11, [Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the U.S. Department of Justice from March 2009 to March 2011. This article was written and submitted for publication when Mr. Kris was Assistant Attorney General.], “Law Enforcement as a Counterterrorism Tool”, JOURNAL OF NATIONAL SECURITY LAW &amp; POLICY Vol. 5, 2011. RFK<br />
Finally, the criminal justice system may help us obtain important cooperation from other countries<br />
AND<br />
be extradited because they do not face charges pending in the foreign nation.<br />
C] Muslim countries- short term military counterterrorism is doomed to fail- we must invest in long term strategies and forge partnerships especially with Muslim states which means due process rights outweigh any disads<br />
Anthony H. Cordesman 10, [Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and is a national security analyst on a number of global conflicts.], “The True Lessons of Yemen ¶ and Detroit¶ How the US Must Expand and Redefine ¶ International Cooperation in Fighting ¶ Terrorism”, CSIS, 2010. RFK<br />
At the same time, the US needs to reconsider its own strategy and pay<br />
AND<br />
reaches its crisis level – as has been the case in countries like Yemen<br />
D] Political repression- denying due process rights justifies political repression which increases extremism and violence<br />
Abdulaziz Ayoub 12, [Assistant Professor of Education at Dhofar University], “Terrorism Prevention and Human Rights Violation”, Asian Transactions on Basic and Applied Sciences (ATBAS ISSN: 2221-4291) Volume 02 Issue 02, May 2012. RFK<br />

 I negate and value morality. States are distinct from individuals and as such have different moral standards. Professor Bruce Williams writes:<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Bruce Williams, [Professor of Media Studies and Ph.D of Political Science at the University of Virginia], “State Morality in International Relations”, The American Political Science Review, Vol. 17, No. 1 (Feb.,1923). RFK</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">From this viewpoint, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the conduct of the state</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in its external relations, </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">AND</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">degree of development, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">morality must</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">in fact, of necessity exist</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
While individuals may be bound by certain moral constraints, states exist for different functions and have different obligations. States are obligated to protect national security for two reasons. First, because they are tools that are created for the sole purpose of protecting their citizens, states can never agree to any other system of moral norms. Professor George Kennan writes:<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">George Kennan. [He is Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.]“Morality and Foreign Policy” Foreign Affairs, Vol. 64, No. 2 1985. pp. 205-218 AG</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">AND</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">attempt to insert itself into the consciences of those whose interests it represents. </span><br />
Second, promoting the protection of rights respects the unconditional value of rational beings. David Cummisky explains:<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Kantian Consequentialism By David Cummiskey Published by Oxford University Press US, 1996 ISBN 0195094530, 9780195094534 192 pages</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In such a situation, what would a conscientious Kantian agent, an agent motivated </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, then equal consideration dictates that one may sacrifice some to save many.</span><br />
Thus, the standard is protecting national security.<br />
My thesis and sole contention is that extending due process rights is a counterterrorism disaster because it would end drone strikes, which are key to national security.<br />
A] <u>E</u>xtending due process rights to terrorists necessitates stopping drone strikes.<br />

<strong><u>AND</u></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Israel has yet satisfied the law enforcement principles of imminence and absolute necessity.</span><br />
B] Obama’s current drone strike policy is bringing terrorism to its knees- even bin Laden acknowledged they were a threat- and, strikes are becoming more effective and civilian casualties are decreasing significantly as we continue the program<br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Covert drone strikes are one of Obama's key national security policies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. He has already </span><br />

 Granting due process rights deprives the government of its ability to detain terrorists indefinitely<br />
David Cole 09, [Professor, Georgetown University Law Center], “Out of the Shadows: Preventive Detention,¶ Suspected Terrorists, and War”, CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW Vol. 97, 2009 RFK<br />
In recognition of the importance of checking the government’s detention ¶ power, the Constitution<br />

¶ provides that an arrest is not reasonable unless based on probable cause.<br />
That’s probably bad for national security- we need to retain the ability to detain terrorists indefinitely because the standards for conviction are so high that dangerous terrorists would be let go<br />

These three concerns challenge the detention paradigm. They do nothing to eliminate the ¶<br />

the past; ¶ having government authorities that reflect that change makes sense.<br />
AND- our inability to convict will only increase terrorism because it sends a weak message that galvanizes militant groups<br />

 Grounding foreign policy in ethics replicates the danger that they criticize, and leads to a dangerous moral singularity<br />

 A. FISA is the ONLY major legislation that will pass – it has bipartisan support<br />

<em>While the upcoming election casts an unfortunate partisan tint on almost every issue, I</em><br />

 Part 1 is the framework: The resolution is a question of appropriate state action, so I value justice. States are contractual actors that are obligated to protect the rights of its citizens. This generates a right to a decent minimum of health care for several reasons.<br />
A] National security- threats to health are more chronic and severe than military threats, which necessitates government intervention<br />
Gary E. Jones 83„The Right to Healthcare and the State‟, The Philosophical ¶ Quarterly vol 33 No 132 (Special Issue: Medicine and Ethics), 1983, pp279-287. DM<br />
Although the above points can be granted, a policy of health care can be<br />
AND<br />
to a threat more serious than is the military threat that prompts conscription.<br />
In order for them to disprove this argument, they would have to claim that the state also does not have the obligation to use military force to protect national security, which is a pretty tough sell.<br />
B] Liberty- even the most minimal conception of the state would grant a right to health because it is the prerequisite to expressing any other liberties.<br />
Gary E. Jones 83„The Right to Healthcare and the State‟, The Philosophical ¶ Quarterly vol 33 No 132 (Special Issue: Medicine and Ethics), 1983, pp279-287. DM<br />
More importantly, even in terms of the presuppositions of the Liberal theory a minimal<br />
AND<br />
to establish a protective agency to respond to life threatening disease and accidents.<br />
C] Civil rights- states must continue to respect civil and political rights of citizens as part of the social contract so that state power doesn’t go unchecked- the right to health is an extension of these rights.<br />
Tony Evans 02, [professor of global politics at the University of Southampton], “A human right to health?”, Third World Quarterly, Vol 23, No 2, pp 197–215, 2002. RFK<br />
The basic rights analysis, on the other hand, offers a considerable challenge to<br />
AND<br />
socioeconomic rights, the actors responsible for¶ those acts can be identified.<br />
Thus, states have the obligation to ensure a decent minimum of health care to citizens, so the standard is preserving health.<br />

Contention 1: Retribution violates human rights.<br />
Subpoint A] Retribution is fundamentally incompatible with human rights because it prioritizes punishment over the psychological and social needs of offenders.<br />
Tony Ward 09, [Professor of Psychology and Director of Clinical Training at Victoria University of Wellington], &quot;Punishment and Correctional Practice: Ethical and Rehabilitation Implications&quot;, Policy Quarterly, Volume 5, Issue 2- May 2009. RFK<br />
A major implication is that less attention is given to the ¶ question of how<br />
AND<br />
¶ psychological ones and any areas of psychological or social ¶ need overlooked.<br />
AND- increased incarceration causes brutalization, overcrowding, psychological harm, and a prison subculture<br />
Martin H. Pritikin 08, [Associate Professor of Law, Whittier Law School. JD, Harvard Law School, 2000; BA, University of Southern California, 1997.], “ARTICLE: IS PRISON INCREASING CRIME?”, 2008 Wis. L. Rev.. RFK<br />
Some argue that while in prison, offenders learn from older or more experienced inmates<br />
AND<br />
research quantifying its role in criminality may feasibly be undertaken in the future.<br />
AND- that links to human rights because since the state intentionally incarcerates offenders, it is responsible for harms other than the intended punishment- failure to do so is a proactive violation of human rights.<br />
Edgardo Rotman 86, [Visiting Researcher, Harvard Law School. Advanced Degree in Criminology¶ (1975); Ph.D. (1973); Law Degree (1959), National University of Buenos Aires.], “DO CRIMINAL OFFENDERS HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO REHABILITATION?”, THE JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW &amp; CRIMINOLOGY Vol. 77, No. 4, 1986. RFK<br />
A third source of the duty to rehabilitate springs from the very fact that the<br />
AND<br />
towards counteracting those effects. Such actions should consist largely of rehabilitative undertakings.<br />
Subpoint B] Retribution has led to a spiral of incarceration that can’t achieve deterrence, increases recidivism, and leads to a debilitating cycle of crime.<br />
John O. Haley 11, [Orthwein Distinguished Professor of Law Emeritus, Washington ¶ University in St. Louis and Professor of Law, Vanderbilt University Law School.] “Introduction—Beyond Retribution: An Integrated Approach to Restorative Justice”, 36 Wash. U. J. L. &amp; Pol’y 1 (2011),¶ <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1878:http://digitalcommons.law.wustl.edu/wujlp/vol36/iss1/2 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://digitalcommons.law.wustl.edu/wujlp/vol36/iss1/2" rel="nofollow">http://digitalcommons.law.wustl.edu/wujlp/vol36/iss1/2</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1878 -->. RFK<br />
Today over two million persons are currently incarcerated in state ¶ or federal prisons in<br />
AND<br />
; we simply refuse to divert funds from retributive to ¶ restorative programs.<br />
This violates the standard because unless offenders are empowered to become moral agents, they will violate the rights of other citizens.<br />
Tony Ward 09, [Professor of Clinical Psychology Victoria University of Wellington], &quot;Dignity and Human Rights in Correctional Practice&quot;, European Journal of Probation, University of Bucharest, Vol. 1, No. 2, 2009. RFK<br />
Third, the two strands of the concept of dignity evident in my analysis have<br />
AND<br />
crime prevention and management with the community as well as the individual offender.<br />
Contention 2: I advocate valuing a right-based model of rehabilitation over retribution. A rights-based model creates an immutable right to rehabilitation, rather than vacillating rehabilitative services. That spurs political leverage that will drive the criminal justice system away from retribution towards a constructive model with the dignity of prisoners as an overriding goal.<br />

Advanced Degree in Criminology¶ (1975); Ph.D. (1973); Law Degree (1959), National University of Buenos Aires.], “DO CRIMINAL OFFENDERS HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO REHABILITATION?”, THE JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW &amp; CRIMINOLOGY Vol. 77, No. 4, 1986. RFK<br />
The humanistic model of rehabilitation affirms the concept of prison inmates as possessors of rights<br />
AND<br />
It therefore replaces purely vindictive justice with a constructive approach of social reintegration.¶<br />
Past models of rehabilitation failed because they still operated within a system where punishment and deterrence were the primary goal- the aff is more focused on the individual prisoner as a recipient, rather than on how larger society benefits.<br />

In modern pluralistic democracies, public policies are limited by individual rights. This moral<br />
AND<br />
, guaranteeing the dignity of human beings confronted with criminal pursuit and conviction.<br />
AND- a prison system founded upon rehabilitation is the only way to make prisons humane---embracing retributivism will only create an incentive to treat offenders cruelly.<br />

Rehabilitation is in fact the approach adopted by prison wardens and other correctional officials.<br />

Both sides must defend a state of affairs as desirable. My burden is to show that a world in which rehabilitation is valued above retribution is better than the alternative. Conversely, the neg must defend a world in which rehabilitation is not valued above retribution and prove it is better than the aff.<br />
<br />
Ethical theories about moral rightness and obligation are irrelevant and insufficient. The debate between deontology and consequentialism is about whether we are obligated to produce the best state of affairs. But the resolution is about which state of affairs is best, REGARDLESS of whether we are obligated to make it happen.<br />
<br />
AND- our calculation of the best state of affairs should be informed by multiple different values and the details of each case.<br />

In a nation colored by the attacks on September 11th, we have developed a narrative of retribution that justifies a war on terror, a war on drugs, a war on crime.<br />

Because the resolution is a question of what the ideal criminal justice system looks like, it is necessary to determine the role of criminal law in public affairs. I value economic efficiency, because criminal law is best understood as a tool to promote efficient transactions of resources.<br />

Instead of following this path, theorists within the law and economics movement have attacked<br />
AND<br />
further creation of other productive areas for analyzing law (see Posner 1998).<br />
The law is a tool to protect our rights to our property and person. We exchange resources by making voluntary agreements with others, but crime upsets those agreements. Accordingly, the value criterion is achieving optimal economic efficiency. This means that the criminal justice system must minimize crime, which violates voluntary agreements.<br />
My thesis and sole contention is that rehabilitation makes the law less efficient by robbing it of its moral authority, which fosters conditions that create more crime.<br />
A] Valuing rehabilitation over retribution destroys the social message that crime is wrong and should be condemned<br />

Susan Dimock in 97, [Professor of Philosophy at York University], &quot;Retributivism and Trust&quot;, Law and Philosophy, Vol. 16, No. 1 (1997), pp. 37-62. RFK<br />
There is a danger that this point may be misunderstood. We¶ are here<br />
AND<br />
rules is necessary to secure trust(at least some of the time).<br />
Lack of trust leads to suboptimal outcomes because it means we can’t reliably make future investments, take risks, or cooperate with other people. Criminal law can create conditions where it is reasonable to trust others, even if it can’t punish every instance in which trust is violated.<br />
Susan Dimock 2, [Professor of Philosophy at York University], &quot;Retributivism and Trust&quot;, Law and Philosophy, Vol. 16, No. 1 (1997), pp. 37-62. RFK<br />
To understand which violations of trust require punishment and which do not, we need<br />
AND<br />
subjective trust easier to achieve and maintain; it makes trust more reasonable.<br />
Therefore, the standard is maintaining conditions of trust. My thesis and sole contention is that only retributive punishment restores trust after the offender has committed a crime.<br />
A] RISK ASSESSMENT- punishing offenders creates negative consequences to violating trust by demonstrating that society is willing to take action.<br />
Susan Dimock 3 [Professor of Philosophy at York University], &quot;Retributivism and Trust&quot;, Law and Philosophy, Vol. 16, No. 1 (1997), pp. 37-62. RFK<br />
But why do such displays of untrustworthiness merit punishment?¶ Why, that is,<br />
AND<br />
subjective willingness of individuals to trust, but that is an independent matter.<br />
B] RULE OF LAW—retribution is necessary to maintain the conception of law as designed to maintain trust.<br />
Susan Dimock 4, [Professor of Philosophy at York University], &quot;Retributivism and Trust&quot;, Law and Philosophy, Vol. 16, No. 1 (1997), pp. 37-62. RFK<br />
Secondarily, it is necessary that when trust between members of¶ society has been<br />
AND<br />
another reason to insist that basic trust be construed objectively rather than subjectively.<br />

 Because crimes establishes a relationship of dominance over the victim that retribution is necessary to reverse, I negate.<br />
Individuals possess rights by virtue of being human, but those rights are meaningless unless they are enforced, especially in a society where our ability to pursue our own ends depends on mutual recognition of rights by others.<br />

Wrongful action has communicative and consequential effects, but it also¶ creates a situation<br />
AND<br />
forms of diminishment, since she is not regarded¶ as an equal.¶<br />
Therefore, the standard is ensuring the recognition of human rights, which is an active process whereby we express what rights people have and condemn wrongdoings that violate rights.<br />
A] Moral wrongdoing puts the offender at a relation of dominance over the victim and devalues their human worth---only retribution annuls the offender’s claim of mastery over the victim and reaffirms the victim’s rights.<br />

 Part 1 is the Framework<br />
First, Regan and Aydin define intervention:<br />
Regan and Aydin 05, Patrick M. Regan [Professor of Political Science at Binghamton University, specializes in International Relations and Conflict Management] and Aysegul Aydin [Department of Political Science, Assistant Professor, University of Colorado Boulder], &quot;Diplomacy and Other Forms of Intervention in Civil Wars&quot;, The Journal of Conflict Resolution, Vol. 50, No. 5 (Oct., 2006), pp. 736-756. RFK<br />
In this article, we articulate a theoretical framework that integrates mediation, ¶ military<br />
AND<br />
stick&quot; ¶ strategies often advocated by the policy community and contemporary folklore.<br />
Next- because all humans deserve the right to live a life of their own choosing by virtue of being human, the value criterion is respecting human rights.<br />
Karina Sangha 12, [Political Science, University of Victoria], &quot;The Responsibility to Protect: A Cosmopolitan Argument for the Duty of Humanitarian Intervention&quot;, Journal of the Canadian POlitical Science Students' Association, 2012. RFK<br />
With this in mind, it should come as little surprise that cosmopolitanism has ¶<br />
AND<br />
beginning first with the duties of the state and related political ¶ institutions.<br />
AND- human rights come before any other framework because they are the foundations of legitimate state institutions.<br />
Rainer Forst 12, [Professor of Political Theory at the Department for Social Sciences], &quot;The Justification of Human Rights and the Basic Right to Justification. A Reflexive Approach; Rainer Forst.&quot; Philosophical Dimensions of Human Rights, Corradetti, Claudio (Ed). 2012. RFK<br />
Human rights are essential and fundamental standards of the legitimacy of a social and ¶<br />
AND<br />
power, and human rights are a way ¶ to express that.¶ 94<br />
AND- human rights are not merely Western constructs ---universal human rights are minimal- every reasonable ethical or political theory agrees that the human rights violations that warrant intervention are intolerable.<br />
Fernando R. Teson 01, [Tobias Simon Eminent Scholar at Florida State University College of Law], &quot;The Liberal Case for Humanitarian Intervention&quot;, Public Law and Legal Theory Working Paper No. 39, November 2001. RFK<br />
Some object to the very project of using liberal political theory to address humanitarian intervention<br />
AND<br />
sovereignty under which foreigners are morally precluded from saving victims of extreme injustice.<br />
Part 2 is the Problem from Hell<br />
America’s response in an age of genocide has been shaped by a philosophy of realism that values state sovereignty over universal human rights---this has lead to a culture of inaction that makes massive rights violations inevitable<br />
Charlotte Hill 09, [Carl Wilkens Fellow with the Genocide Intervention Network, B.A. in Peace and Conflict Studies from UC Berkeley], &quot;Inaction through Tears: Realism and U.S. Policy on Genocide&quot;, 2009. RFK<br />
Regardless of the U.S. government’s strong condemnation of human rights abuses across<br />
AND<br />
future positions ¶ for government employees and reproducing and legitimating the realist framework.<br />
AND- the focus on sovereignty and borders have served as a mask for a racist Western agenda---we don’t care about Africa because it’s Rwanda’s problem, it’s Darfur’s problem, it’s someone else’s problem--- we MUST affirm the equal importance of all human rights because selective enforcement of human rights only perpetuates violence<br />
Shedrack C. Agbakwa 05, [Adjunct Professor of Law &amp; SSHRC Doctoral Fellow, Osgoode Hall Law School, Toronto, Canda], &quot;Genocidal Politics and Racialization of Intervention: From Rwanda to Darfur and Beyond&quot;, German Law Journal, Vol. 06 No. 2, 2005. RFK<br />
My answer to the question posed above (i.e. would international response<br />
AND<br />
international peace and security, the ¶ international community can ill afford it.<br />
AND- the US can no longer hide within its walls---human rights abuses in failed states breeds terrorism and causes global spillover which makes massive rights violations inevitable---humanitarian intervention is our only option<br />
David Vesel 04, [B.A. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and an M.A. from the University of Bath; editor of a volume on SEcurity Sector Reform in the Western Balkans for the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces], &quot;The Lonely Pragmatist: Humanitarian Intervention in an Imperfect World&quot;, B.Y.U. Journal of Public Law, Volume XVIII, 2003-2004. RFK<br />
The protections of state sovereignty do not give governments the right to act with impunity<br />
AND<br />
customary international law is emerging in support of humanitarian intervention in failing states.<br />
AND- claims to sovereignty can no longer be a barrier to humanitarian intervention---governments that don’t respect the rights of their citizens have no immunity<br />
Evans and Sahnoun 02, Gareth Evans [President and Chief Executive Officer of the international Crisis Group and former Foreign Minister of Australia] and Mohamed Sahnoun, [Special Adviser on Africa to the UN Secretary-General and a former senior Algerian diplomat], &quot;The Responsibility to Protect&quot;, Foreign Affairs, Vol. 81, No. 6, 2002. RFK<br />
The international community in the last decade repeatedly made a mess of handling the many<br />
AND<br />
be regarded as a de facto emerging norm: the responsibility to protect.<br />
Part 3: It is time to break down the walls---I advocate embracing an ethic of cosmopolitanism that prioritizes universal human rights over realist conceptions of sovereignty---we should be willing to step in in face of massive rights violations---only cosmopolitanism can reverse US hypocrisy and allow us to use our power for the good.<br />
Mary Kaldor 03, [British academic, currently Professor of Global Governance at the London School of Economics, where she is also the Director of its Centre for the Study of Global Governance], &quot;American Power: From 'Compellance' to Cosmopolitanism?&quot;, International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944-), Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 1-22. RFK<br />
At the heart of the cosmopolitan position is the notion that a new form of<br />
AND<br />
There is no such thing as democracy in one country any¶ longer.<br />
AND- technological improvements and diplomatic incentives ensure that humanitarian interventions can be carried out without unnecessary violence, casualties, ulterior motives, or eradicating sovereignty. Intervention does not have to be military intervention---we have multiple options and we should use them.<br />

III. LIMITED UNILATERAL HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION SHOULD BE LEGAL¶ Humanitarian intervention should be legal<br />
AND<br />
an effective balance between legitimate state sovereignty and the protection of human rights.<br />
AND- genocide is preventable---we need to make sure that genocide stops paying off<br />

My thesis is that genocide is preventable (as are political mass murders), because<br />
AND<br />

AND- the US is in a unique position to stop human rights abuses---massive improvements in military technology and diplomatic leverage make successful humanitarian intervention more feasible than ever---Kosovo and Libya prove<br />

The use of force always entails grave dangers and human costs, and progressives have<br />

There is no doubt that the moral case for humanitarian intervention is ¶ convincing.<br />

people more secure, ¶ if less intervention took place, not more.<br />

As the proliferation of conflicts in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East,<br />

the imperialistic¶ project it embodies is to finally come to an end.<br />
