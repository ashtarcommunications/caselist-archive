Conclusion
NextGen is faced with four major hurdles<span style="font-size: 8pt;">:</span>
Uncertainty Regarding NextGen~’s Benefits<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These is still disagreement among industry experts regarding to what extent NextGen can improve aviation. This is one of the reasons behind the failure to make a sufficient business case for operators to invest in on-board equipage.</span>
Uncertainty Regarding the FAA~’s Ability to Deliver. Even though a lack of strong political
AND
This uncertainty exacerbates the lack of incentives for operators to invest in equipage.
Securing funding for infrastructure. The AATF has relied on increasing general fund contributions in
AND
equitable long term funding mechanism for FAA~’s portion of NextGen~’s capital investment needs.
Equipage. Operators have shown little progress towards equipping their aircraft. This is primarily
AND
will eventually have to invest in equipage particularly if there are benefits involved.
