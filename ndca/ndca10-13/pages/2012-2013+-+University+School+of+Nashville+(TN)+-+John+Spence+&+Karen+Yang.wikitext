===<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Contention 1 is inherency:</span>===

===<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Contention 2 is the economy:</span>=== 
====<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Rail is facing collapse—but the plan boosts competitiveness and creates growth—dedicated funding sources are key</span>====
