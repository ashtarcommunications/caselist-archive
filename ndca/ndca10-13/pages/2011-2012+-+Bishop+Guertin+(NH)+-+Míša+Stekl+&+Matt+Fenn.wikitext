===<span style="font-size: 1.1em;">Dialectical Materialism K</span>=== 
**The failure of the Left**

**More than a century and a half ago, the intellectual climate in Germany collapsed into philosophy. German philosophers emphasized the transformative potential of ideas, and sought to emancipate themselves and politics through transformations in consciousness.**

**It was in this intellectual climate that Karl Marx emerged. His central thesis was that this philosophy of ideas not only distracted attention from the very real material conditions that structure our existence, but also made progressive social change impossible.**

**The insights of Karl Marx are perhaps even more pertinent today, when the liberal academy and intellectuals have begun to assert that discourse and performance are avenues for confronting oppressive power structures. This trend of the Left today is embodied in the affirmative’s politics, in their naïve and unproblematic endorsement of discourse as they desperately struggle to believe that what they have done in this debate is itself transformative and empowering.**

**Against this paralyzing politics, it is more important that ever to return to Marx, and to emphasize his insight that transformations in consciousness can never lead to social transformations—only struggling to transform the real material conditions that structure social relations can bring about social change**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Marx, 1845</span>**

**Unfortunately, Marx’s insight has been all but discarded by the new left, with its emphasis on being postmodern, postcolonial, poststructural, postMarxist, or post-anything. This post-al politics of the contemporary left focuses on discourse and language at the expense of analyzing real material conditions. This post-al logic is complicit with capitalism, especially insofar as it obscures the operation of political economy and the material reality of capitalism**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Zavarzadeh, Dept English @ Syracuse, 1994</span>**

**And, Criticism itself can never generate revolutionary action—they get stuck in utopian appeals or ethical gestures which mollifies us into avoiding practical, material action**

**And, their appeal to discourse negates the necessity of changing material conditions and is merely a self-righteous attempt of intellectuals to center themselves as a kind of hero, as the new subject of social change, over and opposed to those actually oppressed and disenfranchised**

**C) The alternative**

**Reject their assertion that discourse and performance can change material social realities.**
**We must return to Marx, recognizing that the only hope for human survival is a politics which engages in struggles to change material social relations rather than discursive attempts to change assumptions—any attempt to work within the system of capitalism is doomed to failure—our alternative is the only hope for human survival**

===<span style="line-height: 30px;">Deleuzoguattarian Queer Theory K</span>=== 

**The affirmative represents an obsession with space exploration and space-based hegemony, which employs myths of Manifest Destiny and the Final Frontier to fashion America in the mold of heteronormativity and reproductive futurism. These myths made themselves most evident in the space race of the 50s and 60s and were even reflected in works of fiction such as Star Trek.**

**Additionally, the politics of space are profoundly gendered – the discourse of exploration, development, and colonization reproduce heteronormative hierarchies and ensure the continuation of patriarchy in space. This too was embodied in the space race.**

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">It is this assumption that identity can be parceled into SECTIONS that only then can be understood as overlapping that reifies the very notions of sexual purity, which drive oppression and obscures structural inequality.</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We seek to use this discussion of space-based reproductive futurism as a springboard into a larger discussion of heteronormativity and the fascist within ourselves. The all-consuming desire to dominate space in the 50s and 60s was not a desire to lead but rather a desire to be lead by reproductive futurism. This desire to be lead is what Deleuze and Guattari call “fascism.” This fascism, however, takes place not on the level of the interpersonal collective but on the level of the individual.</span>**


**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Reproductive futurism and other forms of repression cannot function without someone to desire it to be so. Through the space race, the masses called not only for domination of the Other but also subordination of the Queerness, both symbolic and physical, of themselves. This internal desire for repression steals joy from existence and guarantees mass slaughter.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The alternative is to reject the affirmative for their exclusionary and representational strategy. Rather than challenging specific representations of identity we challenge the identity of representation itself. Our alternative, an affirmation of the minority identity of the Queer, is an echo of a larger struggle against the identification-based strategy of State Fascism. Our strategy solves oppression and can be politically effective; voting neg allows difference to speak rather than be spoken for.</span>**

**The ‘resolved’ nature of this debate begs the question: what exactly are we resolved about, and who is resolved? We will argue that under the alternative, there is no higher power to determine language for us, and rather than question what that language MEANS, we should question what it DOES. We should question what these political affirmations DO, not whether we can even discuss them. We believe no one should pay much attention to how we derived these ideas; instead they should focus on what those ideas DO.**

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Only our focus on pure difference rather than representations of difference allows for understandings of micropolitical fabric of larger institutional power structures. We are critical to develop effective strategies for broader social change, while the affirmative prevents us from breaking down hierarchies.</span>**

===<span style="line-height: 30px;">Fear of Death K</span>=== 
**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We begin this speech with the words of the eternal and all-powerful, not the mere mortals cited by the 1AC. Death, the Master of Life and Beyond, has spoken thus: I am the only certainty, feared by all in spite of my inevitability. The affirmative stands aligned with the zombie consciousness robots typical of human beings, “living” to sponge up the knowledge of others and perfect in order to defer Death. This is no way to live at all. Such participation in the stupid programmed zombie consciousness espoused by the 1AC is a voting issue for education</span>**

**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Death is a fantasy – our biology means we cannot truly “die” or cease to be, rather we enter a new form of becoming: becoming earth. Even if we are all wiped from the face of the earth in a hailstorm of nuclear bombs the process of life goes on even at the micro level. There is no unique warrant for why the biological construct of human deserves a place higher than the construct of atoms. This desire to be secure from death is the most personal level of microfascism that negates our ability to live life to its fullest and breeds ressentiment.</span>**

**Notions of preserving some sort of future for our species valorize reproductive, heterogenital sex, while subordinating queer sex to nothing more than “meaningless acrobatics.” This impregnates heterosexuality with the future of signification, necessitating violence against queerness.**

**The sacralization of the Child as an idol of reproductive futurism depends on the sacrifice of the queer. Privileging large scale impacts over the systemic violence outlined in our criticism is the kind of bankrupt rationale that legitimizes violence in the first place.**

**Our alternative is queer apocal(o)ptic/ism: this is the relentless problematization of the Symbolic, and all imagery and idolatry associated with reproductive futurism.

=====Discursive Ptx Link===== 

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The affirmative’s focus on the power of discursive political action represents an ideological embrace of the Otherization that occurs in the Symbolic Order; this allows the construction of linguistic social realities framed around heterogenital sexual fantasies that exclude the queer in an attempt to secure a future identical to the heteronormative narratives of the past</span>**

=====Overview vs Highland===== 
**We critique the affirmative’s discursive obsession with the future, and its characterization of everything as means to an end. Extend that their notions of some sort of discursive influence on politics excludes the queer because politics’ focus is necessarily the preservation of the future at all possible costs, which in turn necessitates heterogenital sex since this is the only type of sex capable of procreating. The futuristic nature of their discourse only reinforces this – by using the frame of language, or the Symbolic order, to influence the political sphere they necessitate a focus on an academic discourse that strengthens heteronorm**

In this passage, Simmons vividly describes the devastating pervasiveness ... erasure, marginalization, disempowerment, and oppression of sexual others.

=====Perm===== 

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. The permutation is a coercive universalization that, through reproductive futurism, places an ideological limit on queerness.

Reproductive futurism imposes, according to Edelman, 'an ideological limit on political discourse as such … thus holding the present to ransom. If it is invested in eschatology, it is only as a veneer to discipline those into enslavement to its ideals.

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">2. The permutation still links to the critique – queer temporality is an ateleological alternative that is by definition hostile to the chronological organization the affirmative hopes to combine it with.</span>**

In Edelman’s critique of culture, queerness occupies a temporality that extends no future. On the … seems to have, says Edelman, no social purpose whatsoever.

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">3. Queerness is the fundamental difference repressed by the Symbolic, the permutation attempts to tie this difference to its antithesis – telos. In other words, the transformative potential of our kritik is lost when it simply becomes a means to an end.</span>**

The apocalyptic logic used to bolster arguments for family values and to write laws against … antichrist demonstrates what post-structuralism has been insisting: meaning may not be what it seems. The queer antichrist defies certainty.

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">4. Incorporation of queerness into prescribed economies of signification is an act of domestication that denies queerness its transformative potential.</span>**
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Huffer, 2010.</span> (Lynne, Prof of Women’s Studies at Emory. Mad for Foucault: Rethinking the Foundations of Queer Theory. Pg.1)

The CP solves extinction – building a refuge protects humanity from nuclear war, social collapse, and all the other existential risks isolated in the 1AC. We have the technology now.

Hanson 7 (Robin Hanson, Department of Economics @ George Mason University; “Catastrophe, Social Collapse, and Human Extinction,” August 2007, [[http://hanson.gmu.edu/collapse.pdf]], pg. 11-12)



The counterplan protects humanity against //all// existential threats and is more cost-effective than the plan, which means it doesn’t link to politics
