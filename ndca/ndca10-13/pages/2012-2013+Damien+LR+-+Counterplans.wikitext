**The United States federal government should provide a substantial increase in its investment in an express-train infrastructure exclusively to areas in which private actors guarantee at least one-third of the funding upfront for a minimum of twenty years. In negotiating these partnerships, the United States federal government should open infrastructure plans to modification, including the possible transfer of project ownership to private actors. The United States federal government should make all necessary regulatory changes to encourage greater public-private partnerships in express-train infrastructure, and provide necessary technical assistance for implementation.**

**The net benefit is infrastructure accountability**

**Public investment is manipulated by project managers who cook the data to win project approval – exaggerates aff benefits and causes massive cost overruns, and means better projects lose out**

**The counterplan solves by doing less than the plan – the only projects that will be built are those that can secure private sector capital. This increases accountability in infrastructure design and reduces overall costs**
