==<span style="font-size: 8pt;">**1AC Automobility** </span>== 



The topic of transportation focuses on the "infrastructure investment" that lavishes billions and billions of dollars for highway infrastructure which ultimately serves to isolate along lines of race and class

Karyn <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Rotker</span>, 20<span style="font-size: 14pt;">07</span> (Attorney of Law, Poverty & Race 16.5, " Transportation: Regional Equity & Environmental Justice", http://search.proquest.com/docview/210339531 :)


<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In August, 2007,… …reconstruction and widening. </span>


This network of infrastructure kills space as a living area, dividing and hierarchizing it and making us further rooted in automobility in an attempt to spatially fix these cracks.

This ultimately destroys the experience of space between destination as a pursuit of speed in the same way the ideology of automobility destroys a personal relationship to education and the other.

John <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Urry</span>, Professor of Sociology and Director of the Centre for Mobilities Research, Lancaster University; Edited by Steffen Böhm, Campbell Jones, Chris Land, and Matthew Paterson; “Inhabiting the car,” in “Against Automobility,” The Editorial Board of the Sociological Review 20<span style="font-size: 12pt;">06</span>, p.21-22


<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Simmel makes points rather than miles (1998).</span>



Automobility ultimately culminates in the objectification and depersonalization of the world

(Joshua <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fischel</span>, Senior Project Manager at Thomson Reuters, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2011</span> “EDUCATION AFTER MODERNITY: DEWEY, DAVIDSON, AND THE PROSPECTS FOR OVERCOMING DIREMPTION”)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Unlike</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the “alienation </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Hegel called love. </span>




The separation and depersonalization of the car causes a state of diremption in which the world as seen as dead or other. This separation is internalized to prevent social interaction and understanding that in turn forms the basis and meaning of life.

(Joshua <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fischel</span>, Senior Project Manager at Thomson Reuters, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2011</span> “EDUCATION AFTER MODERNITY: DEWEY, DAVIDSON, AND THE PROSPECTS FOR OVERCOMING DIREMPTION”)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But let’s take a closer look at what happens when we emerge from a condition of diremption to a condition of love. Friedrich Hegel’s early essay … overcome this alienation. </span>


All policy debates that focus on the construction of new better transportation infrastructure within the current framework inevitably prioritize speed and mobility thus reemploying already failing values

(Zack <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Furness</span>, Columbia College Chicago Department of Humanities, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2010,</span> one less car chapter 3)

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Roads are technologies…</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> participatory public spaces. </span>


Thus we affirm. Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States.



Our affirmation is not one of instrumental rationality, but rather as an opportunity to rethink transportation infrastructure by discussing alternate modes of mobility. We think that affirming should not be limited to implementation, but rather should be expanded to its full capacity for possibility.



By radically rethinking mobility we make room for new alternatives that can break free from the current system of automobility as well break the current chokehold of automobility on politics. Even the affirmation of our radical politics in the single instance creates the potential for new understandings of political explorations and desires.

Our break in the construction of transportation infrastructure as only for cars is one that creates a transformative shift from the externalized dynamic of diremption to a less mediated engagement with the world

(Zack <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Furness</span>, Columbia College Chicago Department of Humanities, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2010,</span> one less car chapter 3)

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Bicycling, in .. one dreams of feeling </span>



Governmental support of transportation infrastructure is essentially an excuse to expand the influence of car culture in America. This functions as an unquestionable narrative used to prop up the interests of corporations. It is our job to question and rethink this narrative.

This narrative of automobility is one that silences non-automotive transportation via literary exclusion and use of associative pejorative stereotypes, ultimately perpetuating oppression and violence. By calling into question the role of the automobile in society we allow for a new framing of this relationship

(Zack <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Furness</span>, Columbia College Chicago Department of Humanities, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2010,</span> one less car chapter 5)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This case is … </span>privileged over others<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

The violence enacted through cars has been normalized through the obfuscation of environmental impacts and the linguistic use of accidents. The focus on politically mandated “issues” fundamentally ignores the structural violence induced by cars. Normalized violence from cars is greater than that of both nuclear weapons and terrorism.

(John <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bly</span>, Senior Project Manager at Honeywell, May <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2011</span>, http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/9866/Bly,%20John%20-%20Spring%20'11.pdf?sequence=1)

===1AC Berkeley=== 

**This topic asks the wrong questions about the wrong things. Our current ideological system supported within the context of policy debate is one that serves to perpetuate and justify the system of automobility both as a physical process as well as an ideological construct**
(Zack <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Furness</span>, Columbia College Chicago Department of Humanities, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2010,</span> one less car chapter 3)
Roads are technologies that play a fundamental role in the system of automobility, both
AND
for the twinned purpose of promoting bicycling and creating more participatory public spaces.

**The choice of automobility as the primary deployment strategy for transportation infrastructure is not one that arises from an innate desire for freedom or out unbiased policy analysis. Automobility represents the ultimately most biased and most constrained model of anti-democratic decision making.**
(Zack <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Furness</span>, Columbia College Chicago Department of Humanities, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2010,</span> one less car chapter 1)
The historical transformation of the United States into a full-blown car culture is
AND
by the profit imperatives of very specific and very powerful institutions and organizations.


**The political space claimed by automobility is one of exclusion and restriction. These processes inevitably occur in the name of efficiency and mobility. In the same way the public space of education and community within debate has been destroyed by the continued pursuit of the best policy for the greatest number.**
(John <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bly</span>, Senior Project Manager at Honeywell, May <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2011</span>, http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/9866/Bly,%20John%20-%20Spring%20'11.pdf?sequence=1)
Since the arrival of the automobile, roads have produced a long history of exclusion
AND
threats, police tickets for impeding trafﬁc, car crashes, and death.

**The politics of automobility creates an alienation from the world that isolates and objectifies reality. This commodification through a system of “competition” is one that separates the world into privatized capsules. Critical mass forms a fundamental challenge to this dynamic.**
(Joshua <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fischel</span>, Doctor of Philosophy, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2011</span> “EDUCATION AFTER MODERNITY: DEWEY, DAVIDSON, AND THE PROSPECTS FOR OVERCOMING DIREMPTION”)
Unlike the “alienation of automobility,” bicycling slows the world down such that “
AND
together the shared world that people participate together in what Hegel called love.

**This isolation from the world has several consequences- It makes it impossible to understand the suffering of the other thus destroying any system of ethics, it creates a kill to survive and kill to profit mentality which justifies the creation of technologies of mass destruction, it also makes us willingly complicit in a system that destroys for no purpose.**
(Joshua <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Fischel,</span> Doctor of Philosophy, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">2011</span> “EDUCATION AFTER MODERNITY: DEWEY, DAVIDSON, AND THE PROSPECTS FOR OVERCOMING DIREMPTION”)
2 Alone and isolated from others, one becomes indifferent to the world. This
AND
population increase of ninety million (Orr, 1992, p. 3).¶


**The view of education through a lens of automobility- that is the separation of self from value in the name of efficiency and progress is one that turns the earth into a standing reserve to be exploited and used in the name of these values. This culminates in apathy and the destruction of the biosphere.**
(Joshua <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fischel</span>, Doctor of Philosophy, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2011</span> “EDUCATION AFTER MODERNITY: DEWEY, DAVIDSON, AND THE PROSPECTS FOR OVERCOMING DIREMPTION”)
We’ve gotten to this point, Orr continues, not through ignorance, but in
AND
the so-called natural world is simultaneously a form of social domination.

**The politics of automobility exists within a self-justifying framework of exclusivity. The impacts of the system are externalized and buried while other political priorities and concerns are pushed as more important so as to maintain the current system. Policy justifications serve as little more than the endless perpetuation of a violent system.**
(Jeff <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Ferrell</span>, Ph.D. in sociology U of T Austin, 03/20<span style="font-size: 13pt;">11</span>, http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/culturalcriminology/files/2011/03/chap22-jf-speed-kills.pdf)
All of which raises some other troubling questions of statistics, and politics, and
AND
executives still manufactures fast-moving machineries of death (Burns ¶ 1998).

**We affirm transportation infrastructure as a temporary autonomous zone. This creates radical encounters and moments of insurrection, like that of critical mass. Critical mass is resistance in the street, fleeting anarchy, disruption of traffic and is a literal break of automobility, there is no single individual who commands or creates this insurrection, and rather the formation occurs from a gradual accumulation of resistors.**

**Our affirmation is not a question of direct revolution against the state or automobility, but rather an instance of insurrection in which we block the normative traffic of debate and create a temporary autonomous zone. This temporary autonomous zone is ephemeral and fleeting thus functioning as a celebration against automobility which creates a crucial break and allows for the imagination and realization of alternatives.**
(Garrett Thomas <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dahl</span>, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, August 200<span style="font-size: 13pt;">9</span>, [[http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Dahl%20Garrett%20Thomas.pdf?ohiou1251231748]])
The Critical Mass alters the meaning of the urban landscape through creating a ¶ “
AND
for new possibilities in the realm of social movement ¶ collective identity formation.

**Revolution is a lie. The notion that social movements exist as a transformative struggle for progress ultimately reifies and creates the same oppressive systems they claim to have overthrown. True autonomy only exists in the moment of insurrection- the timeless place around which history and the state have no control.**
(Hakim <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bey</span>, Anarchist, 19<span style="font-size: 13pt;">85</span>, The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism, [[http://hermetic.com/bey/taz_cont.html]])
Uprising, or the Latin form insurrection, are words used by historians to label
AND
? The point is not to change consciousness but to change the world.

**Obviously voting affirmative does not fix or end the problems of automobility. Our argument it that by resisting the politics of automobility through our affirmation of critical mass, we embody a resistance to these systems of power that sees alternative modes of being as possible if temporary. This resistance is in itself empowering**
