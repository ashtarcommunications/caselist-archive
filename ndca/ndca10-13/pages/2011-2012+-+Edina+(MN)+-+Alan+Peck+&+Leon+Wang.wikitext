Cooperation

Contention 1 – international cooperation

This is the second of two [...] national nuclear forces to operate safely.


Strong US space leadership is vital to space cooperation with Russia and China – it will spill over into broader areas of cooperation—cooperating with China solves space militarization, prevents a moon race
Mindell et al ’08 – Director of the Space, Policy, and Society Research Group of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (David, “The Future of Human Spaceflight” Report of the Space, Policy, and Society Research Group, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, December 2008, http://web.mit.edu/mitsps/MITFutureofHumanSpaceflight.pdf)

In spite of these difficulties, [...] future we wish for our progeny?



Industrial base

Contention 2 – the industrial base
