“Rape worse then death rhetoric” causes dehumanization, a loss of value to life, creates the victims to literally becoming the living dead, and massive death-rhetoric is the key question-shapes policy and victimization-we must try to help the people who are raped instead of creating policy for policy sake we should try to help the victims

It is impossible to answer the question if rape is worse then death-their policies are doomed to failure-thus the alternative: Reject the affirmative’s “rape worse then death” rhetoric. The alternative is key to valuing womyn, the alt is a pre req to successful policy action.

<span class="UnderlineNon-bold"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Defense officials will continue</span></span> to study the physiological and environmental effects <span class="UnderlineNon-bold"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">of depleted uranium</span></span>, Kilpatrick said. Data suggests the substance in other than extreme cases <span class="UnderlineNon-bold"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is rather harmless, and the military will continue using DU munitions in its arsenal. "It is a superior armor, it a superior munitions that we will continue to use if the need is there to attack armor</span></span>," he said. <span class="UnderlineNon-bold"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Asked if DU will be used if the United States goes to war </span></span>with Iraq, <span class="UnderlineNon-bold"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Naughton said, "If we use Abrams tanks, we don't have much choice</span></span>."

4.Turn-focusing on the use of Depleted Uranium by the United States obscures the proliferation and use of Depleted Uranium by Russia, Pakistan, and other governments-voting neg is the only way to solve the problem

Depleted uranium (DU) weapons: <span class="UnderlineNon-bold"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Canada is the world’s top exporter of uranium</span></span>. Our government pretends that Canada’s uranium is sold for “peaceful” purposes only, but absolutely nothing is done to stop the US from using <span class="UnderlineNon-bold"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">DU in their weapons</span></span>. America’s A-10 Wart Hog warplanes have fired DU munitions <span class="UnderlineNon-bold"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq</span></span>, while each cruise missile contains three kgs of DU ballast. Providing RADARSAT data: Eagle Vision, a US Air Force mobile ground station, ­which controls Canada’s RADARSAT-1 satellite and downlinks its data­, <span class="UnderlineNon-bold"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">was used from the start of the Iraq War</span></span>.
