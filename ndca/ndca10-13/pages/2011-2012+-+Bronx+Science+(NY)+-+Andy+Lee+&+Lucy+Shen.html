The 2007test demonstrated that the importance of space capabilities is also their Achilles heel, that is, their deadly weakness in spite of overall strength; it is far too easy to neutralize space systems and their power. In the broad strategic context, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">space capabilities have their own set of unique, inherent </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">vulnerabilities, which are largely the result of orbital mechanics. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">This </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">invites destruction, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">damage, and even just mischief delivered by even the least significant adversary</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. However, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">other nations may seek to deny U.S. advantages in space through a variety of negation and prevention actions. Negation Threats Satellite systems consist not only of spacecraft, each with their own payload and bus, but also a supporting infrastructure—ground control stations, tracking and control links, commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&amp;C) links, data links, launch facilities, and an industrial base</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">Each of these components is at risk to threats of physical and cyber attack, and sabotage, and can be negated, simultaneously or each in detail. The satellite payload, bus, links, and infrastructure can be negated by using a variety of permanent or reversible means to achieve one of the five possible effects, known as the ‘‘five Ds’’—deception, disruption, denial, degradation, and destruction.5 Space-based threats proliferate as a result of the ever-growing global availability of technology and access to the space domain. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">There are huge incentives for states to invest in and use space , and the spread of space technologies has occurred. States with sufficient resources can now reach out to space and ‘‘touch’’ satellites through a variety of means, and achieve one and even more of the five Ds. Spacecraft are vulnerable to direct ascent weapons as demonstrated by the Chinese ASAT test, and to a variety of other groundbased, airborne, and space-based ASAT technologie</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">s</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. Direct-ascent launched, or orbit-based nuclear devices, can be detonated, generating radiation and other lethal effects to destroy unshielded electronics over a wide lethal range. Co-orbital ASATs could be employed, comparable to the old Soviet system that was tested extensively in the 1970s and early 80s. In a less likely scenario, space-borne mines can also be deployed in close proximity to spacecraft, or exploded to generate debris clouds that destructively engage whole classes of satellites in the same orbital plane or in crossing orbits. Ground, space-based, or airborne lasers could be used by adversaries to wreak havoc. Blinding operations could be executed and inflict effects ranging from temporary ‘‘dazzling’’ to permanent burnout of optical or other sensors with intense energy bursts. Ground systems, supporting communications, and their nodes, are vulnerable to diverse land, sea, or air kinetic attacks, including sabotage. Unprotected systems are also susceptible to electronic attack through jamming and electromagnetic deception techniques. Jammers emit signals that mask or prevent reception of desired signals; these methods can disrupt uplinks, downlinks, and even cross-links. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">By disabling the means of command and control, and data communications, jammers render satellites inoperable or unavailable. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Electromagnetic deception techniques can be employed to confuse systems; this could include sending false, but deceptively plausible, commands that cause spacecraft to perform damaging or wasteful maneuvers, modify databases or execute configuration changes, or otherwise destroy it. Similarly, supporting terrestrial ground stations, computer networks, and links are vulnerable to information operation and cyber attacks. These attacks could involve directing global denial of service tasks, injecting fake commands, malicious software and viruses into the space system, performing unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of sensitive information (data interception), and causing unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of network information, services, and databases. In sum, there is a wide span of kinetic and other types of attacks an adversary could consider and employ. There is potential that even non-state actors can access some of these technologies and space systems, and achieve several of the five Ds; however, it is unlikely they can obtain and then employ a full-spectrum of these means and achieve all of these effects. Conducting an attack within the space domain involves a rather substantial investment to develop, acquire, operate, and sustain needed shooter, sensor, and command and control systems. Given the scope and commitment needed to affect such a move, an on-orbit attack would probably be made only in the context of a larger strategic struggle, perhaps as a prelude to or part of early combat operations. On the other hand, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">inexpensive jamming technology is available to even the poorest potential adversaries.As such, jamming poses the most used and growing threat to space systems.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Some argue that jamming also carries with it implicit political and legal sanctions since no major space power has moved to ban or make even temporary and reversible jamming illegal. This may change now that a number of nations have banned together to object to recent Iranian satellite jamming.6 Cyber adversaries and criminals are also beginning to hone their craft. They present an evolving threat to space systems; and like jamming, cyber threats can be developed and deployed for only modest investments. Prevention Threats Prevention actions generally involve economic, political, informational, and diplomatic instruments of national power. For example, an extremely large creditor nation could employ its considerable economic clout and leverage in an attempt to compel or blackmail the United States to not license or permit imaging of its territory, preventing its use, and reducing its exposure to such observation. The creditor nation could seek to accomplish its objective by destabilizing the world market place. It could refuse to purchase treasury offerings that underpin the burgeoning U.S. fiscal and trade deficits, perhaps arguing that remote sensing, especially commercial remote sensing, of its territory infringes on its territorial and sovereign rights, or that it constitutes ‘‘unlawful’’ industrial espionage, and is thus, an unfair trade practice.7 Commercial remote sensing systems are nowan important resource for the United States Government and its national security needs. U.S. Government orders help sustain and stabilize the remote sensing industry,8 and any limitations on activities, whether for U.S. Government customers or commercial ones, imposed in response to external economic threats could evolve to cause problems. In an alternative scenario, a state, acting through political allies and proxies, could exert considerable influence and dominance to affect a change in U.S. law. This change could restrict licensing of commercial remote sensing imagery, restricting the market place and impacting business models for producers.9 As a diplomatic prevention example, adversaries could attempt to use international forums and treaties to deny frequency rights needed by U.S. military or intelligence satellites by making spurious ‘‘paper satellite’’ filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ‘‘Paper satellites’’ involve ITU applications for satellite orbital slots, many for ‘‘speculative’’ systems that will never leave Earth. These filings can block access to scarce spectrum and orbital resources.10 The ability to place communications and other satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) positions could be held at risk. Some characterize some of these types of actions as a form of ‘‘lawfare.’’ ‘‘The term lawfare describes the growing use of international law claims, usually factually or legally meritless, as a tool of war. The goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion, and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals.’’11 Prevention actions taken to hobble U.S. space systems are not armed attacks. As is discussed later, the use of force is only authorized under the United Nations (UN) Charter in response to an armed attack, or upon authorization of the UN Security Council. As such, using armed force to deter and defeat prevention actions involving political or diplomatic subterfuge or intrigue may be unlawful under international law. Creative alternative solutions must therefore be found to assure access to space when facing these types of threats. Implications for U.S. Space Strategy </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">The wide span of threats poses profound implications for U.S. space strategy and its execution</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">First</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">unlike the Cold War era, t</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">he U</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">nited </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">S</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">tates </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">now confronts a wide array of global actors, all operating with different motivations and incentives, some of which could become potential adversaries who can attack or threaten space capabilities. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">These state and non-state adversaries exhibit a wide array of political, economic, technical, and social differences</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">Having many potential adversaries makes each of them harder to understand</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. This complicates efforts to understand motivations and to influence perceptions for deterrence purposes. These differences</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">, in turn, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">increase the likelihood of misperceptio</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">n, undercutting strategies to protect access to space capabilities</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. When one’s attention is divided, deterrent measures that are appropriate for one target may not be useful, or even counterproductive, for another. This requires tailored intelligence efforts, information operations, and transparency efforts in order to avoid or minimize disputes and prevent problems. Second, the broad array of adversaries exhibit widely varying risk-taking behaviors. Risk-taking behavior can strongly influence an adversary’s perception of a situation. Understanding this phenomenon can lead to better ways of influencing those perceptions. Unfortunately, potentialadversaries may not care that space systems offer tremendous value and capabilities to all nations,or care whether conflict in space could create space debris that could cost all nations access to the domain. A strategy to assure continuing access to space assets must therefore be sufficiently flexible to address both risk-averse and risk-taking adversaries. Indeed, potential adversaries may shift from risk-taking to risk-adverse over a relatively short period of time. China</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline"> may </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">fit in this category. Within a decade or two, it will have its own extensive space-based communications, navigation, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellite constellations, all of which will be integrated into its military operations. No doubt, China will embrace that evolution and become very reliant on space capabilities; this will shift it from an asymmetric competitor to one similar to the United States or Russia. Third, with the demise of the Soviet Union, some political commentators and critics described the United States as a ‘‘hyperpower’’ not just a ‘‘superpower.’’ 12 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">Though buffeted by recent events involving Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, and the 2008 global financial meltdown,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">U.S. military supremacy</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline"> continues.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> But, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">that supremacy does </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">not make or guarantee a successful space strategy. Adversaries may believe they have a higher stake than the United S</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">tates </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">in the outcome of a particular crisis or conflict. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">Alternatively, the United States stake in the crisis may not be commensurate with the possible cost of involvement by the United States military and the rest of its national security apparatus. The first alternative may encourage mischief by adversaries; the second discourages U.S. action. As a result, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">adversaries may find threats of U.S. action in response to hostile acts affecting U.S. access to space systems to be non-credible. Fourth, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">while </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the U</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">nited </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">S</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">tates </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">has</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline"> produced superlative space capabilities, it has </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">not produced enough systems ready to survive the new kinetic, exotic, jamming, and cyber threat environment</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> The vulnerability exists because the spacecraft developed and deployed today are in many ways the same as those originally fielded during the Cold War. During that epic struggle, there was a tacit and then explicit understanding that each superpower would not attack and overwhelm the other’s space systems, except in the dire st of circumstances, perhaps during the throes of a nuclear conflagration. Indeed, a number of agreements between the superpowers adopted the understanding and ruled out interference with national technical means, including space assets. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">This </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">belief in the superiority of space systems and power blinds the U</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">nited </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">S</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">tates </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">to the inherent strategic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in these systems. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">This,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> predictably, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">can </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">now be exploited by potential adversaries, such as China, who</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">, with their recent ASAT test, appear more </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">willing to fully explore the technologies needed to expand the limits of conventional war to include the space domain. Consequently, by historically and diplomatically reducing the threat, engineering of some satellite threat detection, attack avoidance, and other defense subsystems have not matured enough so that they are sophisticated, nimble, and robust enough to counter new 21st Century adversary attack capabilities.</span><br />

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">PLA authors credit the U.S. with having the most advanced capabilities in the areas of kinetic energy weapons, particle beam weapons, and directed energy. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">The PLA does have various forms of jamming capability, and has done a lot of work on the concept of colliding space bodies.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> The dilemma here for the military theorists or planner in the U.S., is that this is really space science and rocket science. Although Chinese military theory, basic research, and applied research into these areas are transparent, the successes or weapons systems that may become formal programs are not transparent. Regardless of whether the algorithms are correct or not</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">, it </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">is clear that the PLA is serious about space warfare</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">. The destruction of their own weather satellite and the </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">blinding of a U.S. satellite mean</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> they are </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">achieving</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> some </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">success.PLA theorists think that internal lines of communication are most favorable for successful military operations, whether the offense, defense, or maintaining a logistics chain.79 They see internal lines as superior to the conduct of military operations on external lines.80 The Chinese</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> see their regional position in Asia as superior to that of the U.S. because the U.S. has to fight, communicate, and re-supply along extended exterior lines, while China enjoys interior lines of communication within the range of its aircraft, missiles, and submarine fleet. This means that in a conflict, they </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">would</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> probably </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">use their jamming and antisatellite systems to disrupt American lines of communication, command and control, situational awareness, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">and efforts at coordination at the extended ranges of military conflict for the U.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">S.81 One of the most disruptive things the PLA could do, therefore, would be to neutralize the U.S. ability to use tracking and data relay satellites, which provide the global, real time sensor and communications capabilities for network centric operations. The PLA believes that the U.S. is heavily dependent on its satellite systems, more dependent than the PLA. That is changing, however. As the PLA modernizes its own Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4SIR) systems, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">it is becoming as dependent on space and information systems as the U.S. Therefore, its policies of space control and space deterrence for military purposes are no longer forms of asymmetric warfare. Rather, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">the contest will be over which force can most effectively disrupt the other’s military operations. Space warfare will likely become an integral part of traditional conflict. The Implications of Attacks on Reconnaissance Satellites One problem that begs an answer is whether the PLA is considering the implications of exercising the capabilities it is developing. That is, when researchers consider a form of space warfare, or develop capabilities to be applied in space weapons, are there also PLA officers in the policy or war planning sphere thinking through the implications of employing that capability? If not, an incident could quickly escalate and get out of control, leading to an exchange of weapons</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> or a deeper crisis. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">For example, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">four officers from the PLA’s Second Artillery Command College,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> in Wuhan, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">have published an analysis of how to jam or destroy the space-based ballistic missile advanced warning systems of the U.S</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.82 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 5pt;">In their article, the officers note, ‘‘a space borne missile early warning system will play a pivotal role in future space wars.’’83 They set out the capabilities and parameters of the U.S. Defense Support Program (DSP) early warning satellites, including the geosynchronous orbits of the satellite sets, their axis of look, the infrared bands they cover, and their shortcomings. The authors discuss how to destroy the U.S. DSP satellites with other satellites, ground-based lasers, or direct ascent weapons.84 They also have a discussion of how to jam the satellites, their satellite-to-ground transmissions, or to camouflage the infrared radiation emitted by a missile to make it more difficult for the warning satellite to detect an attack.85 In their conclusion, the authors find that maintaining a strategic ballistic missile capability is a powerful deterrent to prevent the U.S. from launching a large scale military attack or intervention aimed at China’s own military operations on its southeast coast, i.e., to intervene in Chinese military operations against Taiwan.86 Their view is that ‘‘destroying and jamming space borne missile early warning systems not only can paralyze such anti-missile systems, but also will help us [the PRC] win the war in space.’’87 The PLA is also aware of the most advanced U.S. synthetic aperture radar imaging systems and are thinking through how to neutralize or jam them.88</span> <span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">The problem in this reasoning is that there is no consideration given to a likely American reaction to the disruption of its missile early warning systems. One possible reaction by </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">the U.S. is that it might well think it is coming under immediate attack and launch its own strike </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">against China’s strategic missile forces</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 5pt;">Another reasonable reaction by U.S. forces might be to strike the source of the Chinese attack, particularly if it came from a ground based laser or direct ascent launch. Even if such a reaction by the U.S. used conventional weapons, the PLA may find it has created a deeper crisis that led to an American strike on Chinese soil. These four PLA authors do not seem to have considered the ramifications of their own research. Space Deterrence Space power theorists, like Cai, advocate the ability to control parts of space for limited periods. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 5pt;" class="BoldUnderline">Huang Zhicheng, in reaction to U.S. Air Force Space Command manual</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 5pt;"> AFM 2–2.1, Space Warfare and Countermeasures, develops the concept further, advocating a regime of ‘‘space deterrence’’ to counter American space superiority. 89 For Huang, this shift toward space deterrence mirrors a trend in U.S. space theory.90 Huang defines this as ‘‘the use of strong aerospace power to create or demonstrate a threat to an opponent’s space power to deter that opponent in a practical way.’’91 The goal of this concept of deterrence is to increase the PLA’s power in weapons systems, information gathering, and command and control to improve national warning systems in China, create fear in an adversary, and degrade the adversary’s power.92 The key to achieving this level of deterrence, according to Huang, is to concentrate one’s own economic, military, and science and technology power to ‘‘ruin an opponent’s economy and ability to function in space.’’93 The intention behind the December 2006 blinding of a U.S. satellite by a Chinese laser and the 11 January 2007 destruction of a Chinese weather satellite by the PLA’s own direct ascent kill vehicle is clear when interpreted through this concept of demonstrating space deterrence.94 As Huang concedes, for a deterrent to be credible, one must demonstrate the capability. A deterrent must be demonstrated. It is also important to note that effective space deterrence, as conceived by this writer, includes crippling attacks on information networks and C4SIR systems. In the future, there could be other examples of space deterrence to let the U.S. and other countries know that they do not have free reign in space or over China. The PLA could demonstrate various forms of jamming. In doing so, the PLA would conduct operational tests of the work being done on jamming synthetic aperture radar satellites. Chinese journals do discuss maneuvering space bodies to intersect in orbit. This type of maneuvering lends itself to accidental collisions between space bodies. China could deny the hostile intent of such accidents, but they still would demonstrate a space deterrent capability. Conclusions There are a number of important findings to this research effort. First,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> in the event of conflict</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> with the PLA, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">military operations carried out across all the domains of wa</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">r, ground, sea, air, space, and the electromagnetic spectrum, or information- and cyber-warfare, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">are likely. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">Any military operations in space will be part of a more coordinated cyber or information attack on an enemy’s knowledge and command systems</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Second, there will probably be strategic warning, even if there is operational or tactical surprise, in any future conflict between China and the U.S. Prior to direct conflict, the PLA and the Central Military Commission will likely justify any of its actions by conducting what it calls legal warfare.95 Third, the concept of legal warfare will be applied by the PRC Foreign Ministry, the security services, Chinese Communist Party liaison Department, and the PLA to exploit political divisions in the U.S. over nuclear testing and space-based weapon systems. Fourth, the PLA will seek to exercise space control in a limited area of conflict. The PLA will probably observe the internationally accepted definitions of commons in space, over 100,000 m, in peacetime. If direct conflict breaks out, altitude limits on space control are off, and any systems carrying adversary military traffic or signals are probably fair game for the PLA. U.S. Navy Secretary Donald Winter, on a visit to Australia in August 2007, said that the U.S. still wants to understand what the Chinese intention is in its military modernization.96 This concern over how China will engage in military operations in space is really about intentions</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">. There are a number of China’s activities and policy positions coming from Beijing that make it hard to interpret Chinese intent. Among these are: China’s expansive territorial claims, combined with periodic incidents of the use of armed force to reinforce these claims;97 the justification for extending the territorial claims of China into the reaches of outer space</span> <span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 5pt;">outlined in this paper; and the shaping of the ‘‘space battlefield’’ with legal arguments that would justify China’s actions to prevent space observation over its territory. The U.S. has taken a course with China that is far different from the isolationist and confrontational approach with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both states are heavily involved in trade, economic, and political engagements with each other. Nonetheless, both states are wary of the potential for conflict with the other, and there exist some deep fundamental differences of national interest. Whether one is a proponent of arms control agreements or not, the dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over arms control and treaties produced a body of mutual understanding that holds up today. The U.S. and the Soviet Union seemed to realize that it is potentially destabilizing to define the upper limits of sovereignty. Thus, neither country interfered with the other’s free passage in space. Also, they agreed that the ability to conduct strategic verification from space stabilized the nuclear balance</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 5pt;" class="BoldUnderline">.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> No</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> such </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">dialogue has taken place with China</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. The PLA has either ignored or rebuffed American efforts at such a dialogue</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">. Often, senior military or Chinese Communist Party leaders have told Americans that to engage in such a dialogue is an example of a cold war mentality</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.98 Yet discussions on these issues are important to clarify the rationales for America’s positions on space and serve as threat reduction measures. Although China’s intentions are not fully known, they can be inferred from Chinese actions, like </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">the attack on a U.S. satellite with a laser and the destruction of its own weather satellite as a demonstration of capability</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. PRC intentions can also be inferred from judicious reviews of its military literature. By observing the military capabilities China is acquiring and reading its military literature</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">, it is clear that China’s leaders are preparing as though they may have to fight the U.S</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. To this end, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">the PLA is busily preparing the space battlefield in advance with legal arguments, as called for in its doctrine. As a result, there are very sound reasons to prepare to defend American interests in space, to engage in mutual threat reduction measures, and to pursue programs that will ensure that the U.S. military will have access to space in any future conflict.</span><br />

<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The risk of crisis instability and miscalc is high – the PLA is isolated from the Chinese government</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span class="AuthorDate">MacDonald 11</span></span></strong> <span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">–[ Senior Director, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program, U.S. Institute of Peace (Bruce, CQ Congressional Testimony, “MILITARY AND CIVIL SPACE PROGRAMS IN CHINA”, 5/11, lexis]</span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">One characteristic of too many wars in the last century is that they arethe result of miscalculation that ignites the tinder of fundamental geopolitical tensions. Averting major power conflict requires skillful management of tensions by senior leaders of the major powers. China has become much more internationally sophisticated, though with important exceptions, in its dealings with the rest of the world than has been true in the past, and this is reflected in its civilian leadership. Unfortunately, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">the PLA's senior officer corps </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">trails its civilian counterparts in this respect. They </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">have much less interaction with foreign official and travel abroad much less frequently than their U.S. counterparts. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">This means that </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">the PLA overall views world events from a less knowledgeable and sophisticated perspective, a danger in this increasingly complex world, and could explain</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, for example, the political &quot;tonedeafness&quot; of the PLA in the manner they conducted </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">their 2007 ASAT test.This PLA problem becomes more serious when one realizes that </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the PLA is organizationally separate from the rest of the Chinese government</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">, and reports only to the Central Military Commission,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> currently chaired by President Hu Jintao. President Hu, and his likely successors, have no significant military background, and </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">the majority of the CMC's members are top PLA officers, suggesting that </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">civilian oversight of major military decisions and consideration of their larger implications are not as carefully reviewed as in the U.S. governmen</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">t</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; text-decoration: none;">. Normally this would not be too great a concern,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> but in a crisis this could be dangerous. Add to this the fact that China has no equivalent of our National Security Council, a critically important body for coordinating our security decisionmaking, and one comes away concerned about the relative insularity of the PLA in the Chinese power structure. In a crisis, the PLA probably cannot be counted on to show as sophisticated a sense of judgment as one would hope any country's military leaders, even an enemy's, to show. All these problems and many more pose potential threats to internal political stability andCommunist Party control, providing ample opportunity for crisis and conflict in the years ahead. Overview of The Strategic Landscape of Space Space assets, and the communications and cyber links that enable them to function, are the means by which essential national security information is either generated, transmitted, or both. This information is the lifeblood of U.S. conventional military superiority and plays a key role in U.S. strategic nuclear posture as well. As such, these space related assets represent extraordinarily appealing targets in any future conflict, and their relative vulnerability can provide dangerously attractive incentives in a crisis to preempt, escalating to war. Resisting this temptation to attack may be morally virtuous but could be strategically unwise:going first in a space conflict with a nearpeer space adversary appears to offer many advantages, while absorbing such a strike, with all its attendant destruction of military capabilities, and then responding to the attack against an opponent fully expecting such a response, appears to be militarily and strategically quite undesirable.As technology advances, the ways of interfering with, disrupting, or destroying information streams in space or supporting space systems will likely increase</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">, as will U.S. and others' dependence upon such systems.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Providing defensive options for U.S. space assets should be pursued where appropriate, but most space observers believe that offense has the advantage in space over defense, as General Cartwright observed last May. Cartwright also noted that the challenging issues that space poses has made the Space Posture Review &quot;the most difficult of all the defense reviews&quot; the Obama Administration has undertaken. The overall U.S. goal in space should be to shape the space domain to the advantage of the United States and its allies, and to do so in ways that are stabilizing and enhance U.S. and allied security. The United States has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival, and function of its space assets so that the profound military, civilian, and commercial benefits they enable can continue to be available to the United States and its allies. This need not mean that China and others must perforce be disadvantaged by such an arrangement - there should be ample opportunity for many countries to benefit and prosper from a properly crafted system of space management. There is an inherent risk of strategic instability when relatively modest defense efforts create disproportionate danger to an adversary, as with space offense. And there is a serious risk of crisis instability in space </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">when &quot;going first&quot; pays off - destroying an adversary's satellites before he destroys yours. We don't know what would happen in a crisis, but </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the potential for space instability seems high and likely to grow.</span><br />

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, whose goal was the destruction of the Pacific Fleet, was not done as an isolated act, but as part of the start of a larger campaign to establish a Japanese Pacific sphere of influence which included the forceful acquisition of US territories. At this time, the Pacific Fleet was viewed as a US center of gravity whose destruction would enable Japan to achieve regional domination and discourage future US intervention. Today, our space-based assets may represent the equivalent of the WWII Pacific Fleet. Further, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">other nations have stated they view the US reliance on space as a potential Achilles ’ heel and a center of gravity whose destruction or disruption is critical to future military success against the US</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">.44Although a major attack on the US is not likely, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">the loss of US space-based early warning capability and ground-based missile warning radars could undermine nuclear deterrence strategy resulting in a devastating miscalculationthat the US was vulnerable to a nuclear first strike</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The perception that US space capabilities are vulnerable to a surprise attack also weakens conventional deterrence</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. In the case of a US-China conflict over Taiwan, the Chinese might seek to disrupt or destroy regional space capabilities as part of a delaying strategy to deny US forces access to the region until their military operations were well underway, making the Chinese takeover of Taiwan a fait accompli.45 A successful Pearl Harbor-type attack on US space assets would degrade US fighting effectiveness. Today, space represents the ultimate high ground and it is unlikely that a nation, whose military ambitions might provoke US involvement, will willingly cede that high ground. The level of battlespace awareness space-based platforms provide makes any attack using large massed forces difficult to accomplish. The ability to neutralize these platforms would improve the circumstances required to gain a strategic advantage over US and allied forces. As General Lord stated in his Congressional testimony: “A resourceful enemy will look at our centers of gravity and try to attack them. Our adversaries understand our global dependence on space capabilities, and we must be ready to handle any threat to our space infrastructure.”46 With the increased US reliance on space assets for communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and command and control of our deployed forces; a successful space attack could significantly delay US response to regional aggression. During Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), over 60% of theater communications traveled via satellites.47 The Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) provided 90% of all protected communications and 70% of all military satellite communications into theater.48 These capabilities significantly enhanced command and control of US and allied forces. Further, the employment of the satellite-based Blue Force Tracker system resulted in an unprecedented level of situational awareness which decreased fratricide and facilitating search and rescue operations and reinforcement operations.49 The United States also maximized the use of the space-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable precision weapons delivery, allowing the use of fewer and smaller weapons to achieve effects; to enhance navigation in featureless terrain; and to aid in the location of both friendly and hostile forces.50 General Lord testified to Congress: “Space capabilities are no longer nice to have, but are now indispensable to how we fight and win our nation’s wars.”51 The failure to develop a credible space threat warning system increases the likelihood that a foreign nation would attack US space assets.The inability to detect and provide timely warning of a space attack could result in the preventable loss of critical high-value satellites, facilities or services. There are a number of scenarios where the timely detection of a threat would allow space operators to intervene, thwarting the attack. In many instances, the ability to find, fix, target and destroy the threat is currently a viable way to counter the attack. However, this is not always possible. In the case of a co-orbital ASAT attack, which involves the launch and maneuver of a satellite into a closing orbit of another satellite to destroy or disrupt it, the countermeasure require a pre-intercept maneuver of the target satellite. The support countermeasures for an attack on space ground facilities include increased physical and information security. Countermeasures for electronic warfare attacks or jamming of the space link segment exist but there is often a significant bandwidth cost when these measures are in effect.52 Degradations to space assets could also occur as a result of unintentional sources such as radio frequency interference or from scientific research such as laser research. In these situations, it is important to locate the source and terminate the activity to prevent loss of the space asset or service. The loss of these capabilities during critical operations could result in operational failure, loss of equipment, resources, and lives. The inability to rapidly neutralize sources of satellite communication (SATCOM) interference also has national security implications. In the area of airpower employment, successful SATCOM jamming could disrupt the US ability to command and control air assets in theater from geographically separated air operations centers. A delay of even one to two days might jeopardize US ability to support deployed forces. Satellite communication links to worldwide deployed forces are critical capabilities in protecting US security, sovereignty, and military combat capability. The inability to detect and assess space threats might allow adversaries to develop new weapon systems or conduct probing attacks on US space systems without our knowledge. Although US surveillance technology and systems are more sophisticated today, the US should not assume it will always be able to detect the development of a new weapon. Our experience in post-WW II with the Germans is one example. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the US and Russia engaged in a race to uncover Germany’s scientific secrets. Major General Hugh-Knerr, deputy commander of the US Air Forces in Europe wrote: “The occupation of German scientific and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research.”53 Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft, guided missiles, stealth technology and hardened armor were just some of the technologies developed in WWII German laboratories.54 The Soviet Sputnik launches and the deployment of the FOB system are modern examples of technological surprise.55Today, other nations are working to developnew weapons to counter US dominance and to take the lead in what is termed Fourth Generation Warfare—informationwar. The current coverage gaps in our space surveillance network, a fragmented intelligence network, a lack of discipline in anomaly reporting, the current inability to rapidly detect an attack on on-orbit systems, and overall erosion over the last decade of the space defense mindset makes it more likely an adversary could develop anti-satellite weapons without our knowledge. Finally, without a credible space threat warning capability the US will not have the ability to execute stated US policy to counter an attack against US space assets. In 1999, President Clinton signed into law DoD Directive 3100.10, US Space Policy, which specifically declared an attack on US space systems, to include commercial space systems, an attack on US sovereignty.56 One purposes of this policy is to deter an attack on US space assets. However, the lack of a credible space threat warning system undermines this policy. A senior officer in US Strategic Command recently stated that a nation or group could likely interfere with US satellites without fear of retribution.57</span><br />

While there have been numerous papers, and much media and academic attention, in the space security discussion focused on promoting or criticizing space-based weapons,2 there have been far fewer papers and studies offering constructive ways forward that deal with these genuine security concerns in a broader sense.3 The central motivation for this paper is to put forward one key element—the satellite architecture—in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. space assets. It is hoped that this idea, together with others like it, should stimulate and contribute to a debate on more constructive ways forward for how to achieve space security in the post-Cold war world.

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers — down. The individual dramas of the past decade — the September 2001 terrorist attacks, prolonged wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis — have delivered the world a message: US primacy is in decline. This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation. Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts. However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid. As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example, in the late 19th century America’s emergence as a regional power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards Spain. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had begun to challenge the notion that Britain ‘rules the waves.’ Such a notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians of the Western Hemisphere’s security to become the order-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law. Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these advances as America’s influence declines? Given that America’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way. Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations. For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy. Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973). A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.</span><br />

To support these requirements, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">ORS consists of three tiers of capabilities: Tier 1, the employment of existing capabilities within minutes to hours; Tier 2, the rapid call-up, launch and deployment of tailored, ready to field capabilities within days to weeks; and finally, Tier 3, the rapid development of a new capability to meet a combatant commander’s joint urgent operational need within months to a year.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> The Unified Command Plan assigns CDR USSTRATCOM the responsibility for all military space. The space systems under his authority and control provide our warfighters increased speed, precision, and lethality in military operations. In 2007, during an Air Force Association speech in Los Angeles, California, General C. Robert Kehler, commander, Air Force Space Command and former deputy commander, USSTRATCOM, stated that the biggest difference between 25 years ago and today, was that “space today is embedded in combat operations.”4 ORS’ strategic deterrent value has the potential to be just as important to future combat operations. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">Nuclear and Traditional Deterrence Theory – Misapplication When Applied to Space For years, deterrence theory centered solely on nuclear deterrence strategies, which relied heavily on threats of punishment and unacceptable losses or mutually assured destruction. These strategies effectively deterred the use of nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War to present day. However, strategies of threatening devastating nuclear retaliation do not apply to space</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">In fact, a deterrence strategy that includes </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the threat of punishment</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline"> (i.e., impose cost) should be just one, if not a limited aspect of deterrence for space.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> For almost half a century, nuclear deterrence strategies formed the foundation for the Cold War waged between the US and the former Soviet Union. Both superpowers relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter even conventional military actions, for fear of rapid escalation. In its most unlimited form,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">mutual assured destruction was a key deterrence strategy;</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> a doctrine of military strategy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both the attacker and the defender.5 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">While nuclear weapons continue to be a strategic deterrent, the same destructive thought process and strategy is</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> notdirectly applicable to space.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">6 Today, some theorists focus and apply more punishing or destructive deterrence practices and thinking to the space domain</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">. They view credible deterrence in space as relying upon the threat of punishment against an aggressor; going so far as to suggest that an attack against us could be countered with an attack in kind. One specific definition limits deterrence to an “attempt to persuade an adversary by threat of force (and other measures) not to pursue an undesirable course of action.”7 Another theorist states, “Deterrence can only succeed if the enemy finds the threat of punishment to be believable.”8 These approaches are less likely to deter for space, especially given our dependence upon the domain</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">. For example, destroying an adversary’s satellite, especially one in an operational orbit, would create a large debris field, potentially hampering or denying our own ability to access space. Instead, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">deterrence for space can only succeed if our enemies believe we have credible means of denying the benefits </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">they seek to gain. Space deterrence theory should focus on credible ways and means to deny an enemy the benefits they seek; impose costs on our adversaries</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> (against their most prized assets);9 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">and encourage their restraint.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> A New Focus of Deterrence What does deterrence look like in the 21st century? The US has not yet figured that out, said Marine Corps General James Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “You need something that deters a conflict, and you need more choices than just nuclear. ~ Sandra I. Erwin, Future of War—How the Game is Changing … Our deterrence strategy no longer rests primarily on the grim premise of inflicting devastating consequences on potential foes.… ~ US National Security Strategy, 2006 In fact, the US does have new and plausible thoughts on 21st century deterrence. Authored under the leadership of General Cartwright, then commander of USSTRATCOM, and signed out in December 2006, the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO-JOC) is the Department of Defense’s (DoD) latest view on deterrence. This approach extends beyond traditional nuclear deterrence theory, which dates back to the heralded days of Strategic Air Command. The DO-JOC states that the purpose or objective of deterrence operations is to “convince adversaries not to take actions that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive influence over their decision-making.”10</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">In order to influence our adversaries’ decision-making calculus, it focuses on and integrates three key elements: Deny the benefits the adversary seeks; impose costs the adversary fears; and encourage adversary restraint</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> (by convincing them that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome).11 Of these three elements, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">denying the benefit should be our focus when fielding new ORS capabilities. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Deterrence today can only succeed if our adversaries find ORS credible enough to enable military operations</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline"> even in a contested environment.

Today, our ability to field ORS</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline"> capabilities </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">is minimal at best, and unconvincing as a credible deterrent. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">Instead</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">, our adversaries likely perceive great benefit in attempting to deny the US’ space capabilities. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">These benefits, also referred to as “vulnerabilities gaps,”13 are reasons why </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">we must pursue ORS with an increased sense of urgency. However, for benefit denial to be viewed as a credible deterrent, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Study states “our adversaries (must) perceive that the US will retain superior warfighting capability even after an attack.”14 The space and cyberspace domains are increasingly important to how current and future wars will be fought and won. As recently as 4 November 2009, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) top Air Force Commander, Xu Qiliang, called the militarization of space an “historical inevitability.”</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">15 This statement came on the heels of an historic visit to USSTRATCOM by </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">General Xu Chihou, one of two vice chairmen of the PRC’s Central Military Commission. During this visit, General Kevin P. Chilton encouraged increased cooperation and comprehensive bilateral relationships between the two space-faring nations.16 Statements from Qiliang and actions such as the 2007 anti-satellite test highlight a growing disconnect between the PRC’s actions and stated policies, increasing concern amongst US leaders and lending credence to the need for new deterrence practices.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Moving forward, to be a true deterrent, ORS must also win the race to space in both the speed and cost of fielding capability versus our adversaries’ attempts to counter, destroy, or deny them.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline"> Two examples highlight how ORS could play a credible role in deterring adverse actions against our space capabilities: (1) International cooperation and partnerships through shared space capabilities (Tier 1) and (2) the ability to rapidly augment or replace some aspect of existing on-orbit ISR assets in low Earth orbit (Tier 2). </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Tier 1 and Two</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline"> ORS capabilities </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">can be deployed</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline"> and employed </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">rapidly, within hours </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">to days.

While the term ‘‘transformational’’ no longer holds the e´lan it once held in the early 2000s, when the then Office of Force Transformation championed funding and concept development for responsive space, proponents place great value on how these proposed systems have the potential to provide tremendous flexibility and options to decision makers and commanders. This responsiveness theme has understandably been picked up in the DOD Plan for Operationally Responsive Space (ORS). Its formulation focuses on assuring availability of timely and needed space capabilities for joint force commanders, delivering these warfighting needs through a three-tier construct—from hours-to-days, weeks-to-months, and then to no more than one year. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">The DOD approach also acknowledges needs to reconstitute, augment, or surge space capabilities in event of conflict. However, as structured, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">the current ORS program stops short of pushing credible long-term acquisition approaches needed for a space strategy. As stated in Joint Publication 3–14, Space Operations, ‘‘Strategic or long-term needs are not a primary focus of ORS.’’78 The rationale also suffers because its construct is based, in part, on false premises. First, the descriptive term ‘‘responsive space’’ implies that the space community has not been responsive to warfighter needs. This has not been the case, and senior U.S. military space leaders have argued indignantly against this conclusion in various conferences and forums. They contend that the space community has been responsive in satisfying warfighter needs, as the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and elsewhere have borne out. Second, the rationale implies warfighters need the space community to develop and sustain the capability to deliver new, just-in-time technologies, or solutions to satisfy battlefield and battlespace needs. The practical business and budgeting realities of indulging the second purported need have not been comprehensively explored. No doubt, military and national space systems are needed to survive a space ‘‘Pearl Harbor,’’ to reconstitute those systems to ensure they are available to support the warfighter. ‘‘</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">Reconstitution refers to plans and operations for replenishing lost or diminished space capabilities.

Instead of using a pure reconstitution approach, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="BoldUnderline">the United States could choose instead to change its satellite designs to small single-purpose vehicles deployed in large distributed constellations to obtain continuous Earth coverage.

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The United States has taken some initial steps to improve its defensive capabilities. The DoD stood up the joint Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office on May 21,2007 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The ORS effort seeks to meet emerging warfighter needs with new space capabilities. Ron Sega, DoD executive agent for space, stated that efforts will focus on the &quot;ability to launch, activate and employ low-cost military-useful satellites, provide, search capability, reconstitute and augment existing capability, while providing timely availabilities of tailor-made, unique capabilities. ,,39 Further, the DoD's Plan for Operationally Responsive Space highlighted the need to increase &quot;situational awareness and adaptability to the threat, as well as an ability to evolve the total suite of space capabilities to address emerging threats in new ways.,,40 The Commander of United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) detailed three efforts vital to execute the plan: rapidly develop technological and operational innovations, rapidly modify or supplement existing systems to increase capabilities, and rapidly reconstitute space systems when necessary to maintain capability.41 Initial focus on capabilities will be on ISR and communication satellites, improvement of space situational awareness, rapid launch capabilities, and command and control. 42 The ORS effort will use a three tier capability approach to meet warfighter needs. Tier-1implements activities immediately-to-days using existing or on-orbit systems. Tier-2 utilizes field-ready systems in days-to-weeks to provide rapid exploitation, augmentation or reconstitution of space capabilities. Finally, Tier-3 solutions take months-to-one year to satisfy needs while capabilities are modified or developed and then deployed.43 The ORS implementation timeline envisions eight tactical satellite demonstrators through fiscal year 2013. As of January 2009, two demonstrators have been launched with the third delayed from a scheduled spring 2009 launch due to technical issues. The program timeline also includes tests of operational employment and integration, command and control, and launch vehicles. The ORS program office recently purchased the first three launch vehicle specifically procured for ORS with launches scheduled for 2010 and 2011. Finally, the DoD expects the &quot;Chiliworks&quot; facility at Kirtland Air Force Base, which will focus onTier-2 satellite fielding, to be fully operational by 2015.44 While there are other ongoing efforts within the Intelligence Community and the DoD45 , ORS provides a good starting point for implementation of recommendations within this paper. The ORS plan identifies the need for both anticipatory and reactive elements. ORS planners should focus on the Chinese threat to build capabilities to fit within the Tier-1 and Tier-2 categories. The conflict with China would have to extend past a year to make use ofTier-3 capabilities. The United States must anticipate Chinese actions and have field-ready systems ready for either preemptive or immediate reactive use. Field-ready systems would provide a credible defensive deterrent against existing and likely Chinese offensive anti-satellite actions. PROPOSED DEFENSIVE ACTIONS The United States can choose from a wide variety of options to develop a defensive strategy to counter the Chinese threat to LEO satellites. The comprehensive approach should address space situational awareness (SSA), preplanned satellite actions, launch capability, small satellites, decreased dependence on space systems, nuclear explosion protection, institutional changes, transparency, and engagement. Space Situational Awareness Improving SSA is essential to the success of this strategy. The United States must have a comprehensive knowledge of all objects in orbit. Although the United States maintains a significant Space Surveillance Network (SSN) network, it lacks coverage in key areas and the capability to comprehensively predict the orbits of all objects in space; the February 10, 2009 collision between an Iridium commercial satellite and a Russian military satellite caught the SSN by surprise.46 The United States could build more fixed ground sites, but this would be limited by host country permissions and fiscal constraints. As a near term improvement to coverage, the United States should leverage the US Navy's AEGIS cruiser and destroyer-based radars into its SSN. The AEGIS radar highlighted its space surveillance capability when it tracked a decaying US satellite, enabling its destruction by a US anti-satellite weapon in 2008.47 While the Navy assets need to train and execute their primary mission, they could be given alternate tasking to search and track objects in LEO. This would entail development of procedures between services. Further, integration of land and space-based missile warning sensors into the SSN would yield benefits in the event of an anti-satellite launch. Finally, the United States should continue to pursue satellite as a sensor technology, where the satellite has the ability to self-identify and report on attacks. Improved SSA also allows the United States to characterize the resultant debris field of an anti-satellite attack and thus support reactive measures that may be required by other satellites. Intelligence Directly related to improved SSA is a robust intelligence effort that focuses on Chinese anti-satellite activity. Indications and warning may include increased communication at tracking stations, deployment of mobile tracking stations, and fueling and dispersal of launch vehicles. Identification and reporting of Chinese anti-satellite preparations would enable execution of preemptive defensive actions by the United States. Preplanned Satellite Actions Establishing preplanned actions is key to deterring and reacting to an anti-satellite attack. While the time from launch to impact for the SC-19 is on the order of minutes, intelligence of an impending launch can lengthen the timeline for taking preemptive defensive actions. While limited on-board fuel prevents large orbital maneuvers, a one-time small change to a satellite's orbit is possible. These orbital maneuvers must be executed before the launch of the anti-satellite weapon. Changes in orbit will produce a discrepancy between the anticipated satellite location and the final satellite tracking just prior to launch. The inconsistency may cause the Chinese to doubt the quality of their data and delay the launch as they develop new orbital tracking data, thus opening a window for additional US actions to prevent a launch. However, if the Chinese did decide to launch without updating their data, the slight change in orbit may cause the antisatellite weapon to miss. These same procedures would also be effective against ground-based anti-satellite weapons; a maneuver could lead to a laser missing the target. Having preplanned actions ready to execute provides United States planners another option. If a conflict looks to be inevitable, they could decide to rapidly execute minor maneuvers across satellite constellations. While not only complicating the Chinese targeting process, this could serve as non-destructive shot across the bow. If the conflict escalates into a conventional war, the single maneuver may buy the United States enough time to execute a kinetic strike that would dismantle the Chinese anti-satellite program. The importance of these strikes would move the priority high on the targeting list. Here again, intelligence is a key enabler. Targets must be accurately located, vetted, and updated to enable quick strikes on the anti-satellite targets. Variable and Rapid Launch Capability The current United States Department of Defense launch complex does not have the capability to rapidly replenish satellites in the event of destruction. Launch preparation and execution can take weeks to months. The United States must adopt rapid and flexible commercial launch technologies. Of at least equal importance to having a rapid launch capability is a launch system that deploys satellites from varying locations. When launched from the traditional space ports of Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base, China can easily monitor the launch and quickly determine the initial orbit and possibly satellite type. Having a capability that can unpredictably launch from unmonitored locations will delay China's ability to track and identify United States satellites, greatly inhibiting their ability to target satellites. This capability could be sea-based, where monitoring by an adversary is more difficult. The capability could also be airborne, like the Pegasus program which has successfully launched satellites using an L-I0ll aircraft from California, Virginia, Florida, the Canary Islands, and the Marshall Islands. 48 Small Satellites TheUnited States must also make a move towards smaller satellites that use a common bus and architecture. A single launch vehicle could then deploy multiple small satellites, allowing the rapid establishment of a new constellation at the beginning of a conflict or replenishment of an old one. China would then face a dilemma as to which satellites they would attack. If China does decide to attack, the impact would be proportionately smaller because they would take out a lesser percentage of the constellation. The Iridium collision demonstrated the ability of a large constellation to absorb the loss of single satellite with minimal degradation. 49 Having numerous small satellites ready to launch can also lesson the need to perform defensive orbital maneuvers, as they can be quickly replenished. Finally, small satellites are inherently harder to track whether by radar or optical telescopes. While a requirement for large satellites remains; small satellites will help protect and complement the large satellites. Key to developing small satellites is a common command and control (C2) network regardless of function, rather than today's stovepiped C2 that are unique for each satellite type. A common bus and C2 system can also support small satellites by relying on a cross-linked network to control satellites and download mission data from a central location rather than on ground stations distributed around the globe. Decreased Dependence on Space Systems The United States must decrease its dependence on space systems, making attack on satellites a less appealing target. United States military forces should have weapons and procedures that can function with or without satellite support. For example, high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles can and should complement, and potentially replace, the LEO satellite ISR mission. Countering High-altitude Nuclear Explosions Although the possibility of a HANE may be remote, defense against the long term radiation effects must focus on hardening all future satellites against nuclear explosions. Without hardening, depending on the size of the constellation, satellite replenishment could take months and quickly exhaust satellite spares even with rapid reaction launch capabilities. Building satellites to withstand the nuclear weapon radiation effects beyond that required against the natural environment would add only 2 to 3 percent to total satellite cost.50 Consideration may be given to forgoing hardening for satellites designed for a short (days to weeks) lifetime; one should consider the radiation from a nuclear explosion may remain for up to two years, precluding the launch of non-hardened satellites into the affected orbital regime. 51 While some government low-earth orbit satellites are already hardened, the United States should harden all future satellites. Institutional Changes Changes must be properly incorporated into the DoD infrastructure to be effective. All aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities must be examined. Additionally, the changes must work across many organizations within the DoD and throughout the United States government. For example, STRATCOM should run comprehensive anti-satellite exercises that incorporate all applicable services and agencies, from the satellite operator to the end user. Transparency The above actions may deter China from further pursuing its anti-satellite programs, but only if executed in a transparent manner. Systems must be fully trained and tested; the United States must overtly demonstrate its capability to rapidly deploy satellites. China must be made fully aware of US capabilities to effectively counter its anti-satellite weapons. China may then realize that its actions will have minimal effect on US military capabilities. <strong>Engagement</strong> Beyond using a military response to protect government satellites, the United States should consider a holistic approach to China's anti-satellite capabilities by using the other elements of national power: diplomatic, information, and economic. China's current reliance on space is minimal when compared to the United States. China can therefore afford to use antisatellite weapons against the United States. Increased Chinese reliance on space would provide significant deterrents to Chinese use ofcertain weapons such as direct ascent, co-orbital, and nuclear, since collateral damage from these weapons would affect China. First, the United States should engage on Chinese proposed treaties limiting space weapons. Next, the United States should work to build Chinese economic dependence on space systems, while taking appropriate measures to limit technology transfer. With a gap between the Space Shuttle and Ares launch vehicles, an opportunity exists to bring China in as a partner on the International Space Station by providing equipment launch services. Working with China to build its reliance on and participation in space activities will help build deterrence to the use of anti-satellite weapons; the collateral effects would harm its own interests. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS While this paper focuses on LEO satellites, the same rigor must also be applied to medium Earth orbit (MEO), highly elliptical orbit (REO), and geosynchronous (GEO) orbit satellites. Although current direct ascent anti-satellite capability can only reach LEO, China's ballistic· missile and space launch vehicles could reach higher orbits. Additionally, China has orbited GEO satellites which could already be carrying co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. China has expressed interest in combating the MEO GPS system through both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.52 China is also actively developing jamming capabilities to combat United States military communications satellites found predominately in GEO. Additionally, the proposed defensive measures will do more than support deterrence against China. Numerous nations will seek to emulate Chinese actions with kinetic and nonkinetic options. In response to the recent anti-satellite activity of China and the United States, Russia announced the resumption of its anti-satellite weapons program.53 Ground-based actions such as jamming are within the realm of many nations and individuals. One only need look at the hijacking of the HBO satellite signal by &quot;Capt Midnight&quot; as an example of a single individual being able to steal a satellite transponder, in effect jamming the intended signal. 54 Further, proliferation of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile technology make the use of a HANE attractive to a rogue nation or terrorist nation that has little reliance on space capabilities. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency suggests this scenario as a possible last act of defiance by North Korean forces facing defeat,55 Lastly, these measures can be used to combat natural phenomena, such as a meteor shower or solar storms that can damage satellite systems. “A strategy that ensures access to and use of space is useful in times of peace just as in times of war, since space systems that provide critical services may fail or become inoperative in the absence of hostile action.”56 Finally, the United States must not stop at applying these recommendations merely to military satellites. While government satellites are critical in a conflict, commercial satellites in all orbital regimes have become an integral part of military operations to include weather, imaging, and communications. Although tightly tied to the world economy, China could decide to expand its anti-satellite program to attack the economic interests of the United States. While commercial satellites companies typically incorporate protective measures against natural threats, the United States government should share best practices and provide incentives to commercial entities to protect themselves against human threats. The government could do this through requirements to obtain licensing or guaranteed govemment contracts to companies that comply. CONCLUSION The fundamental U.S. security interest in the wake of China's 2007 anti-satellite test should be deterring China and others from attacking U.S. assets in space, using both a combination of declaratory policy, military programs, and diplomacy, and promoting a more stable and secure space environment.57 Council on Foreign Relations The United States government requires a comprehensive plan to counter the threat to its LEO systems posed by Chinese anti-satellite weapons. Failing to protect these key satellites would severely degradeUS military capabilities in a conflict with China. The United States should rely on a defensive space strategy to deter Chinese anti-satellite actions. The strategy must include robust space situational awareness, preplanned actions, small satellites, rapid and variable launch capability, decreased dependence on space systems and institutional changes. In total, these actions would complicate the ability for Chinese anti-satellite weapons to easily strike US assets while providing the means to operate through an attack and then reconstitute lost capability. The DoD's ORS effort can be used as springboard, but must be accelerated to meet the rapidly emerging threat. Finally, its growth as a space faring nation may eventually be the best deterrence against a Chinese attack on United States satellites. However, the actions outlined in this paper can also be used to counter threats from other nations or natural phenomena. A rapid comprehensive defensive deterrence approach most effectively counters the Chinese threat and meets Presidential guidance to establish “contingency plans to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain or duplicate access to information from space assets and accelerating programs to harden U.S. satellites against attack.”58</span><br />

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">An active region of the sun that blasted out powerful solar storms four days in a row last week likely isn't done yet, scientists say. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 5pt;">Officially, the flare-spouting region is called sunspot 1283. But space weather experts have dubbed it &quot;Old Faithful,&quot; after the famous geyser in the United States' Yellowstone National Park that goes off like clockwork. And the solar Old Faithful should erupt again before it dissipates, researchers said. &quot;It still has a fair amount of complexity,&quot; said solar physicist C. Alex Young of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. &quot;So we still have a pretty good chance of seeing some more stuff from this one.&quot; An active sunspot Sunspots are temporary dark patches on the solar surface caused by intense magnetic activity. Some last for hours before disappearing; others linger for days, weeks or even months</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">. Powerful solar storms often erupt from sunspots. These include radiation-flinging solar flares and phenomena known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) — massive clouds of solar plasma that can streak through space at up to 3 million mph (5 million kph). From Sept. 5-8, sunspot 1283 produced four big flares and three CMEs. Two of the flares were X-class events and two were M-class flares. (Strong solar flares are classified accordingto a three-tiered system: X-class are the most powerful, M-class are of medium strength and C-class are the weakest.) While the rapid motion previously observed in sunspot 1283 seems to have died down a bit, Young said, the sunspot looks poised to erupt again sometime soon. &quot;There's a good probability that we're still going to seeat least another M-class flare, possibly another X-class flare,&quot; Young told SPACE.com. It's not uncommon for sunspots to pop off a number of powerful flares in quick succession the way 1283 has done, he added. That seems to be the natural order of things. &quot;When you see one big flare, your chances of seeing another one are pretty good,&quot; Young said.

[Sun's Wrath: Worst Solar Storms in History] So researchers are working hard to better understand sun storms, with the aim of one day being able to predict them with a great deal of accuracyand a long lead time. But they're not there yet. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 5pt;">&quot;We still have a long way to go to really have the kind of forecasting capabilities that we have with terrestrial weather,&quot; Young said. That's not to say scientists aren't making progress. Indeed, they've learned a lot about solar eruptions lately, Young said. And the knowledge base will continue to grow, he added, as a fleet of sun-watching spacecraft beam home more and more observations of Earth's star. &quot;We're really in a great time right now in terms of the data that we have,&quot; Young said, citing the contributions of spacecraft such as NASA's STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as SOHO, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency. &quot;It's going to be pretty exciting, from a solar physics and a space weather point of view.&quot; All of these eyes on the sun should be treated to quite a show over the next several years</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">. Solar activity has been ramping up over the last few months as the sun works toward a maximum in its 11-year activitycycle. Scientists expect the peak of the current cycle, which is known as Solar Cycle 24, to come in 2013.</span><br />

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Last October</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">, around Halloween, the </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Sun produced a solar storm</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> that was one of the </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">largest ever recorded</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">, and was strong enough to </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">raise some concerns about the safety of Earth’s satellites</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> According to a recent paper published in Space Weather, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">such concern may </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">well</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> be</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">justified. If its conclusions are correct, then a </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">solar storm the size of one that was observed in 1859 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">could</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> potentially </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">kill several weather, telecommunications, and military satellites in less than a year. Here’s where the danger lies: </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">most </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">satellite</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">s, at least at some point in their orbits, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">fly through the inner radiation belt surrounding the Earth (aka the Van Allen Belt). The inner radiation belt, like it says on the tin, comprises quite a bit of intense radiation. However, satellites are shielded from that radiation, and the intensity of the radiation in the inner belt is relatively stable. That’s because it’s in large part shielded from high-energy particles by the plasmasphere, which is a cloud of plasma that is part of the Earth’s magnetosphere. Usually, when a solar storm hits</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">, most of the </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">radiation</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> either </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">hits the outer radiation belt or the plasmaphere</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">. When the plasmasphere gets hit, some of the plasma dissipates, making it smaller, but that dissipation prevents too much intense radiation from hitting the inner belt.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> During the Halloween storms, observations showed that there was significant erosion of the plasmasphere. Not enough to let significant radiation into the inner belt, but enough that the study authors wanted to take a closer look at the data. Based on observational data of solar storms, the radiation belts, and the plasmasphere during past years, the authors were able to successfully model the Halloween solar storm. They then modeled a solar storm with the intensity of the Carrington Solar Storm, which took place in 1859 and is estimated to have been about four times stronger than the Halloween storms. When the Carrington storm was modeled, the results showed that the plasmasphere was eroded to the point that much more radiation reached the inner belt than is normally the case. Moreover, the intensity produced “waves” of strong radiation continually moving through the inner belt. Based on their models, the authors suggest that the high radiation intensity of the inner belt</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> could </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">persist for as long as a decade</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">. That </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">intensity would</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> likely </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">swamp the radiation shielding on a typical satellite</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">, and</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> the authors estimate that most would be rendered inoperable within a year after the storm. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">The </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">loss of satellites as a result of a solar storm</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> would be </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">an economic catastrophe</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> – </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">we rely on satellites</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> for a large portion of our day to day lives,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">even when we don’t realize it. The researchers hope to continue their work modeling radiation from solar storms, with an eye towards better and more accurate predictions, as well as looking for ways to diminish the impacts of such storms. In the meantime, the authors suggest that satellite engineers incorporate the potential for intensification of the inner radiation belt in their radiation mitigation strategies. That strikes me as a good idea.</span><br />

<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Redundancy and Reconstitution is key to protect satellite systems</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">CBS 9-28</span></span></strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">-11-[September 28, 2011 1:06 PM PRINT TEXT -“Satellites threatened by sun &quot;superstorms&quot; By Charles Q. Choi</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/28/scitech/main20112845.shtml%5Djt" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/28/scitech/main20112845.shtml]jt</a></span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">(Space.com) Magnetic storms set off by the sun</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> could </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">pose a bigger threat than thought to weather, communication, military</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> and other</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">satellites close to Earth</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">, with a potentially </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">devastating economic impact</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">, scientists suggest</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">In the new study, researchers found that solar radiation can energize a belt of high-energy particles that surrounds Earth more dramatically than previously believed</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. The study focused on the possible effects of a particularly strong magnetic storm on the Van Allen radiation belts, the dangerous rings of high-energy particles that girdle the Earth. The belts are split into two distinct zones. The outer belt, which is made up of electrons, reaches from about 15,800 to 31,600 miles (25,500 to 51,000 kilometers) above the surface, while the inner belt, which consists of a mix of electrons and protons, reaches from about 4,000 to 8,000 miles (6,400 to 12,800 km) above. Scientists had known the outer belt could become far more intense during geomagnetic storms caused by high-energy particles spewed by the sun, such as the storm that supercharged Earth's northern lights display Monday night (Sept. 26). However, they have long thought such storms do not affect the inner belt. Now computer simulations suggest </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">that</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">during</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> a </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">&quot;superstorm&quot; -- which has occurred in the past and is likely to recur in the future ? </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">the electrons in the inner belt, too, could become energized</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Near-Earth radiation</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> could then </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">remain dramatically more intense </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">for several years afterward. &quot;The </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">increase in radiation in the inner zone</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> may </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">last</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> for up to </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">a decade and continue damaging satellites for years after</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> a very strong storm</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">,&quot; study lead author Yuri Shprits, a space physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told SPACE.com. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">This </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">radiationwould damage satellites</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline"> in that zone </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">and</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">potentially </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">cut their lifetimes by five-sixths or more. [Related: Space Radiation to Rise for Astronauts, Airline Passengers] &quot;It would not destroy all satellites at once,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;However, at least according to our calculations, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">a very strong storm can increase the radiation dose in the inner zone by a factor of 10, and </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">within a few yearswe may lose a significant portion of the satellites that traverse the inner zone.&quot;</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">In terms of new strategies that might be needed to protect satellite systems</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, &quot;it's hard to say,&quot; Shprits said. &quot;First of all, we need to estimate risks and estimate cost. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" class="BoldUnderline">If cost is too high, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">we may want to accept the risks and start getting ready to replenish the fleet in the case of such event.&quot; &quot;There are a number of rather expensive strategies that can be used to mitigate the risk, including redundancy in electronics and increased shielding,&quot; he added. &quot;Zero risk means infinite cost.&quot; Two missions to study the radiation belts are planned for 2012, Shprits noted: NASA's Radiation Belt Storm Probe will observe radiation belts in the equatorial plane, while Moscow State University's LOMONOSOV mission, with UCLA-built instruments on board, will observe radiation belts at low altitudes. The scientists detailed their findings online in the Aug. 25 issue of the journal Space Weather.</span><br />
