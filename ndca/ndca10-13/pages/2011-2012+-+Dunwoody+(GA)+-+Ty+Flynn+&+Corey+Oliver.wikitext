Plan: The United States federal government should increase its Earth observation capabilities beyond the Earth’s mesosphere.

Contention 1 is Environmental Leadership

Warming is real and anthropogenic
Braganza 6/14/11 (Karl, Manager, Climate Monitor at the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia, The Bureau presently operates under the authority of the Meteorology Act 1955, which requires it to report on the state of the atmosphere and oceans in support of Australia's social, economic, cultural and environmental goals. His salary is not funded from any external sources or dependent on specially funded government climate change projects. Karl Braganza does not consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations “The greenhouse effect is real: here’s why,” http://theconversation.edu.au/the-greenhouse-effect-is-real-heres-why-1515,)

In public discussions … future warming is irrefutable.

Warming is the only scenario for extinction
Deibel ‘7 (Terry L. Professor of IR @ National War College, 2007. “Foreign Affairs Strategy: Logic for American Statecraft”, Conclusion: American Foreign Affairs Strategy Today)
Finally, there is one … existence of life on this planet.

Climate satellites aren’t sufficient now – they’re necessary for US leadership
Lewis et al ’10 [James A., Director and Senior Fellow, Technology and Public Policy Program – CSIS, Sarah O. Ladislaw, Senior Fellow, Energy and National Security Program – CSIS, Denise E. Zheng, Congressional Staffer - Salary Data, “Earth Observation for Climate Change,” June, http://csis.org/files/publication/100608_Lewis_EarthObservation_WEB.pdf]

Until this year, America’s … problem, and rebuild U.S. leadership.

Information capabilities are a necessary to revitalizes US climate leadership that leads to global cooperation
Lewis et al ’10 [James A., Director and Senior Fellow, Technology and Public Policy Program – CSIS, Sarah O. Ladislaw, Senior Fellow, Energy and National Security Program – CSIS, Denise E. Zheng, Congressional Staffer - Salary Data, “Earth Observation for Climate Change,” June, http://csis.org/files/publication/100608_Lewis_EarthObservation_WEB.pdf]

Climate change will have … shortfall is eliminated.

Obama's over-focused on emissions cuts – leadership on adaptation specifically solves environmental leadership
Sundt '10 – Communications Director for Climate Change at the World Wildlife Fund, staff associate at the U.S. Climate Change. Science Program Office, which is sponsored by 13 federal agencies (Nick, 10/11/10, "In Rolling Stone Interview, Obama Says "We're Going to Have to Mobilize" on Climate Change,” http://www.wwfblogs.org/climate/content/rolling-stone-interview-obama-climate-change-oct2010, RG)
"[C]limate change has … the initial leadership push."

US climate leadership spurs international action – independently solves bio-diversity
Khosla 9 – President of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Ashok, 1/29/09, “A new President for the United States: We have a dream,” http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/news/opinion/?2595/new-President-for-the-United-States-We-have-a-dream)
A rejuvenated America, … agriculture and transport systems.

extinction
Cayne and Hoekstra ‘7 – *Professor of Ecology @ University of Chicago AND ** Professor of Biology at Harvard (Jerry & Hopi, 9/24/07, “The Greatest Dying,” http://www.truthout.org/article/jerry-coyne-and-hopi-e-hoekstra-the-greatest-dying)
We are relentlessly taking … greatest dying of them all.

Contention 2 is Monitoring

Current satellites can’t solve – despite a recent increase, programs are still largely underfunded
Fialka 11/17 – reporter @ WSJ, Washington Bureau (John J. Fialka and ClimateWire, "Weather Data Gap Now Appears Certain", November 17, 2011, http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=weather-data-gap-now-appears-certain)

A House-Senate deal … setbacks," Zinser said.

Scenario 1 is disease –
Pandemic risk high now – monitoring satellites allows us to mitigate their spread
Ford et al ‘9 Timothy E. Ford, Rita R. Colwell, Joan B. Rose, Stephen S. Morse, David J. Rogers, and Terry L. Yates, University of New England, Biddeford, Maine, USA (T.E. Ford); University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA (R.R. Colwell); Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA (R.R. Colwell); Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA (J.B. Rose); Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York, USA (S.S. Morse); Oxford University, Oxford, UK (D.J. Rogers); and University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA (T.L. Yates)( Emerging Infectious Diseases Journal, “Satellite Imagery in Predicting Infectious Disease Outbreaks”, September 2009, v.15)
The scientific community … for future disease prediction.

Disease spread makes extinction likely – diseases are mutating
Greger ‘8 Michael,M.D., is Director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture at The Humane Society of the United States (“ Bird Flu: A Virus of Our Own Hatching”, 2008, http://birdflubook.com/a.php?id=111)

Senate Majority Leader … whilst passing a graveyard.”3154

Scenario 2 is oceans –
Ocean ecosystems are collapsing – only the aff can mobilize international solutions
Sherman ‘11 (Kenneth, 2011, “The application of satellite remote sensing for assessing productivity in relation to fisheries yields of the world’s large marine ecosystems,” ICES Journal of Marine Science, US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Ph.D, Director of U.S. LME Program, Director of the Narragansett Laboratory and Office of Marine Ecosystem Studies at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, adjunct professor in the Graduate School of Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island)

In 1992, world leaders … adapt to climate change (Duda and Sherman, 2002).

Accelerating ocean loss causes extinction
Rogers and Laffoley 6/20/11 Alex David, Ph.D. in marine invertebrate systematics and geneticsfrom the University of Liverpool is a Professor in Conservation Biology at the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford and Dan, PhD on marine ecology at the University of Exeter, and Senior Advisor, Marine Science and Conservation Global Marine and Polar Programme (IPSO Oxford, “International earth system expert workshop on ocean stresses and impacts”, July 20, 2011, http://www.stateoftheocean.org/pdfs/1906_IPSO-LONG.pdf)

The workshop enabled leading … the past 600 million years (Barnosky et al., 2009).

Contention 3 is No great power wars

Cooperation is more likely than competition
Deudney and Ikenberry 09 [Daniel, Professor of Political Science at Johns Hopkins, John, Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University, The Myth of the Autocratic Revival :Why Liberal Democracy Will Prevail, Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb]

This bleak outlook is based …international integration and cooperation.

Nuclear war won’t cause extinction
Martin ’84 (Brian, Research Associate – Australian National University, SANA Update, “Extinction Politics”, No. 16, May, http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/84sana1.html)

Yet in spite of the … remains speculative at present.

No accidents AND no escalation from any other scenario
Quinlan 09 [Michael, Former Permanent Under-Sec. State – UK Ministry of Defense, “Thinking about Nuclear Weapons: Principles, Problems, Prospects”, p. 63-69]

Even if initial nuclear use … way belongs to science fiction.

Shared interests prevent great power conflict
Gelb 10 - President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. He was a senior official in the U.S. Defense Department from 1967 to 1969 and in the State Department from 1977 to 1979 (Leslie, Foreign Affairs, “GDP Now Matters More Than Force: A U.S. Foreign Policy for the Age of Economic Power,” November/December, proquest)

Also reducing the likelihood … short of direct confrontation..
