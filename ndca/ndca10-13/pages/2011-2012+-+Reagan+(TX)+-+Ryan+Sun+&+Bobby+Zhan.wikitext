<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Sitting in the stands of a rice football field in 1962 it might be odd to hear:</span>**</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">W</span>****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">e choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. […] Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said, "Because it is there.” Well, space is there, and we're going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.”[[file:///C:/Users/Bobby/Desktop/spanos/churchill%20aff%20work/spanos%20space%20aff/Spanos_Aff_Draft_3.docx#_ftn1|**[1]**]]</span>**</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Kennedy’s words were not an isolated view of space. In 1969 when interviewed before the Apollo program Neil Armstrong stated “</span>****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">I think we're going to the moon because it's in the nature of the human being to face challenges.</span>****<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> It's by the nature of his //deep inner soul// ... we're required to do these things just as salmon swim upstream.”</span>**</span>

</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">The notions of space expressed by Kennedy and Armstrong highlight an interesting motivation to go to space. </span>**</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Both Jack and Neil expressed the belief that the U.S. should explore space because it is our divinely ordained future. Daniel Webster preached of the city on the hill and god’s desire for westward expansion, Armstrong and Kennedy invoked divine right to justify our exploration of space, catapulting the American Jeremiad to the Cosmos.</span>**</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">So what is space? As I stare at the stars at night I ask myself “What is it? What’s out there?” The answer is simple. Nothing. Space is devoid of all meaning and defining appearances. </span>**</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">So when we arrive at the question of space and the resolution we ask: how do we orient ourselves to space? Bobby and I affirm space as beautiful. Much like the work of Marcel Duchamp, we affirm space exploration differently—we affirm the oddity and nothingness of space, devoid of all predetermined values and meaning … as beautiful. </span>**</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">This nomadic affirmation is described by a good friend as a “Space Oddity”</span>**</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Our discussion of space doesn’t take place out of time, it is important to note the metaphysical as well as the historical events surrounding space exploration. Two years after Kennedy’s moon speech, then president and proud Texan president Johnson asked congress to support his decision to begin what later became called the Vietnam war in response to the gulf of Tonkin incident. It was there all along—the real answer why to go to space—not to fulfill the promise of the land ordained on the hill, but rather to think the nothing of space as productive and this is a nomadic thinking. A fluid view of the cosmos that does not subscribe to a predetermined notion of space based upon, manifest destiny and constant progress. </span>**</span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">These words from JFK bore witness to an entire mode of thinking, one which cannot suffer the unknown and must conquer every challenge in its path, to expand to every frontier until there are no more barriers. Thus, on to America, and to the Pacific, and into communist lands, and to the depths of the sea and the surface of the moon itself.</span>**</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">In the words of Kennedy, we can hear echoes of these early explorers – especially American's puritan founders, running the relay from colonization through native genocide, from Daniel Webster through Barak Obama.

America expanded it's imperial reach across the continent, from sea to shining seas, across the ocean, across Europe and Africa and South America. With the Cold War, only the USSR remained. But Apollo 11 proved the victory of liberal-democracy over communism, and with it the US ordained its victory in the space race over the Russians. But having painted all the red doors blue, we sought out the next frontier.

The liberal-capitalist-democratic ideal as the only game in town, and America a shining beacon for the world, for the entire galaxy. Of course, things didn't work quite so smoothly.

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">So what is space? As I stare at the stars at night I ask myself “What is it? What’s out there?” The answer is simple. Nothing. Space is devoid of all meaning and defining appearances, an endless expanse that is infinitely more empty than full. So while so many teams orient their strategy around the cosmos somethings – the asteroids to mine, the moons to colonize, the planets that may support alien life – we instead recognize that boundless nothing, which cannot be known, grasped, or made useful. Thus:</span>**</span>
**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Bobby and I focus upwards to the skies and affirm space.</span>**
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">While most teams will define the terms in the resolution, delimit it's content and locate some object within the space offered by the resolution, only an affirmation focused on space itself can escape the metaphysical drive to colonize every new frontier we encounter. We affirm space exploration differently—we affirm the eccentricity and nothingness of space, devoid of all predetermined values and meaning … as beautiful. </span>**</span>

Two years after Kennedy’s moon speech, president Johnson asked congress to support his decision to begin the Vietnam war. With the end of history and the triumph of American exceptionalism colonizing all matter – from our planet to satellites and asteroids and the moon – we at last see the purpose of space-exploration: not to fulfill the promise of the absolute triumph over Being, but rather to think space's nothing itself as valuable. A fluid view of the cosmos that does not subscribe to our obsession with progress and control. With this simple gesture, we allow metaphysics to realize its destiny promise in its birth – collapsing upon itself to allow the flourishing of difference in this new //space//.</span>**</span>

Therefore bobby and I affirm the cosmological statement: Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its exploration of space beyond the Earth’s mesosphere.


The sooner that we recognize that people aren’t going to check their metaphysical baggage at the door of the debate—the better things can become—because debates are always metaphysically oriented—and in our refusal to acknowledge the metaphysical presuppositions of public debates we cede this metaphysical space to the right. Importantly: metaphysics isn’t going anywhere—it’s a question of how we frame debates—whether our politics are violent or open to difference.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The reliance on a single standard of truth and knowledge is indicative of normal science—of status quo knowledge acquisition. But the astronomers and philosophers that advance science, philosophy, and society don’t use the standard units of measure. Our affirmation is in line with what Thomas Kuhn called “revolutionary science”, a paradigm shift—revolutionary science doesn’t rely on the standards set by its predecessors—it changes by leaps and bounds. Our affirmation calls for a revolution in thinking in the debate space, a paradigm shift—especially this year with the space topic.</span>

So the final question seems to be: what does the critic’s piece of paper do?
The role of the ballot is to affirm identity/ difference in opposition to Unitarian identity.
We ask you to align yourself with a politics that refuses the violent drive to secure a perfect identity. An affirmative ballot affirms space exploration as a metaphysical, epistemological, ontological, and theological question first and foremost. An affirmative ballot is for a paradigm shift towards an ethical policy maker that investigates policy on the level of thinking first.

Our history of madness begins with the Ship of Fools, the vessel filled with those called diseased in the mind and sent out into a vast emptiness, embarking upon a sacred journey. It was a wandering pilgrimage meant to purify their corrupted minds. This violent exclusion brought the sovereign the image of a perfectly ordered society.

Historically, we label the witnesses of the eponymous “UFO” as mad. Exiled for a belief that does not hold with the rational and scientific community, they, like Galileo, are extruded from society for pondering the sky. They are rendered deviant violence mongers or deviant sexual predators.

The drive toward cleanliness (reason) is necessarily violent. It erupts in interpersonal and interstate war, constructs explosive new coordinates of the normative social; it extrudes madness like toothpaste through a tube. In fighting the displacement of value, everything and everyone is forced into the cubby-hole of ideal behavior for the achievement of reason. The problem is, when everything is clean, the rationalists just find more dirt.
