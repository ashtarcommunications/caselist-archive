**<span style="font-size: 90%;"> The United States Congress should provide advance appropriations sufficient to fully fund acquisition of Advanced Extremely High Frequency communications satellite payloads.</span>**


===Contention 1 is Military Communications=== 

Failure to secure advance appropriations is delaying Air Force acquisition of new communications satellites
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Brinton ‘11</span>__**<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (Turner Brinton, “Conaton: Budget Pressure Necessitates Satellite Block Buys,” Space News, 7-1-2011, http://www.spacenews.com/military/110701-budget-necessitates-sat-block-buys.html)</span></span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">With the U.S. Congress pushing back on the Air Force’s proposal to start buying multiple satellites at a time using multiyear advance appropriations, a top service official reiterated the need to rein in the cost of space systems and stabilize the industrial base to prepare for the tough fiscal environment the military will face in the years ahead. </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Air Force</span>__****__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">’s budget for space </span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">programs likely **will come under pressure from other Defense Department priorities**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which means everyone will have to learn how to do more with less, Air Force Undersecretary Erin Conaton said at an event here hosted by the Space Foundation and Center for Strategic Space Studies. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Air Force in **its 2012 budget request is seeking** permission **to implement** a new space acquisition strategy dubbed **Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency** (EASE). The concept is **to buy satellites in blocks** of two or more **using fixed-price contracts**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for programs that have reached maturity. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">In parallel, the Air Force **and** its industry partners would continue to **develop new technologies** that could be inserted **into later satellites**, thus **preserving a highly skilled industrial base**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> designated **test case for EASE is** the fifth and sixth Advanced Extremely High Frequency (**AEHF**) **secure communications satellites**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif. The Air Force requested $552.8 million in 2012 as a down payment for the two satellites, which would be funded incrementally for the next several years. </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The service asked lawmakers to approve several years of advance appropriations for AEHF</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">, which would lock in funding for the procurement</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the 2013 budget request, the Air Force said it will pursue a similar block buy for the fifth and sixth Space Based Infrared System missile warning satellites, also built by Lockheed Martin. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Three of the four **congressional defense committees have considered the AEHF block buy proposal**. The House and Senate Armed Services committees</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which authorize appropriations for the Pentagon, </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">supported the concept of the AEHF block buy and recommended fully funding the procurement request for 2012. Both committees were willing to allow the satellites to be funded over multiple years, **but neither was willing to authorize a specific appropriation level for the next few years**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The House Appropriations Committee, meanwhile, was critical, saying information provided by the Air Force on the strategy was “woefully lacking” and characterizing the advance appropriations idea as a “budgetary gimmick.” Nevertheless, the committee’s bill would provide the requested amount of AEHF procurement funding for 2012, though it would trim $67.2 million from the program’s proposed $421.7 million research and development budget. Senate appropriators have not yet marked up their version of the 2012 defense spending bill. Though the Air Force could probably work within the parameters laid out by the three committees, </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">the AEHF program would have more certainty if advance appropriations are provided</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Conaton said. She acknowledged that the Air Force had not done an adequate job of detailing how it would spend the AEHF technology development funding, and it would soon be able to provide the committees with more insight. Joanne Maguire, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin Space Systems, said </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">block buys</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> of satellites **have the potential to save** 15 to **20 percent** compared to buying satellites individually</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and in a period when the Defense Department is recapitalizing all of its satellite fleets, cost reduction has become a top priority for the government and for her company. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The **EASE** strategy **would create a** more **steady production rhythm, shoring up prospects for** second- and third-tier **component suppliers that might exit the market if production breaks stretch out too long**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “</span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Concepts like **EASE can make a difference, but only if the government is all in**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Maguire said. </span></span>

Advance appropriations are key – buying the full constellation now is essential to reduce program costs and avoid production breaks
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Thompson ‘11</span>__**<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (Loren B. Thompson, Chief Operating Officer of the Lexington Institute, former Professor and Deputy Director of the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University, Ph.D., M.A., Government, Georgetown University, B.S., Political Science, Northeastern University, “An Easy Way To Save Billions Of Dollars On Military Satellites,” 3-30-2011, http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/an-easy-way-to-save-billions-of-dollars-on-military-satellites?a=1&c=1171)</span></span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Deficit reduction doesn't always mean hard choices. Sometimes it's easy, if politicians are willing to rethink how the government goes about pursuing its goals. Perhaps that's what Pentagon policymakers had in mind when they decided to name </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">a new approach to purchasing satellites</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> EASE. The official name </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">is "Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">," but the acronym says it all. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Budget analysts have figured out a way of **saving billions of dollars on space systems without having to give up anything**. And unlike initiatives such as the F-35 alternate engine that require up-front investments to save money later, the EASE concept starts saving money right away</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">It's an amazingly simple idea. **All Congress needs to do is agree to buy more than one satellite at a time, and then spread the appropriations out over several budget years**. **That's not what the government does today**. **Instead, it buys one costly satellite** in a constellation **at a time, and then waits years to buy the next one -- even though legislators know they will eventually need to buy several satellites of any given type** to complete a constellation. **And because satellites are bought one-at-a-time with all the money appropriated in a single year, staffers can't find the money to buy another satellite for years and contractors can't manage their production processes efficiently**. So **each satellite ends up costing a lot more than it needs to**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Here's an example. </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Pentagon is buying</span>__****__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> Advanced Extremely High Frequency</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (**AEHF**) **communications satellites** that will allow warfighters all over the world to communicate securely even in adverse circumstances. That's **an essential capability and military planners expect to buy several** of the satellites **over the coming decade**. Now, **if Congress buys the next two satellites separately with full funding of each in the year it's requested, the cost for both will be about $4 billion**. **If it buys them in a "block"** (together) **and then spaces the money out over several years as EASE proposes, the two satellites will cost $3.1 billion**. **About $900 million is saved just by doing business differently, without giving anything up**. **And the same approach can be applied to any other satellite constellation where the government plans to buy more than one satellite of the same design, whether it's for missile warning or weather reports** or whatever</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. You can't really call EASE a breakthrough, because </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">the N</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">ational **R**econnaissance **O**ffice **has been buying its spy satellites this way for a long time**. **But** most of the military satellites the government buys aren't for spying, and **all the other spacecraft are currently being bought one-at-a-time at very high cost**. **By switching to incremental funding of multi-satellite buys, the government can start saving billions of dollars in fiscal 2012**. **It can also help military planners and contractors to start thinking more coherently about how to introduce necessary upgrades into later versions of current satellites**, since we know constellations like AEHF are going to be operating for decades to come. But **the real savings come from being able to use workers and facilities more efficiently**, because when the government commits to buying multiple satellites of the same type in a single "block" **the work can be sequenced to make sure each employee with specialized skills is working every day, rather than waiting around for the next satellite to be funded**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">This isn't a budgeting gimmick and there are no catches</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">. **Congress can begin saving billions of dollars on military satellites in 2012 without killing any programs** or closing any facilities. **All it needs to do is agree to** what staffers call "**advanced appropriations**," which is technical language for agreeing to fund satellites over several budget years rather than setting aside all the money in a single year. Once it does that, budgeting for military space will become easier and savings will begin accumulating that can be applied to other purposes such as deficit reduction</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of course, somebody somewhere will probably complain about Congress changing the way it does business. But when you're borrowing $4 billion per day from lenders like China, change is indicated. </span></span>

===Contention 2 is Transmission Security=== 

Funding delays for communication satellites will cause production breaks, creating capability gaps
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Conaton ‘11</span>__**<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (Erin C. Conaton, Under-Secretary of the Air Force, “Fiscal Year 2012 Air Force Space Posture,” Presentation to the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. House of Representatives, 3-15-2011, http://integrator.hanscom.af.mil/2011/March/03172011/03172011-20.htm)</span></span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Before going into detail about the Air Force FY12 budget request for space programs, I want to emphasize to the subcommittee some of the impacts of </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">the funding situation for the current</span>__****__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> fiscal year</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (FY11)</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In short, the operation of the Department of Defense (DoD) under a Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY11 </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">is already causing difficulties in the execution of Air Force space acquisition programs</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We have taken actions to mitigate impacts where we can, such as our recent reprogramming of $80 million in FY10 funds into the GPS IIIA program to avoid costly programmatic delays and contract renegotiation for the first long-lead production option for space vehicles (SV) 3 and 4. However, our success in mitigating CR impacts to GPS IIIA has limited our flexibility to address other detrimental impacts of a prolonged CR. Additionally, new start limitations prevent the Air Force from carrying out the scheduled award of WGS-7, </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">potentially **causing a production break with** estimated cost impacts of up to $50 million **if funding is delayed until the start of FY12**. The Air Force plan to procure long lead items for</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Advanced Extremely High Frequency (</span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">)</span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">-5 and 6 is also delayed, undermining current efforts to more efficiently acquire this satellite system and protect the space industrial base</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The CR limitations also prohibit new start programs such as Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) and Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">creating delays in critical space capability</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At a time when the Air Force is striving for greater efficiency in our space programs, operating under a CR for nearly half the fiscal year undermines those efficiency efforts. </span></span>

===Scenario A: Net-Centric Warfare=== 

Gaps in communications are filled by leasing commercial bandwidth, creating vulnerabilities that prevent networked operations
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Thompson ‘10</span>__**<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (Loren B. Thompson, Chief Operating Officer of the Lexington Institute, former Professor and Deputy Director of the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University, Ph.D., M.A., Government, Georgetown University, B.S., Political Science, Northeastern University, “Lack Of Protected Satellite Communications Could Mean Defeat For Joint Force In Future War,” 4-14-2010, http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/lack-of-protected-satellite-communications-could-mean-defeat-for-joint-force-in-future-war?a=1&c=1171)</span></span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the years since the Cold War ended, </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">the</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> U.S. **military has become heavily dependent upon satellite communications to maintain its global connectivity**. **Without such links, it would be difficult for the military to operate in a coordinated fashion or exchange information critical to situational awareness**. Defense experts have repeatedly warned that **the availability of space-based communications could be compromised** in future conflicts **by the fact that 80-90% of all military traffic is transmitted on vulnerable commercial satcom channels**. However, there is a related problem that far fewer military observers have noticed: **only about 1% of defense communications today are protected against even the most modest jamming threats**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Jamming means overloading key frequencies with so much electronic "noise" that communications cannot get through to intended destinations. It's a simple process in the case of unprotected satellite links, because signals are relatively weak after traveling 22,000 miles from transponders in geosynchronous orbit</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- the orbit that communications satellites must maintain in order to serve as "stationary" links above particular points on the Earth's surface (they aren't really stationary, but they appear to be because their rotation matches that of the Earth). If the satellites were any closer to Earth they would zoom across the surface at a speed of several miles per second, making them unavailable as communications nodes most of the time. So they must sit 22,000 miles above sea level, which makes their signals easy to overwhelm with modest amounts of electromagnetic interference, especially if the jammer is near communications receivers. </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The only satellite constellation</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the military is currently building **that can provide protection against the full array of potential communications threats is** the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (**AEHF**) system. AEHF is **designed to cope with everything from jammers to hackers to** scintillation from **thermonuclear explosions**. However, although it will provide ten times as much capacity as the legacy MilStar constellation, it can only carry a small portion of the military communications traffic passing through space portals. As a result, the amount of that traffic that is well protected against jamming will peak at 6-7% in fiscal year 2012, leaving over 90% of joint-force transmissions vulnerable to degradation</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That's not a serious problem if the biggest threats we face are rag-tag adversaries such as the Taliban, but </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">in a war</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">with China **there's a high likelihood that America's military would lose the use of most of its satcom links** in places like the Western Pacific</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Bush Administration had an initiative for addressing this problem called the Transformational Communications Satellite program, or TSAT. TSAT would have provided internet-like access to U.S. warfighters all over the world, including troops on the move, from a constellation of five very capable satellites. However, TSAT was canceled last year due to astronomical (no pun intended) costs, and </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">now **the military** space community **has no real plan for assuring that a reasonable portion of joint-force communications traffic will be protected against jamming in the future**. **The feasible**, affordable **answer is** not to begin a new program, but **to start incrementally evolving AEHF towards a more robust capability**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I argued in Space News several years ago that such an approach was more likely to work out than trying to implement the complex TSAT initiative, but at the time everybody in the business was still chasing the TSAT opportunity. Now that it's gone, </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">military planners need to start thinking about how the government can leverage its investment in AEHF **through** incremental **improvements to each new satellite**. **If that move is not made soon, our warfighters may** one day **face an adversary who knows how to isolate them from the rest of the joint force and then kill them**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span>

In order to address current as well as emerging requirements for national security objectives, newer and more powerful systems are being developed and deployed by the U.S. Military. These assets include the Wideband Global Satcom (WGS), Advanced EHF satellites (AEHF) and the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) programs. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Advances in IT are changing the way warfighting and peacekeeping are being conducted. **The ability to transmit critical information in theater in real-time**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or near real-time, </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">securely</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> to and from various parts of the globe **has enabled faster deployment of highly mobile forces**. **Bandwidth per soldier requirements has increased tremendously**, and the result among others is that troops have become more capable in adapting quickly to changing conditions in the battlefield</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Satellite communications have played a key role in providing interoperable, robust, communications; however, **the current fleet of satellites has proven to be inadequate in terms of bandwidth supply to address current as well as future operations**. **In the** next, or future, **“network-centric” architecture that will** upgrade or **evolve future operations, advanced communications’ systems will be required**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Advanced military satellite communications are</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often identified, and to a large extent, </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">defined by</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the upcoming **AEHF** program</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF will provide</span>__****__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> global, highly secure, protected, survivable communications for all warfighters</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> serving under the U.S. Department of Defense. Moreover, AEHF will provide greater total capacity and offer higher channel data rates compared to current milstar satellites</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The **higher data rates permit transmission of tactical military communications such as real-time video, battlefield maps and targeting data**. In addition, **AEHF will also provide the critical survivable, protected, and endurable communications to the National Command Authority** including presidential conferencing **in all levels of conflict**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">There is now an undeniable and accepted recognition that militaries around the globe cannot do away with commercial systems. Even if the U.S. Military were to achieve independence in terms of its bandwidth supply, the other benefits such as flexibility and redundancy that the commercial industry offers are invaluable</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Challenges and Requirements FSS and MSS commercial satellites currently provide the same types of applications, including real-time video as well as tactical military communications. Commercial satellites are even a part of UAV missions, currently a growing and highly-critical application suite for warfighting that will increase in the future. Moreover, commercial satellites in terms of bandwidth may be able to throughput higher data rates based on currently available satellites based on bent-pipe and on-board processing programs. The sheer number of commercial satellites currently deployed makes bandwidth availability much higher compared to current and planned military programs, specifically for the U.S. military. In terms of the definition as well as </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">the main difference between AEHF and commercial communications satellites, AEHF will provide survivable, highly secure, protected, global communications for all warfighters serving under the U.S. Department of Defense, **whereas** **commercial satellite systems are vulnerable in the event of attacks** or engagements that include nuclear capability</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In terms of the ability to throughput secure, reliable, real-time or near-real time data, commercial systems could play a role in providing advanced communications for military missions. MILSATCOM systems are generally categorized as wideband, protected and narrowband: •Wideband systems provide high capacity, •Protected systems feature antijam, covertness, and nuclear survivability, and •Narrowband systems support users who need mobile voice and low-data-rate communications. In terms of these categories, commercial systems can tap into wideband and narrowband applications via FSS and MSS platforms. Indeed, commercial outsourcing by the U.S. Military has led to healthy leases of wideband/broadband capacity for missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for UAV missions in both countries as well as Pakistan. For narrowband applications, the U.S. Military has had a contract with Iridium, specifically for such capabilities. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> only challenge, or </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">requirement, not met by commercial systems lies in the protected realm</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. By definition, </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">protected systems such as AEHF have the ability to</span>__****__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> avoid, prevent, negate, or mitigate the degradation, disruption, denial, unauthorized access, or exploitation of communications’ services by adversaries or the environment</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">. This is particularly epitomized by activities that involve nuclear capabilities</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Another</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> challenge or </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">requirement currently unmet by commercial platforms is the ability to offer wideband capacity in the Polar Regions</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">. **AEHF will feature an Advanced Polar System both for wideband as well as protected needs**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The ability of the commercial industry to offer wideband services in Polar regions may change with the upcoming Iridium NEXT constellation. However, </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">the requirement for protected wideband communications will once again remain a challenge in the commercial realm</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span>

DOD costs in the area of military electronics, aircraft avionics, vetronics, and missile guidance, communications, electro-optics is approaching $99.57 billion in the 2010.36 </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">There may be changes to terminology</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">, shifts in policy, **and alterations in implementation plans**. **However, the core concepts** that relate to leveraging the power of information **will remain**. The **DOD and senior military leaders have been consistent**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> yet cautious </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">in their support of a networked force</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld concisely stated the importance a fully networked force in the Transformation Planning Guidance, “We must achieve: fundamentally joint, network-centric, distributed forces capable of rapid decision superiority and massed effects across the operational environment. Realizing these capabilities will require transforming our people, processes, and military forces.”37 ADM Giambastiani, former Commander U.S. Joint Forces Command stated, “A fully collaborative and networked force is an imperative, not a luxury.”38 The former Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, General Michael Haggee said, “The capability to connect disparate units spread over the battlefield will help to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance to commanders who can then call in fire support…Information Technology (IT) will also be critical to Sea Basing, a key component of the Navy’s Sea Power 21 Concept.”39 Vice Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Gen. Peter Chiarelli recently stated, “Access to information can mean the difference between living and dying.”40 General William Wallace, USA (Ret.) goes on to caution that “despite the enormous benefits of using a network, it would be folly to lose sight of the fact that it is still merely a tool to aid the commander in understanding and decisionmaking.”41 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates wrote in his recent Foreign Affairs article, We should be modest about what military force can accomplish and what technology can accomplish. The advances in precision, sensor, information, and satellite technologies have led to extraordinary gains in what the U.S. military can do. The Taliban were dispatched within three months; Saddam’s regime was toppled in three weeks. A button can be pushed in Nevada, and seconds later a pickup truck will explode in Mosul. A bomb dropped from the sky can destroy a targeted house while leaving the one next to it intact.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">SEA SHIELD embraces emerging technologies and concepts that for the first time have the potential to extend naval defensive firepower beyond the task force. SEA SHIELD encompasses some things great navies always have tried to do—sea control off hostile coasts and maritime defense of the homeland, for example—and some that no navy has ever done, such as projecting defense deep inland against cruise and ballistic missiles. But whether new missions or traditional ones done in new ways, these enhanced warfighting capabilities will play an increasingly central role in U.S. national security in the decades ahead. </span>__U.S. national strategy is founded on the advantages of forward-deployed forces, sea and air supremacy, and information superiority, allowing U. S. forces to fight and win thousands of miles from American shores. **Potential enemies** know this, and they **are working to circumvent U.S. strengths by denying its forces access to their regions** **and** by developing asymmetric strategies to conduct attacks on U.S. soil. Future adversaries will **strive to hold U.S. deployments at risk by interdicting air and sea lines of communication, rendering debarkation points unusable, and delaying or denying political access**. By **projecting defensive power**, SEA SHIELD **will defeat these efforts and enable** the U.S. Navy to "climb into the ring" to conduct SEA STRIKE and SEA BASE in forward theaters of operation, setting the stage for **combat victory**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Theater Air and Missile Defense. Effective theater air and missile defense is critical to achieving the vision for SEA SHIELD. This is a challenging task, as </span>**__countering emerging cruise and ballistic missiles will require advanced network-centric operations__** __and high levels of weapon-system technology, seamlessly fused to produce a single integrated air picture available to all elements of the force__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Air defense in the 21st century will require missiles that reach ranges, altitudes, and speeds never before seen. </span>**__Networks will pass vast volumes of__** **__precise data to achieve near-instantaneous speed of command, ensuring targets are destroyed using advanced weapons with extended range, over-the-horizon__**__, and ballistic missile defense versions of the Standard missile and new models of the advanced medium-range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM)__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Ballistic missile defense is yet another potential breakthrough on the horizon. Over the next decade, our Navy's globally deployed, mobile infrastructure of sea-based radars and missile launchers will be used to field ballistic missile defense, for both forward theaters and the U.S. homeland. Linked to a network of space and airborne sensors, and directed by highly responsive command-and-control systems, a family of sea-based interceptor missiles will provide options for boost phase, midcourse, and terminal defense as part of an overall joint force ballistic missile defense system. Tests of this capability are ongoing, and recent successes indicate that sea-based missile defense will strengthen U.S. security in the years ahead. Sea and Littoral Control. </span>__Battlespace control near land is essential to ensure prompt access and freedom of maneuver for joint forces moving from the sea to objectives deep inland. Surface and subsurface **threats include small, fast surface combatants, modern ultra-quiet submarines, and** an array of floating, moored, and buried **mines**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__To detect and defeat these threats, force sensors and weapons will be integrated to produce battlespace dominance on, above, and below the sea. This is a challenging goal because sensors and weapons in the littoral environment have limited ranges as a result of environmental conditions and the clutter of maritime traffic. **The most effective approach to countering these limitations is to network large numbers of distributed sensors and weapons**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Navy is pursuing this approach through advanced research and program development. </span>__The key to future effectiveness against modern, quiet diesel submarines in shallow waters once again will be the application of advanced sensor and networking technologies__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. These will contribute to building a common undersea picture that fuses the information from distributed sensors, platforms, and command elements to permit collaborative mission planning and tactical decision making. New, longer-range individual sensors and new acoustic processors on nuclear submarines will complement distributed sensors. In addition, multi-static and advanced signal processing technologies will extract every possible element of information from the surrounding environment, making the water column increasingly transparent. None of these approaches will make anti-submarine warfare easy, but in the aggregate, </span>__these technologies__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, combined with well-trained sailors using realistic simulators to refine their skills, </span>__can sustain assured access for U.S. forces in the face of diesel submarine threats__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Mine warfare is on the verge of a revolution in the U.S. Navy. This decade will see the progressive fielding of new systems that will make mine countermeasure (MCM) capabilities integral to forward-deployed strike groups. While dedicated MCM forces will remain vital to keeping open the sea lines of communication, surface and subsurface combatants will detect and avoid mines on their own, sustaining the critical tempo of operations early in crises. Both dedicated and organic MCM forces will use new generations of sophisticated UUVs—eventually to be joined by unmanned air and surface vehicles—to detect, avoid, and neutralize mines at all depths. Small, fast enemy surface combatants represent another threat to operations in geographically confined areas, where their size and the surrounding clutter of geography and traffic make long-range detection difficult. While destroying these craft in port or at long range is the preferred solution, a dispersed force of smaller surface and air platforms networked with distributed, unmanned sensors, offers promising response capabilities once enemy vessels are under way. Revolutionary new technologies, such as directed-energy weapons, also offer promise as the next generation of systems for precise close-in defense against both combatant craft at sea and waterborne threats to ships pier-side. Extended Homeland Defense. Homeland defense relies on many of the elements that will make SEA SHIELD effective in a forward battlefield environment, such as expanded sensor coverage, increased situational awareness by networking, and rapidly deployable defensive assets and weapon systems. Sharing information with other services and agencies will extend the security boundaries of the United States far seaward, using the time and space afforded by naval forces to shield our nation from impending threats. In close coordination with Northern Command, naval forces will establish comprehensive maritime domain awareness, to include the tracking of surface vessels, aircraft, and subsurface units approaching the United States. Interagency communication reach-back systems will send the latest intelligence to and from naval assets. This will integrate afloat forces into joint, interagency, and civil efforts to a far greater degree than today, providing the situational awareness, agility, and timeliness so vital to countering terrorist threats. Key homeland defense assets in years ahead will include ballistic missile defense ships, U.S. Coast Guard Deepwater units, the new Multi-Mission Aircraft, and the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance UAV that will provide long-dwell coverage of very large areas of the ocean because of its high-resolution sensors and unprecedented flight endurance. The Chief of Naval Operations has tasked Commander, Third Fleet, to work in concert with Commander, Seventh Fleet, to accelerate the development of all facets of SEA SHIELD. </span>__Yesterday's Navy defended itself and the sea lines of communication. Tomorrow's Navy will do much more. **It will provide assured access for joint power projection forces** in an environment where threats increasingly hold land bases at risk. It will protect friends and partners from enemies armed with an array of advanced and deadly weapons. And it will provide the first, critical layer of defense against asymmetric threats to the U.S. homeland__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. SEA SHIELD will extend homeland defense, sustain access to contested littorals, and project security deep inland. In short, SEA SHIELD will provide the capabilities needed for the United States </span>**__to deter, dissuade, and decisively defeat adversaries__** **__in the decades ahead, providing stability and security__** __in an uncertain century__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Each of the services has come in for its share of such criticism since 1991; in many instances it’s justified. Gates’s goal of cutting the defense budget is also not necessarily objectionable in and of itself. And the goal of streamlining and improving our weapon systems to meet emerging threats, rather than remaining stuck on old concepts, is always appropriate. But everything has to be done on the basis of a valid understanding of the threat – and that’s where Gates’s remarks are jarringly ill-timed. </span>__There is **a greater threat to US maritime dominance** than Somali piracy. It has been on display this spring in multiple theaters. The threat **is regional navies establishing maritime power over the** seas and **chokepoints through which global commerce passes**, and setting up arbitrary regimes of regulation and permission. The two most obvious actors in this regard are Iran and China. **Iran chose unilaterally to detain and inspect** two foreign **merchant ships** in the Strait of Hormuz during her big military exercise in April__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Iranian press has also celebrated two unusual and provocative moves from that exercise and one being held this week. In April, </span>__Iran’s navy **sent** a small reconnaissance **aircraft**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, a Fokker F-27, </span>**__to__** __**make a close approach to**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> USS Eisenhower, </span>**__our__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Nimitz-class </span>**__carrier__** __on station in the Persian Gulf__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In the exercise this week in the Gulf of Oman (the approach to the Strait of Hormuz from outside the Gulf), </span>__Iranian forces **warned** a **US** **reconnaissance aircraft out of the** exercise **area**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__These actions seem minor and incremental__** __because they are. But **small regional navies take such provocative actions against dominant navies only if their national leaders think they can get away with it**. **The more Iran thinks she can get away with, the greater will be the naval force required to counter the provocations**. **If it becomes a naval problem for the US to keep the Strait of Hormuz open to global shipping, the small guns** and low-lethality weapons **suitable for antipiracy operations will be badly outclassed**.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Now that we have outlined what is very close to happening, let us discuss briefly why everything possible should be done to prevent it. In a worst-case scenario, </span>**__the attack will cause a violent reaction from Iran__**__. **Millions of "human wave" Iranian militias will storm into Iraq, and**__ __just as Saddam stopped them with chemical weapons, **the U.S. will stop them with nuclear weapons**, resulting potentially in hundreds of thousands of casualties. **The Middle East will explode, and popular uprisings in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and other countries** with pro-Western governments **could be overtaken by radical regimes**. **Pakistan already has nuclear weapons, and a nuclear conflict could even lead to Russia's and Israel's involvement using nuclear weapons**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In a best-case scenario, the U.S. will destroy all nuclear, chemical, and missile facilities in Iran with conventional and low-yield nuclear weapons in a lightning surprise attack, and Iran will be paralyzed and decide not to retaliate for fear of a vastly more devastating nuclear attack. In the short term, the U.S. will succeed, leaving no Iranian nuclear program, civilian or otherwise. Iran will no longer threaten Israel, a regime change will ensue, and a pro-Western government will emerge. However, </span>**__even in the best-case scenario__**__, the long-term consequences are dire. **The nuclear threshold will have been crossed** by a nuclear superpower against a non-nuclear country. **Many more countries will rush to get their own nuclear weapons** as a deterrent. With no taboo against the use of nuclear weapons, **they will certainly be used again**. **Nuclear conflicts will occur**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> within the next 10 to 20 years, </span>**__and will escalate until much of the world is destroyed__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Extinction</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__Ochs ‘2__** (Richard Ochs, "BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS MUST BE ABOLISHED IMMEDIATELY", 6-9-2002, [[http://www.freefromterror.net/other_articles/abolish.html]])</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">The failure of the FBI to prosecute the perpetrator of the anthrax letters even though the FBI is believed to know who it is has led several experts to conclude that the perpetrator is untouchable because he has knowledge damaging to the government. That knowledge is believed to be the US violation of the 1972 Convention on Biological Weapons, which states that it is illegal to "develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire" such weapons. The US is using state-of-the-art genetic splicing to make designer bioweapons. An article by Laura Rozen in Salon (2/8/02) revealed that the "Defense Intelligence Agency hired Battelle to create a genetically enhanced version of anthrax" even though no vaccine was proven to be effective beforehand. A former Clinton administration official, Elisa D. Harris, "was shocked to read in the New York Times" (9/4/01) about bioweapons research "that she herself had not known about, although she had served for eight years in the White House as the point person for weapons of mass destruction nonproliferation issues."What other secret, illegal and genetically modified bioweapons are in the works? If we are told "none," why should we believe anything they tell us? </span>**__Of all the weapons of mass destruction__**__, the genetically engineered **biological weapons**, many without a known cure or vaccine, **are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a "nuclear winter," resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons,**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> on the other hand, </span>**__can get out of control very easily__****__, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions__**__. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause.__ <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, </span>**__bio-engineered agents__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">by the hundreds with no known cure</span> __**could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation**.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? </span>**__HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Ironically, the Bush administration has just changed the U.S. nuclear doctrine to allow nuclear retaliation against threats upon allies by conventional weapons. The past doctrine allowed such use only as a last resort when our nation’s survival was at stake. Will the new policy also allow easier use of US bioweapons? How slippery is this slope? Against this tendency can be posed a rational alternative policy. </span>__To preclude possibilities of human extinction, "patriotism" needs to be redefined to make humanity’s survival primary and absolute. Even if we lose our cherished freedom, our sovereignty, our government or our Constitution, where there is life, there is hope. What good is anything else if humanity is extinguished?__ <span style="font-size: 7pt;">This concept should be promoted to the center of national debate. For example, for sake of argument, suppose the ancient Israelites developed defensive bioweapons of mass destruction when they were enslaved by Egypt. Then suppose these weapons were released by design or accident and wiped everybody out? </span>__As bad as slavery is, extinction is worse__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Our generation, our century, our epoch needs to take the long view. We truly hold in our hands the precious gift of all future life. Empires may come and go, but who are the honored custodians of life on earth? Temporal politicians? Corporate competitors? Strategic brinksmen? Military gamers? Inflated egos dripping with testosterone? How can any sane person believe that national sovereignty is more important than survival of the species? Now that extinction is possible, our slogan should be "Where there is life, there is hope." No government, no economic system, no national pride, no religion, no political system can be placed above human survival. The egos of leaders must not blind us. </span></span>

Even more, it is an essential element of an effective grand strategy, along with a strong economy and useful alliances.

Several obvious US national security imperatives are made possible by preponderant American Seapower. Seapower Enables the Homeland Defense “Away Game”.

Seapower Enables Diplomacy, Development and Defense. </span>**__American Seapower is the global guarantor of freedom of commerce on the world’s oceans, thereby promoting American economic stability and growth__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This role has been played before in history by the Portuguese, the Dutch </span>**__and__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the British, but never before has it been played by a nation without imperial or colonial aspirations.

Additionally, America’s diplomatic power is increasingly enabled by its Seapower<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, a symbiotic relationship reminiscent of US foreign policy conduct throughout much of its pre-World War II history.

===Second B: Cyber-terrorism=== 

Only the plan ensures control of the nuclear force is resilient to cyber attacks

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">"The team of folks behind the first AEHF mission is a great set of Americans who have dedicated many years of their life to put this satellite into orbit," said Col. Michael Sarchet, commander of the Protected Satellite Communications Group at the Space and Missile Systems Center. "</span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is a very sophisticated satellite because it </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">is</span>__****__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">built to provide the highest levels of protection</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> for our nation's most critical users. **Encryption, low probability of intercept and detection, jammer resistance** and the ability to penetrate the electro-magnetic interference caused by nuclear weapons are essential features when communication can be of the highest priority</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">," said Sarchet. This maiden AEHF bird should be ready, if all goes well, to enter service early next year from an orbital location dictated by the needs at that time. [Most Destructive Space Weapon Concepts] Controllers plan to spend the next 100 days or so using the craft's conventional and exotic ion propulsion systems to circularize the orbit 22,300 miles over the equator at 90 degrees West longitude for months-long testing. Built in a collaboration between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, this and </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">future AEHF spacecraft will replace **the aging Milstar satellite fleet** to provide faster communications simultaneously to more users</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> through modernized technology. "It really does mark a new era for us. Milstar was the first protected (communications satellite) system that we ever put up and it's done a great job for us. We launched the first one back in February 1994. If you add up all the on-orbit life of the five vehicles up there operating, we've got over 56 years experience with </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Milstar</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">," said Col. William Harding, the Military Satellite Communications Systems Wing vice commander at Los Angeles Air Force Base. "But it </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">is getting older. All five of the spacecraft are past their 7-year mean mission duration and two of them **are past their** 10-year **design life**</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">it's time to move on to the next version -- AEHF</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">." Designers say </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">one AEHF spacecraft has more capacity than Milstar's</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> five-satellite **constellation combined and** its **faster data rates** will benefit tactical military communications, enabling higher quality maps, targeting data and live video to be transmitted without being detected by the enemy</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. "</span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> also **will provide** a five-fold increase in the numbers of communication coverage opportunities</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> so that more terminals spread over more of the globe will be able to access more communications resources," Harding said. The new satellites will be crosslinked with the existing Milstars, and the AEHF are compatible with existing user equipment. "</span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The benefits also include</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> use of small terminals that can provide high data rate channels, </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">resilience against electronic warfare and cyber attack, and survivable</span>__****__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">, high availability communications connections across the full spectrum of military operations</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> from peacetime training to nuclear warfare</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">," Sarchet said. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF was envisioned to keep communications flowing between the military and civilian leadership in any extreme wartime environment, giving the U.S. information superiority</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Communications relayed through AEHF can include critical support to Special Operations, situational awareness for Army troops, giving last-minute targeting information to en-route Air Force fighters and transmitting Tomahawk missile updates to the Navy</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">For the nation's nuclear forces, these hardened satellites would be the communications lifeline for crisis response and war planning in the most dire circumstances imaginable</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. "</span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Communications links for control of the U.S. nuclear force</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, force direction from the president of the United States, missile attack early warning, missile defense, communications support to Special Operations and high-speed anti-jam protected communications for tactical forces," said Sarchet. Milstar and its </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> successor </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">are far different from the other types of communications satellites operated by the military</span>__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Navy-led </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">UHF</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> system </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">provides mobile communications to a large number of user terminals but at low data rates</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Extinction
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Morgan ‘9</span>__**<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (Dennis Ray Morgan, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, South Korea, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race,” Futures, 41(10), December 2009, ScienceDirect)</span></span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what most terrorists obviously already know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange. As Moore points out, all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States” [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities [10]. In that case, of course, Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on. **Any** accident, **mistaken communication**, false signal</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or “lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">could, in a matter of</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> a few **minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons**, and **once a weapon is used**, then **the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is** actually **less probable** since **each country would act under the “use them or lose them” strategy** and psychology; **restraint by one power would be interpreted as** a **weakness** by the other, **which could be exploited as a window of opportunity** to “win” the war</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In other words, </span>__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">once Pandora's Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, “everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self-determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors” In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and </span>**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">once even just one is used, it is very likely that</span>__**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> many, if not **all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of** much of **human civilization** while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter</span>__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span>

===Contention 3 is Acquisition Reform=== 

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Defense acquisitions can’t keep pace with global threats – ensures loss of military technological leadership</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">__The world is an unpredictable and dangerous place__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In 1919, a group of men gathered to sign an armistice to close the “war to end all wars.” A short two decades later, the world was fighting an even broader and bloodier war. In the mid-1970s, Iran, a staunch U.S. ally, was the strongest regional power in the Gulf. Five years later, the Shah had been deposed, Iran was in the midst of an anti-western revolution, and U.S. citizens were being held hostage. In 1989, the Berlin Wall separated East from West, and at Dick Cheney’s confirmation as Secretary of Defense, no one even mentioned Iraq (“Background Briefing,” 2001). One year later, the Berlin Wall was down and American forces were toe-to-toe with an 800,000-man Iraqi army. On September 10, 2001, the greatest national concern was the health of the stock market and which dot.com company would be the next to go under. On September 11, everything changed. </span>**__Global instability, nuclear proliferation, and__** **__ongoing armed conflicts around the world threaten U.S. security__**__. More ominously, **such instability and global warfare appear to be growing at an alarming pace**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Defense Acquisition and the Changing Environment </span>**__Yet, defense acquisition appears to be ill prepared to respond__** __to many of the rapidly emerging challenges. As a poignant example, improvised explosive devices were killing soldiers and Marines in Iraq, but the solution—a heavily armored Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle—remained bogged down in a peacetime acquisition system__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> until heroic, high-level efforts broke through the bureaucratic obstacles (DeCamp, 2007; Feickert, 2008). On April 6, 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert </span>__Gates refused to buy additional lots of F-22 fighter jets, designed for the Cold War and stuck in a 20-year developmentto-delivery cycle__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Gates, 2009). At some point, </span>**__the question arises as to whether our defense acquisition process can ever be as responsive as necessary to rapidly changing global threats, or whether__**__, after all is said and done, **its application to today’s acquisition environment is largely irrelevant and perhaps itself a danger**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Has defense acquisition always been this problematic, or are we in a particularly difficult transition period? Certainly, defense acquisition has always been hard. The first ship procurements for the U.S. Navy in the 1790s experienced cost and schedule overruns, congressional lobbying, and technology overreach (Toll, 2006). But, the nation rebounded to produce resounding achievements such as the nuclear powered submarine, the intercontinental ballistic missile, and, of course, the Manhattan Project. These programs all were begun in response to significant global changes and dangerous emerging threats. Defense acquisition has shown tremendous responsiveness, when the need arises, to provide game-changing innovations that transform the trajectory of warfare. </span></span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The plan spurs broader adoption of evolutionary acquisition</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__Butler ‘11__** (Amy Butler, Aviation Week, “U.S. Military Space Budget Boosted,” 2-18-2011, http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&id=news/awst/2011/02/21/AW_02_21_2011_p31-290680.xml&headline=U.S.%20Military%20Space%20Budget%20Boosted)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">__The Pentagon’s first National Security Space Strategy and its recently released budget request for space are attempting **to prioritize procurement** and operations **after a decade of problematic performance**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. But work still needs to be done. </span>__The Air Force’s unclassified space budget saw a nearly 10% boost in fiscal 2012__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">—to $8.7 billion—from the $8 billion request in fiscal 2011. A portion of this is intended to increase and stabilize the buy of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV) as the government assumes the role of sole supporter of the United Launch Alliance and its massive industrial base in light of an unrealized commercial market. </span>__Even with the boost in funding__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. James Cartwright says that </span>__the projects now scheduled are impossible to execute within the current planning figures__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This, he says, underscores the need to work with international partners in areas such as space situational awareness, communications and, perhaps, shared missile warning. “We still can’t afford most of the constellations we have up there. . . . At some point you have to come to a position of partnering” to share the financial burden, Cartwright said last week. “We have this construct where we believe everything has got to come from us . . . but we fight in combined constructs” on the ground, at sea and in the air. He advocates for trust with partners to also provide key pieces of space capabilities—such as augmented intelligence collection and, possibly, precision navigation and timing signals. He stopped short, however, of suggesting that the Pentagon could curtail its buy of Global Positioning System III satellites, being developed by Lockheed Martin; this request is for $978 million in development and procurement. Perhaps underscoring the fact that Pentagon leadership still lacks a unified view on this subject, Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn notes that some missions will continue to be handled solely by the U.S., though the “goal is to move away from the world where the U.S. develops unilateral strategy.” Thus, his focus appears to be more on collaboration rather than interdependence. </span>__Another initiative in the National Security Space Strategy is to improve support for the space industrial base, which experts worry has atrophied since the end of the Cold War__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Lynn says </span>__the U.S. is still the top provider of space capabilities, but__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> that </span>__its share of the market is waning. Previously, the U.S. comprised about 66% of the space market; that figure is now less than 40%__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__The Air Force’s approach for military space spending is to buy smarter, beginning with more stable and predictable funding__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Gone are the days when the Air Force would simply put a “wedge” of funding into the budget for a program without fully understanding the out-year financial impact. “We need to fully fund programs,” says Maj. Gen. John Hyten, space program director for the Air Force acquisition office. “We don’t want to just put numbers in the budget.” </span>__Included in the fiscal 2012 budget request is a new strategy to procure satellites, the__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency (</span>__EASE__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">) </span>__buy of__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Advanced, Extremely High-Frequency (</span>__AEHF__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">) </span>__and__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Space-Based Infrared System (</span>__Sbirs) satellites__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, both produced at Lockheed Martin’s Sunnyvale, Calif., facility. </span>__The three-pronged EASE strategy includes stable funding for a block buy of two of each satellite type; parallel funding provided separately for continued product improvement and research work__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (including competitive projects) </span>__for the next-generation upgrades or designs; and parallel work on the mission area’s architecture__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__Implementation of the procurement portion of EASE is fashioned somewhat after multi-year buys for aircraft. The goal is to incrementally fund buys of two satellites at a time to keep a stable stream of income for the prime contractor and its base of subcontractors, all of which lead to some savings__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As with aircraft procurements, the goal is to achieve at least 10% savings in the cost of the satellites, but Hyten believes they can get even lower than that. “You take the savings that you find in terms of lower cost on the satellite and reinvest them through a capabilities improvement program,” says Erin Conaton, undersecretary of the Air Force. The Air Force would traditionally spend about $4 billion buying AEHF 5 and 6, Hyten says. In fiscal 2012, it is requesting $550 million as an initial payment for these two satellites; additional funding would be requested up through fiscal 2017 to complete the buys. The Sbirs block buy would follow, beginning in fiscal 2013. The request related to EASE in fiscal 2012 is for $185 million. A major chunk, $550 million, would be requested in fiscal 2013 with five more years of additional funding to complete the buy. </span>__Though multi-year funding has become a regular practice for military aircraft production, lawmakers might eye an incremental satellite funding strategy with more skepticism. The Air Force lacks examples of satellite programs delivering on time and cost, and lawmakers are leery of obligating future funds for projects. “**This is asking Congress to do business in a different way**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">,” Hyten says. Conaton says </span>**__AEHF__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">and Sbirs</span> __**were** both **at key points in their production cycles, allowing for them to serve as the pathfinders for EASE**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Throughout World War II, Vannevar Bush directed the immensely successful Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). The agency was winding down when, in fall 1946, Bush articulated his startling observation: World War II was the first war in human history to be affected decisively by weapons unknown at the outbreak of hostilities. This is probably the most significant military fact of our decade: that </span>__upon the current evolution of the instrumentalities of war, the strategy and tactics of warfare must now be conditioned.

During the 1990s, armies throughout most of the world were not posted on front lines engaging in mortal combat, nor were the inhabitants of great nations living in constant fear of immediate and deadly attack__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Societies were stable, and people throughout most of the world went about their daily lives unfettered by external military threats. </span>__This did not mean__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, however, </span>__that humankind had eradicated armed conflict, nor that conflicting national vital interests would never again lead to global wars.

Indeed, on September 11, 2001, a new episode of active conflict was begun. With the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York and the attacks on the Pentagon and aboard United Flight 93, a new wave of asymmetric violence was unleashed on the world. </span>**__The global security environment is ever changing, and__** **__all aspects of our military structure are undergoing dramatic transformations to remain at the vanguard of peace and security__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

This chapter examines four R&D issues that enable rapid procurement and introduces a few policy options available to ensure that advanced technology development remains available to defense planners. We examine the role of the internal defense R&D infrastructure, the industrial R&D infrastructure, and the processes that have been established to link R&D outputs closely with rapid procurement, fielding of new technologies and systems, and the effect of major program acquisition strategies on research and development. Background What was startling and revolutionary 55 years ago is ordinary and commonplace today. </span>__New instrumentalities of war are routinely introduced into each new conflict. Weapons, tactics, and strategies that were introduced into one conflict may be decisive factors in the next war and be mainstream tools by the following one__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Concepts that are decisive in a target-rich environment require fundamentally different tools in a target-sparse environment. </span>__The rest of the world studies U.S. procedures and develops asymmetrical responses for the next conflict__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In short, although the arms race associated with the attrition-based strategy of the Cold War era may be over, </span>__the technological race associated with the information-based strategy of the current era is just beginning. If the technology gap is sufficiently large, information-based strategies may prove decisive in network-centric warfare environments. Should this gap close, with the adversary successfully utilizing symmetric information warfare strategies or asymmetric strategies, the network-centric environment collapses and becomes a classical attrition-warfare environment. **Maintaining a U.S. advantage requires constant improvements, which depend** in turn **on r**esearch **and d**evelopment__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Internal Research and Development Infrastructure Since the earliest days of the Nation, the military services have owned and operated their own internal R&D facilities in conjunction with the old arsenal system. Today, all of the services have organizations that sponsor and facilities that perform science and technology (S&T) research. The Army Research Laboratory, the Naval Research Laboratory, and the Air Force Research Laboratory are the core internal S&T labs for their respective services. The Office of Naval Research and the Offices of Scientific Research for the Army and Air Force sponsor S&T research, utilizing universities to conduct most of the research. In addition to the primary S&T labs, all of the services also operate a number of research facilities tied to their system acquisition commands. For example, the Naval Sea Systems Command manages the labs associated with the Naval Surface Warfare Center and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. The Army’s Tank and Automotive Command manages a vehicle R&D lab; the Air Force manages aeronautics and avionics R&D labs throughout the country. The daily activities at the in-house defense research laboratories are governed by three key forces: priorities and policies established by the chain-of-command authorities, program requirements established by paying sponsors, and external constraints such as environmental limitations imposed by other regulatory and policymaking organizations. By controlling or influencing any or all of these elements, the Army, Navy, and Air Force can influence their laboratories to serve their current and emerging priorities. However, even in a single service, no single person or institution controls all three of these forces. As a result, a dynamic mix of competing forces combines to form a swirl of ever-changing activity at each of the research labs. It is precisely this high level of seemingly chaotic activity that, when properly managed, gives the labs an exceptional degree of agility and flexibility. These qualities allow the labs, quickly and efficiently, to create, analyze, and synthesize new ideas and concepts that become the bases of new and innovative military systems. This same behavior, if not skillfully administered, can also lead to inefficiencies, irrelevancies, and redundancies within the labs. Thus, the service laboratories’ ability to perform their critical role—bonding military requirements, scientific knowledge, and technological innovation to create useful and achievable military system concepts—depends directly on their leaders’ ability to balance the multiplicity of forces acting on their labs. These internal R&D labs have traditionally focused their efforts on supporting the major acquisition programs within their parent commands. As military transformation progresses, all the services are generating radically new system requirements. To support the emerging military missions outlined in chapter 1, smaller, lighter, and more agile major systems are being demanded throughout the military. As discussed in more detail in chapter 2, the sensing, communication, and information processing subsystem requirements necessary to support the major systems are also being rapidly transformed, demanding the latest cutting-edge technologies to sustain them. The rapid pace of technological advancement and of identifying emerging system and subsystem requirements to support the military transformation is redefining the role of internal defense research facilities. Scientists are being called upon to examine new areas of study, to focus on extremely rapid transition from concept to fielded system, and to integrate modern high-tech concepts with legacy fleet systems. This approach presents a dilemma analogous to issues faced in the procurement world. In the constrained resource environment of the defense laboratory system, spending funds on improving legacy systems leaves little money to fund leading-edge transformation-enabling technologies. If the funds are diverted to transformation-enabling technologies, legacy improvement research is curtailed. Since the source of funding for the labs is usually major system program offices, almost all of which are developing systems introduced before DOD embarked on its current military transformation process, the labs are often directed to focus their expertise on legacy and evolutionary improvement programs. To change this focus, new sources of funding must be identified, or funding from legacy-related systems must be redirected. Both these cases present issues that are extremely complex but that must be overcome by the research facilities. For example, people, skills, and facilities may be mismatched as a laboratory changes its focus. The testing facilities important for the development of tracked vehicles may be a burden to maintain as the research shifts to developing wheeled vehicles. People with vast experience developing avionics for manned aircraft may be less capable of conducting leading-edge research in avionics for unmanned aircraft. In light of all these issues, attention must be paid to maintaining the true technological leadership needed to enable the ongoing military transformation. Technological Leadership </span>__Maintaining a true technological lead, as a nation, is a very complex process. It requires continuous, careful orchestration of numerous enterprises, both public and private__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Over 4,000 governmental organizations in the United States sponsor or conduct scientific research;2 DOD alone accounts for over 700 of them. Almost 2,000 U.S. university facilities are involved in the conduct of scientific research.3 In 1947, DOD was spending around $3 billion for R&D activities. Today, it spends around $48 billion per year.4 Although this level of spending should be sufficient to keep the military equipped and trained to use systems at the leading edge of technology, many disparate forces keep us from reaching that elusive goal. Because the $48 billion is spread across many organizations and is managed by many different constituencies, appropriating the level of funding necessary to carry out adequate and timely research for a specific project is often difficult. In addition, </span>__since Federal funding of research is an element of the political process, **funding decisions are made on an annual basis**, sometimes **to the detriment of the long-term stability of the project’s funding**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Workforce Issues Workforce issues of particular concern include the aging of a trained and expert workforce without replenishment; pay disparities at entry level, compared to the private sector; a less-than-optimal apprenticeship or mentoring system; and decaying infrastructure. Aging Workforce Since World War II, government laboratories have hired scientists and engineers in waves. Major hiring occurred in the late 1940s and early 1950s as the defense establishments sought to capture the expertise developed during the war and to follow the guidance of research policy experts to strengthen the permanent research establishment lest the country face another deficit of science like that encountered before the war. Another significant hiring spell took place during the early 1960s as the Soviet launch of Sputnik led to a national focus on science and engineering as the solution to society’s ills. The government found a window of opportunity to hire another wave of researchers in the early 1970s as the commercial market for these professionals dried up and vast numbers were laid off as a result of the dramatic decline of the aerospace industry. When the Vietnam War was in full swing, the government had an immediate need for scientific and engineering talent but had a difficult time competing with the aerospace and burgeoning electronics industries for workers. When the commercial industries collapsed, the government took advantage of the situation and filled its labs with new talent. There was another small window of hiring during the early 1980s as President Ronald Reagan led a dramatic defense buildup. The early 1990s saw a small bulge in hiring to begin replacing retiring scientists and engineers who had been hired in the late 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. However, it did not begin to approach the necessary replenishment level. Entry-Level Pay Disparity Since the first Bush administration, the wide pay disparity at the entry-level and early-career level between engineers and scientists employed in the Federal Government and those employed in the private sector has been recognized. This incongruity was particularly acute during the high-tech boom of the 1990s. Starting salaries for government employees were 20 to 40 percent lower than those offered by the high-tech industry, whose appetite for technical talent seemed insatiable. This phenomenon was not limited to government employees; it affected the private-sector defense industry as well. Since many major defense contractors use pay scales closely associated with their counterpart government partners, they too had great difficulty attracting new entry-level technical talent for their research positions. Even universities found themselves losing the hiring competition for newly graduated scientists and engineers. The salaries and benefits that Internet startup companies offered were so great that new graduates naturally gravitated toward them. In the year 2000, the high-tech boom began to turn to a high-tech bust. The marketplace was oversaturated with venture capital and other investment money. Companies could not always produce what they had promised, and even when they did, consumers did not buy their products. As a result, many high-tech companies went out of business, and thousands of engineers and scientists lost their jobs. Thus, as in the early 1970s when the aerospace industry collapsed, employment with the government and the defense industry (with the long-term stability it has come to represent) once again began to look attractive to engineers and scientists. However, unlike the early 1970s, neither the government nor the defense industry in general was in a hiring mode. They were still responding to the reduced budgets and associated workloads associated with the post-Cold War drawdown. Low Turnover and Poor Apprenticeship Relationships As in many other professions, the ability to conduct scientific research and technology development is fostered through a long apprenticeship program. The scientific method, the basis of scientific study and peer review, is a process that demands that new scientific discoveries build upon the old. Without a continuous flow of new people, knowledge of the art of science cannot be passed from one generation to the next. Since the early 1980s, there have been no significant hiring waves of scientists and engineers, other than the very small one of the early 1990s. Even this period came to an abrupt halt when programs began to be canceled and bases began to be closed as the Cold War came to an end. As a result, members of the scientific and engineering workforce today are on average in their late 40s. Many of these people are in their professional prime. This is the time they should be working with a new crop of apprentices to train the next generation of professionals. However, there are few apprentices on the payroll to work with. With nearly 60 percent of the current workforce eligible to retire within 5 years and very few new scientists entering the system, the defense research establishment is already facing severe problems in keeping up with the latest technologies and scientific discoveries. Decaying Infrastructure Leading-edge enterprises get to the top and stay there by having leading-edge facilities, but scarcity of recapitalization funds and rapid advances in technology complicate the process of keeping the defense research infrastructure current. The budget available to the defense research establishment for overhead, including infrastructure capitalization, is at best stable and is in many cases diminishing. At the same time, lab facilities and equipment are both aging and becoming obsolete. As new technologies are developed, new equipment and advanced facilities are required to pursue research. Advanced visualization tools—for example, those that allow scientists to see the effects of structural modifications on turbulence reductions—greatly enhance the research capability of the lab but cost an enormous amount of money. Such money is not normally budgeted into the research program, but without this equipment, the lab ceases to be a state-of-the-art facility capable of performing leading-edge research. Like the debate in the healthcare industry over how many expensive pieces of equipment are needed in each city and where they should be placed, the defense research establishment is faced with the dilemma of where to situate its scarce infrastructure resources. When a new but very expensive investigative tool is developed that directly supports the defense research mission, where should it be located? The tool could be placed in a government laboratory, with access provided to both university researchers and defense contractor researchers. It could be placed at a university, with access available to government and contractor researchers. It could be placed at contractor facilities, with access granted to both university and government researchers. This debate raises the question of research facility rationalization, part of a larger process: the whole defense establishment in the United States is currently working through the issues associated with infrastructure rationalization. How many military bases should we have to support the future defense force structure? What is the appropriate mix of public and private facilities necessary to support the defense mission? The research establishment is part of this debate. It is looking at issues such as¹what mix of university, private industry, and government research facilities is appropriate and necessary to support the defense research mission of the transforming force structures. Defense Research Industrial Base in Support of Transformation The defense research industrial base is undergoing dramatic changes as rapidly as the internal research infrastructure is. Indeed, the whole defense industrial base is being consolidated and redefined as a result of the post-Cold War defense downsizing. In the early 1990s, the government reassessed its defense procurement requirements and acquisition budgets. As a result, the defense market power shrank relative to the overall economy, and industry reacted by significantly consolidating across many product lines. Only four major prime contractors remain of over 50 separate companies that supported aerospace defense requirements in 1990 (see figure 14-1). Companies in the defense industry reacted to the post-Cold War drawdown by adopting one of three strategies: exiting the military-industrial sector; diversifying into nonmilitary production or services; or remaining in the defense industry and expanding military production. The government reacted by relaxing antitrust rule interpretations, defining competitive markets on a global basis, encouraging global competition, promoting consolidations where economies of scale matter, and transferring system-integration function and expertise from the government to prime contractors. The effect of these practices and policies was to reduce significantly the number of industrial facilities available to engage in defense research. In addition, the government no longer encouraged industrial companies to use their own funds to support research programs with the hope of being rewarded with large procurement contracts. The research and procurement of many systems were decoupled. One other factor influenced industrial research: the consolidation of the industrial base left many of the largest companies with enormous debts that needed to be serviced from their current cash flow. This caused some companies to reduce their internal expenditures—in some cases, research expenditures—in many areas that did not directly contribute to near-term revenue. Both the government and its industrial partners are developing processes to link research activities that support the military transformation process closely to the industrial base that will be required to manufacture the systems and provide them to the deployed forces. Rapid Fielding of New Technologies and Systems During the 1990s, to provide a means for rapidly fielding new concepts, DOD and the services introduced several significant transition processes. In the early 1990s, Advanced Technology Demonstrations were introduced and managed by the individual services to identify and demonstrate technologies that showed great promise to serve urgent operational needs. In 1994, DOD introduced the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTD) program to “allow users to gain an understanding of proposed new capabilities for which there is no user experience base.” The Joint Staff established Joint Experimentation Programs in 1998 to allow operational forces to experiment with novel technological advances to compress the time required to field advanced capabilities. This process provides a means of getting technological advances rapidly into the hands of the fighting forces, even before initiation of formal procurement actions. In addition, in the late 1990s, the Navy introduced the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program to link the research community and the operating forces. Both the Air Force and the Army are currently working on similar programs. At the policy level, the concepts of reconstitution, “develop and hold,” and acquisition reform tended to dominate. Implementation and ramifications of some sort of reconstitution policy set the research agenda. How can the research infrastructure be shaped so that future military systems will retain an enduring technological edge even as the force structure and its supporting elements are being reduced? A proposed solution to this issue was a policy recommendation that the United States continue to develop advanced military systems, bringing them completely through the concept and development phase all the way up to the actual full-scale procurement phase. At this point, the program would be shelved and the system procurement package would await a future time when pressing operational requirements would necessitate actual procurement. This proposed develop-and-hold policy was the source of numerous debates. Neither the operational forces nor the research communities felt it was an optimum solution. From these debates, a new policy issue emerged: How could the research infrastructure, needed as a foundation during some future reconstitution phase, be preserved if current requirements and budgets could not support its ongoing operations? The formal policy of encouraging and even mandating technology transfer to civilian uses emerged as the most promising solution to this issue. Under this scenario, government researchers would develop intellectual property that could be licensed to commercial enterprises in return for a stream of royalty payments made to the government research facility. The nonappropriated, privately secured royalties would be used to help maintain the research facility, supplementing the federally appropriated funds it normally receives for this purpose. Over time, however, it appeared that depending on nondefense organizations to support the defense research infrastructure was not going to be a viable policy. Toward the end of the decade, acquisition reform took hold as the primary formal means of rapidly linking advanced research developments and emerging operational requirements. The acquisition process was to be transformed from a linear sequence—develop, procure, create operational doctrine, and train forces to use the system—to a nonlinear, concurrent process: develop system and doctrine together, procure, and train together. This was aimed at considerably compressing the time from concept identification to actual field operation. Advanced Technology Demonstrations In the early 1990s, the defense research community faced a difficult and unforeseen challenge. Basic and early applied research programs were being reduced in scope or eliminated just as they were reaching maturity. Many new research programs had been started or old ones enhanced during the strong defense buildup of the mid-1980s. By the early 1990s, many of these programs were at the point of fruition but had not yet fully matured when the programs they were meant to support were eliminated. The technology was still showing great promise, but program managers were hard-pressed to show how the fully developed technologies could transition into ongoing procurement programs. Without the ability to show a clear transition path, even very promising research programs were in danger of being canceled. To remedy this, the Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) process was established. The purpose of the ATD process was to identify the most promising technological advancements being made in the ongoing research programs and to fund them fully (around $15 million) for 3 years in order to develop their potential on an extraordinary fast track. Each service allocated a percentage of its annual research budget to fund a few of the highest-priority ATDs. Each service also developed its own method for choosing which programs would be funded as ATDs, but all of them required a firm link between the researchers and potential users of the technology. Most programs funded under the ATD program had a program manager of an ongoing acquisition program who would commit both philosophically and fiscally to use the technology at the end of the ATD program if it lived up to its expectations. Over the years, many successful transitions were made from ATDs to system procurements. For example, the Advanced Enclosed Mast/Sensor built by Ingalls Shipyard and installed on the Navy destroyer USS Radford at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard was developed as an ATD by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division; it is currently specified for inclusion on all LPD-17 class ships.5 Because of the instability of the overall defense procurement budgets, however, some ATDs that were successful as research programs were never fully integrated into procurement programs. Even in these cases, the ATD process proved useful. Researchers were encouraged to meet with acquisition program sponsors and operating forces to examine how advancements in technology could serve the needs of the operating forces. This alone went a long way to help reshape many research programs to be more responsive to emerging operational requirements, even if the proposed ATDs were not approved for funding. Some limitations to the ATD process pointed to the need to reexamine its scope. Although the typical funding of $15 million was a large sum of money for some research programs, it became clear that the ATD process could not fully support advances in computer technology, communications, and data fusion and processing technologies as these grew during the 1990s. Meanwhile, commercial enterprises matured these technologies without defense sponsorship. DOD therefore began looking for ways to capture these new concepts and demonstrate their utility for defense-related requirements. Advanced Concept Technology Development DOD introduced the ACTD program in early 1994 to help encourage and expedite the rapid transition of emerging matured technologies from researchers and developers to the operational users. Since the ACTD process focused on matured technologies, it emphasized technology assessment and integration over technology development. Nonetheless, it served as an interim step from the research lab to the operational field. A typical ACTD lasts about 4 years and operates on a budget of approximately $100 million. Another significant feature of an ACTD is that, by definition, it has some level of jointness built into it. The concept that an ACTD is demonstrating must contribute to the mission of more than one service. Each of the participating services is required to partially fund the program with its own funds. The goal of an ACTD is to provide operational commanders with actual prototypes of advanced systems that demonstrate unique military capabilities. Having prototypes gives the operational commanders a way to evaluate and indeed shape the potential system’s ability to meet operational needs. It also allows commanders to develop and refine a concept of operations to exploit the capability under evaluation. As the operating forces gain experience and understanding of the capability through realistic military demonstrations of prototype systems, they are better able to assess the military efficacy of the proposed capability. A number of successful capabilities have been evaluated and shaped through the ACTD process. The medium-altitude endurance unmanned aerial vehicle, Predator, was one of the earliest ACTDs to be funded. It was flown and operated in Bosnia even before the ACTD was over, and it has been used extensively in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. It has since transitioned into a mainstream acquisition program. The ACTD process has proven quite effective at identifying emerging technological capabilities with high potential operational application. It gives the services an opportunity to test an application before buying it. In the environment of very rapidly changing technology advancements, however, the process can seem slow; one must first build a prototype system, deploy it to the field, develop concepts of operation for its use, conduct operations with the system, and then evaluate its military effectiveness. By the time this process has been completed, it may be difficult and expensive to modify the system to take advantage of the knowledge gained during the demonstration phase. Joint Experimentation Program Toward the end of the decade, the Joint Staff introduced the Joint Experimentation program. The purpose of joint experimentation is to examine new technologies, operational concepts, and force structure (organization) options together rather than in isolation from one another to discover and develop advances in warfighting capabilities. Joint experimentation allows warfighters access to new technologies before systems utilizing them are fully developed. In this way, operational commanders can assess the utility of emerging technologies and modify the technological developments early in the development process so that they will be more useful to the operating forces. The Joint Experimentation Office (J-9) was established in Norfolk, Virginia, to manage the program. It gives the research community a new way to link closely with the operational forces. Concepts identified in the research lab can be introduced into the joint experimentation process even before they are fully developed. This allows the researcher to understand whether the concept is worth pursuing from a military perspective, and, if it is, which aspects should be emphasized. In addition, it allows the operating forces to see developments in the research lab long before they are available for field use. This gives forces the opportunity to begin developing doctrine and training programs while the concept is still being developed. It also allows the operational forces to have more direct input into the direction that research programs will take. All three of these technology transition processes have helped both the researchers and the operational forces link to focus their efforts and set priorities for the use of scarce research budgets. They are only really effective at advancing operational capabilities if they are closely linked to the acquisition and procurement process. If great new technologies and capabilities are identified and developed but not procured and fielded, the operational forces cannot take advantage of their capabilities. Acquisition Reform Throughout the past decade, </span>__acquisition reform has changed the way DOD procures and fields new systems. **Technology was improving so rapidly that** **the traditional acquisition process could not keep pace**. **New** platforms and **systems were being delivered with technology that was obsolete**, expensive to operate, and difficult to maintain__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Utilization of commercial off-the-shelf components made defense systems more dependent on commercial spare parts inventories, and when commercial companies changed their products, defense systems were no longer supportable. To compress the time from approval of an acquisition program to fielding of the operational system and thus speed the time for development, new initiatives were introduced into the acquisition process. </span>__Under the traditional acquisition process, systems were procured in a sequence. First research was done, then the engineering completed, then the system went into production, and finally the system was evaluated by the operating forces and integrated into operational capabilities__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This process was useful when the technology being integrated into new systems had not yet matured because it ensured that only fully developed technologies were embedded into new systems. However, as ATDs and ACTDs as well as commercial technological advancements began to yield new concepts faster than the traditional process could accommodate them, a new process of concurrent development had to be introduced. Utilizing concurrent development, integrated engineering (supported by ongoing research) and production occurred simultaneously. Like the traditional process, the introduction into operational doctrine and training programs took place after the system was placed in the field. Although this speeded up the process, operational forces had few feedback loops to the developers to help shape the systems to the operators’ needs. This process did, however, allow the efficient integration of ATDs and ACTDs into the acquisition process. After the Joint Experimentation program was introduced, the acquisition process was modified to allow for direct transition from ATDs and ACTDs into production, coupled closely with user input throughout the process. Utilizing an experimentation-demonstration-acquisition process, integrated engineering (supported by ongoing research) and operational evaluation occur simultaneously. Only after the system is refined through the interaction of both the users and the developers is it put into production. Production runs are scheduled and the system is designed so that the latest technology can be integrated into the system during each succeeding run. This methodology links the researchers, developers, and users as never before. Future Naval Capabilities In the late 1990s, the Navy introduced a new process for closely coupling its research activity with the requirements of its operating forces. Supporting all of the ongoing research activities at levels high enough to ensure that significant progress could be achieved in time to influence high-priority naval requirements was impossible with the limited research resources available. To direct its scarce resources, the Navy established the Future Naval Capabilities program. Senior leadership of both the research and the operations communities meet to establish several specific research priorities. This priority-setting process enables the Navy to focus its resources and attention on significant projects. The close coupling of the research and operations community ensures that the research directly supports emerging operational requirements and the Navy transformation process. The Army, through its Future Combat System focus, and the Air Force, through its Lightning Bolts and Agile Acquisition initiatives, are currently employing comparable priority-setting procedures within their research communities. Acquisition Strategy and Research and Development </span>__Many platform acquisition programs are experimenting with practices derived from private industry, delegating the jobs of developing, identifying, and specifying advanced technological solutions to the prime contractor__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Rather than specifying the details of platform procurement, the government sets the performance specification and asks the prime vendor to deliver a platform that performs as requested. Private industry uses this process as the primary means of acquisition, paying the vendor only after the product is tested and delivered. In contrast, the government usually pays the vendor progress payments, so that by the end of the procurement, the vendor has been paid 90 percent of the cost of the item. Under this practice, the government assumes the risk of, but does not have the same level of control over, the internal decisions. An attribute of the new acquisition strategy is that the government assigns the role of product and process development, including the supporting research, to the prime vendor. Research funds that in the past were provided to in-house government research laboratories are now given directly to the prime vendors. This process has both positive and negative attributes. Directly funding the prime vendors assures a very close coupling of the research with product development. It enables the prime vendor to have full control of the research priorities and ensures that the research is focused on current requirements. In contrast, when government labs perform research without prime vendor interaction, the coupling between the progress and results of the research and the needs of the prime vendor may be weak. Differences in management structures have meant that research and production schedules are not always synchronized as well as they could be. Direct funding of research by vendors also produces a few areas of concern for defense research. Three issues include technology migration to other programs, strategic integration across services, and long-term technological stewardship. When research is conducted in a government facility, the results of that research usually are available to any government program that can utilize them. In contrast, the results of research conducted in a private facility utilizing program-specific funding may not be available to competing programs or vendors. In fact, the results may not even be made public; complementing programs might not know they exist. This secrecy has the effect of limiting and constraining technology migration that might otherwise accrue to government-funded research. In the same vein, funding vendors for program-specific research may complicate government efforts to rationalize and prioritize its research programs across all of the military services. Coordinating research programs among the Army, Navy, and Air Force enables all of the services to take advantage of advanced technologies developed by any one of them. To keep the close contact across the services that this type of coordination requires, new management processes will need to be established that recognize the vendors’ role in research priority-setting. DOD and the services’ in-house research laboratories have traditionally been the long-term stewards of the technological disciplines associated with their missions. In between major acquisitions programs, in-house laboratories keep a workforce current with the latest techniques and processes so that when the next program begins, the research does not need to start again. Research is a continuous process, requiring continuity of knowledge, processes, and techniques—and of personnel and the mentor-apprenticeship relationship discussed above. If each new research program is placed at a different facility, based solely on the identity of the prime contractor of a major acquisition program, this continuity will be broken. Diminished Paths for Transition The defense drawdown associated with the end of the Cold War decreased the number of platforms being developed. As a result, there are fewer sponsors of platform-associated research and fewer transition paths for research results to migrate. A typical measure of the effectiveness of a research establishment is how well it contributes to new products. If only one ship is being designed at any one time and a number of organizations are developing new technologies for ships, most of the new concepts will not be integrated into that new class of ship because of scheduling and cost constraints. Thus, utilizing traditional metrics, many of the research programs will be deemed failures due to their inability to transition to production in the near term, even if they have made great scientific or technological discoveries. This stigmatization is an artifact of the different timelines associated with research and acquisition. Research operates in an extended timeframe. Discoveries made today may not be utilized for decades, until some other enabling development allows their potential to be fully exploited. But, when new findings are finally incorporated, they may enable profound advancements in the final products into which they are imbedded. Acquisition programs, on the other hand, operate over relatively shorter time periods. A research program that cannot provide results in time to meet the acquisition program’s tight development schedule will not be utilized in that program. Since, by definition, research discoveries cannot be guaranteed to meet a production schedule, most of the research must be accomplished before the acquisition program needs the results. Often, the basic research must be completed before the acquisition program begins so that the technology developed by the research program can be integrated into a new product. The effect of these different timeframes, coupled with the policy of assigning the research role to the prime vendors, yields another area of concern in the ability of the research establishment to support the ongoing defense transformation. If prime vendors of major acquisition programs are also the primary performers of defense research, new processes will need to be established to ensure continuity of research during the period between acquisition programs. In addition, new processes will need to be established to ensure that the results of government-funded research are made available to all users, not just the single prime vendor who performs the research. While some acquisition programs use direct-vendor funding of research, the practice is not ubiquitous. In many situations, both government in-house laboratories and prime-vendor facilities are performing complementary research. A mix of government, private, and university research is the result. Balancing these to support the transformation of the services is the major challenge of the near future. Business Model While the defense acquisition community is working to ensure that its research establishment is shaped and focused to support the military transformation process, private nondefense high-technology companies are also reexamining their research processes. A primary focus is on rationalizing the “make-versus-buy” decision. Many of the largest and most successful industrial companies, such as RCA and Xerox, have begun divesting themselves of their in-house dedicated research laboratories, while others such as IBM and General Electric continue to support and depend on their world-renowned in-house research facilities. In fast-growing industries, especially the electronics industry, large corporations are increasingly looking outside their walls for new products and processes to offer their customers. For example, other companies initially developed many of the products that are now in Microsoft’s inventory. Like almost all high-tech companies, Microsoft has a staff whose mission is to search the outside world and identify products, processes, services, and companies that complement their product line. When they find something they like, they purchase the rights to use it in Microsoft’s inventory; in some cases, Microsoft purchases the whole company to get access to the new technology. Many opportunities exist for DOD to use this practice to satisfy its technology requirements by looking to independent entrepreneurs and nondefense-related industries for already developed advanced technologies. Policy Options Successful transformation of the military to a knowledge-based force structure requires new operational concepts, new equipment to support them, and new training processes to integrate the operational concepts and advanced equipment with the fighting forces. </span>__Maintaining the technological lead in the U.S. military means that all three factors—concepts, equipment, and training—must be on the forward edge of technology__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Force planners and concept generators must understand what advanced technology solutions can offer, while technologists must comprehend the requirements of emerging operational concepts. Both force planners and technologists need to work with the force trainers to ensure that the fighting forces know how to carry out the advanced operational concepts using advanced equipment suites. </span>__Continuously integrating advanced operational concepts supported by the most advanced technological equipment into U.S. fighting forces is key to sustaining their competitive advantage__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Over the past 50 years, the United States has developed a research and technology infrastructure to nurture and sustain advanced technological development related to the military mission. Many processes were developed to enhance the efficiency of technological transition from the lab to the fighting forces. This is a continuous process that evolves with the changing environment. The most important issue in the current environment, from the technological perspective, is ensuring that forces have operational concepts that enable them to perform their mission and that they have the equipment that most efficiently supports their needs. A fighting unit in the heat of battle does not care who invented the technology they are using or who perfected its integration into warfighting equipment—only that they have it, it works, and they know how to use it. In light of all of the issues and obstacles described in this chapter, it is the responsibility of both the operating and the technology communities to develop processes and procedures aimed at supporting future operations efficiently. Technologists from all different environments must participate. In-house government research labs must identify and integrate advanced technological concepts into advanced fighting equipment to support advanced operational concepts. Universities and other private research organizations participate by conducting the basic-level scientific research from which advanced technological solutions to emerging problems could be developed. Defense contractors take part in developing and incorporating advanced technological concepts into the weapons and platform systems they design and build. Nondefense industrial enterprises have a role to play in inventing and developing advanced technological concepts that, even while supporting their own industries, can be carried over to serve defense requirements. Although many of the policies and processes currently in place remain important and serve to manage the technological integration process, a few improvements should be considered, especially in the areas of workforce stability and integration, as well as technology identification and integration. Workforce Stability and Integration The defense community is facing a crisis concerning its technological workforce as a result of the salary disparity with nondefense private industry and previous hiring patterns. Many senior technologists may leave defense service in the near future, and the mentor-apprentice chain will be broken. The government can do a few things about this.6 Many initiatives related to pay levels and monetary incentives are under consideration already. Supporting these incentives alone is not sufficient. In light of the new environment in which prime vendors are increasingly being assigned more responsibilities with respect to technological development and integration, the government should institute processes that foster mentor-apprenticeships across organizational boundaries. For example, junior engineers and scientists employed by government research labs should be assigned as apprentices to senior technologists and developers employed by prime vendors. Employees of prime vendors should be placed as interns and fellows at government or university facilities. During periods of intense activity in an acquisition program, technologists from government laboratories should be routinely called upon to support the prime vendors. During periods of slack activity between acquisition programs, technologists from the defense industry should be asked to support research at the government laboratories. These processes will ensure that technologists on all sides of the partnership are current and that technology flows freely across organizational boundaries. Technology Identification and Integration Although the existing research and technology infrastructure will remain an important element in the future, new processes must also be developed for rapid identification of technological advances taking place outside of the defense industry that could support advanced operational concepts being developed by the military. Better mechanisms are needed for acquiring and integrating these technological advances into operational concepts. For example, the advances in communications technologies and in power systems (batteries) are taking place rapidly, but U.S. troops sometimes miss the opportunity to use them because the acquisition process can be so cumbersome. Programs such as ACTD and the Joint Experimentation program were developed to help alleviate this problem, but neither of these is a direct acquisition process; both of them are “research” programs. The government should create a direct acquisition process under which “technology spotters” identify products developed in the commercial marketplace, procure them, and integrate them directly into field use. The acquisition funds could continue to be managed by the individual services in accordance with Title 10 rules, but direct linkages would be established between the technology acquisition team and the operating units. This process would not work in every situation; for example, with major platform procurements, the full acquisition and testing processes will always be necessary. However, in a world of rapid technological advancement and standardization, many new products, especially at the subsystem level, could be simply purchased and used immediately in the field. Conclusions In a December 11, 2001, speech to the students at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, 3 months after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, President George W. Bush said: </span>__While the threats to America have changed, the need for victory has not. We are fighting shadowy, entrenched enemies—enemies using the tools of terror and guerrilla war—yet we are finding new tactics and new weapons to attack and defeat them. This revolution in our military is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">....The Predator is a good example. This unmanned aerial vehicle is able to circle over enemy forces, gather intelligence, transmit information instantly back to commanders, then fire on targets with extreme accuracy. Before the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit the old ways. Now it is clear the military does not have enough unmanned vehicles....What’s different today is our sense of urgency—the need to build this future force while fighting a present war. It’s like overhauling an engine while you’re going at 80 miles an hour. Yet we have no other choice. </span>__Advanced technological development by itself is clearly not sufficient to ensure a successful military transformation. Coupled with advances in doctrine, strategy, tactics, and training, however, advanced technology is a significant force multiplier__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.7 </span>**__Maintaining our technological lead in the future will be critical__** **__to the operations of our fighting forces__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Technologists, operators, and acquisition specialists together can create and implement the policies so vital to ensuring this critical requirement. Acquisition Reform and Spiral Development </span>__The private sector, driven by market forces, is arguably more efficient in the development, production, and sustainment of new products and systems. As such, the focus of early acquisition reform initiatives has been on the adoption of best commercial practices to reduce costs and improve the quality and sustainability of__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Department of Defense (</span>__DOD__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">) </span>__weapons systems__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For example, emphasis was placed on eliminating numerous unique military specifications and standards in favor of commercial specifications and standards. Other important commercially derived initiatives include the adoption of integrated process and product development, single process initiative, and performance-based specifications. </span>__Each of these initiatives has reduced the costs of acquiring and sustaining weapons systems. However, **lengthy cycle times**—that is, the time from initiation of an acquisition program to initial operational capability—**has continued to plague defense acquisition**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Data taken on programs during the 1980s and 1990s indicate the average cycle time for large defense programs is slightly more than 11 years. Current programs such as the F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter are projected to exceed 15 years. Clearly, long cycle times are exacerbated by the highly complex nature of modern weapons systems such as the F-22. Cycle times are also negatively impacted by inefficient funding profiles that stretch development time. Largely, though, </span>__long cycle times are **the result of the highly structured, risk-adverse** **DOD serial product development process** of sequential developmental phases and milestones—the so-called DOD 5000 process. As such, a current focus of acquisition reform__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and the intent of the recent rewrite of the DOD 5000.1 and 5000.2 instructions </span>__is to establish a more flexible, streamlined process for the development of new weapons systems__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The new product development process, known as </span>__spiral development or **evolutionary acquisition, promises significantly shorter acquisition cycle times**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The stated goal is to reduce cycle times by 50 percent or more. In a test of the new spiral development process, the Air Force has established an ambitious set of pilot programs with a stretch goal for a four to one reduction in cycle time. Assuming success in these pilot efforts, the warfighter will receive new weapons systems and capabilities in less than 3 years on average over the traditional 11-year cycle time average. </span>__The key to the new spiral development process is the familiar 80-20 rule. That is, the user accomplishes 80 percent of the objective with 20 percent of the time and effort, the remaining 20 percent requiring the remaining 80 percent of the time and effort__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In the context of product development, </span>__the acquisition community would strive to develop an 80-percent solution and field this new capability to the warfighter as rapidly as possible__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. As such, immature technologies are bypassed in favor of mature technologies, large software integration efforts are broken into core capabilities and advanced capability modules for later development, </span>__and growth is built into the initial design to accommodate subsequent or sequential product upgrades or production blocks. **As the initial** design or **block is** being refined and **produced, parallel design** and maturation **efforts are begun for subsequent blocks**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The riskier technologies are matured and advanced hardware and software are added in later production blocks. </span>__At the end of the full product development cycle, several related blocks of weapons systems might have been produced, each more advanced than the previous one—each advancing toward the ultimate user requirement first envisioned__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. While the initial 80 percent product solution would not completely satisfy the full operational deficiency, </span>__it provides the warfighter a more immediate new capability closer to the desired solution than the current legacy equipment. This also allows the warfighter an opportunity to train and become familiar with employment, doctrine, support, and feedback lessons for incorporation in later blocks__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__Spiral development allows production weapons systems to be fielded at more rapid and predictable intervals, each iteration more advanced__** __than the previous spiral. One can clearly understand the notion of evolutionary acquisition as each successive iteration of the weapon system evolves from the initial product design to the final production block__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, which may require only two or many successive parasequential spirals. Some may argue that this is merely a reapplication of the lessons of the 1970s and 1980s in which preplanned product improvement and F-16-style block production were common product development strategies. While there is some merit in these observations, the primary difference today in implementing spiral development is the clear motivation to reduce cycle time. </span>__In so doing, **spiral development will also drive complementary changes in other segments of the** product **development process, such as** a spiral **requirements** generation process and flexible **training and support** concepts **to develop, field, and sustain new weapons systems more quickly**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span></span>

RAND’s analysis suggests several ways </span>__to increase the ability of U.S. forces in the Pacific **to deter and**, if necessary, to **defeat a Chinese attack against Taiwan**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China’s Military Modernization Since the late 1990s, China’s defense industries have been producing an increasing number of modern weapon systems. Although many fall short of the most advanced systems now entering the U.S. inventory, some Chinese weapons of today are comparable to the U.S. weapons fielded in the 1970s and 1980s and that still make up the bulk of the U.S. inventory. </span>__To retain its qualitative military advantage over China__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, therefore, </span>**__America will need to continue to develop__** **__and field systems that are significantly more advanced than__** __the types that **China** is now in the process of developing and fielding__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China’s defense industry has benefited from the rapidly increasing technological capabilities in China’s broader economy. China’s integration into the global economy has resulted in steady improvements in the research, development, production, and management of many of China’s state-owned defense industrial enterprises. Similarly, the improvement and the growing exposure to Western teaching and scientific methods of China’s universities and technical schools mean that they are turning out increasingly well-trained and independent-thinking scientists, engineers, and technicians. As salaries and working conditions in China’s defense industries improve, they are able to attract higher-quality university and technical school graduates, employees of high-tech civilian enterprises, and Chinese nationals who have studied or worked abroad. Perhaps the most significant change in China’s defense industries in recent years has been the dramatic increase in resources flowing to them. Between 2000 and 2005, the amount spent on weapons procurement by the People’s Liberation Army more than doubled. The net effect of these changes has been a qualitative improvement in the output of </span>**__China’s defense industries__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. They </span>**__are now producing__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> certain </span>**__systems that__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, while not cutting edge, </span>**__are comparable to__** __many systems now in **the inventories of the U**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates and other advanced militaries. China’s Type 98 tank, for example, is comparable in capability to the main battle tanks of other Western countries, although so far the Type 98 tank has been produced in only small quantities. China has launched two classes of naval destroyers that are expected to have air defense capabilities comparable to those of U.S. cruisers and destroyers equipped with the Aegis air defense system. China is currently producing two classes of modern diesel-electric submarines and is building two new classes of nuclear submarines that are far better than their predecessors. The C-802 antiship missile carried by China’s naval combatants is comparable in capability to early versions of the Harpoon missile that is still used on U.S. naval combatants. Since the 1990s, the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation has been coproducing, with Russian assistance, the Su-27 fighter jet, which is roughly comparable to the U.S. F-15. An indigenously built fighter jet, the J-10 is comparable to the U.S. F-16 and has reached initial operational capability. China’s PL-9 air-to-air missile is comparable to the U.S. AIM-9M Sidewinder that was in production until 2004, and China is developing a radar-guided missile, the SD-10, that is expected to match up to the U.S. AIM-120 advanced medium-range air-to-air missile. Other systems under development in China include an airborne early warning and control aircraft comparable to the U.S. Airborne Warning and Control System, a surface-to-air missile system expected to be comparable to early versions of the U.S. Patriot, a cruise missile expected to be comparable to the U.S. Tomahawk, and a high-speed antiradiation missile. China has also purchased several weapon systems from Russia that are highly advanced and, in some cases, exceed U.S. capabilities. China’s military is well known for its short-range, conventionally armed ballistic missiles. They provide a unique capability for China and one that is extremely difficult to counter. Carried on road-mobile launchers, they are exceedingly hard to locate and to attack before they are launched. In addition, the latest models are believed to have accuracies of 50 meters or less. China is also reported to be developing a ballistic missile capable of hitting a moving ship at sea. If this latter effort were successful — a big “if” — it would give China a unique and unprecedented military capability. However, a number of shortcomings remain. China has yet to develop a dedicated attack helicopter. Its antisubmarine warfare technology is weak. It appears to be nowhere close to fielding any kind of stealth aircraft. It does not have a super-agile, infrared-guided, air-to-air missile like those of the United States, Russia, and Israel. And it has nothing like the range of precision air-to-ground munitions employed by U.S. air forces. Moreover, narrowing the technological gap will be costly; prior to 2025, China is unlikely to have resources available for defense comparable to those currently available to the United States (see Figure 1). Nonetheless, </span>**__the strategic significance of the advances in China’s defense industries could be huge__**__. **As long as the products of U.S. defense industries continue to advance, it is unlikely that China’s defense industries will produce systems that directly challenge U.S. technological dominance**. **Conversely, if the U.S. military does not continue to upgrade its technological capabilities**, it is possible that__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> by the end of the next decade, </span>**__China will be able to field a military capable of challenging U.S. dominance in East Asia__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. If China focuses on developing its capabilities for military operations near the coast of East Asia and avoids investing in expensive long-range power projection assets — such as aircraft carriers, heavy bombers, and long-range transports — then, by 2020, China could have the resources to field modern military forces that, while not numerically equal to those fielded by the United States, would at least be of comparable magnitude. Furthermore, China will have the advantage that its home territory is located within the region, whereas East Asia is nearly halfway around the globe from the United States. </span>__Whether the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>__will retain its military advantage over China, therefore, depends__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> both on China’s actions and </span>__on whether the____U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>__will replace its current weapon systems with new ones that are qualitatively superior. America currently possesses substantial military and technological advantages over the Chinese military, and these must be retained while China devotes greater resources to military modernization__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China’s Military Strategy </span>__America needs to retain a strategic as well as a technological advantage. **Chinese military doctrinal writings discuss how to defeat** a militarily superior adversary such as **the U**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates. </span>__We found these writings in openly published **Chinese**-language **books on military strategy, articles in** Chinese **military journals**, reports from Chinese **military newspapers, and recent Western studies of Chinese security policy**. We **found** in the writings__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> at least seven </span>__strategic principles that have implications for U.S. forces__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in the Pacific. The first strategic principle is seizing the initiative early in a conflict. Chinese military analysts note that Iraq, by not seizing the initiative in the 1991 Gulf War, allowed the United States to build up its forces until it had overwhelming superiority. If China is to be victorious against a militarily superior power, China must go on the offensive from the very beginning. In the context of a conflict between the United States and China, this means that U.S. forces stationed permanently in the Western Pacific will be critical, because China is likely to go on the offensive before additional forces can be brought into the theater. A second and related strategic principle for defeating a militarily superior adversary is the importance of surprise. Surprise is valuable not only for an immediate tactical advantage but also as an important way of seizing the initiative. Surprise puts the adversary in the position of reacting to China’s moves, making it easy to maintain the initiative thereafter. In the context of a conflict between the United States and China, this means that the ability of U.S. forces in the Pacific to avoid and survive surprise attacks will be critical. Related to the first two strategic principles is a third one: the value of preemption. </span>__If China waits for a militarily superior adversary to commence hostilities, it will be difficult for China to seize the initiative, and the adversary will likely wield the preponderance of forces. If, by contrast, China initiates a conflict, China can seize the initiative and may also enjoy an initial advantage in the local balance of forces. Preemption also greatly increases the chances of successfully achieving surprise. In the context of a conflict between the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>__and China over Taiwan, this means **that China might initiate hostilities by preemptively attacking U.S. forces in the region**, even before China has attacked Taiwan, **on the presumption that the U**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__will inevitably intervene__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in a conflict with Taiwan. A fourth strategic principle is raising the costs of conflict. At least some </span>**__Chinese__** **__military analysts believe that the U__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__is sensitive to casualties and economic costs and that the sudden destruction of a significant portion of our forces would result in a severe psychological shock and a loss of will to continue the conflict__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. When this principle is combined with the preceding two, </span>__it suggests a belief that a preemptive surprise attack on U.S. forces in the Pacific could cause the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>__to avoid further combat with China__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Although the last time such a strategy was attempted in the Pacific the ultimate results were not favorable for the country that attacked, the Chinese military doctrinal writings that we examined did not acknowledge such historical counterexamples. A fifth strategic principle is that of limited strategic aims. A militarily inferior country cannot expect to achieve total victory over a militarily superior adversary. But if its aims are limited, the inferior country could create a situation in which the costs to its adversary of reversing the results of an initial offensive exceed the benefits of such a reversal, and therefore the adversary will choose to live with the results. In the context of a conflict between the United States and China, this principle suggests that </span>**__if China’s leadership believes it can quickly__** __**accomplish its military aims**__ **__and present the U__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__with a fait accompli__** __(such as **the** invasion and **occupation of Taiwan**)__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> without threatening any truly vital U.S. interests, </span>**__then China might embark on such a conflict even if its leadership recognizes that the U__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__could ultimately prevail if it desired__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span></span>

In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons.</span> __If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, **there is little hope of winning a war against China** 50 years later, **short of using nuclear weapons**. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. **Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its "non first use" principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that</span>**__should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation__**__. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span>


===<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Scenario B: India</span>=== 

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">India will model U.S. defense acquisition reform</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__Singh ‘9__** (Harinder Singh, Research Fellow at Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, MSc Defense Studies, former high-ranking officer in the Indian military, “Defence Acquisitions: The Question of Systemic Inefficienices and Effectiveness,” IDSA Comment, 12-3-2009, http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/DefenceAcquisitions_HSingh_031209)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__Defence acquisitions in the international context carry enormous political__** __and financial **ramifications**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The following data reveal the enormity of the ‘acquisition’ problem and hence the need to frame durable and highly tolerant procurement procedures, processes and mechanisms. With an annual budgetary allocation of US $660 billion, which is equivalent of the next 45 highest spending nations in the world, the United States leads in military expenditure, followed by China at $145 billion and Russia spending $85 billion for its defence needs.1 The United Kingdom is placed fourth with an estimated expenditure of $66 billion. More significantly and in terms of defence expenditure as a share of GDP, the United States spent 4.6 per cent, China 3.9 per cent, Russia 5.4 per cent, France 2.4 per cent, Australia 1.5 per cent, Japan 1.0 per cent, Germany 1.3 per cent, Canada 1.1 per cent and United Kingdom 2.3 per cent on acquisitions cum operating costs in 2007. To highlight the percentage share of acquisitions vis-à-vis operating costs (O&M), capital expenditure stood at 26 per cent in case of the United States, 23 per cent for United Kingdom, 21 per cent for France, 17 per cent for Japan, 15 per cent for Germany, 15 per cent for Canada and 18 per cent for Australia for the same period. In terms of number of acquisition proposals in 2007, the United States handled some 95 projects, United Kingdom 39 projects and Australia 16 projects, taking into account only those costing 200 million pounds and above.2 The average cost of acquisitions ranged from 9.5, 1.0 and 0.5 billion dollars respectively for each of these countries for the same period.3 In terms of time and cost overruns, the data is even more revealing. The cost overshoots stood at 8 per cent in case of United Kingdom as compared to 25 per cent for United States. But then United States delivered the planned projects with an average delay of 25 per cent as compared to 32 per cent in case of United Kingdom. The foregoing raises some important issues. First is the issue of systemic inefficiencies of the acquisition process in terms of time and cost overruns. And two, how these time and cost overshoots affect the operational readiness of the armed forces. The inadequacies highlighted above surely demand serious introspection. Perhaps a similar concern was reflected in recent remarks of the Indian Vice Chief of the Air Staff, which in all its virtuousness questioned the efficacy of the existing acquisition framework, and in turn, the preparedness of the air force. To draw a simple analogy from what the Air Marshal said, the timely construction of infrastructure for Commonwealth Games 2010 at whatever the cost is essential for successful conduct of the event. Not that the proposed infrastructure shall have no use after the event, but its importance clearly lies in timely fructification. Similarly, </span>__the fielding of desired military capabilities cannot be made hostage to time overruns and apprehensions about high cost__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. A recent seminar on Defence Acquisitions at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi, raised several such questions. The seminar focused on complexities of QR formulation and capability definition, impediments to unbiased technical and commercial evaluation, unnecessary publicity surrounding contractual negotiations and inadequacies in project monitoring and implementation. As it often happens, the debate veered onto two divergent and convoluted paths. While the military component comprising the three services, and rightfully so, continued to lament upon huge acquisition delays and equipment deficiencies, the acquisition bureaucracies missed no opportunity in reiterating the impact of `procedure-isation` of procurement processes and several attempts made at `price discoveries` in recent years. There thus seemed to be a clear lack of convergence in arguments put forth by the various stakeholders. The ensuing debate however missed the big picture i.e., the effectiveness of the existing procurement framework and its negative impact on preparedness of the Indian armed forces. In our continued fixation with first generation reforms (i.e., procedure-isation), the question of ‘effectiveness’ seldom comes up for serious discussion. Can the current acquisition framework deliver desired military capabilities is a question that needs to be asked? To be more precise, the effectiveness of procurement framework needs to be judged from the viewpoint of ‘operational’ and ‘structural’ readiness of the armed forces. Richard K. Betts, the much acclaimed guru on military readiness, emphasizes the importance of an effective and deliverable framework for maintaining battle worthiness of the military force. As Senator Solomon Ortiz, the chairman of the United States House Armed Services Committee’s (HASC) Readiness Subcommittee said, “for militaries to fight effectively – today and in the future – you need to have right people in the right roles with the right equipment and the right training. And how ready we were yesterday determines how well we fight today? And how ready are we today determines how well we fight tomorrow?” The deduction here is plain and simple – an ineffectual procurement mechanism surely impinges upon the operational effectiveness of the armed forces. But then the interesting part is that </span>**__India is not the only country__**__caught up in this debate. There are many other modern militaries **battling with the complexities of defence procurement**. **A debate rages in the U**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__as well__**__. Earlier this year, **the House Armed Services Committee** responsible for congressional oversight on military matters **constituted a panel for review of the defence acquisition processes in the U**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates.4 The HASC panel is tasked </span>__to examine the ‘effectiveness’ of the current acquisition framework in the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates. And the line of inquiry is quite simple and straightforward – How can the existing acquisition framework be reformed to satisfy the twin objectives of providing “best military wherewithal” and “when it is most needed” to the United States Armed Forces while ensuring “best value” for each dollar spent from taxpayers’ money? The operative words here being ‘timeliness of procurement’ and ‘best value for money spent’ and not ‘procedure-isation’ or ‘price discoveries’ as is the case in the Indian context. The recently released Bernard Gray report on defence acquisition reforms in the United Kingdom also focuses on the effectiveness of the existing procurement framework. The report is indeed an exemplar on acquisition related reform. </span>**__There could be several lessons from the American__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and British </span>**__experience__** **__in the Indian context__**__. The HASC panel review is focused on the following key questions__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">: Is there a proven methodology available to measure the effectiveness of the defence acquisition system? If not, how could one be created or modelled? </span>__Is the current system effective enough in meeting the twin objectives of ‘timeliness’ of procurement and ‘good value’ for the money spent? What could be the root causes for systemic inefficiencies?__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The causatives could be found at these levels: How much do the important processes of qualitative requirement (QR) formulation, project validation and budgetary support affect acquisition outcomes? And which one or more of these acts as an impediment to sound decision making? Are there enough trained civilian and military managers to process procurement related decisions? Do they have sufficient knowledge, expertise and authority to take procurement decisions? If not, then what could be the other options to process sound procurement decisions? Does the defence acquisition system generate sufficient domain knowledge, data and analytics to enable good decision making? Are procurement related decisions ever hampered by lack of technical information, empirical data or well documented procurement precedence/s etc? If so, then what options exist to build requisite domain knowledge? Does the defence acquisition system schedule major decision points in a collegiate fashion and bring up issues duly prioritized for review at right times? Is adequate information available to enable informed decision making? If not, then what correctives are required? </span>__How responsive is the framework in responding to urgency of the military’s needs? Can the system be tailored to match the duration of ‘capability development’ with ‘threat cycle/s’? And are the current procurement processes responsive enough to cope with sharp changes in technology? If not, then what measures need to be taken?__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> What are the social and cultural biases that often creep into the acquisition system? How could these lead to bad acquisition outcomes? And how could these then be corrected? </span>**__What measures are being taken worldwide to reform acquisition__** __procedures, **processes** and mechanisms?__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> How efficient are the acquisition processes in the United Kingdom, France and Australia? What lessons do we need to learn from them? What structural changes would be necessary to ensure that the defence acquisition system satisfies the twin objectives of timely acquisitions and good value for taxpayers’ money? </span>__The foregoing framework **could be relevant in the Indian context as well**. With as many as a few dozen proposals in the pipeline and no major procurements in the offing, the procurement diagnostics clearly needs to shift from ‘procedure-isation’ to ‘effectiveness’__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Firstly, there is the important aspect of realistic definition of required military capabilities. And then is the issue of achievable and affordable qualitative requirements; a ‘knowledge cum experience’ driven expertise is difficult to come by in defence bureaucracies. We need to build expertise to enable framing of realistic qualitative requirements, and till such time these proficiencies are actually built technical consultancies could be hired. Institutional advice from accredited trade bodies such as the CII, FICCI, ASSOCHAM and others is yet another avenue. The bottom line here being that identification of cutting edge military technologies, concepts and capability formulation and benchmarking of qualitative requirements becomes an extensive, cross pollinated and inter-disciplinary action in the long term. Another related aspect is that the current procurement procedures and processes are too sequential and therefore highly time consuming. </span>**__There is a need to break from ‘serial’__** __and ‘iterative’ **procurement processes towards concurrent, smart and timely acquisition actions**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Bernard Gray report offers several suggestions on this score.</span></span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Indian defense acquisition reform is key to military modernization in the face of Chinese aggression</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__Pant ‘11__** (Harsh V. Pant, professor at King’s College, London, “Tale of two defense policies,” The Japan Times, 3-16-2011, http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20110316a2.html)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">China has declared that its official defense budget for 2011 will rise by 12.7 percent from the previous year. Last year there was a lot of hoopla surrounding the fact that China had announced a mere 7.5 percent jump in defense budget. It was the first time since the 1980s that China's defense spending increased by a single-digit percentage. But this year we are back to the norm of double-digit increases. While China's civilian leadership has tried to downplay the latest increase, suggesting that much of the increase will go to human resources development, infrastructure and training, it is the response of the Chinese military that should be a matter of concern. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan was unambiguous in suggesting that when it comes to military spending, there is no need for China "to care about what others may think." The international community has long demanded that China should be more transparent about the intentions behind its rapid defense spending. Now the Chinese military is making its strategic intent clear. </span>__Divisions within China about the future course of nation's foreign policy are more stark than ever__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is now being suggested that much like young Japanese officers in the 1930s, </span>__young Chinese military officers are increasingly taking charge of strategy with the result that rapid military growth is shaping the nation's broader foreign policy objectives. Civil-military relations in China are under stress with the PLA asserting its pride more forcefully than even before__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and demanding respect from other countries. "A country needs respect, and a military also needs respect," wrote a major general last year in the PLA's newspaper. Not surprisingly, </span>__China has been more aggressive in asserting its interests not only vis-a-vis India but also__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> vis-a-vis </span>__the U__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>__S__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates, the European Union, Japan and Southeast Asian states. </span>__The **increasing assertion by the Chinese military and changing balance of power in the nation's civil-military relations should be a real cause of concern for China's neighbors**. The pace of **Chinese military modernization**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> has already taken the world by surprise and it is clear that the process </span>**__is going much faster than many had anticipated__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. A growing economic power, China is now concentrating on the accretion of military might so as to secure and enhance its own strategic interests. China, which has the largest standing army in the world with more than 2.3 million members, continues to make the most dramatic improvements in its nuclear force among the five nuclear powers, and improvements in its conventional military capabilities are even more impressive. </span>__What has been causing concern in Asia and beyond is the opacity that surrounds China's military buildup__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, with an emerging consensus that Beijing's real military spending is at least double the announced figure. The official figures of the Chinese government do not include the cost of new weapon purchases, research or other big-ticket items for China's highly secretive military. As a result, the real figures are much higher than the revealed amount. </span>__Despite this, **India's own defense-modernization program is faltering**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This year the Indian government has allocated only 1.8 percent of its GDP to defense, though ostensibly the military expenditure has gone up by 11.58 percent. This is only the second time in over three decades that the defense-to-GDP ratio has fallen below 2 percent of GDP. </span>__This is happening at a time when India is expected to spend $112 billion on capital defense acquisitions over the next five years in what is being described as "one of the largest procurement cycles in the world." Indian military planners are shifting their focus away from Pakistan as China takes center-stage in future strategic planning__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Over the past two decades, the military expenditure of India has been around 2.75 percent, but since India has been experiencing significantly higher rates of economic growth over the last decade compared to any other time in its history, the overall resources that it has been able to allocate to its defense needs has grown significantly. </span>__The armed forces have long been asking for an allocation of 3 percent of the nation's GDP to defense. This has received a broad political support in recent years__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Indian prime minister has been explicit about it, suggesting that "if our economy grows at about 8 percent per annum, it will not be difficult for [the Indian government] to allocate about 3 percent of GDP for national defense." The Indian Parliament has also underlined the need to aim for the target of 3 percent of GDP. Yet as a percentage of GDP, annual defense spending has declined to one of its lowest levels since 1962. </span>__But defense expenditures alone will not solve all the problems plaguing Indian defense policy. More damagingly__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, with the exception of this year, </span>__for the last several years now the defense ministry has been unable to spend its full budgetary allocation. **The defense-acquisition process remains**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> mired in corruption and bureaucratic red tape. A series of defense procurement scandals since the late 1980s have also made the bureaucracy </span>**__risk averse__**__, thereby delaying the acquisition process. A large part of the money is surrendered by the defense forces every year because **labyrinthine bureaucratic procedures** involved in the procurement process **make it impossible to spend the entire budget**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. India's indigenous defense-production industry has time and again demonstrated its inability to meet the demands of the armed forces. </span>__The Indian armed forces keep waiting for arms and equipment while__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the Finance Ministry is left with unspent budgets year after year. </span>**__Most__** **__large procurement programs get delayed, resulting in__** __cost escalation and technological or strategic **obsolescence** of the budgeted items__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Indian government has yet to demonstrate the political will to tackle </span>**__the defense-policy paralysis__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> that </span>**__seems to be rendering all claims of India's rise as a military power increasingly hollow__**__. **The capability differential between China and India is rising at an alarming rate**____. An effective defense policy is not merely about deterring China. In the absence of an effective defense policy, India will lose the confidence to conduct its foreign policy unhindered from external and internal security challenges__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span></span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Otherwise, China will attack by 2012 – that draws in Pakistan and escalates to global conflict</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__Verma ‘9__** (Capt. Bharat Verma, former Cavalry Officer, Editor, Indian Defence Review, “Unmasking China,” Indian Defence Review, 24(3), Jul-Sep 2009, http://www.indiandefencereview.com/2009/08/unmasking-china.html)</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**__China will launch an attack on India before 2012__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__There are **multiple reasons** for a desperate Beijing to teach India the final lesson, thereby ensuring Chinese supremacy in Asia__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in this century. </span>**__The recession__** __that shut the Chinese exports shop **is creating** an **unprecedented internal social unrest**. In turn, the vice-like grip of the communists over the society stands severely threatened__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__Unemployment is on the rise__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The unofficial estimate stands at a whopping fourteen percent. Worldwide recession has put thirty million people out of jobs. </span>__Economic slowdown is depleting the foreign exchange reserves. Foreign investors are slowly shifting out__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. To create a domestic market, the massive dole of loans to individuals is turning out to be a nightmare. There appears to be a flight of capital in billions of dollars in the shape of diamond and gold bought in Hong Kong and shipped out towards end 2008. The fear of losing control over the Chinese masses is forcing the communists to compulsorily install filtering software on new computers on sale to crush dissent on the Internet, even though it is impossible to censor in entirety the flow of information as witnessed recently in Tibet, Xinjiang and Iran. </span>__The growing internal unrest is **making Beijing jittery**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>__The external picture appears to be equally dismal__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The unfolding Obama strategy seems to be scoring goals for democracy and freedom without firing a single shot. While Bush unwittingly united and arrayed against himself Islamic countries and radical Islam worldwide, Obama has put radical Islam in disarray by lowering the intra-societal temperature vis-à-vis America and the Muslim world. He deftly hints at democracy in his talk without directly threatening any group or country and the youth picks it up from there – as in Iran. </span>__With more and **more Chinese citizens** beginning to **demand political freedom**, the future of the communists is also becoming uncertain. The technological means available in the 21st century to spread democracy is definitely not conducive for the totalitarian regime in Beijing__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__India’s__** __chaotic but **successful democracy is an eyesore for the authoritarian regime in Beijing**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Unlike India, China is handicapped as it lacks the soft power – an essential ingredient to spread influence. This further adds fuel to the fire. Ethnicity-of-China In addition, the growing irrelevance of Pakistan, their right hand that operates against India on their behest, is increasing the Chinese nervousness. Obama’s AF-PAK policy is primarily a PAK-AF policy. It has intelligently set the thief to catch the thief. The stated withdrawal from Iraq by America now allows it to concentrate its military surplus on the single front to successfully execute the mission. This surplus, in combination with other democratic forces, enables America to look deep into resource rich Central Asia, besides containing China’s expansionist ambitions. To offset this adverse scenario, while overtly pretending to side with the West, the Chinese covertly ordered their other proxy, North Korea, to test underground nuclear explosions and carry out trials of missiles that threaten Japan and South Korea. The Chinese anxiety is understandable. Under Bush’s declared policy of being ‘a strategic competitor’ alongside the ‘axis of evil’, they shared a large strategic maneuverability with others of similar hues. However, Obama policies wisely deny such a luxury by reclaiming more and more international strategic space ceded by the previous administration. </span>**__The communists in China__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, therefore, </span>**__need a military victory to unite the__** **__disillusioned citizenry behind them__**__. This will assist in marketing the psychological perception that the 21st century belongs to China and assert their deep belief in the superiority of the Chinese race. To retain the communist party’s hold on power, it is essential to divert attention from the brewing internal dissent__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. In an autocratic system normally the only recipe to unite the citizenry is by mannpulating their nationalistic feelings. </span>__The easy method for Beijing to heighten the feeling of patriotism and forging national unity is to design a war with an adversary. They believe that this will help them to midwife the Chinese century__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. That is the end game rooted in the abiding conviction of the communists that the Chinese race is far superior to Nazi Germany and is destined to “Lord over the Earth”. </span>__At present, there is no overall cost benefit ratio in integrating **Taiwan** by force with the mainland, since under the new dispensation in Taipei, the island **is ‘behaving’ itself**. **Also, the American presence** around the region **is too strong** for comfort__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. There is also the factor of Japan to be reckoned. Though Beijing is increasing its naval presence in the South China Sea to coerce into submission those opposing its claim on the Sprately Islands, at this point of time in history it will be unwise for recession-hit China to move against the Western interests, including Japan. </span>__Therefore, **the most attractive option is to attack a soft target like India** and forcibly occupy its territory in the Northeast__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Ideally, the Chinese believe that the east-wind should prevail over the west-wind. However, despite their imperial calculations of the past, they lag behind the West, particularly America, by many decades. Hence, they want the east-wind to at least prevail over the other east-wind, i.e., India, to ensure their dominance over Asia. </span>**__Beijing’s__** __cleverly **raising the** hackles on its fabricated **dispute in Arunachal Pradesh to an alarming level, is the** preparatory **groundwork** **for** imposing **such a conflict** on India. A sinking **Pakistan will team up with China** to teach India “the final lesson”__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The Chinese leadership wants to rally its population behind the communist rule. As it is, </span>__Beijing is already rattled, with its proxy Pakistan, now literally embroiled in a civil war, losing its sheen against India. **Above all, it is worried over the growing alliance of India with the U**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>**__S__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>**__and__** __the West, **because the alliance has the potential to create a technologically superior counterpoise**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span>**__All these__** __three **concerns** of the Chinese communists **are best addressed by waging a war against**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> pacifist </span>**__India__** __to achieve multiple strategic objectives. But India, otherwise the biggest challenge to the supremacy of China in Asia, is least prepared on ground to face the Chinese threat__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. How will India repel the Chinese game plan? Will Indian leadership be able to take the heat of war? Have they laid the groundwork adequately to defend India? Is the Indian military equipped to face the two-front war by Beijing and Islamabad? Is the Indian Civil Administration geared to meet the internal security challenges that the external actors will sponsor simultaneously through their doctrine of unrestricted warfare? The answers is an unequivocal ‘NO’. Pacifist India is not ready by a long shot either on the internal or the external front. It is said that long time back, a king with an excellent military machine at his disposal could not stomach the violence involved in winning wars. So he renounced war in victory. This led to the rise of the pacifist philosophies. The state either refused to defend itself or neglected the instruments that could defend it. Any ‘extreme’ is dangerous, as it tends to create imbalance in statecraft. We saw that in the unjust unilateral aggression in Iraq. It diminished the American aura and recessed the economy. China’s despotic regime is another extreme, scared to permit political dissent. This will fuel an explosion worse than the Tiananmen Square. Despite the use of disproportionate force and the demographic invasion of Tibet, Beijing’s hold remains tenuous. Pakistan’s over-aggressive agenda in the name of jihad haunts it now to the point of fragmentation of the State. Similarly, </span>__India’s pacifism is the other extreme__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. 26/11s will occur on a regular basis as it infects policy-making. </span>__Such extreme postures on either side invariably generate wars__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Armed with an aggressive Wahabi philosophy, Pakistan, in cohort with China, wants to destabilize a pacifist India. India’s instruments of state steeped in pacifism are unable to rise to its defence. In the past sixty years, the deep-rooted pacifism contributed to the Civil Administration, ceding control of forty per cent of the Union’s territory to the Maoists and ten percent to the insurgents, effecting a shrinking influence internally, as well in the ‘near abroad’. </span>**__India must rapidly shift out from its defeatist posture__**__of pacifism **to deter China**. New Delhi’s stance should__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> modify, not to aggression, but to a firm assertion in statecraft. The state must also exclusively </span>__retain the capability of intervention by use of force__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> internally as well as externally. If it permits the non-state actors to develop this capability in competition, then the state will whither away. On the contrary, the state machinery should ensure a fast-paced development in the Red Corridor even it if has to hold Maoists hostage at gunpoint. The state’s firm and just intervention will dissolve the Maoist movement. Keeping in view the imminent threat posed by China, the quickest way to swing out of pacifism to a state of assertion is by injecting military thinking in the Civil Administration to build the sinews. That will enormously increase the deliverables on ground – from Lalgarh to Tawang. </span></span>

Air Force Secretary Michael Donley said </span>__such savings will fund a host of programs, including the F-35 stealth fighter, the recently announced long-range bomber__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, more satellite-boosting rockets and upgrades for existing fighters. Donley said the service had already begun a broad efficiency drive by Aug. 9, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates ordered the services to save $100 billion over five years. "This work had been underway, but certainly </span>__the secretary [of defense]__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> gave us a shot in the arm and </span>__gave us a great__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, I think, </span>__inducement to proceed with this work with a simple caveat: **What we found within the Air Force for savings** and efficiencies **would stay in the Air Force**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">," he told reporters Jan. 12. </span>**__Finding those savings will be critical__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, said Dan Gouré, an analyst at the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Va.

It will be part of a "family of systems" that will also handle ground surveillance and electronic attack. Donley said it would be </span>__able to carry nuclear weapons, but would be primarily geared toward conventional war__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, and might not be immediately certified for nuclear missions. Unlike the service's previous next-generation bomber effort, the new aircraft will use proven technologies, he said. "In contrast to the program that was canceled in 2009, Next Generation bomber as it was known, development of this new bomber will leverage more mature technologies, and we think will reduce the risk in the program, allow us to deliver with greater confidence on schedule and in quantities sufficient to support long-term sustainment of long-range bomber capabilities after the current fleet of B-1s and B-52s retire," Donley said. </span>__Still, Gouré doubts that the service's efforts to save will free up enough money to fund the bomber effort, especially for production__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. "</span>**__Is the current reallocation money going to be enough? No, clearly not, when you get to the point of having to build__**__," he said__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Over the long term, however, Gouré said he believes there is enough money in the budget to pay for a new bomber as production on other programs comes to a close. "If they need this thing, they'll find the money. Not to worry," he said. F-35 Delay The initial operational capability date for the U.S. Air Force version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is likely to slip due to recent program changes instituted to help right the troubled triservice effort, Donley said. "I think that's implied with the additional dollars and time required in system development," he said when asked whether the recent restructuring would delay the in-service date. Donley did not elaborate, but said additional details would follow. Gouré said he was not surprised by the potential slip, but cautioned that slowing down production could raise the purchase price. The secretary said the Air Force would benefit from Gates' decision to put the U.S. Marine Corps vertical landing F-35B variant, the most technically challenged and complex version, on a two-year probationary period. "The major decision from this TBR [technical baseline review] has been to decouple the testing of the U.S. Marine short-takeoff, vertical-landing variant from the conventional and carrier variant to ensure we do not slow progress on the conventional and carrier variant," he said. Donley also said the service would buy 16 F-35 simulators, which, among other things, will save fuel. "In the Joint Strike Fighter program, it is forecast that up to 50 percent of pilot training will be accomplished through simulators," he said. Current Fighters Donley said the savings drive would also allow the service to shave the time required to refit F-15C and -E fighters with active electronically scanned array radars and new operational flight programs. Upgrades to the F-15C air superiority variant will wrap up one year early; those for the multirole F-15E Strike Eagle some eight years ahead. Boeing officials said their production facilities were ready to handle the accelerated schedule. The secretary also said the workhorse F-16C multirole fighter would definitely receive a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). "They continue to refine the requirements for F-16 SLEPs going forward," he said. "What kind? How much? And when? And we are committing resources in that direction." He said the F-16 work is directly tied to the continuing delays in getting the F-35 into service. Gouré said he is not convinced that the F-16 extensions are necessary, suggesting instead better fleet management to ease the strain or borrowing older F-16s from storage. "If we're going to take a risk in order to modernize the air fleet, this is the decade to take it," he said. Space Programs Donley also announced a new approach to satellite acquisition. </span>**__The Evolutionary Acquisition__** __for **S**pace **E**fficiency **strategy would buy satellites in batches of two or more, use more fixed-price contracts**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, promise more stable research and development funding, and use a more evolutionary developmental approach </span>**__and__** **__"a modified annual funding approach__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">." He said the service was still working out details of </span>__the new approach__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, which </span>__is **meant to reduce** the **costs** **associated with uneven funding and production gaps**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Gouré applauded the plan. "</span>__If there is one area you can clearly say cried out for acquisition reform, it was the satellite business__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">," he said. "</span>**__This [is]__** __clearly__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, clearly, </span>__a true innovation, maybe a revolution. In the end, I suspect [it is] **going to get us further down the road**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">." Ultimately, Gouré said, even with the evolutionary approach to developing and launching new satellites, the end result might be even more technologically advanced machines. </span></span>

The Defense Department’s nuclear-capable bomber force program of record consists of twenty penetrating B-2s and seventy-six standoff B-52s.165 When the B-2 loses its ability to penetrate, the air leg of the triad will be reduced to B-52s equipped with nuclear-tipped standoff ALCMs that are approaching the end of their service life and are unsuited for attacking relocatable targets such as road-mobile ICBM launchers of the type being fielded by China, Iran and Russia.166 There are options that will permit DoD to sustain a nuclear-capable bomber force and hedge against uncertainty. First, DoD should develop a new nuclearcapable cruise missile capable of surviving advanced air defenses. Unlike the ALCM, the new missile should be able to carry conventional as well as nuclear warheads and to be launched from a variety of Air Force and Navy aircraft. A smaller, more versatile cruise missile with a range of 500–600 nm that can be carried by fighter-sized aircraft as well as bombers would permit DoD to take advantage of the economies of scale via a larger procurement and increase the overall size of the standoff missile magazine. Second, </span>**__the Defense Department should design a new bomber to preserve this option for delivering nuclear weapons__**__. Under New START, the Air Force has the latitude to incorporate basic nuclear weapons requirements into a new bomber design without fully equipping, testing, certifying, and declaring it as nuclearcapable__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span>


<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">And, it’s not just a question of eroding capability – failure to initiate a new bomber program creates the perception that the DoD is formally eliminating a nuclear role for bombers</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Loss of the nuclear bomber creates three unique scenarios for nuclear war – allied proliferation, hostile aggression, and crisis escalation</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">The Case for Continuity The case for the continuity of current U.S. nuclear policies and structure involves consideration of their benefits in terms of security, international prestige, domestic politics, and technology.8 From a security perspective, nuclear weapons ensure security because </span>**__the potential usage of nuclear weapons__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> during a conflict raises the cost of war to an unacceptable level.9 Scott Sagan notes that: Nuclear declaratory policy is meant to enhance deterrence of potential adversaries by providing a </span>**__signal__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of </span>**__the intentions__**__, options and proclivities **of the U.S. government in** different **crisis** and war-time **scenarios**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.10 I would argue, however, that </span>**__an ambiguous U.S. first use policy__** __of nuclear weapons **creates valuable uncertainty** on the part of potential adversaries. This uncertainty, coupled with U.S. nuclear and conventional superiority, **makes overt state aggression** against the U.S. or its’ allies **a** very uncertain and **potentially disastrous proposition, thus not likely to happen**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. After all, no state has started a war with the U.S. since it acquired nuclear weapons. </span>**__No part of the U.S. nuclear triad can be eliminated without creating an adverse impact on deterrence__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This is the case because </span>__each element of the triad fills a unique role that makes U.S. nuclear forces lethal, survivable, and visible__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Submarines offer the greatest degree of survivability, but the lowest degree of accuracy and become vulnerable upon surfacing. </span>__Bombers are the most accurate and only recallable option__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, but they are vulnerable to defensive counter-air missions and groundbased anti-aircraft fire. ICBMs are the most reliable means of delivery and the only sovereignlaunched option, yet are all located at known, stationary sites that are easily targeted by enemy ICBM forces, special operations teams, or terrorist surrogates. </span>__One may not consider the visibility of nuclear forces to be desirable, but **the visibility of bombers**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and ICBMs </span>**__allows for clear signaling to potential adversaries__** **__about U.S. intentions during a crisis__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Take the Cuban Missile Crisis for example: President Kennedy used naval and air forces in order to signal his intent toward Premier Khrushchev. This signaling ensured there were no doubts about U.S. willingness to go to war to prevent Soviet missiles from being placed in Cuba. </span>**__Future conflicts may require signaling__** **__of a similar nature to prevent deadly exchanges__**__. For example, if Kim Jong Il were notified that the U.S. was uploading nuclear-armed bombers in response to North Korean deployments of nuclear-armed missiles, he might reconsider his actions__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. From the perspective of international prestige, other powers are retaining and in some cases enhancing their nuclear capability, yet as Younger points out, the U.S. is not modernizing any aspect of its inventory.11 Instead, the U.S. is relying on mathematical projections and estimations regarding the reliability of its systems and deploying them well beyond what most states would consider a reasonable service-life. </span>**__Further reductions in strategic nuclear forces could be seen as evidence of retrenchment__** __on the part of the U.S. **by ambitious rising or reemerging powers, thus increasing the risk of war**. **The U.S. could be characterized as a declining power by rising powers who are seeking** either initial or enhanced **nuclear technology**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Rising powers, after all, will work to realign the international balance of power in their favor: one way of doing so is through countering U.S. military capabilities. </span>__If the U.S. were to reduce its capability by eliminating portions of the triad, then it would essentially be making it easier for other powers to challenge the current U.S. position. Further, **without the potential threat of a nuclear first strike, U.S. allies might feel less secure** about U.S. security commitments, especially in light of current troop commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. **Such insecurity has the potential to lead these allies to pursue nuclear capabilities of their own, as well as embolden hostile states to gamble on a lack of U.S. retaliation for WMD usage** **or conventional aggression**__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For example, when the U.S. considered reducing troop levels in South Korea, the government in Seoul signaled a potential shift in policy toward a nuclear capability to protect itself from possible North Korean aggression.12 This threat resulted in very quick U.S. reassurances about troop levels and its commitment to defending South Korea.</span></span>
