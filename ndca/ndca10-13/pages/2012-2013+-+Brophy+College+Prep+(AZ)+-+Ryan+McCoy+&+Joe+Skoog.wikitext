**Their method turns debate into a catastrophic prediction market—the ballot becomes the currency awarded to the most catastrophic and inevitable impact—we define down the standards for evidence by elevating extinction risks as the central criteria for evaluation—this orients society towards permanent war and evacuates critical public spheres which means the aff becomes anti-political.

My approach is three pronged... in more detail.
===Ethical Mediation K=== 
====**<span style="font-size: 11pt;">1NC</span>**==== 
**<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Speaking out against transportation inequity is something that occurs every day—a theme of modern politics is the desire, and indeed, the necessity of an ethical framework for dealing with the other.</span>**

**<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yet these discussions never truly occur. The debate over the formation of genuinely ethical orientations towards excluded groups is inevitably relegated to a subsidiary of our political struggles. People attempt to create the conditions for authentic ethical engagement by altering particular institutions.</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The 1AC poses the question of ethics only insofar as it relates to the domain of politics. On the one hand they present the need for a radical ethical affirmation, only to conclude that the appeal must be tied to the renegotiation of particular institutions and institutional practices. The 1AC thus performs the classic ritual of mediating through politics; it is this ritualization that stifles the potential of the aff.</span>**
Alenka **<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zupancic, ‘2</span>** (Researcher—Institute of Philosophy—Ljubljana, “Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, March, p.
In other words, one cannot attain the realm of the ethical by means of
AND
she may be ' reborn ' , but only as a new subject.
**<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The affirmative will respond that the plan and the political is not a prominent part of the 1AC. This however, is precisely our point—the belief that the political must remain in the background in our discussions, even when it is irrelevant to their stance, is precisely the move that allows the political to dominate our relationships. This admittance that their posture is intrinsically insufficient cheapens the force of their appeal</span>**
Adam **<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thurschwell, ‘3</span>**, (Assistant professor of Law, Yeshiva University, 24 Cardozo L. Rev. 1193, Lexis)
Thus, as Derrida puts it, "ethics enjoins a politics and a law
AND
to say, determined on the basis of something that resembles pure faith.

**The need to play out our ethical relationships through political change guarantees our perpetual dependence on external mediation. Institutions seduce us into submission—no matter the ethical force of an appeal, this submission terminally undermines the emancipatory potential of its ethical principles**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hershock, ‘99</span>**<span style="font-family: Garamond,serif;">, (East-West Center, Journal of Buddhist Ethics, Vol6, </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Garamond,serif;">[[http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/6/hershock991.html|jbe.gold.ac.uk/6/hershock991.html]]</span><span style="font-family: Garamond,serif;">)</span>
I have argued at some length (Hershock, 1999) that evaluating technologies on

and for preserving "fair" definitions of 'being right' and 'being wronged'.
**This displacement of our ethics onto external political institutions culminates in genocidal violence. Once we accept that our ethics are contingent on the political all atrocities become possible.**
Alenka **<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zupancic, ‘2</span>** (Researcher—Institute of Philosophy—Ljubljana, “Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, March, p. 96-7)
Another problem still remains, however: the question of the possibility of (performing
