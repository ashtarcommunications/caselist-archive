==Plan== 
The United States Federal Government should substantially increase transportation investment in the United States by creating a National Transportation Infrastructure Bank to be used to better transportation infrastructure.

==Advantage 1 - Growth== 
The U.S. economy is stalling. Only a strong rebound in job creation will be sufficient to boost declining consumer confidence, and boost consumer demand which is the linchpin of the U.S. economy.

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 17.3333px;">A double dip recession and prolonged economic weakness, combined with the failure to create jobs, will lead to renewed demands for protectionism in the United States, resulting in a collapse of the global financial architecture, renewed U.S. isolationism, global instability, nuclear adventurism, and a third world war-this time with nuclear weapons.</span>

**A strong consensus agrees that transportation infrastructure must be updated in order to revive the economy, and create the conditions for continued economic strength, but there is little agreement on who should pay for it. Attempts to shift the burden to the states will only accelerate the erosion of U.S infrastructure.

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 17.3333px;">America’s crumbling transportation infrastructure is a critical reason for the nation’s current economic malaise. Deteriorating transportation infrastructure severely constrains private sector investment and economic growth, and has pushed manufacturing, and the middle class jobs its supports, abroad. The nations soaring debt has undermined any support for the level of government investment necessary to restore critical infrastructure and kick-start the economy. Only a national infrastructure bank can create new era of public-private partnership, drawing private capital and investment off the sideline, and attract sufficient investment to rebuild transportation infrastructure and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth </span>**

NIB will increase critical transportation infrastructure investment, creating jobs in the short term, fueling economic activity, and increasing competitiveness

<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">The NIB will reform the system to cut waste, and emphasize merit and need. As a bank, the NIB would inject accountability into the infrastructure investment process. Since the bank would offer loans and loan guarantees using a combination of public and private capital, it would have the opportunity to move away from the traditional design-bid-build model and toward project delivery mechanisms that would deliver better value to taxpayers and investors.35 By operating on principles more closely tied to return on investment and financial discipline, the NIB would help to prevent the types cost escalation and project delays that have foiled the ARC Tunnel. America’s infrastructure policy has been significantly hampered by the lack of a national strategy rooted in clear, overarching objectives used to evaluate the merit of specific projects. The politicization and lack of coordination of the process has weakened public faith in the ability of government to effectively meet infrastructure challenges. In polling, 94% of respondents expressed concern about America’s infrastructure and over 80% supported increased federal and state investment. However, 61% indicated that improved accountability should be the top policy goal and only 22% felt that the federal government was effective in addressing infrastructure challenges.36 As a stand-alone entity, the NIB would address these concerns by selecting projects for funding across sectors based on broadly demonstrated need and ability to meet defined policy goals, such as economic benefit, energy independence, improved health and safety, efficiency, and return on investment. </span>//The NIB will create jobs … global rivals.//

There are many suggestions for how to structure such a bank, including a Senate proposal sponsored by John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, which earned the strange-bedfellow support of both the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, has introduced a House bill, and President Barack Obama has advanced a plan that mixes loans and grants.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Creating a National Infrastructure Bank is __the best__ way to use scarce governmental resources to attract private investment in transportation infrastructure.

**<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to propose an employment stimulus package worth over $300 billion (Bloomberg) in a speech to both houses of Congress on Thursday. The plan will aim to create new jobs through a combination of tax cuts and--more contentiously--government spending on infrastructure projects. </span>The most sweeping proposal …//in the long run//.<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> But many congressional Republicans say that, as with the stimulus package implemented during the height of the financial crisis, U.S. workers would not immediately feel the effects of infrastructure spending, if at all.
