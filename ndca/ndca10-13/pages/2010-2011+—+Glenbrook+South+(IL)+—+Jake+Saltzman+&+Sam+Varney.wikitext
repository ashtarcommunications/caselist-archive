**Non-unique-we’re losing the war now-COIN failure guarantees Taliban strength-this is the only argument we need to win**

**Regional Actors Prevent Takeover-incentive to prevent it**
**Hadar, 10**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - research fellow in foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, specializing in foreign policy, international trade, the Middle East, and South and East Asia. (7/28/10, Leon, “What happens if US troops leave Afghanistan? Not the end of the world as we know it,” <span style="color: blue;">[[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=12011]]</span>)</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As the members of War Party and its political-media echo chamber continue recycling their spin on WeakiLeaks-Afghanistan — hey-there-is-no-big-news-here-like-we-didn't-know — that-let's-stay-the-course — Washington — as opposed to the Rest of the Country — remains chained to the conventional wisdom (CW) that, well, even if things in Afghanistan are not working as planned and may be heading toward F-U Territory, the alternative — getting out of Hindu-Kush — would spell U-S D-E-F-E-A-T, helicopters on the American embassy's roof, the Barbarians at the Gate, the Fall of the Roman Empire, the End of the World as We Know it. Even the less hysterical types among us warn of the possible loss of American "credibility" around the world, of the potential threat to the Afghani secularists, women, religious minorities, and of the realistic scenario under which the failed state of Afghanistan degenerates into a total anarchy and is engulfed in a bloody civil war between ethnic and tribal groups that could draw in foreign powers and ignite a regional (nuclear?) war between India and Pakistan. The //Financial Times//' foreign affairs analyst, Gideon Rachman — more incisive and much less pompous than you-know-who — responds to this scary CW that seems to suggest that we will be there — yesterday, today, tomorrow — "To prevent Afghanistan becoming a failed state and a haven for terrorists," by asking, "If we are in Afghanistan, why are we not also in Somalia, Yemen or Pakistan?" Rachman point out that these countries (one could add Kashmir and some of our beloved Central Asia's "Stans" to the list) have become centers of operations for mishmash of radical Islamist terrorist groups — al Qaeda franchises or "al Qaeda @" — that (try) to impose their control over some people and some territory and (try) to export their brand of terrorism to other countries in the geographical neighborhood. Here is Rachman's main point: The U.S. and its</span> allies have been dealing with this threat (<span style="font-size: 8pt;">notice I did not put quotation mark here)</span> in Somalia <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(and in Yemen and Pakistan) </span>through a <span style="font-size: 8pt;">combination of whatcha call "over the horizon</span>" counterterrorism <span style="font-size: 8pt;">strategy or the "Somali Model," to use Rachman's term. "Monitor potential terrorist activity in Somalia from a distance, using a mixture of satellite and human intelligence. And, where possible and necessary, intervene with targeted military strikes," he recommends. The arm-chair strategists in the //Washington Post//do not like the idea, arguing that "over the horizon" strategy does nothing "to change the conditions under which al-Qaeda finds refuge and recruits." They continue to support whatcha call "counterinsurgency strategy" or COIN, by "providing security for the civilian population, economic reconstruction and the brokering of political accords — in other words, nation-building." That is as true in Somalia as it is in Iraq, the happy warrior and nation builders in the //Post// suggest. But </span>the COIN strategy that <span style="font-size: 8pt;">General Petraeus and his Australian mate and their disciples in Washington think tanks which the U.S</span>. failed <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to impleme</span>nt in Vietnam will certainly not work in Afghanistan.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Indeed, the notion that the U.S. has the power and the will — not to mention the interest — to engage in a long and costly process of</span> building a nation-<span style="font-size: 8pt;">state</span> in Afghanistan <span style="font-size: 8pt;">— — rebuilding, remaking, restructuring, reconstructing, and reforming this failed state and its mishmash of ethnic, religious, and tribal groups — the Pashtun and Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara, and the Aimak and the Turkmen and the Baloch people, its underdeveloped economy, nonexistent military, and "civil society" —</span> **is nothing more than a fantasy**. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In reality, it could create —</span> it is creating! — a series of "blowbacks" that could <span style="font-size: 8pt;">end-up</span> igniti<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ng</span> more <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and not less</span> anti-American terrorism. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">And let's face it: What Petraeus has achieved in Iraq is a temporary cease-fire between the Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds and the many other religious sects and tribes, that may — like in maybe — provide for a "decent interval" during which the U.S. could pull-out its troops from Mesopotamia. If anything, the American invasion or Iraq has interrupted a very bloody and horrific "nation building" process by Saddam Hussein and resulted in a civil war that will probably continue in one form or another for many years to come. My guess is that a U.S. military disengagement would probably ignite a similar kind of civil war in Afghanistan as the largest ethnic group, the Pashtun fight with the Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras (the three groups that dominated the victorious Northern Alliance) as outside regional powers led by Pakistan, India, Russia and China providing support for their clients. Contrary to the dire warnings of members of Washington's War Party</span> such a process could <span style="font-size: 8pt;">actually help</span> create <span style="font-size: 8pt;">some level of</span> stability<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Afghanistan</span> as Pakistan and India help establish spheres of influence <span style="font-size: 8pt;">there: Pakistan will maintain its influence in the so-called Pashtun-belt in the south where a the Taliban could emerge as the major local player, while India exert its own influence in the north of Afghanistan. In fact, </span>the expectation for U.S. military pull-out from Iraq has helped produce similar incentives <span style="font-size: 8pt;">for regional powers like Turkey, Iran and the Sunni Arab states to establish a certain balance of power in that country, with Turkey establishing friendly ties with the Kurds in the North while cooperating with Iran to prevent the emergence of an independent Kurdish state. Similarly, Iran and the Saudis have a common interest in averting a full-blown military confrontation between the Shiites and the Sunnis. There is no reason why</span> India and Pakistan would <span style="font-size: 8pt;">not</span> cooperate in controlling <span style="font-size: 8pt;">their clients in</span> Afghanistan <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in order to avoid a regional military conflagration. In any case, outside global powers, including the U.S. are constrained in their ability to shape the political realities in Afghanistan, and they have no moral obligation to do that. That does not mean that Washington should not use its diplomatic and economic power — and in some cases, limited military assistance — to help those players that share its interests and values. And it certainly should continue applying an effective counter-terrorism strategy to deal with the concrete threat of al-Qaeda @. As I have written two years ago, the </span>Obama <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Administration needed to modify its "belief about the moral benefit and policy utility of nation-building" which amounted to nothing more than mumbo-jumbo rhetoric. It</span> should <span style="font-size: 8pt;">"abandon these fantasies and instead embrace a realist policy of working with regional powers to</span> secure <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the limited but</span> actual <span style="font-size: 8pt;">U.S.</span> interests in Afghanistan <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and the rest of South and Central Asia — weakening the influence of radical Islam;</span> damaging <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the infrastructure of</span> terrorist groups; preventing <span style="font-size: 8pt;">unstable regimes and</span> terrorist organizations from gaining <span style="font-size: 8pt;">access to</span> weapons of mass destruction." <span style="font-size: 8pt;">You do not have to engage in the grandiose project of nation-building in order to achieve these limited goals.</span>

First, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">there is no reason for al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan. It seems safer in Pakistan</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the moment. Indeed, al-Qaeda has so far not returned to Taliban controlled areas in Afghanistan. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Al-Qaeda’s relationship with Taliban factions has never been very smooth</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, despite the past public display of Usama bin Laden’s pledge of bayat to Mullah Omar. Al-Qaeda leaders seem intimately involved in the Haqqani network in North Waziristan, less so with Mullah Omar’s Quetta Shura, and even less with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s forces. Indeed, the presence of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan divided Taliban leaders before their downfall. Likewise, loyalty for Taliban leader Mullah Omar also divided al-Qaeda leadership. This complex relationship between al-Qaeda and Afghan Taliban factions opens up an opportunity for the U.S. Government to mobilize its deep understanding of local history, culture and politics to prevent the return of a significant al-Qaeda presence in Afghanistan through exploitation of internal rivalries and judicious use of political and economic incentives [8].</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> c. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Even if a triumphant Taliban invites al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan, its presence there will look very similar to its presence in the FATA</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Times have changed. The presence of large sanctuaries in Afghanistan was predicated on Western not so benign neglect of the al-Qaeda funded camps there. This era is gone because Western powers will no longer tolerate them. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">There are many ways to prevent the return of al-Qaeda to Afghanistan besides a national counter-insurgency strategy</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Vigilance through electronic monitoring, spatial surveillance, networks of informants in contested territory, exploitation of internal Afghan rivalries, combined with the nearby stationing of a small force dedicated to physically eradicate any visible al-Qaeda presence in Afghanistan will prevent the return of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The proper military mission in Afghanistan and elsewhere is sanctuary denial</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
**<span style="color: black;">Non-Pashtun Actors Prevent Takeover </span>**
**Katz 9** (professor of government and politics at George Mason University, Mark, “Assessing an Afghanistan <span class="il"><span style="color: black;">Withdrawal</span></span>,” 9/9, ISN Security Watch, [[@http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?lng=en&id=105801]])
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">First, it is not clear that a US/NATO <span class="il"><span style="color: black;">withdrawal</span></span> would lead to the Taliban returning to power in much more of Afghanistan than they control now. </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">While the Taliban have a base of support</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">among the Pashtuns in the south, </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">they appear to have no support among non-Pashtuns </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">elsewhere. Because of their experience under Taliban rule from 1996 through 2001, the non-Pashtuns have no illusions about what life will be like for them if the Taliban return to power. This could well motivate them to put aside differences among themselves (which helped the Taliban in 1996) and resist it - something with which the US and NATO could assist even after a complete or partial troop <span class="il"><span style="color: black;">withdrawal</span></span>. Further, even if the Taliban were to return to power in Afghanistan, it is not clear that it would give al-Qaida carte blanche the way it did before 9/11. This after all is what led to the US/NATO intervention in Afghanistan just afterward. The Taliban may well prefer to severely circumscribe or even sacrifice al-Qaida in order to avoid the possibility of a second costly interruption to its hold on power. Finally, al-Qaida and its affiliates already have access to Pakistan’s Northwest Frontier Province, Somalia, Yemen and other badlands. It is not clear how al-Qaida’s getting more access to Afghanistan than it now has would materially increase its already considerable ability to attack the West. Far more than what it might add to al-Qaida’s capabilities, the most important geopolitical impact of a US/NATO <span class="il"><span style="color: black;">withdrawal</span></span> from Afghanistan would be the perception of a western (read: American) defeat. Yet even </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">in the worst case - the Taliban return to power and once again allow carte blanche to al-Qaida - the</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">most </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">negative</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">geopolitical </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">effects are more likely to be felt not by the US</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and Europe (which al-Qaida can attack without a base in Afghanistan since it already has bases elsewhere), but the countries neighboring and near Afghanistan: the Central Asian republics, Russia, China, India - and perhaps even Pakistan and Iran. </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">The impact of a US</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">/NATO </span><span class="il"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver; color: black;">withdrawal</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, then, </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">could well be to make these neighboring and nearby governments feel more vulnerable, and thus more willing to increase or initiate cooperation</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">with the US and NATO to contain al-Qaida and the Taliban within Afghanistan. This is not to say that the US and NATO will be better off after a complete <span class="il"><span style="color: black;">withdrawal</span></span> from Afghanistan or a partial one from the south. <span class="il"><span style="color: black;">Withdrawal</span></span> will surely have some negative consequences. But not withdrawing will also have negative consequences if the US/NATO intervention becomes even less popular in Afghanistan and the West than it is now. Even if a <span class="il"><span style="color: black;">withdrawal</span></span> from Afghanistan results in the worst case scenario its opponents predict, </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">this is highly likely to be mitigated by non-Pashtuns inside Afghanistan or the governments of neighboring and nearby countries acquiring the incentive to increase</span> (or in some cases<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">,</span> initiate) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">security cooperation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with the US and NATO against the common threat. Just as maintaining or increasing US/NATO military involvement in Afghanistan will not necessarily lead to victory, <span class="il"><span style="color: black;">withdrawal</span></span> will not necessarily lead to defeat there. </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Here are the issues. Number one, both Peter and Ivan have talked about this, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the Taliban is not monolithic. We here in the United States tend to equate the Taliban with Al Qaeda. They’re not one and the same. There are elements of the Taliban that would support Al Qaeda in wanting to attack the United States. There are other elements of the Taliban that are just interested in having a say in the government in Afghanistan. We’ve got to stop treating them monolithically as a single threat as if somehow they are a threat to the United States of America proper. They’re not.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We have to be willing to live with less than perfect in terms of what happens in Afghanistan, and I also think that we have to be willing to concede at this point that what’s left of Al Qaeda, whether they’re operating out of Pakistan or coming across the boarder periodically into Afghanistan. And by the way I saw a news report that supposedly even Bin Laden—assuming he’s still alive—finds his way across the border into Afghanistan periodically. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Al Qaeda isn’t the same Al Qaeda that existed, that attacked us on 9/11, and Bin Laden in particular does not have operational control over a group that has global reach that can attack the United States.</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Our larger problem is not Osama Bin Laden and what is left of Al Qaeda hiding out in Pakistan</span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">. Our larger problem is the ideology of radical Islam, which has seeped into the Muslim world in part because we’ve helped propagate that by our actions in places </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">like Iraq and Afghanistan. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">I would argue that whatever benefit there might be to getting Bin Laden at this point, and believe me I would love to be able to say that we got Osama Bin Laden, but strategically the costs required to try and get Bin Laden and contain Al Qaeda far outweigh any residual benefit at this stage</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Bin Laden and the people surrounding him no longer represent operationally the real threat to the United States. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The real threat is sort of everywhere within the Muslim world being fueled by ideology and anti-American sentiment.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> So </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">this notion of denying Al Qaeda safe haven in Afghanistan, I think, is a pie-in-the-sky notion. Al Qaeda—there will be some safe havens</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Why? Because there will always be people who have sympathies and decide they want to support groups like Al Qaeda. The question is, are they local threats or global threats? As long as they are local threats, then those are threats that the Afghan government has to deal with and ones that we may have to live with—again, less than perfect</span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">. It’s the global threat that Al Qaeda may represent that we have to worry about. I think we have to worry about that less now than we did eight years ago. I think we have to worry more that we are radicalizing Muslims around the world</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as witnessed by the bombings in Madrid and London in particular. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Our very presence</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in two Muslim countries at the moment, Iraq and Afghanistan, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">goes a long, long way to fueling that radicalism that it’s U.S. occupation that makes us a target</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There may be a certain amount of anti-Western, anti-U.S. elements in radical Islamic ideology, but </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">most of that is because we’re there in their territories, not necessarily that they want to come after the United States in the U.S.</span></span>


**Nonunique –withdrawal deadline**

Obama's troop withdrawal timetable makes defeat inevitable<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">,” 6/25, Lexis Academic) </span></span></span>
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">America is repeating the mistakes of the past. The problem in Afghanistan is not one of personnel. It is one of strategy. Whether it is Gen. McChrystal or Gen. Petraeus overseeing the war is irrelevant. A deeply flawed strategy will fail no matter who is in charge.</span>
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Mr.</span><span style="color: black;"> Obama's decision to announce the start of a troop withdrawal in July 2011 has guaranteed the war cannot be won. The Taliban is simply waiting America out; their forces are escalating attacks, knowing that by killing more U.S. troops they will encourage an even quicker </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">pullout.</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> Moreover, </span><span style="color: black;">the Afghan people have no incentive to cooperate with American and NATO forces because they know once the West is gone, they will be left in the lurch. T</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">he Taliban and al Qaeda are not going anywhere, while the Yanks are leaving; thus, Islamist retribution for collaboration with the infidels will be swift, brutal and merciless.</span>
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Also, the decision not to deploy massive U.S. airpower and ground troops in neighboring Pakistan - especially the porous border areas along the North West Frontier Provinces - has assured the Taliban a safe haven from which to launch a sustained guerrilla campaign against the West. Until the Islamist insurgents are wiped out in Pakistan, the conflict in Afghanistan will grind on - senselessly, aimlessly, tragically.</span>
<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Mr. </span><span style="color: black;">Biden has announced that "many troops" will be "leaving" Afghanistan in the summer of 2011. The administration already has</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, in essence,</span><span style="color: black;"> waved the white flag of surrender. The U</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="color: black;">S</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="color: black;">will leave Afghanistan in defeat - humiliated on the world stage as a paper tiger, a feckless and self-indulgent nation unable to carry the burden of global leadership</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. This will represent a historic victory for the forces of Islamic fascism; radical Islam will have brought the American giant to its knees - and in the very place, Afghanistan, where the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were imagined and planned.</span><span style="color: black;"> It will signify the death of American pre-eminence.</span>
**<span style="color: black;">Perception of Being Bogged Down crushes US international credibility</span>**
**Innocent and Carpenter, 9 -** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">*foreign policy analyst at Cato who focuses on Afghanistan and Pakistan AND **vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at Cato (Malou and Ted, “Escaping the Graveyard of Empires: A Strategy to Exit Afghanistan,” <span style="color: black;">http://www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/escaping-graveyard-empires-strategy-exit-afghanistan.pdf</span>)**</span>
**<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Myth #3: Withdrawal Would Erode America’s Global Status</span>**
**<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Former national security adviser Henry Kissinger, Council on Foreign Relations scholar Stephen Biddle, and many others, concede that the war in Central Asia will be long, expensive, and risky, yet they claim it is ultimately worth waging because a withdrawal would boost jihadism globally and make America look weak.26 But </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">what we’ve invested in the Afghanistan mission could all fall apart whether we withdraw tomorrow or 20 years from now. In fact</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">, if leaving would make America </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">look</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> weak, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">trying</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> to stay indefinitely </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">while accomplishing little</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> would <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">appear even worse</span></span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. If the issue is preventing U.S. soldiers from having died in vain, pursuing a losing strategy would not vindicate their sacrifice. And </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">trying to pacify all of Afghanistan, much less hoping to do so on a permanent basis, is a losing strategy. </span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Regardless, some people invoke memories of America’s ignominious withdrawals from Vietnam, Somalia, and Lebanon to muster support for an open-ended commitment. President Bush in 2007 claimed that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today’s terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility. “Here at home,” he said, “some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently.”27 Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute agrees with that reasoning, writing that “the 1983 withdrawal from Lebanon and the retreat from Somalia a decade later emboldened Islamists who saw the United States as a paper tiger.”28 When opinion leaders in Washington talk about “lessons learned” from Vietnam, Somalia, Lebanon, and other conflicts, they typically draw the wrong lesson: not that America should avoid intervening in someone else’s domestic dispute, but that America should never give up after having intervened, no matter what the cost.29 But </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">the longer we stay and the more money we spend, the more we’ll feel compelled to remain in the country to validate the investment</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. A similar self-imposed predicament plagued U.S. officials during the war in Vietnam: After 1968 it became increasingly clear that the survival of the [government of South Vietnam] was not worth the cost of securing it, but by then the United States had another rationale for staying— prestige and precedent setting. The United States said the [South Vietnamese government] would stand, and even those in the administration now long convinced of the hollowness of the domino argument could agree that a U.S. failure in South Vietnam might endanger vital US national interests elsewhere or in the future.30 For decades, the fear of America losing the world’s respect after withdrawing from a conflict has been instrumental in selling the American public bad foreign policy. Perhaps most troubling about the reflexively “stay the course” mentality of some Americans is the widespread insensitivity about the thousands of people—civilian and military, domestic and foreign—killed, maimed, and traumatized in war. But when the stakes seem unrelated to vital national interests, the American public rightly resents their country’s interference in third party problems, and is extremely skeptical of nation building. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">History shows that, sooner or later</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">, disenchantment will manifest in public </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">and congressional</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> opposition. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">After nearly a decade in Afghanistan, even the memory of 9/11 might not be sufficient to outweigh the sacrifice in blood and treasure</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Perhaps the most important argument against the “withdrawal is weak-kneed” meme is that America’s military roams the planet, controls the skies and space, faces no peer competitor, and wields one of the planet’s largest nuclear arsenals. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">America </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">is responsible for almost half of the world’s military spending and</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> can project its power around the globe</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Thus, </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the contention that America would appear “weak” </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">after withdrawing from Afghanistan</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> is ludicrous</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Unfortunately, bureaucratic inertia and a misplaced conception of Washington’s moral obligations (an argument that more often than not legitimizes America’s military occupation of a foreign people) threaten to trap the United States in Afghanistan for decades. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Overall</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">, remaining in Afghanistan is more likely to tarnish America’s reputation </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">and undermine U.S. security</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> than </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">would</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> withdrawal</span></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">.</span>**

"I do not make this decision lightly," Obama said. Obama estimated that $30 billion would be spent this year on the war in Afghanistan, and he said the security of not only Americans but also people in Afghanistan and Pakistan is at stake. He said he aims for the troops to disrupt and dismantle al Qaeda and to deny al Qaeda a safe haven for violent extremism in Afghanistan.

**COIN massively unpopular**
**Washington Times** **09** (Kim R. Holmes SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES, 8/20/09, "What's the Big Idea: Obama facing the tests of war in Afghanistan amid elections", lexis)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">All this is true. But keeping his promise to win the "good" war in Afghanistan won't be easy. </span>The president will face many tests along the way. Starting now. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The first test is in responding to the outcome of Thursday's elections in Afghanistan. The Obama administration has not yet figured out how to integrate successfully its nation-building efforts at the central government level with the much harder work of dealing with local factions and tribes susceptible to Taliban intimidation. If the elections simply ratify the status quo in Kabul, the disconnect between central and local governance will likely continue. Corruption is undermining the legitimacy of the Afghan government, and legitimacy is critical in building up a strong Afghan army - as well as U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in the countryside. Until corruption is at least minimized, the war cannot be won. </span>The second test is whether Mr. Obama will back his new strategy in Afghanistan with the resources needed to make it work. The administration's policy, unveiled in March, puts a high priority on protecting Afghan civilians as part of a counterinsurgency strategy<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>**There is already pushback from some Democrats** who insist the Afghan "quagmire" will cost too much and drain resources from domestic programs. Mr. Obama 's habit of trying to have it both ways - tacking back and forth between tough and soft statements and ultimately splitting the difference on policy - may not convince these Democrats in the long run<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Mr. Obama will probably end up trying to keep his liberal critics at bay by giving Gen. Stan McChrystal fewer troops than he needs. That would produce an ever-worse dilemma down the road. Insufficient troops will minimize battlefield success, ultimately prolonging the war. The longer the war lasts, the more criticism Mr. Obama will face from his political base. Time is not on his side politically, and his antiwar position on Iraq actually puts him in a politically weaker position than former President George W. Bush was on war policies. </span>Mr. Obama 's base is not only more hostile to some of his policies, but far less patient should he make unpopular decisions. That could lead to Mr. Obama 's third big test - one that could actually be his undoing. Whether the president knows it or not, his biggest allies on Afghanistan are pro-national security conservatives. Yet he still gives defensive speeches, as he did this week before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, attacking Sen. John McCain of Arizona and other conservatives over the war in Iraq<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This makes no sense. </span>If he is serious about winning in Afghanistan, he needs to stop this divisive rhetoric and realize that his Afghan policies face a potential challenge from the right flank as<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> well. </span>So far, most conservatives are holding strong behind the war effort. But there already are rumblings among some conservatives that "Obama 's war" may not be worth fighting. Far more threatening than traditional isolationist or libertarian antiwar arguments are so-called conservative realists who may conclude that only a minimalist effort is all that is possible - or worse, needed - in Afghanistan. Such people may come to think that the U.S. is caught in the "graveyard of empires," a place where the more we try to do, the worse the problem gets. It's not that Mr. Obama will face a conservative revolt against the war in Afghanistan. But when he needs conservatives to face down the dovish left wing of his own party, he may not find them eager allies.

<span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As a consequence, the US has adopted a policy of qualified escalation, seeking to pacify Afghanistan through coercive and expansive counter-insurgency</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (‘clear, hold, build’) operations and a concerted state-building effort to bring order to its politics, contain regional militancy and ensure stability in Pakistan. </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The US plans to bring the American troop presence in Afghanistan to a peak of 100,000</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by late summer 2010, which would represent an increase of nearly a third over the mid-2009 number.

**Political capital isn’t key – issues are compartmentalized**
**Dickinson, 09**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – professor of political science at Middlebury College and taught previously at Harvard University where he worked under the supervision of presidential scholar Richard Neustadt (5/26/09, Matthew, Presidential Power: A NonPartisan Analysis of Presidential Politics, “Sotomayor, Obama and Presidential Power,” http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/)</span>

__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As for Sotomayor, from here the path toward almost certain confirmation goes as follows: the Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold hearings sometime this summer (this involves both written depositions and of course open hearings), which should lead to formal Senate approval before Congress adjourns for its summer recess in early August. So Sotomayor will likely take her seat in time for the start of the new Court session on October 5. (I talk briefly about the likely politics of the nomination process below). What is of more interest to me, however, is what her selection reveals about the basis of presidential power. </span>Political scientists, like baseball writers evaluating hitters, have devised numerous means of measuring a president’s influence in Congress.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I will devote a separate post to discussing these, but in brief, </span>they often center on the creation of legislative “box scores” designed to measure how many times a president’s preferred piece of legislation, or nominee to the executive branch or the courts, is approved by Congress. That is, how many pieces of legislation that the president supports actually pass Congress? How often do members of Congress vote with the president’s preferences?<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> How often is a president’s policy position supported by roll call outcomes? </span>These measures<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span>are a misleading gauge of presidential power – they are a better indicator of congressional power.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This is because </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">how members of Congress vote</span> on a<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nominee or </span>legislative item <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">is **rarely influenced by anything a president does**</span>**.** Although journalists (and political scientists) often focus on <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the legislative “endgame</span>” to gauge presidential influence – will the President swing enough votes to get his preferred legislation enacted? – **this <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">mistakes an outcome with actual evidence of presidential influence</span>.** Once we control for other factors – **a member of Congress’ <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">ideological and partisan leanings</span>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the political leanings of her constituency, whether she’s up for reelection</span> or not – we <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">can usually predict how she will vote without needing to know much of anything about what the president wants.</span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (I am ignoring the importance of a president’s veto power for the moment.) </span>Despite the much publicized and celebrated instances of presidential arm-twisting during the legislative endgame, then, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">most legislative outcomes don’t depend on presidential lobbying</span>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But this is not to say that presidents lack influence. Instead, the primary means by which presidents influence what Congress does is through their ability to determine the alternatives from which Congress must choose. That is, presidential power is largely an exercise in agenda-setting – not arm-twisting. And we see this in the Sotomayer nomination. Barring a major scandal, she will almost certainly be confirmed to the Supreme Court whether Obama spends the confirmation hearings calling every Senator or instead spends the next few weeks ignoring the Senate debate in order to play Halo III on his Xbox. That is, how senators decide to vote on Sotomayor will have almost nothing to do with Obama’s lobbying from here on in (or lack thereof). His real influence has already occurred, in the decision to present Sotomayor as his nominee. If we want to measure Obama’s “power”, then, we need to know what his real preference was and why he chose Sotomayor. My guess – and it is only a guess – is that after conferring with leading Democrats and Republicans, he recognized the overriding practical political advantages accruing from choosing an Hispanic woman, with left-leaning credentials. We cannot know if this would have been his ideal choice based on judicial philosophy alone, but presidents are never free to act on their ideal preferences. Politics is the art of the possible. Whether Sotomayer is his first choice or not, however, her nomination is a reminder that the power of the presidency often resides in the president’s ability to dictate the alternatives from which Congress (or in this case the Senate) must choose. Although Republicans will undoubtedly attack Sotomayor for her judicial “activism” (citing in particular her decisions regarding promotion and affirmative action), her comments regarding the importance of gender and ethnicity in influencing her decisions, and her views regarding whether appellate courts “make” policy, they run the risk of alienating Hispanic voters – an increasingly influential voting bloc (to the extent that one can view Hispanics as a voting bloc!) I find it very hard to believe she will not be easily confirmed. In structuring the alternative before the Senate in this manner, then, Obama reveals an important aspect of presidential power that cannot be measured through legislative boxscores.\</span>__

**Cooperation inevitable-Nuclear deal and converging interests**
**Kumar 9** (Arum, staff writer Headlines India, "US and India poised to become global partners", June 26, http://headlinesindia.mapsofindia.com/india-and-world/united-states/us-and-india-poised-to-become-global-partners-15116.html, JS)
Washington**:** With the India-US civil nuclear deal establishing a new level of trust between the two countries, New Delhi and Washington are poised to become "global partners" to help shape the 21st century, says a senior US official. The recent visit of Undersecretary of State William Burns to India had paved the way for the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to visit "and underscores our commitment to an expanded partnership with India," Robert O. Blake, Jr, the new US pointman for South Asia, told a panel of the House of Representatives on Thursday. President Barack Obama and Clinton "have both expressed a deep commitment to building stronger ties with India, a commitment based on mutual respect and mutual interests," Blake, the new assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs, noted. As "Clinton recently put it in her speech before the US India Business Council 'we see India as one of the few key partners worldwide who will help us shape the 21st century,'" he said giving a regional overview of South Asia to the House Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia. Noting that the ruling Congress Party won a substantial victory in India's recent elections and "formed a coalition supportive of a stronger US-India relationship", Blake said the US looked forward to working with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government to make that vision a reality. "The US-India relationship has been on a positive trajectory for over a decade", he said. And Both Clinton and Obama "hope that the next stage in our country's relationship will see a dramatic expansion in our common agenda, and a greater role for India in solving global challenges," Blake said citing Clinton. "The implementation of the Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative established this new level of trust between our countries and set the stage for the next level of US India cooperation in which we can become global partners while also focusing on India's still huge development needs," he said. The US also continued to support dialogue between Indian and Pakistani leaders, he said. But "the timing and scope and content of any such dialogue are strictly matters for the Indians and Pakistani to decide." Earlier, the sub-committee's Democratic chairman Gary Ackerman noted that "with India we are moving forward on what I believe can be and will be a true strategic partnership, one built on both shared values and genuine cooperation across a broad range of shared interests." 

**Obama has an incentive to sell the plan as part of a new commitment to a regional strategy**

Washington, Sep 10 Describing India as an emerging global player, a U.S. official has said that President Barack Obama looks forward to his trip to a nation that is essential to solving regional challenges, including Afghanistan. "As we've said many times, it is a vitally important relationship to the region and to the world," Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, Phillip J. Crowley told reporters on Thursday. "The world's oldest democracy and largest democracy should have constructive relations, and we do." While the agenda is still being developed for Obama's trip "there will be — there's always deliverables, as we call them, when you have presidential travel to critical countries," he said. The official said he anticipated a broad agenda, but he wouldn't be surprised if issues like the India's nuclear liability bill, U.S. export controls list and India future role in Afghanistan are part of that discussion. "India, as an emerging global player, will be essential to solving challenges in the region, Afghanistan being one, and challenges globally, climate change being one," Crowley said. In Afghanistan, the U.S. is pursuing a regional strategy, he said, "which is why we have expanded our discussions with other countries, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and other countries in the region, and we're not ruling out cooperation with Iran when it comes to Afghanistan." "This is a regional challenge and we expect that key countries in the region, including India, will develop their own relationship with Afghanistan, Crowley said. "As we've said to many countries, this cannot be seen within a zero-sum calculation." "So we want to have constructive relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, want to have constructive relations between Afghanistan and India, we want to have constructive relations between Afghanistan and Iran and other countries in the region." The United States, Crowley said, had talked about Afghanistan with India, with Pakistan, with other Central Asian republics, and in each case, it was promoting a regional agenda. "We want to see increasing commerce among these countries. We believe if you develop trading relationships, if you develop economic interests, that can have an impact on reducing regional tensions." 
**No link uniqueness-disputes over Afghanistan now-India wants more influence and feels the US favors Pakistan**
**Smith 8/20** (Jeff M., Kraemer Strategy Fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council, the Diplomat, "How to Fix US-India Ties", 2010, [[http://the-diplomat.com/2010/08/20/how-to-fix-us-india-ties/4/]], JS)
And then there’s Pakistan. Short of fundamental changes in the US-Pakistan relationship, the United States’ generous financial and military support for that country will always be a contentious point in US-India relations. In this regard, Obama hasn’t dramatically changed course for better or worse. However, his administration did push through a massive, $7.5 billion civilian aid package to complement billions of dollars in military aid that Indians fear will be diverted toward India-focused weapons programmes and terrorist groups. During the legislative process, the administration, particularly the Defence Department, lobbied intensively to get tough restrictions and accountability measures on the aid removed from the congressional bills. Elsewhere, the Obama administration mishandled the arrest of David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American arrested in October 2009 for involvement in the November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack that killed 173 in ‘India’s 9/11’. Repeated Indian requests for access to Headley, a former informant for the Drug Enforcement Agency, were rebuffed for eight months, long enough to fuel frustration and conspiratorial speculation in New Delhi before India’s National Investigative Agency was granted access to Headley for a week in June. But it’s arguably **Afghanistan that is the most surprising area of contention** because Washington and New Delhi have for so long been on the same page. India is one of the largest aid donors to Afghanistan and a staunch supporter of the Hamid Karzai regime, not to mention extremely popular among Afghans. Like the United States, it seeks a stable, democratic, independent Afghanistan free of terror. Yet while it has done so politely and diplomatically, New Delhi has been the most vocal opponent of Afghan and Coalition efforts to negotiate with the Taliban. The Obama administration has been inching toward supporting such a strategy and Pakistan has been positioning itself to serve as the primary interlocutor and beneficiary in any settlement. But India, naturally, doesn’t want to see the Taliban or any Pakistani proxy return to power. New Delhi is already painfully familiar with Pakistan’s agenda in Afghanistan: at least one of two devastating attacks on India’s Embassy in Kabul, a July 2008 bombing killing 58, was traced to Pakistan’s Directorate of Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) by US intelligence agencies. As the sole voice cautioning against Taliban reconciliation, India was sidelined when the fate of Afghanistan was being debated at the London Conference in January. And New Delhi was visibly aggrieved when then-Afghan commander General Stanley McChrystal warned in 2009 that ‘increasing Indian influence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures.’

**The logic of the Disad is based on flawed zero-sum neocon logic which is empirically denied-the thesis of the DA is nonsensical-our author indicts the qualifications and the logic of Kaplan-counterbalancing guarantees sustained US-Indo cooperation**

Robert Kaplan says all manner of silly things, but because he says them in important places, [[http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/South%20Asias%20Geography%20of%20Conflict_Robert%20D.%20Kaplan_0.pdf|we’re supposed to listen]]: He or she who sits in Delhi with his back to Muslim Central Asia must still worry about unrest up on the plateaus to the northwest. The United States will draw down its troops one day in Afghanistan, but India will still have to live with the results, and therefore remain intimately engaged. [“The quickest way to undermine U.S.-India relations is for the United States to withdraw precipitously from Afghanistan”] In the process of leaving behind an anarchic and radicalized society, which in and of itself is contrary to India’s interests, such a withdrawal would signal to Indian policy elites that the United States is surely a declining power on which they cannot depend. Detente with China might then seem to be in India’s interest. After all, China wants a stable Afghanistan for trade routes; India, for security. Because of India’s history and geography, an American failure in Afghanistan bodes ill for our bilateral relationship with New Delhi. Put simply, if the United States deserts Afghanistan, it deserts India. Indeed, India is quietly testing the United States in Afghanistan perhaps to the same intense degree as Israel is very publicly testing the United States in regards to a nuclear Iran. I do not suggest that we should commit so much money and national treasure to Afghanistan merely for the sake of impressing India. But I am suggesting that the deleterious effect on U.S.-India bilateral relations of giving up on Afghanistan should be part of our national debate on the war effort there, for at the moment it is not. The fact is that our ability to influence China will depend greatly on our ability to work with India, and that, in turn, will depend greatly on how we perform in Afghanistan. In short, we need to win in Afghanistan in order to prevent the Indians from becoming friends with the Chinese, which would be a strategic disaster of the highest order, or something. There are so many layers of silly and stupid stacked together that it’s difficult to sort them all out. **Kaplan is not merely a silly thinker, but** also **a lazy and unimaginative one.** People like Kaplan have made arguments like this for (literally) centuries; if we don’t commit our blood and treasure to worthless location X, then our “friends” in location Y will dash into the arms of our “enemies” in location Z. The script is well worn, and proved particularly popular during the Cold War. Of course, Kaplan fails to give any clear reason for why the US would fear detente between India and China, and appears oblivious to twenty years of US policy focused on reducing tension along the Sino-Indian border. He trots out a few bits of nonsense about Chinese military bases in the Indian Ocean without bothering to make an argument about why we would want to care about them. Worse, he takes at face value the notion that the Indian leadership would somehow lose faith in our “resolve” and become in short order the lickspittle of China. Pakistani strength, as demonstrated by its ability to control Afghanistan, will drive India into tight alignment with Pakistan’s primary patron. He presents not the faintest evidence that such a move would take place, but rather intones darkly about the threat that this move would present to US strategic interests. He considers not for a moment the idea that Pakistani and Chinese strength and bellicosity might drive the Indians closer to the US; I doubt that the notion that states //balance// against power and threat even occurred to him. No; in his world, India is only worried about US “resolve” and is preparing to surrender the keys of the Taj Mahal to Hu Jintao if the US withdraws from Afghanistan. In the real world, things are rather different. Unsurprisingly, China is paying a [[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/world/asia/23china.html?_r=1&src=tptw|diplomatic price ]]for its bellicosity: For the last several years, one big theme has dominated talk of the future of Asia: As China rises, its neighbors are being inevitably drawn into its orbit, currying favor with the region’s new hegemonic power. The presumed loser, of course, is the United States, whose wealth and influence are being spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and whose economic troubles have eroded its standing in a more dynamic Asia. But rising frictions between China and its neighbors in recent weeks over security issues have handed the United States an opportunity to reassert itself — one the Obama administration has been keen to take advantage of… Meanwhile, China’s increasingly tense standoff with Japan over a Chinese fishing trawler captured by Japanese ships in disputed waters is pushing Japan back under the American security umbrella. The arena for these struggles is shifting this week to a summit meeting of world leaders at the United Nations. Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, has refused to meet with his Japanese counterpart, Naoto Kan, and on Tuesday he threatened Japan with “further action” if it did not unconditionally release the fishing captain. See also [[http://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/InformationDissemination/%7E3/_t5K5Q97OS8/on-strategic-weaknesses.html|Galrahn]] and [[http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/09/23/china_has_a_longer_learning_curve_than_i_had_anticipated|Drezner]]. Tension between China and Russia over weapons licensing have increased in the last few years, leading to reluctance on the part of the Russians to export advanced technology to China. China’s unwillingness to acknowledge North Korea’s destruction of the Cheonan has created tension between Seoul and Beijing. The Japanese are now engaging in offensive military exercises designed to retake islands presumably seized by China. On the Sino-Indian front, tensions over disputed border areas have increased. Vietnam has pursued tighter security and economic cooperation with the United States. None of this is surprising, and it doesn’t even mean that China has been particularly clumsy. The United States, to be sure, has hardly exhibited a deft hand. What it does indicate, however, is that states very often //balance// against power and threat. As Chinese power (and almost necessarily Chinese assertiveness) increases, the states surrounding China don’t knock themselves over in an effort to kowtow to Beijing. Rather, they pursue security relationships that ensure against potential (and it remains almost entirely potential) Chinese belligerence. And yet, Robert Kaplan insists that if we don’t stay in Afghanistan, India will bandwagon and become a Chinese satellite. He presents this claim with no evidence, and makes no effort to logically support it. Indeed, Kaplan makes only the barest effort to claim that his deep knowledge of the Indian character gives him insight into Indian strategic behavior, perhaps because he’s not an India specialist. Kaplan’s talent is to tell the powerful what they want to hear with the veneer of both theoretical insight and empirical knowledge, **while possessing neither.**

**Relations low now and India is satisfied with CT – multiple reasons**
**Sharma, 9/6/10** (Pranay, Outlook (India), factiva)
The protracted, even duplicitous, negotiations between the UPA government and the Opposition over the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, 2010, must have surely given the heebie-jeebies to those in Washington who are responsible for preparing US President Barack Obama’s visit to India in November. As the Liability Bill generated headlines and stoked passion all around, the overwhelming signal to the US was—there isn’t yet a consensus amongst India’s political class about its relationship with America. Worse, several new wrinkles seem to have surfaced in Indo-US relations precisely at that juncture when officials of the two countries should have been carving out the agenda for Obama’s November visit. In some ways, this must depress the Obama team—though he’s the third American president to visit India in 10 years, he’s the first to make the journey in his first term. The eve of the visit should have been marked by excitement, expectations and grandiose plans. Instead, as the debate over the Liability Bill demonstrated, questions are being asked about whether the Indian government has been too accommodative of America’s interest even as Washington has ignored or downplayed India’s. The rancorous ferocity of last week’s debate, as also several pending issues (see infographic), suggest Indo-US relations are not as robust as they were under George W. Bush. True, the Liability Bill was passed, but only after the government agreed to drop the controversial clause that sought to indemnify companies from culpability and liability in the event of a nuclear accident. This was the clause the Americans were keen on because their companies, unlike those of other countries, do not enjoy state support; the possibility of huge compensation payment renders it difficult to secure insurance cover, without which companies are wary of doing business. However, companies enjoying state support are not as badly strapped for insurance. Consequently, the Americans insisted on the indemnity clause, claiming their companies, in competition with those of others, won’t have a level-playing field in India. The deletion of the indemnity clause, admit officials in the ministry of external affairs, is likely to agitate the US and its companies. It was, after all, the US that had used its formidable weight to secure India a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group—for its firms to be placed at a disadvantage in the competition to grab the Indian nuclear pie would seem to be an odd recompense. These officials, however, say the US will ultimately realise the UPA government couldn’t circumvent Parliament. No one in America can blame Manmohan for failing to deliver what he had promised though. His government tried its best to smuggle in the clause seeking to indemnify nuclear suppliers. The Americans, say sources, were kept in the loop at every stage of the debate, every time a clause was deleted, inserted or rewritten. Manmohan was even accused of promoting US interests, of being soft on them. As former secretary in the MEA, Rajiv Sikri, told //Outlook//, “The pertinent question to ask is why the government had not deleted the clause on its own. Perhaps it was trying to bat for someone who was definitely not Indian.” The odds, however, were stacked against the Manmohan government. For one, intense recent scrutiny of the Bhopal gas tragedy loomed large. Weeks had been spent debating the plight of victims of the world’s worst industrial disaster and how Union Carbide, an American company, got off the hook. The media spotlight had been trained on New Delhi’s failure to extradite Carbide president Warren Anderson, an American national, even after 26 years. This backcloth made it well nigh impossible to protect nuclear suppliers from compensation and culpability for nuclear accidents. Bhopal is one reason why Indian diplomats feel the Americans will condone the UPA government’s failure to deliver on the liability issue. Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao too says the liability issue won’t become a problem between India and the US as their relations have matured to an extent that they can understand each other’s problems and discuss these with candour. “Indo-US relations are now acquiring increasing maturity to become more multi-dimensional. They are no longer unifocal,” Rao told //Outlook//. [[#Blurb1]]Yet there are many in the foreign policy establishment who wonder if India enjoys the same kind of status under Obama as it did under Bush. Several new stress-lines have surfaced—for one, there has been a hike of $2,000 for each H-1B visa, thus adversely impacting the Indian IT companies which send their workers to the US. Second, several key Indian organisations remain in the American Entities List, thereby restricting transfer of high technology from the US to India. More importantly, the Obama administration seems keen to outsource the management of Afghanistan to Pakistan, bypassing Indian interests for tactical reasons. Says former foreign secretary Lalit Mansingh, “You cannot have a meaningful strategic partnership when some of your top organisations are in the Entities List.... There is nothing called a perfect marriage.

For instance, some diplomats say that though New Delhi has protested vehemently against the H-1B visa fee hike, this is unlikely to hamper the IT firms operati__ng in the US. “But if we don’t scream and make a song and dance about it, they may put additional burdens,” says a senior official in the MEA. Some feel India must also do its bit to make its relations with the US robust. For starters, it must shed its “developing country” mindset and not see the devil in every US intiative, opposing things merely because Washington is the progenitor. Diplomats say this factor is the reason why India hasn’t yet signed three crucial agreements—the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement, the Communication Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Understanding Agreement (CISMOA) and the Basic Change and Cooperation Agreements for Geo-Spatial Cooperation (BECA). These agreements sought to give India access to sophisticated information and data pertaining to the military hardware New Delhi buys from the US. Since these were mooted during the UPA-I rule, the Left forbade the Manmohan Singh government from entering into a tighter US strategic embrace. Sources say these could be signed during defence minister A.K. Anthony’s visit to the US next month. Former Indian ambassador to the US Naresh Chandra says, “We are no longer the country we were in the early 1990s. The India of 2010 is a confident country, but it has to reflect this in its attitude.” It is an argument that cuts both ways—true, it shouldn’t suspect every US initiative; but it shouldn’t agree to every demand of the US either. Analysts feel India should harness its growing economic clout to bargain hard with the US and protect and nurture its interest. With the Indian nuclear pie expected to be around $150 billion by 2030 and New Delhi expected to make military purchases worth at least $110 billion in the next 12 years, it could grant concessions to the US here for a quid pro quo in another area. As officials begin preparations for Obama’s visit in November, **India would want him to clearly express his resolve to counter terrorism** emanating from Pakistani soil and accept that New Delhi deserves to play a role in Afghanistan. It would also want Obama to show unambiguous support for India’s quest to secure a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. Should America ignore some of these issues, Obama’s November visit could fail to conjure the Bush or Clinton magic. ]]

Several practical implications, which ought to be of significance to the Congress as it ponders the U.S.-Indian civilian nuclear agreement, flow from these realities. To begin with, the strengthening U.S.-Indian relationship does not imply that New Delhi will become a formal alliance partner of Washington at some point in the future. It also does not imply that India will invariably be an uncritical partner of the United States in its global endeavors. India’s large size, its proud history, and its great ambitions, ensure that it will likely march to the beat of its own drummer, at least most of the time. The first question, for the Congress in particular and for the United States more generally, therefore, ought not to be, “What will India do for us?”—as critics of the civilian nuclear agreement often assert. Rather, the real question ought to be, “Is a strong, democratic, (even if perpetually) independent, India in American national interest?” If, as I believe, this is the fundamental question and if, as I further believe, the answer to this question is “Yes,” then the real discussion about the evolution of the U.S.-Indian relationship ought to focus on how the United States can assist the growth of Indian power, and how it can do so at minimal cost (if that is relevant) to any other competing national security objectives.

I say ‘may be’ because very little was said publicly about the meeting because neither of the two countries wants to draw attention to just how strained the relationship has become in past few years. In the meeting, however, the biggest sticking points was about how to deal with Afghanistan. We have seen over the period of a year or few months that the Obama administration had openly said about the withdrawals of U.S. troop from the land commencing 2011. Here, New Delhi differs.

**Withdrawing from Afghanistan is vital to credible deterrence to denuclearize Iran – prevents proliferation and nuclear war Garfinkle, 9 –** editor of The American Interest, former professor of Middle East Politics at the University of Pennsylvania and at the School of Advanced International Studies of The Johns Hopkins University (Adam, “[[http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/2009/11/the-real-linkage-afghanistan-and-iran/|The real linkage: Afghanistan and Iran]],” 11/4, [[http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/2009/11/the-real-linkage-afghanistan-and-iran/]]<span class="Underline">)</span>
As President Obama decides how to proceed in the Afghan war, he needs to add one more variable that is rarely mentioned: Iranian determination to acquire nuclear weapons. <span class="Underline">An ongoing Afghanistan campaign means that resort to force against Iran would be tantamount to starting a second war</span>. The politics being what they are, <span class="Underline">that will knock the military option against Iran off the table, with negative implications for an empowered diplomacy toward Iran</span>. Consider the timelines of the Afghan and Iranian policy portfolios, as President Obama must. Whether or not <span class="Underline">Iran</span> parts with some of its fissile material in coming months in accord with the recent Geneva deal, it <span class="Underline">will</span> still <span class="Underline">have enough nuclear “stuff” for one at least bomb within 18 months</span>. (It may have more than that if, as looks increasingly likely, the recent Qom revelation displayed the tail end of a significant and protracted effort.) <span class="Underline">It will probably have overcome its weaponization and delivery-system challenges within 36-48 months</span>. In 36-48 months U.S. and NATO forces will probably still be fighting in Afghanistan, whether Obama decides on a minimalist, counterterrorism-plus approach or General Stanley McChrystal’s counterinsurgency-minus one. <span class="Underline">The logic and overlapping timetables of the Afghan-Iran linkage suggest a need to choose</span>. How should we think about that choice? Both problems are consequential, but an Iranian nuclear breakout poses more serious long-term security dangers to the region and to the United States than any likely fallout from the Afghan war. Losing in Afghanistan could boost the morale of Islamist extremists worldwide, harm NATO and possibly exacerbate the situation in Pakistan. But <span class="Underline">acquiescing to an Iranian nuclear capability would spell the collapse of the N</span>on-<span class="Underline">P</span>roliferation <span class="Underline">T</span>reaty regime<span class="Underline"> and</span> likely <span class="Underline">set off a proliferation race in and around the region that could catalyze a regional nuclear war</span>. <span class="Underline">Unlike the Cold War deterrence relationship</span> many of us remember, which involved just two sides with mostly secure weapons and command-and-control systems, <span class="Underline">a multifaceted nuclear Middle East without stable second-strike arsenals would be extremely crisis unstable and accident-prone, and could “leak” dangerous materiel to terrorists</span>, as well. It is facile to assert that a deterrence relationship which worked in one context will also work in others; that assumption with respect to Iran is a textbook example of the “lesser-included case” fallacy. <span class="Underline">If American interests require the prevention of an Iranian bomb, then major combat operations in Afghanistan must end before the moment to decide on Iran is at hand</span>. That’s not the track we’re now on. General McChrystal’s plan is a stop-loss effort that cannot achieve a level playing field upon which to drive a new Afghan diplomacy, let alone achieve anything remotely resembling victory in three years or less. There are only two alternatives to preserve a credible military option, and hence a credible diplomacy, with regard to Iran: accept defeat in Afghanistan, whatever we may call it, and leave; or surge militarily to reverse the perception of Taliban ascendancy, and then drive a new political arrangement there to end the war within the next 18-24 months. Either option is preferable to a protracted and inconclusive bloodletting, but the latter option—depending more on air power and avoiding the massive (and counterproductive) garrisoning of the country with foreign forces—is preferable. It would avoid the optic of defeat. A new Afghan coalition government, blessed by a Loya Jirga within and supported by high-level contact-group diplomacy from without, would have at least a chance of creating a stable environment over the longer run—something that cannot reliably be said about the current regime in Kabul. A success in Afghanistan also would lift the admittedly modest prospects that diplomacy can persuade the Iranians to step back from the nuclear precipice, just as failure to turn the tide would likely tempt them forward. And if the Iranians do not step back, a success in Afghanistan will better undergird the diplomacy that must accompany any military operation directed toward them. Clearly, however, no McChrystal-plus option is on the table. This suggests that, barring some major out-of-the-blue event, like the collapse of the Iranian regime, <span class="Underline">the administration will be unable to consider using force against Iran when the time comes to decide</span>, even if it might wish to do so. <span class="Underline">And Tehran’s knowledge that all U.S. military options are off the table is not liable to be helpful.</span>

**2. Lack of US action catalyzes regional actors-solve Iran Prolif** 
**Kerstein 10** (Benjamin, senior writer for the New Ledger, "The inevitable Nuclear Iran", [[http://newledger.com/2010/06/the-inevitable-nuclear-iran/print/]], JS)
It is now all but certain that the American administration has more or less resigned itself to a nuclear Iran. At the very least, it appears to have decided to take no military action against the Iranian nuclear program, nor even to support or encourage – publicly or discreetly – the Iranian popular opposition to the Ahmadinejad regime. The Obama administration will likely continue to pursue its policy of promoting engagement, either out of cynicism or naiveté, while simultaneously busying itself with the diplomatic give and take of arranging international support for sanctions which are unlikely to be effective. It is entirely possible, moreover, that American exhaustion from a decade of war and its public’s concentration on pressing domestic problems will effectively vitiate any political damage that might result from the emergence of a nuclear Iran. This, at any rate, is likely what Obama and the doves in his administration are counting on. At first glance, this appears to be a disastrous state of affairs. But it need not be so. A nuclear armed Iran may be considered the lesser of possible evils by the United States, but it cannot be seen this way by others. To many Americans, the Iranian threat appears to be comfortably distant. This is something of a willful illusion, of course, but it is a politically influential and perhaps decisive one. For Iran’s neighbors, however, as well as many nations on their periphery, the threat is far more immediate. Israeli concerns are naturally the most intense, given the Iranian president’s openly racist and genocidal attitude toward the Jewish state. But Israel is hardly alone in its concerns. If, as many suspect, the ultimate goal of the Iranian theocrats is the establishment of Iranian hegemony in the Middle East and thus the de facto seizure of the leadership of the Muslim world, then almost everyone in the region and many beyond have an interest in preventing such an outcome. The Arab nations (Iran, it should be remembered, is not an Arab state) have squabbled among themselves for decades over leadership and hegemony, with the prize generally going to Egypt. Saudi Arabia, however, home to the most sacred sites and objects of Islam, as well as vast oil wealth, has long harbored its own sense of ancient entitlement. Jordan’s interest remains solely the stability and survival of its anachronistic monarchy. Iraq, still in the throes of its post-totalitarian regeneration, is Iran’s longtime rival, and its large Sunni and Kurdish minorities are unlikely to encourage Iranian dominance on Iraqi borders. These are only a few examples, but they serve to demonstrate the degree to which a newly hegemonic Iran would frustrate and threaten many of the most powerful players in the Middle East. Even Syria, which has established a cordial unofficial alliance with Iran in service of its continuing domination of Lebanon through Hezbollah terrorism, might find itself having second thoughts in the face of an Iran suddenly become much more powerful than Syria itself. Such concerns are even more prominent outside the Arab world. India is far away from the Middle East, but radical Islamic terrorism has taken many Indian lives, and the prospect of a nuclear armed Islamic republic and its possible galvanization of Islamic movements in and around India – especially in its longtime rival Pakistan – cannot be a particularly sanguine prospect. To the north, Russia is currently in the midst of an attempt to resurrect its own regional hegemony while simultaneously fighting its own long war against domestic and foreign Islamic radicalism. China, while perhaps hoping to remain aloof from a region it considers outside of its sphere of influence, is having its own problems with a burgeoning Islamic movement. Turkey, as has been amply demonstrated in recent weeks, is currently moving toward some kind of alignment with Iran, but the ruling AKP party has a large and by no means dormant secular opposition, and they likely do not desire to see their rivals strengthened by the emergence of a hegemonic Islamic theocracy. Europe, ironically, has recently been far more proactive than the United States on this issue, and there are some fairly obvious reasons for this. There is not only the threat of radical Islam both outside and inside European borders, but the realization that, missile technology being what it is, an Iranian nuclear bomb could eventually threaten Europe as easily as the nations of the Middle East. A few years ago, no one could have anticipated that France, for example, would be ahead of America on this issue, but in many ways it makes sense, if only because of the brute facts of physical proximity. While there is and will remain a large and powerful European lobby in favor of appeasement, Europe nonetheless seems to be waking up to the realization that on this matter they may well be left to fend for themselves. Paradoxically, then, this confluence of interests has at least the potential to overcome the Obama administration’s policy of resignation and successfully avert the Iranian threat. It is impossible, for course, for such disparate interests to band together in any formal way, but a quiet, tacit alliance of convenience – and, perhaps more importantly, fear – is by no means unthinkable. While any military action against Iran will almost certainly be solely Israeli, the lead up to any action and the subsequent fallout will certainly involve many of the parties mentioned above. In the context, it is important to note that it is not merely likely that the Obama administration will not support an Israeli strike on the Iranian nuclear program, but it seems increasingly clear that it will actively oppose one and perhaps try to prevent it from occurring. If this does prove to be the case, then the influence of other nations will prove to be decisive. A careful indifference on the part of the Arab states, for example, or a round of denunciations concealing a policy of inaction, would eliminate Israel’s worst fears of sparking a regional war. Similarly, a tacit silence on the part of Russia, India, and China would do a great deal to deter the Obama administration from taking active steps to prevent a strike or to punish Israel should one occur, especially considering the administration’s active fetishization of maintaining good public relations in these emerging (or in Russia’s case, reemerging) superpowers. It is impossible, of course, to imagine that Europe will openly come out in favor of an Israeli military strike, but a concerted effort on the part of anti-appeasement forces on the continent could serve as a countervailing force both to its own domestic opponents and to the Obama administration. Even a split within the European establishment on the question would allow Israel considerable room to maneuver, and render diplomatic attempts at obstruction or punishment largely ineffective. Considering American public opinion on the issue, it would also be difficult for Obama to take an openly anti-Israel position without unanimous European support. His only supporters would likely be in the media, and while they can make a great deal of noise, they are nonetheless always destined to be the dogs barking while the camels pass. A president of the United States cannot afford to be loved by the BBC and no one else, though there are indications that this president may well think he can. The point of all this is not to engage in hypothetical scenarios or wishful fantasies. It is simply to emphasize that the emergence of a nuclear Iran is not inevitable. That is, the basic concept behind Obama’s foreign policy on Iran – that there is nothing we can do about it and we might as well resign ourselves to the inevitable and make the best of it – is not merely a self-fulfilling prophecy but also simply untrue. It is simply defeatism dressed up as realpolitik. The truth is that even a cursory look at the big picture reveals a strong majority of nations whose interests stand to be damaged by the emergence of a hegemonic Iranian theocracy. And the possible negative repercussions of attempting to exploit this confluence of interests appear to pale in comparison to those that will follow Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons. With a little creative diplomacy, this fact can be turned to the advantage of all these nations, but only if they are prepared to move beyond the idea that the United States must take the lead in all such crises. And this is perhaps the saddest aspect of the entire situation. If the Iranian nuclear program is successfully stopped, it will only be because Barack Obama should have been more careful in wishing for a post-American world. He will have gotten it, but not in the way he would have liked. The tragedy of Obamaism is painfully obvious when one considers that, as long as Obama is president, a nuclear Iran is avoidable only if concerted opposition to it is undertaken without the United States.

As part of its efforts to break away from its diplomatic isolation, Iran has found in the present Islamic-oriented Turkish government a soul-mate for economic collaboration. In the words of the former Iranian parliament speaker Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel, Iran and Turkey are "two powerful countries in the region and in the Islamic world," and, as such, they have "a common responsibility about the fate of all Muslims, especially in Palestine, Afghanistan, and Iraq." Fars, Iran's news agency which quoted the speaker, added that "Iran-Turkey relations have significantly improved during the AKP rule."[[#_ednref8]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn8|[8]]] Iran's foreign minister, Manucher Mottaki, added his own superlatives to the burgeoning relations between the two countries: "The current level of economic cooperation between Tehran and Ankara," said Mottaki, "is unexampled [unprecedented] in the history of the countries' relations." He added that 
the extended cooperation in the oil and gas industry "can serve as a model for expansion of relations in other fields."[[#_ednref9]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn9|[9]]] Shortly after the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered Turkey's good offices as a "mediator between the new Obama administration and Iran." According to Erdogan, a new era in relations between Turkey, Iran, and the United States is about to be opened. "We are ready to be the mediator. I do believe we could be very useful," Erdogan said ahead of a visit to the U.S.[[#_ednref10]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn10|[10]]] Since the turn of the millennium, trade between the two countries has become increasingly robust. According to one study, in 2000, cross border trade reached nearly $1 billion, a figure that increased to $4 billion in 2005. In 2008, cross-border trade between the two states passed $10 billion annually (see table 1 below and the two charts). Turkey became Iran's 5th largest trading partner that year. According to the IMF, some Turkish officials, including state minister Cevet Yilmaz, and some Iranian news sources, trade fell to $5.63 billion in 2009 due to a slowdown in the global economy. Despite these reports, both Tehran and several government officials in Ankara, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, maintain a figure of over $10 billion and have stated a goal to triple this figure by 2015. **<span style="font-family: "Georgia","serif"; font-weight: normal;">UN Sanctions on Iran</span>** The UN Security Council has imposed a series of four separate sanctions on Iran because of its refusal to cooperate with the IAEA and its subsequent refusal to suspend its nuclear enrichment program, which is viewed as a precursor for building nuclear weapons. The first set of sanctions was imposed in December 2006 under Resolution 1737. The resolution called on states to block Iran's import and export of "sensitive nuclear material and equipment" and to freeze the financial assets of those involved in Iran's nuclear activities. With Iran's nuclear program ongoing, in March 2007 the Security Council voted to toughen sanctions by passing Resolution 1747, which banned all of Iran's arms exports. It also froze the assets and restricted the travel of people it deemed involved in the nuclear program. Further restrictions imposed in March 2008 in Resolution 1803 encouraged scrutiny of the dealings of Iranian banks. It also called upon countries to inspect cargo planes and ships entering or leaving Iran if there were "reasonable grounds" to believe they were carrying goods prohibited by previous resolutions. [[#_ednref12]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn12|[12]]] UN Security Council Resolution 1929 of June 9, 2010, has so far been the most comprehensive in terms of sanctions on Iran. The Resolution targeted goods and services supporting Iran's nuclear and missile program. The Resolution prohibits the supply of heavy military equipment to Iran, targets Iranian investment in business relating to missile technology, and, perhaps most significantly, calls on states to prevent the provision of financial services, including insurance or re-insurance, and the transfer of any financial or other assets or resources where there is reason to believe that such services, assets, or resources could contribute to Iran's proliferation programs.[[#_ednref13]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn13|[13]]] The Resolution was passed by 13 votes, and only two rotating member countries - Turkey and Brazil - voted against [the resolution] it, because their attempt to broker a deal with Iran regarding its uranium enrichment program was rejected by the U.S. and the European countries. In fact, Turkey has opposed all along sanctions on Iran. In September 2009 Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmad Dovutoglu said Turkey opposed the imposition of sanctions on Iran on account of its nuclear activities because that could have an effect on trade in the region.[[#_ednref14]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn14|[14]]] **<span style="font-family: "Georgia","serif"; font-weight: normal;">The EU Sanctions</span>** The European Union and Canada imposed new sanctions on July 26 against Iran. The sanctions went beyond the fourth set of UN sanctions imposed over Tehran's refusal to freeze nuclear work and follow similar sanctions imposed by the United States and Australia. The EU measures include a ban on the sale of equipment, technology, and services to Iran's energy sector, hitting activities in refining, liquefied natural gas, exploration, and production. New investments in the energy sector are banned. The Iranian banking sector was also hit by restrictions, forcing any transaction over 40,000 Euros ($52,000) to be authorized by EU governments before they can go ahead. Crafting a diplomatic response, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparasat was quoted as saying that "Sanctions are not considered an effective tool…and they will only complicate the situation."[[#_ednref15]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn15|[15]]] Not known for his refined style, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quick to characterize the sanctions as a "used handkerchief."[[#_ednref16]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn16|[16]]] Ahmadinejad boasted that the Iranian economy is one of "the strongest and largest economies in the world."[[#_ednref17]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn17|[17]]] **<span style="font-family: "Georgia","serif"; font-weight: normal;">The Sanctions are Biting</span>** There is hardly any doubt that the most recent set of sanctions, those by the UN Security Council and most recently by the EU, are beginning to bite into the flesh of the national economy. There are many reasons why the sanctions will hurt. The most significant aspect of the sanctions is the inability of Iran's ships to secure maritime insurance, without which they will be denied access to European ports. By one account Iran received only three shipments of gasoline so far this month, because tankers carrying gasoline destined for Iran were diverted because of the sanctions.[[#_ednref18]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn18|[18]]] Iran will also have problems opening letters of credit for its business transactions with Western suppliers. It will mean that Iran will need to cover many of these transactions by cash or through intermediaries. which will increase the cost of the transactions. The United Arab Emirates was among the first to take measures against Iran. This is quite significant because Dubai, one of the seven emirates of the UAE, was the principal transit port for goods destined for Iran. UAE closed down 40 international and local firms as part of a crackdown on companies that violate UN sanctions on Iran. These corporations have been dealing in "dual-use and dangerous materials barred under UN resolutions and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty." The UAE has declared its commitment to carry out the sanctions in full.[[#_ednref19]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn19|[19]]] Even Venezuela, whose leader Hugo Chavez is a close friend and ally of Ahmadinedjad, is having a problem meeting a prior commitment to ship 20,000 tons of benzene daily to Iran. Problems with the country's three refineries and a shortage of oil by-products in Venezuela itself will make it difficult for Venezuela to meet Iran's needs.[[#_ednref20]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn20|[20]]] Perhaps the most harmful result of the sanctions is the brain drain. It is estimated that between 150,000 and 300,000 educated Iranians try to escape unemployment and political and social oppression by seeking employment abroad.[[#_ednref21]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn21|[21]]] For example, the spokesman on energy matters in the Iranian Majlis (parliament) Imad Husseini estimated that 60 percent of the most qualified Iranian oil workers have left Iran for much higher wages in the Gulf countries and Europe. Some professional employees were forced out because of what Ahmadinejad referred to as "the oil mafia."[[#_ednref22]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn22|[22]]] **<span style="font-family: "Georgia","serif"; font-weight: normal;">Turkey Comes to the Rescue</span>** An article in the //Financial Times// quoted extensively by the on-line reform paper //Elaph// depicts the efforts by Turkey to extricate Iran from the worst consequences of the UN and U.S./EU sanctions. While Turkey has declared that it will honor UN sanctions, it made it clear that it will not adhere to sanctions imposed by individual countries (referring to the U.S., EU countries, Australian, and Canada). By its words and action Turkey appears determined to provide Iran a safety net, while at the same time promoting, in the words of the Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, "closer trade links with Iran." After a number of international and private companies have stopped selling refined oil products to Iran, state-owned Turkish refiner Tupras has stepped up its sale of oil to Iran. With Dubai imposing restrictions on transit goods to Iran, the Turkish foreign economic relations board said that Turkey's ports of Mersin and Trabzon will fill the slack. Turkey is also offering Istanbul in lieu of Dubai as an attractive place for real estate investments by Iranians. Turkey will watch Russia and China to determine how far it can go in ignoring U.S. unilateral sanctions. On the other hand, Turkish banks appear to be more reluctant to violate the sanctions because the value of Turkish export to Iran is merely $2 billion, which is too small an amount for the Turkish banks to risk falling under punitive measures by the US/EU. [[#_ednref23]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn23|[23]]] The real danger is that Turkey can help Iran circumvent sanctions by smuggling banned freight over the common border.[[#_ednref24]][[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4498.htm#_edn24|[24]]]And it would be necessary to watch whether Turkish imports of certain goods register a large and sudden spike. **<span style="font-family: "Georgia","serif"; font-weight: normal;">Iran and Turkey Ink Deal to Construct New Gas Pipeline</span>** Notwithstanding the sanctions that restrict investment in Iran's energy sector, Iran and Turkey signed a contract for the construction of a 660km (412.5 miles) gas pipeline which will pass through Turkey and transfer Iran's national gas to Europe, at a cost of one billion euros.

**b) Any Turkish ties to the West destroy bargaining capability-sqo proves TNWs not key** 
**Maruskin 9** (Stacy, International Strategic Research Organization, "Will Turkey's Efforts with Iran pay off or be blown off?", Dec. 20, [[http://changingturkey.com/2009/12/20/will-turkey%E2%80%99s-efforts-with-iran-pay-off-or-be-blown-off/]], JS)
Yet, every great power needs a regional wing man, and Turkey seems to be the reliable partner the U.S. wants in this corner of the world. The relationship between the U.S. and Iran has been a cold one since the 1979 Islamic revolution; there has been no love lost. Any expectations that the U.S. could ever tame Iran by itself are fanciful at best. For Iran, the West has lost all credibility, and Iranian suspicions still exist as to what Turkey’s actual motive might be in meditating Iran’s fight against the world. After all, Turkey was once the superpower in the region during the Ottoman heyday, and for hundreds of years it was Persians vs. Ottomans over supremacy in the neighboring expanse. Turkish foreign policy aims to be a regional power once more; it continues to rise from the ashes of the Treaty of Sevres, a treaty that nearly led to the modern Republic of Turkey being swallowed up by other international actors. However, if Iran is worried about Turkey for those reasons, then they are sorely mistaken. The Turks are not trying to re-create the glory days of the Empire; they are trying to tame their neighbors. Unfortunately, as of late, it seems Iran is rebuking Turkish advances and support. Ironically, soon after Obama gave his support to Turkey, Iran made an announcement that it did not need Turkish mediation in its struggles with the world community and that it would continue its uranium enrichment program as is. This declaration came only one day after Obama said he had told Erdoğan “how important it is to resolve the issue of Iran’s nuclear capacity in a way that allows Iran to pursue peaceful nuclear energy but provides assurances that it will abide by international rules and norms,” adding, “I believe that Turkey can be an important player in trying to move Iran in that direction.” U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been adamant in her stance that sanctions will be imposed if Iran does not straighten up its act, often times using aggressive rhetoric. A few political pundits in the states have argued that the U.S. is just waiting for the right opportunity to strike Iran (with sanctions first of course). If Iran fails to comply with any of the demands made upon it, and becomes even more cagey and secretive, sanctions will be proposed and most likely enacted. It seems that if Turkey had made any headway at all in the past months with Iran, after Obama’s announcement voicing support for Turkish mediation, Iran has once again become skeptical of whom it keeps for company. Prior to Erdoğan meeting Obama, the White House had not said much on the issue, it was Europe and within Turkey itself that critics began lashing out at Turkey’s undertaking in Middle Eastern affairs, with specific reference to Iran during most of those censures. Turkish mediation would be Iran’s last chance if it continues to evade questions. If Iran proceeds to turn its back on Turkey, they will have no heavy hitters in their corner. The Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has repeatedly sounded off on the nuclear issue. At last week’s White House meeting he reiterated that Iran’s nuclear program should be dealt with diplomatically and criticized the rush to impose sanctions on Iran. Earlier this month, Turkey abstained from the International Atomic Energy Agency’s, or IAEA, vote to rebuke Iran’s secret building of a second nuclear plant, an abstention that caused much disparagement over its decision. Even China and Russia, who have major interests in Iran and have long maintained that sanctions are not necessary, partook in the 26-3 vote. After Turkey displayed its bid of solidarity with Iran, disappointment in Turkey’s decision became apparent. However, for all the criticism Turkey has received, as usual, it is important to remember its location and the new policy understanding it is trying to implement within the region. Although the latter does not excuse all behaviors, whether past, present or future, it can offer explanations as to why Ankara behaves the way it does sometimes. Turkey does not need another war in its region. If an aggression occurs against Iran, once more Turkey will find itself on the doorstep of conflict. Turkey wants dialogue and diplomatic solutions, it hopes to integrate the Middle East on the basis of economics and communication, and any collapse of these will harm those aspirations. Washington gave its support for Turkey to further its efforts in trying to resolve Iran’s nuclear issue; however, it is uncertain whether Iran will allow Turkey to step into that role once more. Whatever place Turkey aims to take in Iranian affairs, it is safe to say that it should expect the unexpected with Iran. Erdoğan has defended Iran’s undertakings and called them a friend, but what has Iran done for Turkey? Perhaps Turkey has exhausted all its capabilities for this particular affair, perhaps it needs to step aside and let the international community deal the crippling economic blows to Iran that it has threatened to do for so long.
**4. Turkish Mediation fails-any reason they’re uniquely positioned to solve is a reason Iran will use them to disband international opposition**
**Schulte 9** (Gregory L., former U.S. ambassador to the IAEA, Winter 2009/10 Turkish Policy Quarterly, " Why Turkey cannot abstain on Iran’s nuclear violations", [[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=why-turkey-cannot-abstain-on-iran8217s-nuclear-violations-2010-04-19]], JS)
Mediation can play a role. Certainly, Turkey has better insights into Iran and contacts with its leaders than do the United States and many other countries seeking a diplomatic solution. At one point last fall, it appeared that Turkey’s mediation could bring Tehran to accept an IAEA proposal to ship much of Iran’s illicitly-produced low-enriched uranium out of the country in exchange for fuel for a research reactor. This prospective deal gave hope for a diplomatic breakthrough that would build confidence and buy time for further diplomacy. But the deal died – either a victim of Iranian domestic politics or another Iranian ploy to avoid Security Council action. Iranian authorities recognize the value of mediation – not to secure a diplomatic solution but to divide the international community. Iran has regularly convinced countries and politicians that they could serve as important mediators. Being a mediator is a comfortable position. It gives an excuse to avoid confrontation and tough positions. Prospects for success bring special attention. Failure can be blamed on the parties or external meddling. Iran’s interest in encouraging mediation is to chip away at the coalition of international concern about its illicit nuclear pursuits. It often encourages mediation by countries that have significant trade ties with Iran or that can influence key international decisions. Turkey, now on both the IAEA Board and UN Security Council, meets both criteria. Mediation is not sufficient for diplomacy to succeed. Success, at this juncture, requires that the offer of negotiations be reinforced by significant international pressure. Pressure or its prospect move Iran’s leaders in ways that mediation has not. The goal of international pressure is not to back Iran’s leaders into a corner, but to convince them to walk through a door toward serious negotiations. In these negotiations, Iran’s leaders must take more than token steps but agree instead to significant, verifiable measures that demonstrate they have given up any weapon ambitions. Even if today’s leaders refuse to rollback their illicit nuclear pursuit, we must create conditions to convince future leaders who respect Iran’s international obligations and seek a different relationship with the rest of the world.
**Arguments about the Iranian nuclear program are exaggerated hysteria, there’s no risk of adventurism, attacking Israel, terrorism, or regional prolif**
**<span style="color: black;">Amuzegar 6 </span>**<span style="color: black;">(Jahangir, finance minister and economic ambassador in Iran's pre-1979 government, Middle East Policy, “Nuclear Iran: perils and prospects”, 6/22, lexis)</span>
<span style="color: black;">Questioning the validity of objections to a nuclear-powered Iran, however, are a large number of experts who find the threats somewhat exaggerated, if not largely based on hysteria. First, the Islamic Republic's challenge to Washington's interests and power in the region needs no bomb for leverage, as U.S. interests and influence have already been effectively threatened since 1979 through conventional means and via financial support to groups in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Second, the chances of the Islamic Republic's engaging in adventurism or naked aggression against its neighbors are far-fetched. The last time Iran started a war was back in 1850 to liberate Herat; its last invasion of another country was in 1738. In the immediate past, even when Afghan Taliban challenged the Tehran government both militarily and ideologically, the clerical leadership showed an astonishing restraint. Third, the possibility of the Iranian nuclear program spawning a Middle East arms race is indeed ominous, but that race started decades ago, and Iran was not the one to launch it. Furthermore, Israel, Pakistan and India are already nuclear powers. Iraq, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf emirates all enjoy U.S. or NATO presence, alliance or protection and, thus, have no need of a nuclear defensive shield. No Iranian government, no matter how belligerent or stupid, would dare provoke or challenge American or NATO forces. Still further, potential candidates for the race--Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Turkey--present technical, financial, political and security problems of their own, and their foray into the nuclear bazaar is highly circumstantial. (46) Finally, Iran might hesitate to start a regional nuclear arms race because it would lose its current superiority in conventional weapons. Fourth, there is the straw-man issue of a "bold Iran" engaging in nuclear coercion through the so-called "suitcase bomb." (47) But chemical and biological weapons would be much cheaper to produce, less cumbersome to pack and carry, easier to handle and more devastating in effect. Fifth, Iran's influence in OPEC, whatever it might be, will be neither augmented nor diminished by possession of the bomb, but rather by its own oil-capacity limitations. Last, and most crucial, Washington's concern about the Islamic Republic's posture toward the Jewish state seems to be a bogus argument to neutral observers. The esteemed Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld believes that, "given the balance of forces," it cannot be argued that a nuclear Iran will threaten the United States or even Israel. (48) Since the chances of mutual annihilation loom large in any nuclear first strike, a nuclear Iran would not dare initiate such an attack. Visiting the Natanz centrifuge facility, President Ahmadinejad told the staff, "What enemies fear is not production of an atomic bomb because in today's world atomic weapons are not efficient." (49) The new president may be a political amateur, occasionally making dimwitted statements, but he is neither a fool nor a suicide bomber. Some pundits argue that a Shiite belief in martyrdom, coupled with the Iranian regime's extremist ideology, could render deterrence meaningless. (50) Such people know neither Shiite martyrdom nor the regime leaders' instinct for self-preservation, nor even the mullahs' bazaari habit of always looking for the best deal.</span>
**Deterrence prevents the impact**
**<span style="color: black;">Hendrickson and Tucker 6</span>**<span style="color: black;"> (David, Distinguished Service Professor at Colorado College, and Robert, professor Emeritus of American Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University, “A Test of Power”, The National Interest, Sept/Oct, <span style="color: black;">[[http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=11900]]</span>, JS) </span>
<span style="color: black;">The consensus view that Iran could not be deterred if it did acquire nuclear weapons is also dubious in the extreme. These alarms were a regular feature of the Cold War, and it was confidently predicted that neither the Soviet Union nor China would be susceptible to deterrence once they acquired atomic devices. Events showed otherwise. It is said today that President Ahmadinejad is different, that he welcomes the coming of the twelfth imam that a nuclear holocaust would entail, and that a crazed religious fanatic in control of a nuclear-armed state would represent an intolerable danger to Israel, the Gulf sheikhdoms, the United States and the rest of the world. Against these considerations, however, it may be asserted that the Iranian public did not elect their new president on the basis of the expectation that they would soon be burnt to a crisp, but rather that he would improve their standard of living in the here and now; that Ahmadinejad's reputed common touch is utterly incompatible with the careless disregard for the lives of his countrymen that such an act would entail; that any decision for war by Iran could not, from all we know of Iranian decision-making, be undertaken simply on the president's say so but would also require the consent of the religious establishment; and that it is inconceivable that Iran's rulers would display such a complete disregard of Iran's true interests as to invite the retaliation against it that would surely follow. The restraints governing the use of nuclear weapons rest on far more than the strong likelihood of retaliation. Any regime that used nuclear weapons in a first strike "bolt from the blue" would almost certainly be signing its death warrant. The infamy that would attach to any such action, both at home and abroad; the license it would give to others to retaliate or otherwise attempt to bring the regime down; the international isolation and withering contempt it would draw upon itself; the reputation for brigandage it would entail--all this constitutes an insurance policy against the dangers of an Iranian bomb. As a practical matter, it makes extremely unlikely--nay, virtually inconceivable--what is now taken by consensus opinion in America as a sort of moral certainty.</span>
**Middle East war won’t draw in outside powers or go nuclear**
**FERGUSON 6** 
(Niall, Professor of History at Harvard University, Senior Research Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, and Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford, LA Times, July 24)
Could today's quarrel between Israelis and Hezbollah over Lebanon produce World War III? That's what Republican Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, called it last week, echoing earlier fighting talk by Dan Gillerman, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. Such language can — for now, at least — safely be dismissed as hyperbole. This crisis is not going to trigger another world war. Indeed, I do not expect it to produce even another Middle East war worthy of comparison with those of June 1967 or October 1973. In 1967, Israel fought four of its Arab neighbors — Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq. In 1973, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. Such combinations are very hard to imagine today. Nor does it seem likely that Syria and Iran will escalate their involvement in the crisis beyond continuing their support for Hezbollah. Neither is in a position to risk a full-scale military confrontation with Israel, given the risk that this might precipitate an American military reaction. Crucially, Washington's consistent support for Israel is not matched by any great power support for Israel's neighbors. During the Cold War, by contrast, the risk was that a Middle East war could spill over into a superpower conflict. Henry Kissinger, secretary of State in the twilight of the Nixon presidency, first heard the news of an Arab-Israeli war at 6:15 a.m. on Oct. 6, 1973. Half an hour later, he was on the phone to the Soviet ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin. Two weeks later, Kissinger flew to Moscow to meet the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev. The stakes were high indeed. At one point during the 1973 crisis, as Brezhnev vainly tried to resist Kissinger's efforts to squeeze him out of the diplomatic loop, the White House issued DEFCON 3, putting American strategic nuclear forces on high alert. It is hard to imagine anything like that today. In any case, this war may soon be over. Most wars Israel has fought have been short, lasting a matter of days or weeks (six days in '67, three weeks in '73). Some Israeli sources say this one could be finished in a matter of days. That, at any rate, is clearly the assumption being made in Washington.

Shorter-range Scuds might be fired by the Iranian-supported Hezbollah from its bases in south Lebanon. Even more troubling is the possibility of attacks against military or civilian targets by sleeper cells of Israeli Arabs that would be activated by Israeli actions against Iran. An indication that such attacks are well within the realm of the possible is the recent arrest of Israeli Mohammad Ghanem for alleged espionage on behalf of Iran.34 <span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none; font-family: "Georgia","serif";">The U</span></span><span class="underline0">nited </span><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none; font-family: "Georgia","serif";">S</span></span><span class="underline0">tates, widely perceived as the source of Israel’s power and protection, </span><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none; font-family: "Georgia","serif";">is</span></span><span class="underline0"> also </span><span class="Highlightedunderline"><span style="border: medium none; font-family: "Georgia","serif";">likely to bear the brunt of retaliatory action</span></span><span class="underline0">.

So what would it look like?

Turkey is launching initiative after ambitious initiative aimed at stabilising the Middle East. Building on the successes of its normalisation with Syria and Iraq, it is facilitating efforts to reduce conflicts, expanding visa-free travel, ramping up trade, integrating infrastructure, forging strategic relationships and engaging in multilateral regional platforms. For some, this new activism is evidence that Turkey is turning from its traditional allies in Europe and the United States. In fact, its increased role in the Middle East is a complement to and even dependent on its ties to the West. This report assesses Turkey’s growing engagement with the Middle East within the broader frame of Turkish foreign and trade policy. The process is still in its infancy, faces official scepticism in Arab governments and has divided opinion among Turkey’s Western allies. Yet, the attempts to grow the regional economy, create interdependence and foster peace have positive potential. At a time when negotiations to join the European Union (EU) have faltered, Ankara has adopted early EU gradualist integration tactics for post-Second World War peace in Europe as a model for strengthening long-term stability and healing the divisions of the Middle East. Turkey’s self-declared “zero-problem” foreign policy to end disputes with its neighbours has worked well in Syria and Iraq, and its facilitation role in some Middle East conflicts has booked some success, for instance in hosting Syria-Israel proximity talks in 2008. Ankara has been less effective, however, in intractable matters like the dispute between Fatah and Hamas. The sharpening tone of Turkey-Israel relations has raised Turkish leaders’ popularity among Middle Eastern publics but has undermined trust among traditional allies in Washington, Brussels and even some Arab capitals. Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP) leaders’ rhetoric, and //their// new regional activism extending from Persian Gulf states to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), have given rise to perceptions that they have changed Turkey’s fundamental Westward direction to become part of an Islamist bloc, are attempting to revive the Ottoman Empire or have “turned to the East”. These are incorrect. The basic trends in the country’s regional activism seen today were well established before AKP came to power, and NATO membership and the relationship with the U.S. remain pillars of Turkish policy. While Turkey is bitter over attacks by France, Germany and others on its EU negotiation process between 2005 and 2008, half of its trade is still with the EU, and less than one quarter of its exports go to Middle East states – a proportion typical for the past twenty years. The global nature of Turkey’s realignment is underlined by the fact that Russia and Greece have been among the biggest beneficiaries of its regional trade boom. Nevertheless, since the end of the Cold War, Turkey has been shifting its foreign policy priority from hard security concerns to soft power and commercial interests and moving away from being a kind of NATO-backed regional gendarme to a more independent player determined to use a plethora of regional integration tools in order to be taken seriously on its own account. Turkey’s U.S. and EU partners should support these efforts towards stabilisation through integration. Ankara has many balls in the air and sometimes promises more than it can deliver, over-sells what it has achieved and seeks a role far away when critical problems remain unsolved at home. Turkey’s new prominence is partly attributable to confusion in the region after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, a situation that is not necessarily permanent. Some Middle Eastern governments are also wary of the impact on their own publics of emotional Turkish rhetoric against Israel or about implicit claims to represent the whole Muslim world. Turkey should sustain the positive dynamics of its balanced relationships with all actors in the neighbourhood and its efforts to apply innovatively the tactics of early EU-style integration with Middle East neighbours. While doing so, however, it should pay attention to messaging, both internationally, to ensure that gains with Middle Eastern public opinion are not undercut by loss of trust among traditional allies, and domestically, to ensure that all Turkish constituencies are included, informed and committed to new regional projects over the long term. Also, it will gain credibility and sustainability for its ambitions if it can solve disputes close to home first, like Cyprus and Armenia. Middle Eastern elites worry about any sign of Ankara turning its back on its EU accession process. Much of their recent fascination with Turkey’s achievements derives from the higher standards, greater prosperity, broader democracy, legitimacy of civilian rulers, advances towards real secularism and successful reforms that have resulted from negotiating for membership of the EU. At the same time, Turkey and its leaders enjoy unprecedented popularity and prestige in Middle Eastern public opinion, notably thanks to their readiness to stand up to Israel. Turkey’s new strength, its experience in building a strong modern economy and its ambition to trade and integrate with its neighbours offer a better chance than most to bring more stability and reduce the conflicts that have plagued the Middle East for so long.

The Arab Gulf States: Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have said little about Iranian nuclearization. Its wait-and-see mentality has three causes. First, these states traditionally have formulated foreign policy in private, without transparency, announcing it only when deemed absolutely necessary. The Gulf Coalition Council (GCC) has shifted its attitude toward a nuclear Iran, but it has done so in a very limited manner. The Gulf States are likely to continue to avoid specifying a policy until no other course is available to them. Second, on a diplomatic level, the Arab Gulf States likely do not want to irritate Iran, complicating the current negotiations between Iran and the rest of the world. It would be better to have others solve the problem of a nuclear Iran than to become involved. Third, as partners in oil production and as neighbors, the Arab Gulf States have no interest in provoking Iran, which may in turn disrupt the status-quo that keeps these states among the richest in the world. Iran’s past attempts to overthrow regional leaders is well remembered, and those states would prefer not to return to those days. The debate on this issue takes two courses. On one hand, a nuclear-armed Iran is not a serious concern. There are already nuclear states within the region, and it is nothing new. In gaining nuclear weapons, Israel and Pakistan have not caused any further instability. Similarly, Iran also would not significantly impact the region. One of Israel’s most prominent military historians, Martin van Creveld of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has justified Iran’s nuclear program in response to Israel’s own nuclear status. Van Creveld is on record stating that, in the face of Israel’s increasing nuclear capabilities, through alleged deployment of nuclear equipped submarines to the region, Iran would be “crazy” not to try to develop a similar capability.81 The other side of the debate depicts a nuclear Iran as a serious threat to regional security. Iran with nuclear weapons would potentially reenergize its aims to export its Islamic revolution and supplant regional regimes with those more in line with Tehran’s vision of fundamentalist law. With nuclear weapons, Iran threatens to shift the balance of power within the Arabian Gulf in its favor, against the smaller and weaker Arab Gulf States.82 This chapter examines the reaction that the Arab Gulf States will likely have to a nuclear-armed Iran. This chapter scrutinizes the background of regional historical concerns about Iran. Second, the chapter describes the current Gulf States security apprehensions about Iran. Third, the chapter assesses the impact that a nuclear-armed Iran is likely to have regionally, including response options available to them. Finally, it outlines the likely impact these matters will have on U.S. interests.

<span class="Underline">With growing concerns about the threat of nuclear terrorism after September 11, 2001, officials in the United States and NATO have pointed to a lingering problem regarding Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal (a class of weapons similar to the type of U.S. nuclear weapons deployed on the soil of several NATO member states in Europe). TNW's are potentially vulnerable to terrorists or nations who might try to buy or steal them. These weapons are smaller and more portable than strategic nuclear weapons and could be used without the authority of centralized command and control oversight mechanisms. Despite several decades of nuclear arms control initiatives, non-strategic, or TNWs, are not covered by any formal treaties. The U.S. and Russian Presidential nuclear initiatives of the early 1990's called for voluntary controls on the vast stocks of these weapons. While significant reductions resulted from the Presidential initiatives, they were informal and lacked a codified agreement setting out verification and legal obligations. </span>

**4. Underground vaults solve**

The U.S. weapons are stored in underground vaults, known as WS3 (Weapon Storage and Security System), at bases in Belgium, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Turkey. Most of the weapons are at U.S. Air Force bases, but Belgium, Germany, Holland and Italy each have nuclear weapons at one of their national air bases. The weapons at each of the national bases are under control of a U.S. Air Force MUNSS in peacetime but would, upon receipt of proper authority from the U.S. National Command Authority, be handed over to the national Air Force at the base in a war for delivery by the host nation’s own aircraft. This highly controversial arrangement contradicts both the Non-Proliferation Treaty and NATO’s international nonproliferation policy. Implications and Observations The main implication of the BRR report is that the nuclear weapons deployment in Europe is, and has been for the past decade, a security risk. But why it took an investigation triggered by the embarrassing Minot incident to discover the security problems in Europe is a puzzle. Since the terrorist attacks in September 2001, billions of dollars have been poured into the Homeland Security chest to increase security at U.S. nuclear weapons sites, and a sudden urge to improve safety and use control of nuclear weapons has become a principle justification in the administration’s proposal to build a whole new generation of Reliable Replacement Warheads.
