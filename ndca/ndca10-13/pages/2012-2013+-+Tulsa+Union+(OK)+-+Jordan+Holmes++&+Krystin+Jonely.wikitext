ETT stands for Evacuated Tube Transport. … For greater detail see technology section.

====Tube transport system have a low cost==== 

<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">Yaoping continues</span>The energy and material use is very low, … <span style="font-size: 13.32px;">The cost will depend on many factors such as the design speed, the topography, and the demand.</span>

<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">Yaoping 2012 continues</span><span style="font-size: 13.32px;">Capsules 2 feet in diameter and 8 feet long could be used for one person lying down … __This is estimated to be the best compromise between utility and cost.__ </span>

====Tubes can be used for everything==== 

<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">Yaoping 2012 concludes</span>Tubes less than a foot in diameter would have use for mail and small packages. Tubes 20 feet in diameter could accommodate a bus. It is estimated that a 5 foot (1.5m) diameter tube could accommodate almost all transport needs.
