 <strong>Now this is a story all about how WE flipped our planet turned upside-down – Warmings Anthropogenic</strong><br />
<strong>Bragnaza, 11</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Karl Bragnaza is Manager of Climate Monitoring at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, operating under the authority of the Meteorology Act of 1955, which mandates that he objectively report on the state of the atmosphere and oceans in support of Australia's social, economic, cultural and environmental goals his salary is not funded from any external sources or dependent on specially funded government climate change projects. “The greenhouse effect is real: here’s why,” June 24, 2011, The Conversation, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://theconversation.edu.au/the-greenhouse-effect-is-real-heres-why-1515" rel="nofollow">http://theconversation.edu.au/the-greenhouse-effect-is-real-heres-why-1515</a>)</span><br />
In reality, the correlation between global mean temperature and carbon dioxide over the 20th century forms an important, but very small part of the evidence for a human role in climate change. Our assessment of the future risk from the continued buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is even less informed by 20th century changes in global mean temperature. For example, our understanding of the greenhouse effect – the link between greenhouse gas concentrations and global surface air temperature – is based primarily on our fundamental understanding of mathematics, physics, astronomy and chemistry. Much of this science is textbook material that is at least a century old and does not rely on the recent climate record. For example, it is a scientific fact that Venus, the planet most similar to Earth in our solar system, experiences surface temperatures of nearly 500 degrees Celsius due to its atmosphere being heavily laden with greenhouse gases. Back on Earth, that fundamental understanding of the physics of radiation, combined with our understanding of climate change from the geological record, clearly demonstrates that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will inevitably drive global warming. Dusting for climate fingerprints: The observations we have taken since the start of 20th century have confirmed our fundamental understanding of the climate system. While the climate system is very complex, observations have shown that our formulation of the physics of the atmosphere and oceans is largely correct, and ever improving. Most importantly, the observations have confirmed that human activities, in particular a 40% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations since the late 19th century, have had a discernible and significant impact on the climate system already. In the field known as detection and attribution of climate change, scientists use indicators known as fingerprints of climate change. These fingerprints show the entire climate system has changed in ways that are consistent with increasing greenhouse gases and an enhanced greenhouse effect. They also show that recent, long term changes are inconsistent with a range of natural causes. Is it getting hot in here? A warming world is obviously the most profound piece of evidence. Here in Australia, the decade ending in 2010 has easily been the warmest since record keeping began, and continues a trend of each decade being warmer than the previous, that extends back 70 years. Globally, significant warming and other changes have been observed across a range of different indicators and through a number of different recording instruments, and a consistent picture has now emerged. Scientists have observed increases in continental temperatures and increases in the temperature of the lower atmosphere. In the oceans, we have seen increases in sea-surface temperatures as well as increases in deep-ocean heat content. That increased heat has expanded the volume of the oceans and has been recorded as a rise in sea-level. Scientists have also observed decreases in sea-ice, a general retreat of glaciers and decreases in snow cover. Changes in atmospheric pressure and rainfall have also occurred in patterns that we would expect due to increased greenhouse gases. There is also emerging evidence that some, though not all, types of extreme weather have become more frequent around the planet. These changes are again consistent with our expectations for increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Patterns of temperature change that are uniquely associated with the enhanced greenhouse effect, and which have been observed in the real world include: greater warming in polar regions than tropical regions greater warming over the continents than the oceans greater warming of night time temperatures than daytime temperatures greater warming in winter compared with summer a pattern of cooling in the high atmosphere (stratosphere) with simultaneous warming in the lower atmosphere (troposphere). How do we know it’s us? By way of brief explanation, if the warming over the 20th century were due to some deep ocean process, we would not expect to see continents warming more rapidly than the oceans, or the oceans warming from the top down. For increases in solar radiation, we would expect to see warming of the stratosphere rather than the observed cooling trend. Similarly, greater global warming at night and during winter is more typical of increased greenhouse gases, rather than an increase in solar radiation. There is a range of other observations that show the enhanced greenhouse effect is real. The additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been identified through its isotopic signature as being fossil fuel in origin. The increased carbon dioxide absorbed by the oceans is being recorded as a measured decrease in ocean alkalinity. Satellite measurements of outgoing long-wave radiation from the planet reveal increased absorption of energy in the spectral bands corresponding to carbon dioxide, exactly as expected from fundamental physics. It is important to remember that the enhanced greenhouse effect is not the only factor acting on the climate system. In the short term, the influence of greenhouse gases can be obscured by other competing forces. These include other anthropogenic factors such as increased industrial aerosols and ozone depletion, as well as natural changes in solar radiation and volcanic aerosols, and the cycle of El Niño and La Niña events. By choosing a range of indicators, by averaging over decades rather than years, and by looking at the pattern of change through the entire climate system, scientists are able to clearly discern the fingerprint of human-induced change.<br />

<strong>Now is key – feedback loops amplify climate change</strong><br />
<strong>Hansen, 08</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(James E.Hansen is the Head of NASA Goddard Institute and adjunct Professor in the Earth and Environmental Science at Columbia University. April 2008. “Tipping point: Perspective of a Scientist”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:595:http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2008/StateOfWild_20080428.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2008/StateOfWild_20080428.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2008/StateOfWild_20080428.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:595 -->)</span><br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;">Fast feedbacks</span>—changes that occur quickly in response to temperature change—<span style="text-decoration: none;">amplify the initial temperature change, begetting additional warming. As the planet warms, fast feedbacks include more water vapor, which traps additional heat, and less snow and sea ice, which exposes dark surfaces that absorb more sunlight. Slower feedbacks also exist.</span> Due to warming, <span style="text-decoration: none;">forests and shrubs are moving poleward into tundra regions. Expanding vegetation</span>, darker than tundra, <span style="text-decoration: none;">absorbs sunlight and warms the environment. Another slow feedback is increasing wetness (i.e., darkness) of the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets in the warm season.</span> Finally, <span style="text-decoration: none;">as tundra melts, methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is bubbling out. Paleoclimatic records confirm that the long-lived greenhouse gases</span>— methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide—all <span style="text-decoration: none;">increase with the warming of oceans and land.</span> These positive feedbacks amplify climate change over decades, centuries, and longer. The predominance of positive feedbacks explains why Earth’s climate has historically undergone large swings<span style="text-decoration: none;">: feedbacks work in both directions, amplifying cooling, as well as warming, forcings. In the past, feedbacks have caused Earth to be whipsawed between colder and warmer climates</span>, even in response to weak forcings, such as slight changes in the tilt of Earth’s axis.2 The second fundamental property of Earth’s climate system, partnering with feedbacks, is the great inertia of oceans and ice sheets. Given the oceans’ capacity to absorb heat, when a climate forcing (such as increased greenhouse gases) impacts global temperature, even after two or three decades, only about half of the eventual surface warming has occurred. Ice sheets also change slowly, although accumulating evidence shows that they can disintegrate within centuries or perhaps even decades. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The upshot of the combination of inertia and feedbacks is that additional climate change is already “in the pipeline”: even if we stop increasing greenhouse gases today, more warming will occur.</span> This is sobering when one considers the present status of Earth’s climate. Human civilization developed during the Holocene (the past 12,000 years). It has been warm enough to keep ice sheets off North America and Europe, but cool enough for ice sheets to remain on Greenland and Antarctica. With rapid warming of 0.6°C in the past 30 years<span style="text-decoration: none;">, global temperature is at its warmest level in the Holocene.3 The warming that has already occurred, the positive feedbacks that have been set in motion, and the additional warming in the pipeline together have brought us to the precipice of a planetary tipping point. We are at the tipping point because the climate state includes large, ready positive feedbacks</span> provided by the Arctic sea ice, the West Antarctic ice sheet, and much of Greenland’s ice. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Little additional forcing is needed to trigger these feedbacks and magnify global warming. If we go over the edge, we will transition to an environment far outside the range that has been experienced by humanity, and there will be no return </span>within any foreseeable future generation. Casualties would include more than the loss of indigenous ways of life in the Arctic and swamping of coastal cities. An intensified hydrologic cycle will produce both greater floods and greater droughts. In the US, the semiarid states from central Texas through Oklahoma and both Dakotas would become more drought-prone and ill suited for agriculture, people, and current wildlife. Africa would see a great expansion of dry areas, particularly southern Africa. Large populations in Asia and South America would lose their primary dry season freshwater source as glaciers disappear.

Solar Energy - The Ultimate Answer to Anthropogenic Climate Change The evidence of global warming is alarming. The potential for a catastrophic climate change scenario is dire. Until recently, I worked at Goddard Space Flight Center, a NASA research center in the forefront of space and earth science research. This Center is engaged in monitoring and analyzing climate changes on a global scale. I received first hand scientific information and data relating to global warming issues, including the latest dynamics of ice cap melting and changes that occurred on either pole of our planet. I had the chance to discuss this research with my Goddard colleagues, who are world leading experts on the subject. I now have no doubt global temperatures are rising, and that global warming is a serious problem confronting all of humanity. No matter whether these trends are due to human interference or to the cosmic cycling of our solar system, there are two basic facts that are crystal clear: a) there is overwhelming scientific evidence showing positive correlations between the level of CO2concentrations in the earth's atmosphere with respect to the historical fluctuations of global temperature changes; and b) the overwhelming majority of the world's scientific community is in agreement about the risks of a potential catastrophic global climate change. That is, if we humans continue to ignore this problem and do nothing, if we continue dumping huge quantities of greenhouse gases into earth's biosphere, humanity will be at dire risk. As a technical and technology risk assessment expert, I could show with confidence that we face orders of magnitude more risk doing nothing to curb our fossil-based energy addictions than we will in making a fundamental shift in our energy supply. This is because the risks of a catastrophic anthropogenic climate change can be potentially the extinction of human species, a risk that is simply too high for us to take any chances. Of course, there will be economic consequences to all societies when we restrict the burning of fossil fuels in an effort to abate &quot;global warming.&quot; What we are talking about are options and choices between risks. All human activities involve risk taking; we cannot avoid risks but only make trade-offs, hopefully choosing wisely. In this case, there has to be a risk-based probabilistic thought process when it comes to adopting national or international policies in dealing with global warming and energy issues. As the measure of risk is a product of &quot;likelihood&quot; and &quot;consequence,&quot; when consequence or risk of a potential human extinction (due to catastrophic climate change) is to be compared with the potential consequence or risk of loss of jobs or slowing the growth of economy (due to restriction of fossil-based energy consumption), I believe the choice is clear. My view is that by making a paradigm shift in the world's energy supply over time through extensive R&amp;D, technology innovations and increased production of renewable energy, we will create countless new careers and jobs and end up triggering the next level of economic development, the kind of pollution free industrial revolution mankind has never before seen. The aggravation and acceleration of a potential anthropogenic catastrophic global climate change, in my opinion, is the number one risk incurred from our combustion-based world economy. At the International Energy Conference in Seattle, I showed three pairs of satellite images as evidence that the earth glaciers are disappearing at an alarming rate.[2] Whether this warming trend can be reversed by human intervention is not clear, but this uncertainty in risk reduction doesn't justify the human inactions in adapting policies and countermeasures on renewable energy development for a sustainable world economy, and for curbing the likelihood of any risk event of anthropogenic catastrophic climate changes. What is imperative is that we start to do something in a significant way that has a chance to make a difference. Solar Power - The Best Renewable Energy Source for the Future Now mankind faces an energy crossroad. As a species, we have basically two directions in our quest for energy: 1) either we look for energy based on cosmic-based, open and unlimited original resources, which means everything comes from the stars, from the sun, or 2) we continue to rely on earth-based, local and confined secondary energy resources. There is no secret that every single bit of energy on this planet comes from the sun. In my view, we have a small window of opportunity over the next couple of decades. Either we're going to go down or we're going to go up as a species. The direction we follow largely depends upon how we approach our energy challenge. Learning how to harness our sun for solutions to our energy problems will not be unlike our ancestors harnessing the wild fire. I believe it will lead to an inevitable leapfrog in the process of human evolution. Bill Michael, a University of Chicago professor, wrote &quot;Use of fire illustrates that human evolution is a gradual process; modern humans did not emerge overnight in a 'big bang' of development, but rather slowly adapted from their primitive origins. The use of fire by humans throughout time to overcome environmental forces is a fundamental and defining aspect of human nature.&quot;[3] Before we reach that tipping point of negative sustainability, there is still time for humankind to tame the natural forces of the sun and harness it for the well-being and survival of our species. The best place, of course, for a nuclear fusion reactor is about 149E6 km (149 x 106 km) away. This one happens to be free of charge and we can count on it being around for a long time. The sun's energy only takes 8 minutes to arrive on earth and leaves no radioactive waste (and it is terrorist proof). Our sun puts out about 3.8E11TWh of energy per hour. Our planet receives about 174,000 terawatt each second. Every minute, earth's surface gets more solar power than we human beings can use in a whole year.<br />

<strong>Warming is an existential risk - even if the chance of solvency or the impact is low, no turning back means we win anyway</strong><br />
<strong>Sunstein</strong>, <strong>07</strong> ( Cass R Sunstein is a Professor in the Department of Political Science and at the Law School of the University of Chicago, 2007, “Worst-Case Scenarios”)<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Most worst-case scenarios appear to have an element of irreversibility. Once a species is lost, it is lost forever</span>. The special concern for endangered species stems from the permanence of their loss (outside of Jurassic Park). <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">One of the most serious fears associated with genetically modified organisms is that they might lead to irreversible ecological harm. Because some greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for centuries, the problem of climate change may be irreversible, at least for all practical purposes. </span>Transgenic crops can impose irreversible losses too, because they can make pests more resistant to pesticides. If we invest significant wealth in one source of energy and neglect others, we may be effectively stuck forever, or at least for a long time. One objection to capital punishment is that errors cannot be reversed. In ordinary life, our judgments about worst-case scenarios have everything to do with irreversibility<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">. Of course an action may be hard but not impossible to undo, and so there may be a continuum of cases, with different degrees of difficulty in reversing. </span>A marriage can be reversed, but divorce is rarely easy; having a child is very close to irreversible; moving from New York to Paris is reversible, but moving back may be difficult. People often take steps to avoid courses of action that are burdensome rather than literally impossible to reverse. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">In this light, we might identify an Irreversible Harm Precautionary Principle, applicable to a subset of risks.' As a rough first approximation, the principle says this: Special steps should be taken to avoid irreversible harms, through precautions that go well beyond those that would be taken if irreversibility were not a problem. The general attitude here is &quot;act, then learn,&quot; as opposed to the tempting alternative of &quot;wait and learn.&quot; In the case of climate change, some people believe that research should be our first line of defense. In their view, we should refuse to commit substantial resources to the problem until evidence of serious harm is unmistakably clear</span>.' But even assuming that the evidence is not so clear, research without action allows greenhouse gas emissions to continue, which might produce risks that are irreversible, or at best difficult and expensive to reverse. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">For this reason, the best course of action might well be to take precautions now as a way of preserving flexibility for future generations. In the environmental context in general, this principle suggests that regulators should proceed with far more aggressive measures than would otherwise seem justified.</span><br />

<strong><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif;">This energy’s exported globally</span></strong> <strong>– Chinas Desperate</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif;">Kammen, 7</span></strong> <span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">(Daniel Kammen is a Professor of Public Policy at UC Berkeley, &quot;Green Jobs Created by Global Warming Initiative,&quot; September 25th, 2007. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.unep.org/civil_society/GCSF9/pdfs/karmen-senate.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.unep.org/civil_society/GCSF9/pdfs/karmen-senate.pdf</a>)</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">In addition to supporting domestic job creation, clean energy is an important and fastest growing international sector, and one where overseas policy can be used to support poor developing regions – such as Africa (Jacobsen and Kammen, 2007) and Central America – as well as regaining market share in solar, fuel cell and wind technologies, where European nations and Japan have invested heavily and are reaping the benefits of month to year backlogs in clean energy orders. Some of those orders are for U. S. installations, but many more could be if we choose to make clean and green energy a national priority for both domestic installation and overseas export. Technology exports have impacts well beyond domestic job creation. In fact, if properly managed, the development of a thriving ‘cleantech’ sector can address a vital global issues, namely the emissions trajectories of major developing nations. China and India are often singled out for attention as major, emerging global emitters. China, in fact, will become the world’s largest greenhouse emitter in the near future, if it has not already. This fact, is often used – mistakenly in my view – to argue against unilateral climate protection efforts by nations such as the United States. This view is shortsighted in two vital respects. First, China is demonstrably already suffering from the impacts of fossil fuel use. Crop yields in many parts of China are significantly lower than they would be without the significant sulfur and particulate burden that results from domestic coal combustion. (In fact, coal combustions emissions from China have significant air quality impacts on Japan, and can be measured in the U. S. as well.) Crop losses of over 20% have been reported in part of China, with the decrease unambiguously linked to air pollution. China also experiences significant human health impacts from this pollution burden as well. Second, China has committed, on paper, to a ‘circular economy’ where waste is reduced and overall productivity is enhanced. If the United States were to become a major exporter, or even a partner, in the production of low-emissions technologies – from truly carbon-capture coal-fired power plants, to increased numbers of solar, wind, and biofuel technologies – China would be an eager trading partner, so that they could install increasing numbers of low-emissions technologies. This would directly help the Chinese economy and their environmental and public health situation. On both of these grounds, U. S. domestic expansion of the clean energy sector will likely positively impact the ability and the actions of a number of emerging economies to ‘go green’.</span><br />

<strong>Support Consensus and Consequence over Climate denialism</strong><br />

The Earth is a very complex system: there are natural effects like volcanoes, and variations in the sun; there are the vagaries of the weather; there are complicating factors such as clouds, and how ice responds; and then there are the human influences such as deforestation and CO<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">₂</span> emissions. But despite these complexities, some aspects of climate science are thoroughly settled. We know that atmospheric CO<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">₂</span> is increasing due to humans. We know that this CO<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">₂</span>, while being just a small fraction of the atmosphere, has an important influence on temperature. We can calculate the effect, and predict what is going to happen to the earth’s climate during our lifetimes, all based on fundamental physics that is as certain as gravity. The consensus opinion of the world’s climate scientists is that climate change is occurring due to human CO<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">₂</span> emissions. The changes are rapid and significant, and the implications for our civilisation may be dire. The chance of these statements being wrong is vanishingly small. Scepticism and denialism Some people will be understandably sceptical about that last statement. But when they read up on the science, and have their questions answered by climate scientists, they come around. These people are true sceptics, and a degree of scepticism is healthy. Other people will disagree with the scientific consensus on climate change, and will challenge the science on internet blogs and opinion pieces in the media, but no matter how many times they are shown to be wrong, they will never change their opinions. These people are deniers. The recent articles in The Conversation have put the deniers under the microscope. Some readers have asked us in the comments to address the scientific questions that the deniers bring up. This has been done. Not once. Not twice. Not ten times. Probably more like 100 or a 1000 times. Denier arguments have been dealt with by scientists, again and again and again. But like zombies, the deniers keep coming back with the same long-falsified and nonsensical arguments. The deniers have seemingly endless enthusiasm to post on blogs, write letters to editors, write opinion pieces for newspapers, and even publish books. What they rarely do is write coherent scientific papers on their theories and submit them to scientific journals. The few published papers that have been sceptical about climate change have not withstood the test of time. The phony debate on climate change So if the evidence is this strong, why is there resistance to action on climate change in Australia? At least two reasons can be cited. First, as The Conversation has revealed, there are a handful of individuals and organisations who, by avoiding peer review, have engineered a phony public debate about the science, when in fact that debate is absent from the one arena where our scientific knowledge is formed. These individuals and organisations have so far largely escaped accountability. But their free ride has come to an end, as the next few weeks on The Conversation will continue to show. The second reason, alas, involves systemic failures by the media. Systemic media failures arise from several presumptions about the way science works, which range from being utterly false to dangerously ill-informed to overtly malicious and mendacious. The false Let’s begin with what is merely false. A tacit presumption of many in the media and the public is that climate science is a brittle house of cards that can be brought down by a single new finding or the discovery of a single error. Nothing could be further from the truth. Climate science is a cumulative enterprise built upon hundreds of years of research. The heat-trapping properties of CO<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">₂</span> were discovered in the middle of the 19th century, pre-dating even Sherlock Holmes and Queen Victoria. The resulting robust knowledge will not be overturned by a single new finding. A further false presumption of the media is that scientific opinions must somehow be balanced by an opposing view. While balance is an appropriate conversational frame for the political sphere, it is wholly inappropriate for scientific issues, where what matters is the balance of evidence, not opinion. At first glance, one might be tempted to forgive the media’s inappropriate inclusion of unfounded contrarian opinions, given that its function is to stimulate broad debate in which, ideally, even exotic opinions are given a voice. But the media by and large do not report the opinions of 9/11 “truthers” who think that the attacks were an “inside job” of the Bush administration. The media also do not report the opinion of people who believe Prince Phillip runs the world’s drug trade. The fact that equally outlandish pseudo-scientific nonsense about climate science can be sprouted on TV by a cat palmist is evidence not of an obsession with balance but of a striking and selective failure of editorial responsibility. What is needed instead of the false symmetry implied by “balance” is what the BBC calls impartiality – fact-based reporting that evaluates the evidence and comes to a reality-based conclusion. The dangerously ill-formed An example of a dangerously ill-informed opinion on how science works is the widely propagated myth that scientists somehow have a “vested interest”, presumably financial, in climate change. This myth has been carefully crafted by deniers to create a chimerical symmetry between their own ties to political and economic interests and the alleged “vested interests” of scientists. In actual fact, climate scientists have as much vested interest in the existence of climate change as cancer researchers do in the existence of the human papilloma virus (HPV). Cancer researchers are motivated by the fact that cervical cancer kills, and the scientists who developed the HPV vaccine did so to save lives, not to get their grants renewed. Climate scientists are likewise motivated by the fact that climate change kills 140,000 people per year right at this very moment, according to the World Health Organization. The scientists who have been alerting the public of this risk for nearly 20 years did so to save lives, not to get their grants renewed. Climate scientists are being motivated by the realisation that humanity has got itself into serious trouble with climate change, and it will need the best scientific advice to navigate a solution. As scientists, we ask not for special consideration by the media, but simply for the same editorial responsibility and quality control that is routinely applied to all other arenas of public discourse. Selective failure of quality control and editorial responsibility when it comes to climate change presents a grave public disservice.<br />

<strong>Your DA’s are inevitable in the squo - Warming raises the magnitude of all impacts</strong><br />

Global climate change presents a serious national security threat that could affect Americans at home, impact U.S. military operations, and heighten global tensions, finds a study released today by a blue-ribbon panel of 11 of the most senior retired U.S. admirals and generals. Climate change, national security and energy dependence are a related set of global challenges that will add to tensions even in stable regions of the world, found the panel, known as the Military Advisory Board. &quot;<strong>We will pay for this one way or another</strong>,&quot; said retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni, former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East. &quot;We will pay to reduce greenhouse gas emissions today, and we'll have to take an economic hit of some kind. Or, we will pay the price later in military terms. And that will involve human lives. There will be a human toll.&quot; &quot;The U.S. should commit to a stronger national and international role to help stabilize climate changes at levels that will avoid significant disruption to global security and stability,&quot; the Military Advisory Board recommends. The study, &quot;National Security and the Threat of Climate Change,&quot; explores ways in which climate change acts as a &quot;threat multiplier&quot; in already fragile regions of the world, creating the breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism. The CNA Corporation, a nonprofit research and analysis organization, brought together 11 retired four-star and three-star admirals and generals as a Military Advisory Board to provide advice, expertise and perspective on the impact of climate change on national security. CNA writers and researchers compiled the report under the board's direction and review. Members of the Military Advisory Board come from all branches of the armed services. The board includes a former Army chief of staff, commanders-in-chiefs of U.S. forces in global regions, a former shuttle astronaut and NASA administrator, and experts in planning, logistics, underwater operations and oceanography. One member also served as U.S. ambassador to China. &quot;We found that climate instability will lead to instability in geopolitics and impact American military operations around the world,&quot; said retired General Gordon Sullivan, chairman of the Military Advisory Board and former Army chief of staff, in releasing the report today at a Washington news conference. &quot;People are saying they want to be perfectly convinced about climate science projections,&quot; General Sullivan said. &quot;But speaking as a soldier, we never have 100 percent certainty. If you wait until you have 100 percent certainty, something bad is going to happen on the battlefield.&quot; Military Advisory Board members said they remain optimistic that climate change challenges can be managed to reduce future risks. As part of its five specific recommendations for action, the Board said &quot;the path to mitigating the worst security consequences of climate change involves reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.&quot; The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today released the national greenhouse gas inventory, which finds that overall emissions during 2005 increased by 0.8 percent from the previous year. Overall emissions have grown by 16 percent from 1990 to 2005. Retired Navy Vice Admiral Richard Truly, a shuttle astronaut and former NASA administrator, said, &quot;Unlike the challenges that we are used to dealing with, these will come upon us extremely slowly, but come they will, and they will be grinding and inexorable.&quot; Truly also notes that &quot;maybe more challenging is that climate change will affect every nation, and all simultaneously. This is why we need to study this issue now, so that we'll be prepared and not overwhelmed by the required scope of our response when the time comes.&quot; The Military Advisory Board report recognizes that unabated climate change could bring an increased frequency of extreme storms, additional drought and flooding, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and the rapid spread of life-threatening disease. These projected effects are usually viewed as environmental challenges, but now the Military Advisory Board has looked at them from the perspective of national security assessments. They are serious risk factors for massive migrations, increased border tensions, greater demands for rescue and evacuation efforts, and conflicts over essential resources, including food and water, the board said, saying such developments could lead to direct U.S. military involvement. &quot;Climate change can provide the conditions that will extend the war on terror,&quot; said retired Admiral T. Joseph Lopez, former commander-in-chief, U.S. Naval Forces Europe and of Allied Forces, Southern Europe. &quot;Rising ocean water levels, droughts, violent weather, ruined national economies-those are the kinds of stresses we'll see more of under climate change,&quot; he said. &quot;In the long term, we want to address the underlying conditions that terrorists seek to exploit,&quot; Admiral Lopez said. &quot;But climate change will prolong those conditions. It makes them worse.&quot;<br />

<strong>Global warming makes all their DA impacts inevitable – triggers global conflict and instability</strong><br />
<strong>McGinn</strong>, <strong>10</strong> (Dennis Mcginn is a Senior Policy Advisor to the American Council on Renewable Energy, Senior Fellow of International Security at the Rocky Mountain Institute, Former Chairman of the US Naval Institute Board of Directors, and Fellow at the Naval War College. “ENERGY CHALLENGES; COMMITTEE: HOUSE SELECT ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND GLOBAL WARMING,” CQ Congressional Testimony, December 1st, EBSCO)<br />
Last year, global climate researchers revised those predictions, now forecasting that the planet could warm by as much as 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century even if the world's leaders fulfill their most ambitious climate pledges, a much faster and broader scale pace of change than the IPCC forecast just two years ago. Their other findings include that sea level could rise by as much as six feet by 2100 instead of 1.5 feet, as the IPCC had projected, and the Arctic Sea may experience an ice-free summer by 2030, rather than by the end of the century. Let me give you some examples, from a military perspective, of what the future could be like if we fail to adequately address the causes and effects of climate change. In Africa, projected rising temperatures will dramatically reduce water availability, soil moisture, arable land and food production. Combined with increased extreme weather events - climate impacts will act to accelerate the destabilization of populations and governments already dealing with more traditional causes of conflict. Climate-driven crises are already happening there. Lack of water and changing agricultural patterns are at the root of crises in Darfur and Somalia, present day examples of failed social structures and governments, leading to widespread humanitarian crises, conflict, piracy and terrorism. In South and Central America - melting glaciers in Venezuela and the Peruvian Andes will directly impact water supplies and hydroelectric power. The Peruvian plains, northeast Brazil and Mexico will experience longer and more serious droughts. Land degradation and loss of food production will hit hard in Latin America - particularly Brazil whose economy is fueled by food exports - possibly leading to social disruptions and significant migration. We need only reflect on present immigration and security challenges along the U.S. southern border to get a glimpse of what the future could hold: immigration driven not by a search for a better economic life but in search of basic needs. In Bangladesh, the growing threat of more frequent and intense typhoons in the Bay of Bengal has the potential for wiping out essential coastal agriculture and fishing areas, just as it did in 1991 resulting in the U.S. military led Operation Sea Angel. Greater and more prolonged coastal typhoon damage would create an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, which could drive literally millions of refugees northwest toward India in search of relief. As the Himalayan glaciers recede, Asian nations like China, India and Pakistan will have to deal with internal and external unrest due to a much less reliable source of water from four great rivers --- creating floods at some times of the year, prolonged drought during others-- to meet the needs of growing populations. This past summer, we saw massive flooding in Pakistan that continues to affect more than twenty million people in a nuclear- armed nation, with an ongoing extremist insurgency that has direct bearing on the outcome of allied operations in Afghanistan. 40 percent of Asia`s four billion people live within 45 miles of the coast - with coastlines and infrastructure that could be inundated by rising seas. Even the most modest projections of increased temperature and sea level rise include widespread flooding and loss of significant percentages of coastal delta farmland and heavily populated areas. In the Middle East, the vast majority of highly diverse populations already depend on water sources external to their borders. A greatly increased competition for diminishing supplies of water for agriculture and basic human needs would significantly ratchet up tensions in this historically critical and politically unstable region. These potential climate change effects will not just create crisis events happening far away from American soil or along our borders. Disasters like Hurricane Katrina in 2005 reveal, in a very stark way, how a natural disaster-caused humanitarian crisis can quickly lead to suffering, civil unrest and the need for a massive, expensive and sustained mobilization of resources. In fact today, more than five years after Hurricane Katrina produced widespread destruction along the Gulf Coast, thousands of people have not returned to their homes and hundreds of millions of dollars in damaged infrastructure remain. As CNA Military Advisory Board member Vice Admiral Richard Truly said climate change is not like <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:00:``some hot spot we`re trying to handle.`` -->some hot spot we`re trying to handle.<!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:00 --> <!-- ws:start:WikiTextRawRule:01:``It`s going to happen to every country and every person in the whole world at the same time.`` -->It`s going to happen to every country and every person in the whole world at the same time.<!-- ws:end:WikiTextRawRule:01 --> ii And while the effects of global warming create this potential environmental havoc, its principal dynamic will be to shift the world's balance of power and money.iii Drought and scant water supply have already fueled civil conflicts in global hot spots like Afghanistan, Nepal and Sudan, according to several new studies. The evidence is fairly clear that sharp downward deviations from normal rainfall in fragile societies elevate the risk of major conflict.iv Climate impacts like extreme drought, flooding, storm, temperatures, sea level rise, ocean acidification, and wildfires - occurring more frequently and more intensely across the globe - - will inevitably create political instability where societal demands for the essentials of life exceed the capacity of governments to cope. As noted above, fragile governments will become failed states, and desperation and hopelessness will drive whole populations to be displaced on a scale far beyond what we see today. And into this turmoil and power vacuum will rush paramilitaries, organized crime, extremists producing a highly exportable brand of terrorism. Clearly the U.S. Military will be called to respond to these new threats -- mobilizing to meet the needs of humanitarian crises, like our response to the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia. At the same time, we will be confronted with more frequent resource based conflicts -- think oil-- in the most volatile regions of the world. Climate-driven disruption is such a viable threat that the Pentagon has already started to prepare contingencies for such scenarios, and focused on the issue in its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, as did the State Department in its Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. At the same time, -- and this is at the very nexus of climate change, energy and national security -- increasing demand for, and dwindling supplies of fossil fuels will add greatly to this instability, in many of the very same places worst hit by climate change. In its second report, May, 2009, the CNA Military Advisory Board concluded that America`s current energy posture constitutes a serious and urgent threat to national security -- militarily, diplomatically and economically. Further, this creates an ongoing unacceptable level of risk to our nation, exploitable by those who wish to do us harm.<br />

Instead, he and <span style="text-decoration: none;">Zhao found a small but measurable decline of about 1 percent, compared to a 6 percent increase in the 1980s and '90s.</span> Their study, based on data collected by NASA satellites, found that northerly areas continued to increase plant growth, thanks to warmer temperatures and a longer growing season. But that was more than offset by warming-associated drought in the Southern Hemisphere. The research was supported by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.<br />

<strong>Even if more plants grow, they can’t take the heat</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11px;">Bangalore: <span style="text-decoration: none;">Global warming could seriously dent crop yields in the tropics and subtropics, including India by the end of the century, and if the agriculture systems don’t adapt, at least half of the world’s population could face serious food shortages</span>, says a new report in Friday’s Science. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Using data from 23 climate models, which contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, 2007 report, David S. Battisti, University of Washington, and Rosamond L. Naylor of Stanford University’s Program on Food Security and the Environment say India will be among the harder-hit regions due to its high growing-season heat and decrease in soil moisture. Researchers say there is greater than a 90% probability that by 2100 the lowest growing-season temperatures in the tropics and subtropics will be higher than any temperatures recorded there to date. The temperate zones won’t be spared either</span>, even though the IPCC is optimistic about them. “It’s a very interesting approach at looking into the future and has a serious message for India. IPCC has not done such an analysis,” says N.H. Ravindranath, professor at the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore and co-author in most of the IPCC climate reports<span style="text-decoration: none;">. Unlike other reports, this study has used historical instances of extreme warming, hurricane, drought, etc. to illustrate the magnitude of damage to food production, showing that these short-run extreme events could become the norm in later part of the century.</span> The study includes severe heat episodes in France in 2003, Ukraine in 1972 and Sahel, western Africa, in the 1960s-70s. In the case of the Ukraine, a near-record heat wave reduced wheat yields and contributed to disruptions in the global cereal market that lasted two years. “We are taking the worst of what we’ve seen historically and saying that in the future it is going to be a lot worse unless there is some kind of adaptation,” says Naylor. Though India has had many instances of high seasonal heat (and extreme heat waves), Battisti and Naylor say they couldn’t include those examples in their study as there is not enough documentation of damage from these events. Most documentation for India and other parts of Asia focuses on drought episodes as opposed to heat episodes. That’s true, we don’t scientifically document such events and crop damages, says Ravindranath. India had severe drought and heat episodes as recent as in 2000 and 2001 in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka and other parts but the crop yield was not assessed, as they were considered extreme events. But this could be the norm in next 50 years, says Ravindranath. For instance, the IPCC predicts 2-3 degrees centigrade change in temperature in Europe by 2050. <span style="text-decoration: none;">But Europe already experienced such a rise in temperature in 2003 when an estimated 52,000 people died and various crops faced decline in yield ranging from 35 to 21%. This could serve as a good example for policy makers, says Ravindranath, who, as part of several New Delhi committees on climate policy, regrets India not basing its climate policy on “sound scientific and economic analysis”. Scientists say this finding provides a compelling reason for investment in adaptation as it will take decades to develop new food crop varieties that have more heat tolerance. In the tropics, the higher temperatures can cut yields of the staple crops such as rice and maize by 20-40%. Even crops such as wheat, says Battisti, which makes up one-quarter of the calories consumed in India, have not seen any growth in yields for the last decade</span>. He suggests “the government of India should take these projections seriously”, as the ensemble of models in this study includes all of the science that contributed to the IPCC and is the “best available in the world”. “India has to worry about its own crop productivity; it also has to worry about migration from other regions of South Asia, notably Bangladesh, when sea level rises and wipes out a large share of their agricultural region,” says Naylor.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11px;">Unfortunately, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the US investment in advanced research and technology for space</span> exploration and development <span style="text-decoration: none;">has been reduced to historically low levels</span>, and concurrently has been focused more narrowly than ever before on immediate system designs and development projects. In many respects, the current budget is little more than an “advanced development” program with minimal opportunity for innovation and essentially no possibility that an invention arising from civil space research and technology programs could influence system design decisions, inform budget estimates or inspire new, more ambitious space program goals. The challenge today <span style="text-decoration: none;">Space has never been more important to our national security</span> than it is today. The opportunities for truly profound scientific discoveries through space exploration have never been greater. And <span style="text-decoration: none;">the pace of international development of new capabilities for space operations has never been faster</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Federal budgets</span> for advanced research and technology to enable future space exploration and development <span style="text-decoration: none;">have been reduced</span> in scope and focused on near-term system developments to the point that <span style="text-decoration: none;">US preeminence in space</span> activities <span style="text-decoration: none;">is in question</span>. NASA’s advanced space research and technology budget was over $2 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2005, with a focus on objectives five to ten years in the future and with the purpose of informing program and design decisions, while retiring both technical and budget risks of those future programs. The President’s FY 2007 budget for NASA exploration technology declined to less than $700 million, and of that only a small fraction (perhaps less than $200 million) still addressed longer-term objectives. The corresponding budgets in 2008 and 2009 were further reduced. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Little to none of the remaining investment deals with</span> enabling fundamentally <span style="text-decoration: none;">new goals or objectives</span>, or dramatically reducing expected costs. With these funding levels and program goals, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11px; text-decoration: none;">it is unlikely that the US will maintain leadership in space</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11px;"> exploration beyond the current generation of projects—all of which are founded on the “seed corn” harvested from past investments in innovative new space capabilities. Further, <span style="text-decoration: none;">declining support for space research and technology is creating an innovation vacuum in the US as </span>small<span style="text-decoration: none;"> business opportunities evaporate, and funding for universities and students vanishes</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">This trend jeopardizes America’s long-term leadership in space</span> exploration and development, <span style="text-decoration: none;">and damages our</span> ability to achieve important <span style="text-decoration: none;">national security</span> goals. History Since the conclusion of the Apollo program in the early 1970s, the US space program has experienced varying levels of support from national leaders in the White House and the US Congress. Moreover, during most of that time human exploration beyond low Earth orbit has been “off the agenda”, with the exception of the short-lived Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) of 1989–1993. During the same period, US robotic exploration has had a number of tremendous successes, primarily involving the outer planets (e.g., Voyager spacecraft, Galileo, and more recently, Cassini), but also the inner solar system (e.g., Viking on Mars, Magellan at Venus), and the recent series of Mars missions (e.g., Pathfinder/Sojourner, Mars Observer, Spirit and Opportunity). However, these programs have tended to reflect one-of-a-kind successes with a minimal number of spacecraft and missions using common systems or technologies, resulting in continuing very high costs. Various attempts to create a foundation of common technologies and modular spacecraft have failed. Similarly, attempts to bridge the gap between robotic mission systems technologies and human space flight technologies (e.g., “Platform Z” from the early Space Station Freedom program) have failed. The most notable successes in this vein arose from the in-space assembly and spacecraft servicing capabilities of the Space Shuttle, first in the early 1980s with the Solar Max servicing mission, then with the series of hugely successful Hubble Space Telescope servicing missions, and finally with the assembly of the International Space Station. However, these achievements were far more the exception than the rule. For the most part human and robotic exploration systems and technologies became increasingly isolated beginning in the 1970s. More recently Following the Columbia tragedy in 2003, the direction of the US space program was again the subject of intense discussion (led by the White House) and including various agencies and organizations. The result, announced in January 2004, was the “Vision for Space Exploration” (VSE). The VSE as formulated originally was much more than a new justification for human space flight. Rather, the Vision addressed the full range of human and robotic exploration, as well as a revitalization of advanced space research and technology with far-reaching implications. The original VSE strategy placed strong emphasis on studies, research, and technology developments that would in time inform decisions regarding architectures and systems for (1) a Space Shuttle replacement; (2) annual robotic technology missions to the Moon; (3) a human return to the Moon to establish a permanent presence; (4) new space observatories to explore the universe beyond our solar system; (5) a campaign of robotic missions to Mars and beyond; and more. With current funding levels and program goals, <span style="text-decoration: none;">it is unlikely that the US will maintain leadership in space</span> exploration beyond the current generation of projects—all of which are founded on the “seed corn” harvested from past investments in innovative new space capabilities. However, in 2005 NASA shifted to a dramatically different approach to exploration and related technology developments with the results of the Exploration Systems Architecture Study. ESAS results placed exclusive emphasis on a US human lunar return and in an attempt to accelerate the first operational capability for the “crew exploration vehicle”—a capsule-based Space Shuttle replacement. To achieve this focus, numerous strategic changes were necessary. References to other aspects of space science and exploration were dropped, as was integrated planning of human and robotic exploration missions. For example, the initially planned annual campaign of robotic technology missions to the Moon was reduced to a single orbiter and one lunar lander mission, and these retained little or no role in guiding design decisions for human lunar systems. Also, to avoid technology-related risks, a range of lifecycle cost-related architectural options were eliminated from consideration, including in-space assembly of lunar transportation systems, in-space fueling and servicing, reusable lunar transportation systems, and others. The result was a family of systems for low Earth orbit access and a return to the Moon that involved a re-sized, Apollo-like architectural approach, with a heavy-lift launch vehicle and expendable transportation system elements. Significant shifts in agency budgets followed these new strategic directions, including drastic reductions in advanced space research and technology development, and a redefinition of remaining investments as “technology development”, focused on already-made design decisions. This shift in strategy was epitomized by NASA’s elimination of the NASA Institute of Advanced Concepts (NIAC) on the grounds of budget constraints, despite that fact that NIAC represented less than one third of one percent of the agency’s annual budget. The real point was that NIAC no longer had a legitimate role given NASA’s new approach to innovation: low engineering risk designs, and modest technology developments focused on those designs. Unfortunately, the elimination of design-to-cost and investments in longer-term innovation have come with a price. By recent estimates, the transportation-related cost of a single human mission to the Moon using the present, low-technology design solution will exceed $5 billion; transportation for two crewed lunar missions per year would require approximately 60% of NASA’s annual budget. Moreover, in-house agency subject matter expertise has been severely affected, as has the Agency’s contribution to US space technology leadership. Overall, the ambitious goals that were articulated by the White House in 2004 have been pushed into the indefinite future. A permanent human outpost of the Moon, development of lunar resources, deployment of large space observatories, and ambitious missions to the outer planets: all of these have been pushed out into the future by 20 years or more. Moreover, it is difficult to envision how such goals could ever be achieved using current systems concepts and concomitant prohibitively high costs. Only new systems concepts, enabled by focused space research and technology developments, can change this assessment. At the same time, <span style="text-decoration: none;">real progress continues to be made by the international space community, grounded in steady investments in new technologies and systems</span>—and <span style="text-decoration: none;">resulting in regular accomplishments</span> in space systems. The international flotilla of robotic space missions to the Moon illustrates this point: the US contribution of a single orbiter and a future lander are largely indistinguishable from the missions of other countries. Without an adequate strategy for, and more robust investment in, advanced space research and technology, long-term US preeminence in space exploration and development is doubtful. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) of the US Department of Defense (DOD) provides a useful example for how long-term but focused government research and technology advancement may be pursued. In particular, the ONR uses four complementary program strategies: a foundation of in-house subject matter expertise, sustained basic research and technology investments, development and demonstration of prototypes, and a focus on future capabilities. The concept of “Future Naval Capabilities” (FNCs) is used by the ONR to focus advanced research and technology (R&amp;T) efforts around novel systems and concepts of operations. FNCs allow a range of R&amp;T investments to be coordinated around specific new capabilities—even though the details of those systems designs have not yet been finalized, nor development programs approved. Also, the ONR uses the concept of “Innovative Naval Prototypes” (INPs) to orchestrate a range of ongoing R&amp;T and draw the results of those efforts into nearer-term demonstrations of working prototypes and test-beds. INPs are characterized by ambitious technical objectives, and their potential to truly transform future naval operations. In addition, the ONR has preserved for over 60 years a commitment to long lead, discipline-oriented research and technology development. These investments have been responsible for advances in areas as diverse as materials, electronics, communications, power, and others—but all leading toward naval preeminence. And finally, DOD investments have maintained a foundation of in-house subject matter expertise at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and other installations. Over the years, these in-house experts have enabled more effective technology investment decisions and, working with civilian and uniformed leaders better system acquisition decisions. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Novel technologies and systems concepts must be matured and validated</span> before decisions are made regarding the detailed designs of future space systems. There are a variety of business models that might be considered for space research and technology development. However, the strategies used by the ONR for its investments seem especially appropriate to the long-term character of the challenge of space exploration and development. For civil space exploration and development, these would be: (1) maintenance of in-house NASA subject matter expertise in relevant technologies; (2) sustained, discipline-oriented investment in basic research and technology at NASA centers, universities, and small businesses; (3) development and demonstration of transformational systems prototypes in partnerships involving NASA, major industry and others; and (4) a sustained focus on future space capabilities. And the results of these investments must be harvested before designs are finalized and system acquisition programs started. Assessment It is hardly consistent with the aspirations of Americans to “go where everyone has been before…” However, it is fantasy to suppose that the civil space program can affordably accomplish ambitious goals and objectives in space using systems concepts and technologies of the last century. Novel technologies and systems concepts must be matured and validated before decisions are made regarding the detailed designs of future space systems. In fact, numerous reports over a period of decades have established the criticality of a robust and focused investment in advanced research and technology, including the findings of several National Commissions, committees of the National Academy of Sciences, and others. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11px; text-decoration: none;">Stable, robust, long-termfederal investments in advanced research and technology for future civil space capabilities—funded at a level sufficient to assure US preeminence in space science, exploration, and utilization—are critical if we are to meet the challenges of this century: achieving ambitious goals in science and exploration, delivering on the promise of</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11px;"> space to contribute to <span style="text-decoration: none;">a strong national economy, maintaining a skilled aerospace workforce, and providing the foundations for future national security</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">It is time for the Congress and the White House</span>—recognizing the challenges facing this nation’s space sector—<span style="text-decoration: none;">to articulate and implement a strategy to revitalize advanced space research and technology and to make a sustained commitment to the implementation of that strategy. </span>The recently chartered national study on the future of human space exploration, chaired by Norm Augustine, should take up this task. What should be done? The following actions are needed now: <span style="text-decoration: none;">The federal government should revitalize</span> its investment to invent and develop innovative new technologies for <span style="text-decoration: none;">space science</span>, exploration, <span style="text-decoration: none;">and development,</span> consistent with assuring US preeminence in space activities and industry’s ability to adopt these innovations for application in future space missions and markets. A balanced distribution should be created in the allocation of revitalized advanced space research and technology funding among more basic research efforts, technology maturation, and demonstrations of new technologies. <span style="text-decoration: none;">These investments should be</span> guided by the goal of creating ambitious <span style="text-decoration: none;">new</span> “future <span style="text-decoration: none;">space capabilities</span>”—well-enough defined to inform technology investments, but flexible enough to allow the results of those investments to influence designs, reduce costs, and enable new and more ambitious science goals. In establishing these investments, NASA must seek and embrace inputs from outside the agency (including other agencies, industry, academia) to develop, review, and recommend NASA advanced space research and technology plans, programs, and strategies. NASA in-house space research and technology (performed by engineers and technical specialists) should be restored, in balance with increased external research (by industry and academia). Funding for university research should also be targeted toward producing graduates with advanced degrees to support the follow-on work that will be undertaken by industry. We need to reconsider what makes an ambitious space program worth a substantial investment of public dollars—and consider again the historical and future importance of advancing space technology and developing truly new and valuable space capabilities for the public, the nation, and the world. To achieve the purposes for which it was created, <span style="text-decoration: none;">NASA must maintain the excellence of its workforce and their expertise in</span> a wide array of <span style="text-decoration: none;">cutting-edge new technologies</span>. As they enter the workforce, <span style="text-decoration: none;">it will be impossible to attract the “best and the brightest” to federal service without</span> a foundation of <span style="text-decoration: none;">cutting-edge research and technology</span> program opportunities. Moreover, <span style="text-decoration: none;">a healthy NASA workforce</span>, armed with appropriate skills and secure in its future, <span style="text-decoration: none;">will provide better oversight for</span> technical system <span style="text-decoration: none;">procurement and</span> program <span style="text-decoration: none;">management</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">This competence will result in better performing systems, better ability to meet schedule, more productive interactions</span> with other stakeholders in the aerospace enterprise, <span style="text-decoration: none;">and more efficient use of taxpayer dollars</span>. Although NASA must accommodate changing priorities and budgets, it must also ensure that it does not lose the important skills and knowledge currently possessed by its workers. NASA also must continue to ensure that the NASA workforce gains the new competencies needed in the aerospace industry of the future. In order accelerate the transition of novel technologies into transformational future space capabilities <span style="text-decoration: none;">NASA must invest in demonstrations of innovative space prototypes</span> on the ground and in space. Innovative space prototypes should be implemented in coordination with the DoD, academia, and industry; and wherever possible with co-funding with the private sector in order to speed the application of these new capabilities in creating new space industries. To implement these recommendations effectively, <span style="text-decoration: none;">focused and timely near term action is essential</span>: The National Academy of Sciences (National Research Council) should be chartered to conduct an independent, visionary study to identify 6–12 transformational “future space capabilities” that would—if developed—enable a wide range of new, ambitious, and affordable space exploration and development. These future space capabilities would in turn drive planning for government and industry research and technology investments. The Administration should develop—in consultation with the US Congress, and using NASA as its executive agent—a strategic research and technology development roadmap that establishes a baseline for achieving these goals, including objectives, schedules, milestones and budgets. This roadmap should be used to provide the basis for future US investments in advanced space research and technology development and demonstrations. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The US space program needs more than</span> a national discussion of what <span style="text-decoration: none;">human exploration</span> should do next: <span style="text-decoration: none;">International Space Station</span> research versus <span style="text-decoration: none;">lunar outposts</span> versus <span style="text-decoration: none;">asteroid sorties</span> versus human Mars missions, <span style="text-decoration: none;">and so on</span>. These are important questions. Even more, however, <span style="text-decoration: none;">we need to set in place basic policies that can endure</span> from one administration to the next. <span style="text-decoration: none;">We need to reconsider</span> what makes an ambitious space program worth a substantial investment of public dollars—and consider again the historical and future importance of <span style="text-decoration: none;">advancing space technology and developing truly new and valuable space capabilities for the public, the nation, and the world</span>.</span><br />

Today we take America’s industrial base for granted, but we do so at our own peril. Think about what a strong industrial base has meant for our country. It was the “arsenal of democracy” that equipped us to win World War II and the Cold War. It put a man on the moon. It made America the worldwide leader in space, commercial aviation, and defense. But a strong industrial base is not a given. It’s a product of the right policies, investments and priorities – and of time. We don’t have to look far to see how an industrial base can quickly wither away. The UK was once renowned for its aerospace and defense manufacturing. Now that country is buying F-35s, C-17s, Apaches, and Chinooks from us, and of course, commercial airplanes. UK leaders realized a few years ago that they needed an industrial policy and have put one in place. But it won’t be easy for the UK to rebuild its capabilities, and that should serve as a warning to us. When we don’t invest in new development programs and when policymakers don’t consider how procurement decisions impact the industrial base, we risk losing talent and expertise that’s taken us decades to build. Our engineering talent is not a fixed asset. It’s made up of people who need challenging new projects. And if they don’t have them, they move into other industries or retire. Once lost, reconstituting it is very difficult and will take decades. With the F35 in test flight, we are now at a point where there are no new military airplanes or helicopters in development by the DoD. I think that’s the first time we’ve been in that situation in probably a hundred years. We risk following the UK in dismantling our industrial base if we don’t do something about that. You might think, “We are building aircraft for the military, so what’s the problem?” To be a viable contractor and an integrator of very complex systems, you have to understand how to do R&amp;D. You have to take R&amp;D into detailed design. You have to transition detailed design into production. You have to run your production systems, and you have to have a very healthy supply chain. What we’re seeing right now with no new start in the Department of Defense is we are losing our ability to do detailed design. We are losing our capability to transition design into manufacturing. Once that’s gone, it will take a long time to reconstitute. I know this is an issue. That was one of the problems we had on the 787 program. We had not done a new development program since the 777, and we paid the price as a result. On the space side, tens of thousands of very experienced engineers will lose their jobs in the gap between the Space Shuttle’s last mission and the start of the next program. Earlier this month, the United Space Alliance, the NASA contractor responsible for operating the space shuttles, announced it will lay off up to 50 percent of its work force 4or about 2,800 workers. NASA astronauts who have trained for years are wondering what they will do next. Without clear direction and investments, we’re going to lose the intellectual capital it’s taken us 50 years to develop. Once we park the shuttle this summer, I predict that the Chinese will walk on the moon before we once again put an American into low-earth orbit in a U.S. launch vehicle. To me, that’s unconscionable.<br />

<span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">Great power status is achieved through competition between nations. This competition is often based on advancing science and technology and applying these advancements to enabling new operational capabilities. A great power that succeeds in this competition adds to its power while a great power that doesnotcompete or does so ineffectively or by choice, becomes comparatively less powerful. Eventually, it loses the great power status and then must align itself with another great power for protection.As the pace of science and technology advancement has increased, so has the potential for the pace of change of great power status. While the U.S. &quot;invented&quot; powered flight in 1903, a decade later leadership in this area had shifted to Europe. Within a little more than a decade after the Wright Brothers' first flights, the great powers of Europe were introducing aeronautics into major land warfare through the creation of air forces. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, it was forced to rely on French-built aircraft. Twenty years later, as the European great powers were on the verge of beginning another major European war, the U.S. found itself in a similar situation where its choice to diminish national investment in aeronautics during the 1920's and 1930's—you may recall that this was the era of General Billy Mitchell and his famous efforts to promote military air power—placed U.S. air forces at a significant disadvantage compared to those of Germany and Japan. This was crucial because military air power was quickly emerging as the &quot;game changer&quot; for conventional warfare. Land and sea forces increasingly needed capable air forces to survive and generally needed air superiority to prevail.With the great power advantages of becoming spacefaring expected to be comparable to those derived from becoming air-faring in the 1920's and 1930's, a delay by the U.S. in enhancing its great power strengths through expanded national space power may result in a reoccurrence of the rapid emergence of new or the rapid growth of current great powers to the point that they are capable of effectively challenging the U.S.Many great powers—China, India, and Russia—are already speaking of plans for developing spacefaring capabilities. Yet, today, the U.S. retains a commanding aerospace technological lead over these nations. A strong effort by the U.S. to become a true spacefaring nation, starting in 2009 with the new presidential administration, may yield a generation or longer lead in space, not just through prudent increases in military strength but also through the other areas of great power competition discussed above. This is an advantage that the next presidential administration should exercise.</span><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power</span>--Rome, Britain or the United States today. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Scholars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of when we consider the current international order--free trade</span>, a robust monetary regime, increasing <span style="text-decoration: none;">respect for human rights, growing democratization--is directly linked to U.S. power. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it</span>. In that <span style="text-decoration: none;">they are dead wrong</span> and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons: <span style="text-decoration: none;">Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages followed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles</span>. Without U.S. power, the liberal order created by the United States will end just as assuredly. As country and western great Ral Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washington and the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today, <span style="text-decoration: none;">American primacy helps keep a number of complicated relationships aligned--between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia</span>. This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Wars still occur</span> where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, <span style="text-decoration: none;">but a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly</span> war's worst form: <span style="text-decoration: none;">great power wars</span>. Second, <span style="text-decoration: none;">American power gives the United States the ability to spread democracy</span> and other elements of its ideology of liberalism: Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview.( n3) So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition, <span style="text-decoration: none;">once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced</span>. This is not because democracies do not have clashing interests. Indeed they do. Rather, itis <span style="text-decoration: none;">because they are more open, more transparent and more likely to want to resolve things amicably in concurrence with U.S. leadership</span>. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States. Critics have faulted the Bush Administration for attempting to spread democracy in the Middle East, labeling such aft effort a modern form of tilting at windmills. It is the obligation of Bush's critics to explain why :democracy is good enough for Western states but not for the rest, and, one gathers from the argument, should not even be attempted. Of course, whether democracy in the Middle East will have a peaceful or stabilizing influence on America's interests in the short run is open to question. Perhaps democratic Arab states would be more opposed to Israel, but nonetheless, their people would be better off. The United States has brought democracy to Afghanistan, where 8.5 million Afghans, 40 percent of them women, voted in a critical October 2004 election, even though remnant Taliban forces threatened them. The first free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. It was the military power of the United States that put Iraq on the path to democracy. Washington fostered democratic governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caucasus. Now even the Middle East is increasingly democratic. They may not yet look like Western-style democracies, but democratic progress has been made in Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt. <span style="text-decoration: none;">By all accounts, the march of democracy has been impressive</span>. Third, <span style="text-decoration: none;">along with the growth in the number of democratic states around the world has been the growth of the global economy</span>. With its allies, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the United States has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network characterized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, and mobility of capital and labor markets. The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is a global public good from which all states benefit, particularly the poorest states in the Third World</span>. The United States created this network not out of altruism but for the benefit and the economic well-being of America. This economic order forces American industries to be competitive, maximizes efficiencies and growth, and benefits defense as well because the size of the economy makes the defense burden manageable. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Economic spin-offs foster the development of military technology, helping to ensure military prowess</span>. Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the economic network comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat and researcher at the World Bank, who started his career confident in the socialist ideology of post-independence India. Abandoning the positions of his youth, Lal now recognizes that the only way to bring relief to desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the adoption of free market economic policies and globalization, which are facilitated through American primacy.( n4) As a witness to the failed alternative economic systems, Lal is one of the strongest academic proponents of American primacy due to the economic prosperity it provides. Fourth and finally, the United States, in seeking primacy, has been willing to use its power not only to advance its interests but to promote the welfare of people all over the globe. <span style="text-decoration: none;">The United States is the earth's leading source of positive externalities for the world</span>. The U.S. military has participated in over fifty operations since the end of the Cold War--and most of those missions have been humanitarian in nature. Indeed, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the U.S. military is the earth's &quot;911 force&quot;--it serves, de facto, as the world's police, the global paramedic and the planet's fire department. Whenever there is a natural disaster, earthquake, flood, drought, volcanic eruption, typhoon or tsunami, the United States assists the countries in need</span>. On the day after Christmas in 2004, a tremendous earthquake and tsunami occurred in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra, killing some 300,000 people. The United States was the first to respond with aid. Washington followed up with a large contribution of aid and deployed the U.S. military to South and Southeast Asia for many months to help with the aftermath of the disaster. About 20,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines responded by providing water, food, medical aid, disease treatment and prevention as well as forensic assistance to help identify the bodies of those killed. Only the U.S. military could have accomplished this Herculean effort. <span style="text-decoration: none;">No other force possesses the communications capabilities or global logistical reach of the U.S. military</span>. In fact, UN peacekeeping operations depend on the United States to supply UN forces. <span style="text-decoration: none;">American generosity has done more to help the United States fight the War on Terror than almost any other measure</span>. Before the tsunami, 80 percent of Indonesian public opinion was opposed to the United States; after it, 80 percent had a favorable opinion of America. Two years after the disaster, and in poll after poll, Indonesians still have overwhelmingly positive views of the United States. In October 2005, an enormous earthquake struck Kashmir, killing about 74 000 people and leaving three million homeless. The U.S. military responded immediately, diverting helicopters fighting the War on Terror in nearby Afghanistan to bring relief as soon as possible To help those in need, the United States also provided financial aid to Pakistan; and, as one might expect from those witnessing the munificence of the United States, it left a lasting impression about America. For the first time since 9/11, polls of Pakistani opinion have found that more people are favorable toward the United States than unfavorable, while support for Al-Qaeda dropped to its lowest level. Whether in Indonesia or Kashmir, the money was well-spent because it helped people in the wake of disasters, but it also had a real impact on the War on Terror. When people in the Muslim world witness the U.S. military conducting a humanitarian mission, there is a clearly positive impact on Muslim opinion of the United States. <span style="text-decoration: none;">As the War on Terror is a war of ideas and opinion as much as military action, for the United States humanitarian missions are the equivalent of a blitzkrieg</span>.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">NSSO 7 </span></strong>National Security Space Office, Report to the Director, 10-10-2007, “Space-Based Solar Power As an Opportunity for Strategic Security; Phase 0 Architecture Feasibility Study,” NSS, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:600:http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/final-sbsp-interim-assessment-release-01.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/final-sbsp-interim-assessment-release-01.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/final-sbsp-interim-assessment-release-01.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:600 --><br />
FINDING: The SBSP Study Group found that <span style="text-decoration: none;">SBSP offers a path to address</span> the concerns over US <span style="text-decoration: none;">intellectual competitiveness in math and the physical sciences</span> expressed by the Rising Above the Gathering Storm report by providing a true “Manhattan or Apollo project for energy.” In absolute scale and implications, it is likely that <span style="text-decoration: none;">SBSP would</span> ultimately <span style="text-decoration: none;">exceed both the Manhattan and Apollo projects which established significant workforces and helped the US maintain its technical and competitive lead</span>. The committee expressed it was “deeply concerned that the <span style="text-decoration: none;">scientific and technological building blocks critical to our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength.” SBSP would require a substantial technical workforce</span> of high<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span>paying jobs. <span style="text-decoration: none;">It would require expanded technical education opportunities, and directly support </span>the underlying aims of the American <span style="text-decoration: none;">Competitiveness</span> Initiative. FINDING: The SBSP Study Group found that <span style="text-decoration: none;">SBSP directly addresses the concerns of the</span> Presidential <span style="text-decoration: none;">Aerospace Commission which called on the US to become a true spacefaring civilization and to pay closer attention to our aerospace technical and industrial base</span>, our “national jewel” which has enhanced our security, wealth, travel, and lifestyle. An SBSP program as outlined in this report is remarkably consonant with the findings of this commission, which stated: <span style="text-decoration: none;">The United States must maintain its preeminence in aerospace research and innovation to be the global aerospace leader in the 21st century. This can only be achieved through proactive government policies and sustained public investments in long</span><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; text-decoration: none;">‐</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">term research and RDT&amp;E infrastructure that will result in new breakthrough aerospace capabilities</span>. Over the last several decades, the U.S. aerospace sector has been living off the research investments made primarily for defense during the Cold War…<span style="text-decoration: none;">Government policies and investments in long</span><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; text-decoration: none;">‐</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">term research have not kept pace with the changing world</span>. Our nation does not have bold national aerospace technology goals to focus and sustain federal research and related infrastructure investments. The nation needs to capitalize on these opportunities, and <span style="text-decoration: none;">the federal government needs to lead the effort</span>. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Specifically, it needs to invest in long</span><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; text-decoration: none;">‐</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">term enabling research and related RDT&amp;E infrastructure, establish national aerospace technology demonstration goals, and create an environment that fosters innovation and provide the incentives necessary to encourage risk taking and rapid introduction of new products and services</span>. The Aerospace Commission recognized that Global <span style="text-decoration: none;">U.S. aerospace leadership can only be achieved through investments in our</span> future, including our <span style="text-decoration: none;">industrial base, workforce, long term research and national infrastructure, and that government must commit to increased and sustained investment and must facilitate private investment in our national aerospace sector</span>. The Commission concluded that <span style="text-decoration: none;">the nation will have to be a space</span><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; text-decoration: none;">‐</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">faring nation in order to be the global leader in the 21st century</span>—that our <span style="text-decoration: none;">freedom, mobility, and quality of life</span> will <span style="text-decoration: none;">depend on it</span>, and therefore, recommended that the United States boldly pioneer new frontiers in aerospace technology, commerce and exploration. They explicitly recommended hat the United States create a space imperative and that <span style="text-decoration: none;">NASA and DoD need to make</span> the <span style="text-decoration: none;">investments necessary for developing and supporting future launch capabilities to revitalize U.S. space </span>l<span style="text-decoration: none;">aunch infrastructure</span>, as well as provide Incentives to Commercial Space. The report called on government and the investment community must become more sensitive to commercial opportunities and problems in space. Recognizing the new realities of a highly dynamic, competitive and global marketplace, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the report noted that the federal government is dysfunctional when addressing 21st century issues</span> from a long term, national and global perspective. <span style="text-decoration: none;">It suggested an increase in public funding for long term research and supporting infrastructure and an acceleration of transition of government research to the aerospace sector</span>, recognizing that government must assist industry by providing insight into its long<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span>term research programs, and industry needs to provide to government on its research priorities. It urged the federal government must remove unnecessary barriers to international sales of defense products, and implement other initiatives that strengthen transnational partnerships to enhance national security, noting that U.S. national security and procurement policies represent some of the most burdensome restrictions affecting U.S. industry competitiveness. <span style="text-decoration: none;">Private</span><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; text-decoration: none;">‐</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">public partnerships were</span> also <span style="text-decoration: none;">to be encouraged</span>. It also noted that without constant vigilance and investment, vital capabilities in our defense industrial base will be lost, and so recommended a fenced amount of research and development budget, and significantly increase in the investment in basic aerospace research to increase opportunities to gain experience in the workforce by enabling breakthrough aerospace capabilities through continuous development of new experimental systems with or without a requirement for production. Such experimentation was deemed to be essential to sustain the critical skills to conceive, develop, manufacture and maintain advanced systems and potentially provide expanded capability to the warfighter. <span style="text-decoration: none;">A top priority was increased investment in basic aerospace research which fosters an efficient, secure, and safe aerospace transportation system, and suggested the establishment of national technology demonstration goals</span>, which included reducing the cost and time to space by 50%. It concluded that, “America must exploit and explore space to assure national and planetary security, economic benefit and scientific discovery. At the same time, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the United States must overcome the obstacles that jeopardize its ability to sustain leadership in space.” An SBSP program would be a powerful expression of this imperative</span>.<br />

<strong>Commitment boosts Aerospace – it doesn’t depend upon completion</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Nansen, 95 </span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Ralph Nansen is the world leader in designing, developing and promoting Solar Power Satellites, and founder of the Solar Space Initiative. Nansen spent 31 years with The Boeing Company, asked to testify before such Congressional committees as the Senate Space Subcommittee in 1976 and the House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics in 1978 and again in September 2000. “</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Sun Power”, <span style="color: black;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/sunpower/sunpower09.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/sunpower/sunpower09.html</a></span>)</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">The Case for Developing Solar Power Satellites Some of the very reasons for not developing the solar power satellite concept are also the best reasons to develop it. First of all, if we were to commit to its development it would give us national purpose. We would no longer be wondering what to do the next time we run short of oil or a megalomaniac threatens to take control of a major oil-producing nation. We would be concentrating on a single common goal—not a generalized wish for energy independence, but a specific solution. It would be a greater task than going to the moon in the 1960s, but it would focus the nation’s talents, its energies, and its imagination in much the same way as did that lofty accomplishment. It would challenge our young people to take their place in history building a future for themselves and their children. They would become known as a generation of visionaries who stood at the crossroads of history and chose the pathway of growth rather than stagnation. It would utilize the talents of scientists, engineers, and companies who have been working on military hardware, which is no longer a number one priority with the ending of the cold war. It would develop a new high-level technological base, which is so important to a highly developed nation like the United States in order to maintain our competitive place in the world economy. It would create a massive number of jobs that would bring growth to our economy.</span><br />

If we do not seize this historic opportunity to reduce our dependence on oil, we will bear the following serious consequences: 1. More conflicts in the Middle East America imports almost 60% of its oil today and, at this rate, we’ll import 70% by 2025. Where will that oil come from? Two-thirds of the world’s oil is in the Middle East, primarily in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. The United States has less than 3% of global oil. The Department of Energy predicts that North American oil imports from the Persian Gulf will double from 2001 to 2025. i Other oil suppliers, such as Venezuela, Russia, and West Africa, are also politically unstable and hold no significant long-term oil reserves compared to those in the Middle East. Bottom line: our economy and security are increasingly dependent on one of the most unstable regions on earth. Unless we change our ways, we will find ourselves even more at the mercy of Middle East oil and thus more likely to get involved in future conflicts. The greater our dependence on oil, the greater the pressure to protect and control that oil. The growing American dependence on imported oil is the primary driver of U.S. foreign and military policy today, particularly in the Middle East, and motivates an aggressive military policy now on display in Iraq. To help avoid similar wars in the future and to encourage a more cooperative, responsible, and multilateral foreign policy the United States must significantly reduce its oil use. Before the Iraq war started, Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said: “Regardless of whether we say so publicly, we will go to war, because Saddam sits at the center of a region with more than 60 percent of all the world's oil reserves.” Unfortunately, he was right. In fact, the use of military power to protect the flow of oil has been a central tenet of U.S. foreign policy since 1945. That was the year that President Franklin D. Roosevelt promised King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia that the United States would protect the kingdom in return for special access to Saudi oil—a promise that governs U.S. foreign policy today. This policy was formalized by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 when he announced that the secure flow of oil from the Persian Gulf was in “the vital interests of the United States of America” and that America would use “any means necessary, including military force” to protect those interests from outside forces. This doctrine was expanded by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 to cover internal threats, and was used by the first President Bush to justify the Gulf War of 1990-91, and provided a key, if unspoken rationale for the second President Bush’s invasion of Iraq in 2003. ii The Carter/Reagan Doctrine also led to the build up of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf on a permanent basis and to the establishment of the Rapid Deployment Force and the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The United States now spends over $50 Billion per year (in peacetime) to maintain our readiness to intervene in the Gulf. iii America has tried to address its oil vulnerability by using our military to protect supply routes and to prop up or install friendly regimes. But as Iraq shows the price is astronomical—$200 Billion and counting. Moreover, it doesn’t work—Iraq is now producing less oil than it did before the invasion. While the reasons behind the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq may be complex, can anyone doubt that we would not be there today if Iraq exported coffee instead of oil? It is time for a new approach. Americans are no longer willing to support U.S. misadventures in the Persian Gulf. Recent polls show that almost two-thirds of Americans think the Iraq war was not worth the price in terms of blood and treasure. Lt. Gen William Odom, director of the National Security Agency during President Reagan's second term, recently said: &quot;The invasion of Iraq will turn out to be the greatest strategic disaster in U.S. history. The nation is understandably split about what to do now in Iraq, but there appears to be widespread agreement that America should not make the same mistake again—and we can take a giant step toward that goal by reducing our dependence on oil. 2. More terrorist attacks on Americans The more dependent we are on foreign oil, the more troops we will deploy abroad to protect that oil. This creates resentment and invites terrorist attacks on our troops—and on oil supply routes. The U.S. troop presence in Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War was a major contributor to the rise of Islamic terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, and U.S. troops in Iraq are now a main justification for the insurgency there. We must break our oil habit so we can reduce our military footprint abroad. Moreover, much of the money we pay for our imported oil goes to countries or groups that support terrorism. It is no accident that 15 of the 19 September 11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia, as does Osama Bin Laden. It is time we stop funneling money to our own enemies. According to a 2003 article in Foreign Affairs: “It is…increasingly clear that the riches from oil trickle down to those who would do harm to America and its friends. If this situation remains unchanged, the United States will find itself sending soldiers into battle again and again, adding the lives of American men and women in uniform to the already high cost of oil.” iv 3. Collision course with China With over one billion people, China is second only to the U.S. in oil consumption—and gaining fast. China has one of the fastest growing economies in the world and an energy demand that is projected to grow by 150% by 2020. China’s oil demand is increasing seven times faster than America’s. v China currently imports half of its oil, and like the United States, China will become increasingly dependent on oil from the Middle East. As a result, access to Middle East oil will over time become a key issue in relations between the two nations. The more U.S. actions in the Middle East are perceived as an effort to dominate oil resources there, the more China will consider the United States a threat to its interests, and visa-versa. In the current context of stagnating supply, this kind of demand competition is very destabilizing. Defusing a potential U.S.-Chinese rivalry over global oil supplies is a key driver for reducing U.S. oil dependency. While China’s oil demand is growing rapidly, U.S. demand in absolute terms is much larger, accounting for a quarter of the world’s oil consumption. To its credit, China is taking steps to protect itself from the increasingly tight, volatile global oil market by controlling its oil demand. Last year China set fuel economy standards that are higher than those here in the United States. vi 4.<br />

<span style="color: black;">Usually, Day’s articles are among the best-written and most informative space commentary on the market. But this time he appears to have made a number of unjustified assertions. He writes: “Space activists, who are motivated by the desire to personally live and work in space, do not care about SSP per se […] they have latched on to SSP because it is expedient.” There may well exist people who answer to this description, but if so, they must be remarkably shortsighted. The facts are clear: fossil fuels have served civilization well in the first phase of its industrialization (approximately 1700–2000), but possess a number of problems, of which the current climate hysteria is only one; the others concern the long-term sustainability and growth of industrial energy consumption. Therefore we can predict an imminent shift of the baseload energy supply away from fossil fuels to, most likely, a mixture of artificial nuclear fission and fusion, and terrestrial and space-based solar power. I should add that my personal chances of ever living and working in space are zero. My concern is that society should make the best strategic choices for its prosperity and growth. Given the fact that almost all the natural resources of the universe of potential economic value are extraterrestrial, I am therefore bound to argue the importance of systematic access to those resources. SSP is not merely expedient, rather it is strategic, in the sense that it has the potential to permanently raise the whole of human civilization to a higher level of prosperity, security and spatial range. According to Day’s reading of the NSSO study, this is not for us, but only apparently for future generations, many decades in the future: “The NSSO study […] states that we are nowhere near developing practical SSP […] that the technology to implement space solar power does not currently exist… and is unlikely to exist for the next forty years.” This came as news to me. Since SSP has been regularly used on a small scale to power satellites for forty years already (in marked contrast to the development effort that has gone into nuclear fusion), how could the NSSO have concluded that the technology “does not exist”? What actually does the NSSO report say? It reports: “FINDING: The SBSP Study Group found that Space-Based Solar Power is a complex engineering challenge, but requires no fundamental scientific breakthroughs or new physics to become a reality.” (p.20) “FINDING: The SBSP Study Group found that significant progress in the underlying technologies has been made since previous government examination of this topic, and the direction and pace of progress continues to be positive and in many cases accelerating.” (p.20) This sounds promising. Does it mean we’ll be able to start work in forty years time? “FINDING: The SBSP Study Group found that individual SBSP technologies are sufficiently mature to fly a basic proof-of-concept demonstration within 4–6 years and a substantial power demonstration as early as 2017–2020, though these are likely to cost between $5B–$10B in total. This is a serious challenge for a capable agency with a transformational agenda. A proposed spiral demonstration project can be found in Appendix B.” (p.22–23) Turning to Appendix B, we find that its introductory paragraphs point out that significant technological progress has been achieved in the past decade, which would allow an accelerated pace of progress compared with that proposed by NASA in the late 1990s. But Day is not impressed, for his article reads: “from a technological standpoint, we are not much closer to space solar power today than we were when NASA conducted a big study of it in the 1970s.” He seems to have been reading a completely different report. Appendix B is subheaded: “AN AGGRESSIVE AND ACHIEVABLE SBSP TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATOR ROADMAP: 10 Years — 10 Megawatts — $10 Billion”. It offers an updated program to build “an integrated large-scale demonstrator, to be flown in less than 10 years, at a cost of less than $10B, and delivering power to the Earth of approximately 10 megawatts.” Again, Day’s assertion that the technology is “unlikely to exist for the next forty years” is completely contradicted by the actual contents of the NSSO study report.</span><br />

The idea of harnessing SBSP as an option originated in the United States some 40 years ago. But it has not been pursued with vigour for a variety of reasons, including possibly the influence of nuclear lobbyists. In simple terms, <span style="text-decoration: none;">SBSP</span> is described thus by Lt. Col. Peter Garretson of the US Air Force: &quot;In this concept, very large satellites, the largest ever constructed, made up of kilometers of solar cells, <span style="text-decoration: none;">would collect the Sun’s energy where there is no light, and convert it to radio-waves to be beamed to special receiving antenna farms on the ground </span>(called rectennas) about the size of a small airport. The energy is sent in the form of a low energy beam at about 1/6th the intensity of normal sunlight that falls on earth. But because it is a low-energy, non-ionizing wavelength, it is not as dangerous as sunlight with its high energy ultraviolet rays. At the rectenna, the energy is reconverted and sent via the existing electrical grid. Such satellites would necessitate a fleet of re-useable space planes, and as a consequence of economies of scale, reduce the cost of space access a hundred fold, enabling many other applications.2 It is estimated that <span style="text-decoration: none;">one kilometre-wide band of geo-synchronous earth orbit can produce solar flux to match as much as the total amount of energy produced from all the different recoverable oil reserves on Earth</span>. The idea was promoted by none other than Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam first at the Aeronautical Society of India (AeSI) and later again at a press conference in Washington DC last year. The initiative is now titled as the Kalam-NSS (National Space Society) Energy Initiative. The Kalam-NSS initiative is an India-US partnership taken up by individuals with long-term expertise in the space realm. Some of the key people involved are, in addition to Dr. Kalam, Mark Hopkins, CEO of the US-based National Space Society and John Mankins, President of the Space Power Association and a veteran of NASA. On the Indian side, there seems to be some official involvement due to the involvement of Dr. T.K. Alex, who is the Director of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Satellite Centre, Bangalore and leader of the Chandrayan-I project. Speaking in New Delhi in November last year, Dr. Kalam said that &quot;<span style="text-decoration: none;">by 2050</span>, <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">even if we use every available energy resource</span></em> <span style="text-decoration: none;">we have,</span> clean and dirty, <span style="text-decoration: none;">conventional and alternative, solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, coal, oil, and gas, the world will fall short of the energy we need by 66%. There is an answer.</span> An answer for both the developed and developing countries. <span style="text-decoration: none;">This is a solar energy source that is</span> close to <em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">infinite</span></em>, an energy source that produces no carbon emissions, <span style="text-decoration: none;">an energy source that can reach the most distant villages of the world, and</span> an energy source that <span style="text-decoration: none;">can turn countries into net energy exporter</span>.&quot;3 According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the worldwide demand for primary energy increases by 55 per cent between 2005 and 2030 - 1.8 per cent hike per year on average; and for India, the demand is expected to more than double by 2030, growing at 3.6 per cent rate per year.4 With energy demand growing rapidly, <span style="text-decoration: none;">the SBSP option offers huge opportunities</span>. Such an option will also be reportedly a cleaner energy option. This option would also significantly augment India’s capabilities in the space domain, which will have far-reaching positive spin-offs in the ever-changing security environment in Asia. This will bring the much-desired focus on the question of technology transfer between India and the US, Japan and Israel.<br />

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, the purpose, obstacles and issues in bringing space solar power to earth are discussed. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">The present congruence of international interest in renewable energy sources</span> and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">provide a window of opportunity to bring about Space Solar Power </span>in synergy with the development of clean renewable power on earth. The policy initiatives advanced in Europe for comparable solar power grid project are discussed. The <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">special features of the space power grid</span> are presented, and shown to <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">provide an excellent vehicle for global collaboration</span>. While substantial technical challenges remain, it is shown that <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">there are viable paths for</span> these challenges, as well as for the economics and public/ <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">international collaboration needed to make Space Solar Power available to humanity</span>. The public <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">policy initiatives needed for renewable energy, are seen to be acceptable in many nations. Security concerns</span> that appear to pose formidable obstacles <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">are</span> cited as also <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">posing unprecedented opportunities for wel-controlled collaboration between nations, through the participation of personnel who are cleared at the individual level, and</span> through <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">sequestering of technologies</span> particular to the project as done in the European Space Agency’s projects. The European TRANS-CP project is cited as a relevant current initiative to develop suitable policy.<br />

<strong><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia,serif;">Smith ’08</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> (M.V.,- Lt. Col, PhD student in the strategic studies program under Professor Colin Gray at the University of Reading in the UK, winner of the National Space Society’s 2008 Space Pioneer Award, Chief of Future Concepts (Dream Works) the Pentagon “Weaponization, Environmental Risk, and Multinational Approaches”)</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">“Your concern about weaponization of the system and environmental risks are proper and deserve solid answers. For the answers (and a whole bunch of other great information) let me point you to a special edition of Ad Astra magazine produced by the National Space Society. If you look on page 29 you’ll see the answers as to why space-based solar power satellites cannot be weaponized. Let me add to that list the following items: The DoD will not own or operate SBSP satellites. Energy production and distribution is outside of its Title X authority. In my opinion the DoD merely wants to be a customer of safe, clean energy and is most comfortable purchasing its energy from commercial vendors, just as it does today. The interest shown by the National Security Space Office (NSSO) in hosting the work done by the Space-Based Solar Power Study Group was largely because NASA does not do energy and the DoE does not do space. In other words, it was a ball being dropped along organizational lines. The security-related interest of the NSSO as it stepped in to host the study was three fold: Provide more energy sources to hopefully alleviate energy competition as a trigger for war between the major powers in the 21st Century Achieve American energy independence from foreign oil suppliers who attract US vital interests in areas and with peoples with whom we really would prefer to interact with in ways other than a dependent customer-supplier relationship. Provide a source of clean energy that provides America with broader options regarding carbon contamination and clean-up, as well as improved ability to make progress on treaties such as Kyoto. Simple inspections of the waveguides for either laser or microwave transmitters on the satellites can easily verify that the beam cannot be focused narrowly to create a weapons effect. Such inspections can and likely will be conducted at time of insurance inspection, licensing, and registration before launch. International inspectors would be welcome and encouraged. The goal is to have international corporations own and operate these satellites and provide power to international customers–that’s the key to defense of these huge birds–deterrence by mutual defense through broad international ownership and international customership–an attack on a satellite is an attack against all. As for environmental safety, especially when transmitting power into disaster areas and feeding power to forward bases, I envision spreading the several kilometer in diameter rectifying antenna on air bases or other relatively secure areas in the theater of operations and using ground broadcasting from there to the forward forces, first responders, or relief workers. That way we keep the beam from space very broad and desaturated. No way do we want ANY accusation of this being a weapon. Keep in mind that there are two forms of power broadcasting that can be done from satellites. The first form is by microwave at 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz. These are the same frequencies that are used by internet wifi, cordless phones, and blue tooth. Since the beam is fairly well focused on the rectifying antenna we will prevent interference with those systems. In addition, the intensity of a cellular telephone placed next to the head delivers more radiation to the user than space-based solar power possibly can. The second form of power transmission from space is by laser at 1.0 microns (silicon) or 0.86 microns (Galium Arsinide). Laser transmissions are obviously more focused than microwave, but still must be spread to prevent overheating of the system, which also removes the risk of weaponization. As for multinational approaches, when it comes to space, government-led multinational ventures are risky for a very strange and almost counterintuitive reason. The International Space Station (ISS) is a case in point. We assembled it with our very best allies and partners, but everybody got their feelings hurt in the process. In my opinion, it is far less likely that we will cooperate on such projects government-to-government in the near future because of the miserable experience of the ISS. Everybody was waiting for various governments to cut their red tape and stood around tensely waiting for last-minute funding and various approvals for go-aheads. Budgets changed frequently which drove some dramatic redesigns that impacted several other players. As a result, the project had all the joy of loaning money to relatives with gambling problems. I personally believe that in order to make space-based solar power a reality that business must lead the way. However, government does have a role. Governments should conduct some R&amp;D to improve efficiencies inherent to the system, remove bureaucratic barriers, and fund experiments to incrementally buy down some of the risk that business must take on. Examples include increasing the efficiencies of solar cells, lowering the cost and increasing the turnaround rate for launch vehicles, advancing the development of an international space traffic control system, securing the orbital parking slots and frequency allowances for these satellites, and conducting concept demonstrators. It is also my opinion that it is best if commercial companies take government research and lead the development effort for space-based solar power, and then own and operate such systems. In the first instance, they partner more broadly and far easier than governments do. Take a Boeing aircraft for example. Nearly 40% of the components on the latest Boeing aircraft are made by Airbus. Conversely, nearly 40% of the components on the latest Airbus aircraft are made by Boeing. That did not take massive government negotiations. Business is international by its very nature. Take a look at the products in your home. They are likely a hodgepodge of gadgets with parts made all over the world and assembled somewhere else. It’s nothing personal, it’s just business. The problem with government leadership is that it often gets personal. Best of all, when business is enabled to get the job done, they do so on their own dime, not the taxpayer’s. I like it when the taxpayers get a break. I want space-based solar power in the worst way, but not on the backs of the taxpayer, and only when the business case is sufficiently made that industry can profitably sustain the effort over the long run. We must avoid the fits and starts in industry that did such great damage to the overall space industry in the 1990s when wild enthusiasm collided with reality on several projects. In the end, I want the commercial sector to do it, and I want my government to clear the obstacles, such as ITAR (which I hate with a passion), out of the way so Americans can work with their international business partners to start bending the steel to make it happen! Space-Based Solar Power is a huge undertaking. I need fleets of reusable rockets and spaceplanes to get ‘er done. Since these birds MUST be launched into a prograde orbit, I need lots and lots of lift coming out of Florida and hopefully other domestic launch sites to make it happen. That said, current sites cannot accommodate the full compliment of launches that I will need without massive expansion. I will need launches from international partners as well. If led by American industry, this will make America the hub of commercial space launch once again–with the busiest launch industry in the world. Think jobs, jobs, jobs. The shuttle is peanuts compared to this project. I want to hit on the fact that space-based solar power transcends other projects because it crosses the lines of 6 major policy areas; Energy, Environment, Commerce, Space, Education, and Defense. Every dollar spent on SBSP addresses six sets of policies. Where else can government and the business sector collaborate to get a 6-to-1 return on investment for our future? As you see, there is no bureaucratic home for SBSP inside any single government organization. Perhaps this is another argument why this is best done in the business sector.</span><br />
