It is time to establish a modern, ……. one of the most memorable dates in world history.
Climate change disproportionately affects people of color worldwide --- voting aff disrupts this cycle in favor of a more just vision of the world that holds the US accountable for its flawed policies and rectifies flawed policies that caused this situation --- the impact is extinction

It is now known unequivocally …….here at home in the global North.
A pragmatic shift to develop renewable energy technologies is essential to achieving climate justice for marginalized groups --- it alleviates millions of deaths worldwide, while reducing the risk of catastrophic climate change --- only our pragmatic policy proposal can solve --- open-ended local activism fails to deliver, while distracting from more effective solutions
