NEW AFF. Bye bye Lifton :(


Turkey is in possession of US nuclear weapons whose sole purpose is deterring and securing populations. These //<span style="font-style: normal;">make nuclear catastrophe thinkable by lowering the firebreak distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons, proving the failure of deterrence policies. This is part of a larger theology of security that attempts to eliminate difference constructed by our own narratives and makes annihilation inevitable</span>//

The United States federal government should remove all of its nuclear weapons from the Republic of Turkey.

Endorse the affirmative as a stance in opposition to nuclearism and the security paradigm. The assumptions we have in regards to reductions to the nuclear complex should be never ending and be genuinely opposed to notions of aggressive and benign securitization

This debate is key to enter into the political arena and dismantle the threats posed by the nuclear priesthood to reclaim the state from those who delegitimize it. The plan acts to interrogate the normalization of securitization by means of nuclear and conventional weapons by the US

The discourse of nuclear security diminishes our moral capacities and bankrupts the language of international politics of all ethics. Our opposition to the specific discourse surrounding the nuclear weapons in Turkey is key to raise societal consciousness and solve

The plan opens up the possibility for holy communities â€“ in rejection of the security paradigm, or an apologetic theology, we reject a methodology of domination and allow for an alienated theology. This opens up the possibility for the transformative impact of the experience of others and rejects pretension towards certainty in our own narratives which foreclose the possibility for truth in difference and pushes us closer to annihilation

Nuclearism perpetuates a logic by which we unquestioningly succumb to the mythic power of the bomb as an excuse for ethical engagement. This technical mystification forces upon us a doubling whereby our preparation for the final apocalypse assures our own destruction

And, nuclear weapons are not a guarantor of peace, but a psychological state that keeps us on the brink of annihilation. These desensitizing mind tricks keep us from realizing our condition. The violent securitization of nuclear policies forecloses the possibility for true peace because of a constant fear of a certain adversary
