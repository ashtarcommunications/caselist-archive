**C) Link - The enemy is a necessary precursor to war. The aff seeks to eradicate enemies in a never-ending mission to establish a peaceful utopia – this destroys the value to life. We love the enemy because he drives us to battle.**

**E) The alternative is to love war.**
**Instead of going to war in the name of peace, we should enter war for war’s own sake. This means setting aside our fear and distaste for conflict so we can imagine ourselves embroile cd in beautiful strife.**
**Also, the alternative comes first and is a prerequisite to aff solvency because war is the primary psychological task that shapes all of our notions about society – unless we come to terms with the war in each of us, our desire for war will lash out and push us closer and closer to annihilation.**
