Status quo implementation of transportation infrastructure is profoundly racist and exclusionary.

Contemporary urbanization processes are strongly shaped by the logic and policies of neoliberalism. Neoliberal ideology advocates the extension of market-based principles in the arena of the state in order to `liberate' both public services from so-called `state inefficiencies' and capital `squandered' by taxation that could be more profitability deployed by private actors. Accordingly, neoliberal regulatory frameworks promote market discipline over the state, usually achieved by such policy mechanisms as lowering taxes on businesses and the wealthy, shrinking or dismantling public services, and subjecting public services to the logic of markets through public - private partnerships or outright privatization. The creative-destructive processes of neoliberal state strategy reconfigure the territorial organization of accumulation, and consequently produce new forms of uneven geographic development.

The literature on neoliberal urbanization establishes the broader processes of political, economic, and social restructuring and rescaling in response to declining profitability of the Fordist accumulation regime (Brenner and Theodore, 2002; Peck and Tickell, 2002). The roll-back of Fordist regulatory configurations and the roll-out of neoliberalization transformed the sociospatial hierarchy of regulatory frameworks with the nation-state as the center of state regulation to a more multiscalar regulatory framework articulated by the interactions of global, national, and local scales (Brenner and Theodore, 2002). Cities emerged as crucial sites of neoliberalization and institutional restructuring. In the United States, neoliberal policies restructured Fordist forms of territorial organization by devolving the relatively centralized, managerial -redistributive system of urban planning and financing at the federal level to subregional states and municipalities (Eisinger, 1998; Harvey, 1989). Thus localities were forced to finance local infrastructure, transit, housing, and other forms of collective consumption on their own or abandon them altogether. By starving cities of revenues, neoliberal state restructuring rendered states and municipalities more dependent upon locally generated tax revenues as well as intensifying intercity competition (Harvey, 1989).

Cities starved by neoliberal state restructuring responded to their fiscal troubles by adopting entrepreneurial norms, practices, and institutional frameworks. Entre-preneurial municipal governments prioritize policies that create a good business climate and competitive advantages for businesses (Harvey, 1989; Smith, 2002) by “reconstituting social welfare provisions as anticompetitive costs'', and by implementing ``an extremely narrow urban policy repertoire based on capital subsidies, place promotion, supply side intervention, central-city makeovers and local boosterism'' (Peck and Tickell, 2002, pages 47 ^ 48). In effect, neoliberal urbanization encourages local governments to retreat from social redistribution and integrated social welfare policies in favor of bolstering business activity (Brenner and Theodore, 2002; Peck and Tickell, 2002; Swyngedouw et al, 2002). As a consequence, entrepreneurial mayors emerged in the 1980s to forge alliances between government and business leaders (what I refer to as the `global city growth machine') under the banner of urban revitalization (Judd and Simpson, 2003). City space is mobilized ``as an arena both for market-oriented economic growth and for elite consumption practices'' (Brenner and Theodore, 2002, page 21). The abandonment of Fordist planning, privileging a more integrated urban form in favor of selective investment in privileged places, has resulted in what scholars have variously deemed as a fragmented, polarized, splintered, or quartered urbanity (Graham and Marvin, 2001; Marcuse and van Kempen, 2000; Sassen 1991; Swyngedouw et al, 2002).

The business-friendly policies and practices pursued by entrepreneurial urban governments must also be understood in relation to the global reorganization of production. Global cities emerged as the command and control nodes of the global economy, where multinational headquarters, producer services, and FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) firms cluster (Sassen, 1991). To lure multinational corporate headquarters, producer services, professional ^ managerial workers, and tourists to their city, municipal governments recreate urban space by prioritizing megaprojects and infrastructure that help businesses gain competitive advantages and keep them connected within global networks as well as providing financing and amenities for gentrification, tourism, and cultural consumption (Brenner and Theodore, 2002; Fainstein, 2008; Graham and Marvin, 2001; Peck and Tickell, 2002; Swyngedouw et al, 2002). These urban development strategies are ideologically and discursively legitimized by the global city growth machine as necessary for `global city' or `world-class city' formation (McGuirk, 2004; Wilson, 2004).

Public transportation policy is one dimension of spatial restructuring deployed by entrepreneurial governments to create place-based competitive advantages for global capital. Transportation represents a fixed, place-based geographic element where the local and the global interact; where global processes shape local geographies and where local politics shape global networks. As Keil and Young (2008) suggest, transportation should now be considered in relation to globalized trade and economic networks and consumption-oriented patterns of everyday life. Growth demands in cities experiencing gentrification, the development of luxury consumption spaces, and a surge of tourism have placed pressure on local agencies to expand airports, roads, and rail and public transit capacities. Large-scale urban redevelopment plans have made a comeback as city planners conceive of megaprojects that concentrate new public transit investment in the revalorized core (Fainstein, 2008; Keil and Young, 2008; Swyngedouw et al, 2002).

Air transportation has become the leading form of global connectivity, influencing the decisions of global, national, and regional elites to create air-transportation infrastructure (Cidell, 2006; Erie, 2004; Keil and Young, 2008; Phang, 2007). For instance, there is a growing network of world-class cities (Shanghai, London, and Tokyo) that enables air travelers to connect seamlessly from one global city core to the next, with direct express train service from the downtown business core to the city's international airports (Graham and Marvin, 2001). These specialized public transit systems more closely integrate a city into global markets, thereby making the city more attractive for business activities (Brenner and Theodore, 2002; Graham, 2000). The resulting “premium network spaces'' are ``geared to the logistical and exchange demands of foreign direct investors, tourist spaces or socioeconomically affluent groups'' (Graham and Marvin, 2001, page 100). Interactions with the surrounding residential districts are carefully managed by filtering `proper' users through nonstop services or prohibitively expensive fares. In addition, premium transport services tend to be bundled with upscale shopping centers, entertainment spectacles, hotels, or office spaces to form a giant, integrated bubble of luxury. Subsequently, sociospatial relations are reconfigured as premium infrastructure bypasses devalorized places and exclude economically disadvantaged users from accessing the transit service. The neoliberal trend towards premium public transportation deployed for the purposes of constructing competitive advantages in the global capitalist system privileges profit making for capital, or exchange-value purposes, and not necessarily for everyday use, or use-value purposes (Keil and Young, 2008; Logan and Molotch, 1987).

In order to finance new urban transit projects, cash-strapped entrepreneurial governments are increasingly entering into long-term partnerships with the private sector, or public- private partnerships (PPPs), in which the public sector pays for services and infrastructure delivered by the private sector (Phang, 2007; Siemiatycki, 2006; Solin¬o and Vassallo, 2009). In studies of PPPs used both for large-scale urban redevelopment projects and urban rail projects, scholars have noticed that planning agencies are increasingly favoring infrastructure projects favoring affluent segments of the population that have greater potential for profitability rather than delivering the largest public benefit (Fainstein, 2008; Siemiatycki, 2006; Swyngedouw et al, 2002).

By privileging market-based metrics of efficiency, entrepreneurial administrations have profoundly changed the function of public transportation. In the Fordist era, public transportation involved a modicum of centralized planning aimed at industrial development, mitigating labor costs and alleviating the effects of uneven development produced by the highly subsidized highway system (Grengs, 2004; Weiner, 1999). Neoliberal statecraft abandons the Fordist strategy of territorial redistribution mobilizing public transportation to enhance economically disadvantaged groups' access to the city. In its place, socially regressive neoliberal practices favor market-oriented growth and elite consumption patterns (Boschken, 2002; Grengs, 2004; Young and Keil, 2010). Thus, public transportation service has become a battleground in the global city growth machine's revanchist claims to the city (Smith, 1996).

As municipalities sink their meager financial resources into lumpy global city public transportation infrastructure, residents outside the myopic global city vision are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain development dollars for their communities (Judd, 2003). In this regard, entrepreneurial public transportation policies are reshaping the contours of race-based social exclusion. As real estate developers and creative class workers mobilize their political and financial power to outcompete lower income groups for rights to the (central) city, they are pushing working-class and minority residents to the margins of the city and into the devalorized inner-suburban ring where affordable housing can be found but public transit service is meager (Dreier et al, 2004). These deepening patterns of exclusion are also reinforced by policies dismantling and disbursing public housing out of the central area and away from public transit. And yet, poor urban African-Americans are more structurally dependent on public transportation to access jobs, services, and cultural amenities (Bullard and Johnson, 1997; Kasarda, 1989). In a more egalitarian policy-making environment, public transportation policy can be a means to reduce the effects of hyper sociospatial racial segregation (Wilson, 1990). However, in the neoliberal approach to urban planning and economic development, public transportation is but one of a constellation of institutions that create and reproduce spatialized racial inequalities.





The legacy of racism has been embedded in our transportation infrastructure – public transportation is under funded while a culture of suburbia has reinforced racial hierarchies – blacks and other minorities are trapped within the urban ghettos and unable

The legacy of anti-public transportation policies continues today.237 Public transportation continues to be under-funded in all areas of the country, meaning that those without cars are relegated to inconvenient, often dirty, and generally unreliable transportation.238 Though public transportation is insufficiently funded and substandard in general, the U.S. bus systems, which generally serve lower income populations of color, are particularly poorly run and under-funded.239 In many urban areas, blacks make up the vast majority of the riders on these inadequate bus systems, mandating that they disproportionately bear the brunt of these seemingly innocuous transportation funding decisions.240 There are three distinct avenues through which racist transportation policies have preserved and naturalized race in the United States. First, transportation in the United States is divided into a two class system— the car-owners over the non-car-owners, replicating the whiteover- black hierarchy and marking the “haves and have nots.”241 Second, access to the spaces where power and wealth are accumulated in American society is limited by the precondition of personal car ownership. 242 This limited access protects white privilege from incursions by car-less blacks, insulating whiteness from the dangers of blackness, and reestablishing privilege as marked by exclusivity—the absence of blacks.243 Third, transportation policy has created highway border vacuums, which reinforce the economic, political, and social isolation that underlies the construction of blackness by physically cutting off black neighborhoods from the rest of society through highway siting decisions. 244 Like the slaves relegated to slave quarters on plantations, the resulting urban underclass is kept separate from and foreign to the white privilege of the suburbs.245 The consequence of this economic, social, and political isolation has become the basis of “natural” racial difference in American society.246 1. The Hierarchy of Transportation In our two-tiered transportation system, the first-class citizens are people who own their own cars or who have access to private automobile transportation; the second-class citizens are people who do not own their own cars.247 By and large, people who do not own their means of transportation in the United States are poor, black, and female; 248 in contrast, those who do own a car are more likely to be middle- class or wealthy, white, and male.249 Membership in the first class provides a broad range of benefits and is a requisite for full economic, social, and political citizenship in this country.250 Membership in the second class dooms members to a life of riding unreliable public transportation, limiting their economic, political, and social mobility.251 This dichotomy’s power lies in its equation of car ownership with whiteness, mobility, and success.252 Because “[r]ace is the mark of dispossession,” carlessness leads to joblessness and limited mobility—synonymous with blackness.253 In contrast, car ownership in American society is equated with wealth, success, and power—the characteristics that are used to define whiteness.254 Car ownership is a fundamental element of the American dream, an indication of status and of one’s place within the racial and economic hierarchy.255 It is culturally understood in America that “[t]he wealthier a household is, the more vehicles it owns.”256 Automobile ownership is so closely tied to success that to be carless in many parts of the country is to be without an identity, to be invisible.257 Across economic classes, whites are more likely to own cars and therefore gain membership into the powerful and wealthy car owning class than blacks.258 In urban areas, thirty percent of black families do not own cars, while only six percent of white households do not.259 This carlessness is dispossession.260 As car ownership has become a requisite for achieving the American dream, our economic and social system has been designed to function most efficiently for the benefit of the car owning (white) majority. 261 Car owners have access to the best jobs, many of which are located in the car-dependent suburbs.262 Car owners are granted unfettered agency and privacy in their transportation choices because they are not dependent on public transportation to carry them to and from their chosen destinations.263 This mobility and agency translates into increased earning power and integration into the economy and society.264 As the suburbs became synonymous with personal automobile transportation, inner cities became enclaves of carlessness, where “for millions of inner city residents, public transportation is the only means of getting around.”265 Excluded from the whiteness of car-ownership, riders of public transportation are disproportionately persons of color.266 Thus, ridership on public transportation has become a racialized and stigmatized exercise, reproducing the white-over-black hierarchy through transportation modes.267 Because it has been made black, public transportation—in particular, the bus—has become “a largely reviled figure within the American cultural imagination.”268 In contemporary American society, not only is “auto ownership . . . associated with wealth, [and] style . . . [but] transit use, rail, biking, and walking are seen as . . . dangerous and degrading activities.”269 Beyond degrading, ridership on public transit closes the door to full participation by limiting the mobility and agency of carless blacks who depend on unreliable and inconvenient buses.270 The “bus system effectively enforces the racial . . . hierarchies that underlie suburban ‘manifest destiny.’”271 Thus, public bus ridership has both created and perpetuated a white-over-black racial hierarchy based on a selfreinforcing cycle: blacks live in the inner city; they can’t afford cars because they don’t have good jobs; they don’t have good jobs because they are economically and physically isolated from good suburban jobs.272 Because inner city blacks cannot get to good suburban jobs so that they can afford a car and become fully integrated into American social and economic society, they remain stuck in the ghetto, unemployed, undereducated, and increasingly isolated economically and culturally.273 “Thus, the bus system—conveyance of the raced body, the transient, the low-income, the immigrant—has metamorphosed . . . into an emblem of the postapocalyptic vision of Third World dystopia.”274 2. The Transportation Hierarchy’s Role in Racing American Society Racing bus ridership has dire consequences for blacks living in urban neighborhoods; “many young African-Americans faced with substantial transportation obstacles in addition to the normal difficulties associated with beginning work become discouraged about their chances to make it in a traditional occupation. The consequences in some cases—crime, drug abuse, sexually transmitted disease, and teenage pregnancy—are disastrous.”275 Additionally, the consequences fuel the persistent cultural construction of the naturalness of race by creating new marks of racial inferiority; in the public consciousness, blackness becomes associated with, and then defined by, this economically isolated ghetto culture.276 The transportation hierarchy polices access to enclaves of power and privilege by limiting entry to those with private vehicles.277 Whiteness itself may be considered property, in that one of the essential property rights is the right to exclude—to exclude blacks from the privilege of whiteness.278 Indeed, the suburbs were popular not just because they offered mobile whites their very own quarter-acre of the American dream, but because their auto-dependency ensured that access would also be limited.279 Restricted access was key because the creation and maintenance of homogenous white neighborhoods increased and protected white privilege.280 The privatization of travel allowed residential segregation to become institutionally entrenched in American culture to an unprecedented extent by excluding undesirable elements from desirable spaces.281 What is most significant about residential settlement patterns in the United States “is not that some whites refused to live among nonwhites, but the extent to which social status and a desired quality of life are predicated on homogenous whiteness.”282 For example, in the 1960s some suburban communities outside of Atlanta “resisted MARTA [Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority] for fear it would bring blacks and the poor from the city to [the] outlying suburbs,” undermining the whiteness and privilege of their suburban communities.283 Limiting private transportation by race means that “[i]n transit, behind the wheel, alongside the center divider, the racial boundaries of cityhood could be preserved.”284 Even more importantly, however, racial boundaries could be preserved by limiting access to white suburban enclaves through private transportation.285 Finally, the transportation hierarchy compounds the economic, social, and political isolation of the ghetto.286 As vibrant black neighborhoods were demolished by whites who considered them less valuable than highway construction, the neighborhoods became socially isolated, plagued by gangs, arson, and crime.287 Congressman Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously used these consequences of racist transportation policies to justify the abandonment of black inner cities in a note to President Richard Nixon, suggesting that it was time to enact a policy of “benign neglect” toward the nation’s black inner cities.288 The Congressman’s suggestion underscores the way in which the consequences of racist transportation policies that sited highways in black urban areas were used to prove the naturalness of race and to justify continued racism at all levels of government. The economic and social devastation that inevitably followed in the wake of federal, state, and local highway siting policies thus contributed to the reification of race in American society by coloring and shaping the idea of a particular subordinate black identity in diametric opposition to a superior suburban white identity.



Increasing public transit is key – remedies past racial injustices and leads to a disruption of the culture of suburbia

Seymore ‘5 [Winter/2005, Sean B. Seymore is a PhD at Notre Dame College. “Set the Captives Free! Transit Inequity in Urban Centers, and the Laws and Policies Which Aggravate the Disparity,” George Mason University Civil Rights Law Journal http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=dabf6f5de210596884f4b19194a2e566&csvc=le&cform=byCitation&_fmtstr=FULL&docnum=1&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzV-zSkAz&_md5=458f242f692ed378721e0b9d498010eb]

Thus far, this Article has explored the roots of transit inequity and its detrimental consequences on the urban core. Although the history of transit inequity mirrors the growth of mass transit and highway construction in America, efforts to achieve equity will be complex. All major transportation authorities face the difficult decisions that Terrance Reagan describes. 357 Multimodal transit agencies, including the MBTA and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, have drafted mission statements which explicitly reveal the complexity: We are committed to being an integral part of the Washington metropolitan area by ensuring the best in safe, reliable, cost-effective and responsive transit services, by promoting regional mobility and by contributing toward the social, economic and environmental well-being of our community. 358 The balancing of interests that Reagan describes may point to a common goal, or may in fact be irreconcilable. The disparity may actually lie in social and economic forces that eclipse transportation. A. Is Race the Real Issue? The link between race and transportation policies and practices is inescapable. But does modern-day transit inequity create or exacerbate the racial divide, or is it simply a manifestation of America's race problem? This Article shows that all three are likely true. Highway construction and restrictive federal funding programs laid the foundation for the disparity. 359 Commuter rail lines exist because, without them, choice riders may abandon mass transit. Since capital costs for rail service far eclipse those for bus lines, 360 the choice riders can often make [*111] sway transit expenditures. Choice riders, therefore, can determine "what they get" and "where it goes." 361 This Article has shown that captive riders often do not "get what they pay for." 362 Government policies allow low-income riders of the urban core to cross-subsidize transit fares for commuter rail. 363 With one major exception, 364 cross-subsidization has survived Title VI scrutiny because the courts have deferred to the business judgment of transit agencies. 365 All disparate impacts on low-income minorities are not rooted in racism. 366 But, at the very least, transit authorities clearly make race-conscious decisions. These include: (1) where to place routes; (2) which neighborhoods will be served by a particular route; (3) who gets trains and who gets buses; and (4) which type of vehicle (diesel or CNG buses) will be assigned to a particular route or location. These decisions are not purely economic; choice riders "get what they want," and captive riders "get what they get." 367 "White fear" is real, 368 and transit agencies know it. White discomfort with black riders can be traced back to the Plessy era, where racial separation in transportation promoted "public order, peace, and comfort." 369 The same notion persists in public transportation today. Transit agencies know that whites and blacks often cannot share a bus [*112] or train due to racism, elitism, "class differences," a perceived lack of safety, discomfort, resentment, or "white guilt." 370 Justice Clarence Thomas has argued that Plessy receives little scholarly attention, possibly because of its "complete rejection by our society." 371 Although we have rejected Jim Crow laws, 372 it is not clear that we have completely abandoned Plessy's precepts. For example, many transit routes are racially identifiable as "black" or "white." 373 White passengers will stand on a crowded train rather than sit in an empty seat next to a young black professional. 374 B. What Can Be Done? Transit agencies do not have a duty to fix America's race problem, but they should not aggravate the disparity. Public transportation is at a crossroads; if transit authorities cannot equitably achieve their goals, then the agencies should rethink their mission. Nevertheless, transit agencies can make policy changes that seek to achieve equity. First, transit authorities should assign equipment fairly. As the agencies begin to replace old diesel bus fleets, the urban core should receive a fair proportion of clean fuel buses. Some commentators, such as Professor Litman, would even argue that the urban core should receive a higher proportion of clean-fuel buses in order to compensate for overall inequity and past environmental harm. 375 Asthma rates in Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan may decrease when the MBTA replaces its diesel fleet with CNG buses. 376 Second, transit authorities can attract more suburban riders without constructing new rail lines. 377 Although some suburbanites will always prefer to drive, some will use mass transit if, on balance, mass [*113] transit becomes cost-effective and convenient. 378 TEA-21 authorized employer transit subsidies, which can attract wealthier riders out of their cars. 379 The employer can deduct these costs as business expenses, and the employees need not report the subsidy as taxable income. 380 Transportation policy in America must be reevaluated. Since the birth of the Interstate Era, transportation policies have been narrowly focused, which in turn have placed a disparate burden on the urban core. Transportation agencies must realize that the urban core should not bear the burden for improving suburban life. VI. Conclusion Although the story of transit inequity often appears to be a collection of anecdotes that reveal the darker side of America's past, this Article has sought to show that the disparities are rooted in the law, beginning with Plessy and continuing with Interstate Era legislation which benefited highways and suburbs at the expense of city transit and the urban core. These laws, combined with government-supported discriminatory housing practices, have created an urban core with low-income residents who are transit dependent. This Article has sought to show that transit inequity extends beyond "train is better than bus." Admittedly transit authorities seek to achieve formidable goals while navigating through a network of regulations and statutes. This Article has shown that the agencies, in exercising their business judgment, tend to placate choice riders at the expense of the captive riders of the inner city. Although the courts must allow transit [*114] authorities reasonable discretion in allocating resources, the courts must insist that the agencies operate within the law and honor their commitments.



The transportation decision-making process ignores minorities and only benefits the wealthy, educated population

Bullard ‘2K [Spring 2000, Robert D.-; “TRANSPORTATION EQUITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY: A Newsletter of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University”, http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/atep%20newsletter%20spr00sm.PDF]

Procedural Inequity. Attention is directed to the process by which transportation decisions may or may not be carried out in a uniform, fair, and consistent manner with involvement of diverse public stakeholders. Here, the question is do the rules apply equally to everyone? Geographic Inequity. Transportation decisions may have distributive impacts (positive and negative) that are geographic and spatial, such as rural vs. urban vs. central city. Some communities are physically located on the “wrong side of the tracks” and often receive substandard services. Environmental justice concerns revolve around the extent that transportation systems address outcomes (diversity and quality of services, resources and investments, facilities and infrastructure, access to primary employment centers, etc.) that disproportionately favor one geographic area or spatial location over another. Social Inequity. The distribution of transportation benefits and burdens are not randomly distributed across population groups. Generally, transportation amenities (benefits) accrue to the wealthier and more educated segment of society, while transportation disamenities (burdens) fall disproportionately on people of color and individuals at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. Intergenerational equity issues are also subsumed under this category. For example, the impacts and consequences of some transportation decisions may reach into several generations. Transportation decision-making--whether at the federal, regional, state, or local level--often mirrors the power arrangements of the dominant society and its institutions. Some transportation policies distribute the costs in a regressive pattern while providing disproportionate benefits for individuals who fall at the upper end of the education and income scale. All transportation modes are not created equal. Federal transportation policies, taxing structure, and funding schemes have contributed to the inequity between the various transportation modes, e.g., private automobile, rail, buses, air, etc. Central cities and suburbs are not equal. They often compete for scarce resources. One need not be a rocket scientist to predict the outcome between affluent suburbs and their less affluent central city competitors. Freeways are the lifelines for suburban commuters, while millions of central city residents are dependent on public transportation as their primary mode of travel. But cuts in mass transit subsidies and fare hikes have reduced access to essential social services and economic activities.



Racism must be rejected in every instance.

Memmi ’00 [2000, Albert is a Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ Unv. Of Paris, Albert-; RACISM, translated by Steve Martinot, pp.163-165]

The struggle against racism will be long, difficult, without intermission, without remission, probably never achieved, yet for this very reason, it is a struggle to be undertaken without surcease and without concessions. One cannot be indulgent toward racism. One cannot even let the monster in the house, especially not in a mask. To give it merely a foothold means to augment the bestial part in us and in other people which is to diminish what is human. To accept the racist universe to the slightest degree is to endorse fear, injustice, and violence. It is to accept the persistence of the dark history in which we still largely live. It is to agree that the outsider will always be a possible victim (and which [person] man is not [themself] himself an outsider relative to someone else?). Racism illustrates in sum, the inevitable negativity of the condition of the dominated; that is it illuminates in a certain sense the entire human condition. The anti-racist struggle, difficult though it is, and always in question, is nevertheless one of the prologues to the ultimate passage from animality to humanity. In that sense, we cannot fail to rise to the racist challenge. However, it remains true that one’s moral conduct only emerges from a choice: one has to want it. It is a choice among other choices, and always debatable in its foundations and its consequences. Let us say, broadly speaking, that the choice to conduct oneself morally is the condition for the establishment of a human order for which racism is the very negation. This is almost a redundancy. One cannot found a moral order, let alone a legislative order, on racism because racism signifies the exclusion of the other and his or her subjection to violence and domination. From an ethical point of view, if one can deploy a little religious language, racism is “the truly capital sin.”fn22 It is not an accident that almost all of humanity’s spiritual traditions counsel respect for the weak, for orphans, widows, or strangers. It is not just a question of theoretical counsel respect for the weak, for orphans, widows or strangers. It is not just a question of theoretical morality and disinterested commandments. Such unanimity in the safeguarding of the other suggests the real utility of such sentiments. All things considered, we have an interest in banishing injustice, because injustice engenders violence and death. Of course, this is debatable. There are those who think that if one is strong enough, the assault on and oppression of others is permissible. But no one is ever sure of remaining the strongest. One day, perhaps, the roles will be reversed. All unjust society contains within itself the seeds of its own death. It is probably smarter to treat others with respect so that they treat you with respect. “Recall,” says the bible, “that you were once a stranger in Egypt,” which means both that you ought to respect the stranger because you were a stranger yourself and that you risk becoming once again someday. It is an ethical and a practical appeal – indeed, it is a contract, however implicit it might be. In short, the refusal of racism is the condition for all theoretical and practical morality. Because, in the end, the ethical choice commands the political choice. A just society must be a society accepted by all. If this contractual principle is not accepted, then only conflict, violence, and destruction will be our lot. If it is accepted, we can hope someday to live in peace. True, it is a wager, but the stakes are irresistible.



Racism and poverty are equivalent to an unending war or genocide every year of every decade worldwide.

Abu-Jamal ‘98 [September 19th, Mumia, award-winning PA journalist, http://www.flashpoints.net/mQuietDeadlyViolence.html]

We live, equally immersed, and to a deeper degree, in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging "structural' violence, of a kind that destroys human life with a breathtaking ruthlessness. Former Massachusetts prison official and writer, Dr. James Gilligan observes; By "structural violence" I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted by those who are above them. Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) are a function of the class structure; and that structure is itself a product of society's collective human choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting "structural" with "behavioral violence" by which I mean the non-natural deaths and injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide, suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on. --(Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New York: Vintage, 1996), 192.) This form of violence, not covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected media, is invisible to us and because of its invisibility, all the more insidious. How dangerous is it--really? Gilligan notes: [E]very fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths; and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews over a six-year period. This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world. [Gilligan, p. 196]

We now live in an age when the role of government is inevitably important whether we are referring to preschool education in Seattle or the aircraft industry in that area, whether we are talking about welfare in Detroit or the creaky, wavering automotive industry there. What we need so desperately is the assumption of responsibility at the highest levels in the public and private sectors to make a strong pitch for the elimination of the uglier aspects of the color line so that we can have a healthier, happier, even gentler society. We need to appreciate the importance of legislation, judicial decisions, and executive orders in setting the stage for eliminating the color line. Without them it is not possible for individuals or groups of individuals, however dedicated, to make a good-faith and successful effort to eliminate the color line. Yet we cannot expect too much of these public efforts, important as they are. These public efforts must be combined with private efforts to promote mutual respect and a willingness to make judgments of others based on what they have done and can do, and not on who they are. If we can somehow teach ourselves these lessons in human relations, perhaps we can take the first feeble steps toward creating the kind of community about which some of our forebears spoke and wrote, and the kind of nation about which so many of us have dreamed but never realized.



Conventional decisionmaking is rigged against the poor-only acting within the system can reform this.

Gannon and Liu 97 (Colin Gannon and Zhi Liu, Zhi Liu Lead is an infrastructure Specialist, East Asia and Pacific Region, World Bank, Beijing; Colin Gannon is senior transport economist at the World Bank, “Poverty and Transport”, September, 1997, http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTURBANTRANSPORT/Resources/twu-30.pdf)

Transport sector operations do have important direct impacts on the poor. In particular, some problems inherent in the transport project evaluation process and in transport market structures often adversely affect the poor more than the rich. Because these adverse impacts on the poor contribute to both relative poverty and absolute poverty, heightened awareness on these distributive impacts is very important for appreciating the contribution of the transport sector to poverty reduction. This awareness needs to be translated in systematic manner into the formulation of national transport policies and investment programs, and into the selection and design of transport development projects. Unfortunately, there have been very few studies of the distributive impact of transport in general, and transport operations in particular. The consequences for the poor of transport projects, external effects, and government regulations have not been adequately documented. 4.30 Conventional cost-benefit analysis does not take distributive impact into account and hence does not inform government decision-makers of the social groups that stand to gain and lose as a result of their decisions. Nor does it inform decision-makers of the effect of projects on poverty reduction. In addition, since cost-benefit analysis involves adding the gains and losses to all affected groups on the same basis, it may be argued that it involves a selection orientation against low-income groups. To overcome this orientation, one approach is to introduce distributional weights that assign different weights to money gains or losses to different income groups. In general, this approach is not appropriate. Distributional judgments should be resolved through political processes. However, these processes can be assisted in a rigorous way by extending the conventional cost-benefit analysis framework to cover distributional outcomes and to display this information in a balance sheet format as an adjunct to the conventional cost benefit analysis. Analysis of distributive outcomes can be difficult, however. The practical extent to which it can be undertaken needs to be judged carefully; for example, a strong(er) case prevails in situations where the distributive outcome is likely to differ significantly across alternatives, and especially where there is little difference in efficiency among alternatives.



The state is inevitable.

Thayer 2k [Assistant Professor of Political Science @ University of Minnesota-Duluth (Bradley A. “Bringing in Darwin: Evolutionary Theory, Realism, and International Politics” International Security, Vol. 25, No. 2. Autumn. JSTOR p. 135-136)]

Humans and other primates evolve a mental architecture to address the difficulties they encounter when in dominance hierarchies. As result of this, Wilson submits: "Human beings are absurdly easy to indoctrinate-they seek it." Three factors contribute to the ease of indoctrination. First, survival in a hostile world dictates membership in a group and produces a fear of ostracism from it. Second, acceptance of, or conformity to, a particular status quo lowers the risk of conflict in a dominance hierarchy. Third, conformity helps keep groups together. If group conformity becomes too weak, the group could fall apart and become extinct because of predation from one's own or another species. The consequences for the study of politics are great. Eibl-Eibesfeldt, Somit and Peterson, Wilson, and psychologist Donald Campbell, among others, suggest that humans readily give allegiance to the state, or embrace religion or ideologies such as liberalism or communism, because evolution has produced a need to belong to a dominance hierarchy. An overview of human history provides context. Much of it is a record of threats of force or wars to gain territory and resources.60 Political institutions, whether monarchies or aristocracies, and leaders such as Julius Caesar, Louis XIV, and Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid typify dominance hierarchies-as do the modern state and its many institutions, including government bureaucracies and the military.



Yes, the nation-state is not perfect, but refusal to reform ignores our best tools for resistance – abandonment of the state is naïve and dangerous.

Dussel, ‘11 [2011, Enrique Dussel, Professor of Philosophy at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, “From Critical Theory to the Philosophy of Liberation: Some Themes for Dialogue”, Transmodernity: Journal of Peripheral Cultural Production, http://escholarship.org/uc/item/59m869d2]

We should proceed in politics in the very same manner that Marx proceeded in economics: working on the level of macro-institutional feasibility. The “dissolution of the state” should be defined as a political postulate. To seek to bring this about empirically leads to the “anti-institutional fallacy,” and the impossibility of a critical, transformative politics. To say that we need to transform the world without exercising power through institutions – including the state (which we need to radically transform, but not eliminate) – is the fallacy into which Negri and Holloway fall. The presently given institutions, and even the particular state as a political macro-institution, are never perfect and always require transformation. But there are moments in which institutions become diachronically repressive in the extreme, in their final entropic moment. Hegemony – the consensus exercised over the “obedient” à la Weber's legitimate domination91 – gives rise to domination in the Gramscian sense. The state machinery, in the service of the economic interests of the dominant classes in the postcolonial metropolitan nations, become definitively repressive. The popular masses go on gaining consciousness in proportion to level of their oppression. This accumulation of power-to (potentia),93 which takes place partially in the exteriority of the structures of the particular state but within the “bosom of the people” (which is not without its contradictions), confronts the political institutions currently in force. It does so to “trans-form” them (not necessarily for reforms94, but only rarely for revolution95), not necessarily to destroy them (though it could if required by the postulates), but to use them and transform them according to its ends and according to the degree of correspondence to the permanence and extension of life and symmetrical democratic participation of the oppressed people. The anti-institutionalist believes that the destruction of the state represents an important victory on the path to revolution. This sort of destruction is irrational. They have confused the “dissolution of the state” as a postulate (empirically impossible, but functioning as a principle for strategic orientation) with its empirical negation. How are we to understand the postulate of the “dissolution of the state”? Right-wing anarchism – like that of Nozick – proposes the dissolution of the state or something close to it under the guise of the “minimal state.” The unhindered market produces equilibrium, especially in Hayek's formulation; for this, the minimal state needs only to destroy the monopolies that impede the free movement of the market. A union seeking a wage increase is a monopoly, because it places demands on the market that do not emanate from free competition. The duty of the state is therefore to dissolve the union. In the service of this total market definition, the process of globalization as controlled by transnational industrial and financial capital (not with hegemony, because this was lost in the move to the last-instance use: the violent coercion of military power), equally proposes the dissolution or weakening of the particular states in postcolonial peripheral nations. The postcolonial state – however much it may be dominated by the private bureaucracies of the transnational corporations which impose their own members onto the political bureaucracies of those states (and we see, for example, a Coca-Cola distributor as president96) – still represents the last possible resistance for oppressed peoples. To dissolve or substantially weaken their states is to take away their only possible defense. The second Iraq War represents a war against a particular postcolonial state that, however corrupt and dictatorial, nevertheless had a certain degree of sovereignty and self-determination which interposed some resistance to the appropriation of its petroleum by foreign companies. For all of this, it is tragic that a sector of the left coincides with the North American Empire – the home-state97 of the transnationals and the ultimate example of power based on its economic political-military complex – in dissolving the particular peripheral state. If Europeans alongside Habermas seemed as though they were dissolving the old particular state, it is for the strategic fortification of a Confederation of States in the European Union. In Latin America, if it were possible to proceed to organize a Confederation of Latin American States98 without American or Spanish influence, such a weakening of the particular state would be equally useful. But for the moment, this is not the situation. Any struggle for the real, effective dissolution of a particular postcolonial state is a reactionary project. It is an entirely different thing to struggle to transform the particular postcolonial state in view of a political postulate of the “dissolution of the state” as such. This would mean that in the creation of any new institution, in every exercise of institutional power, or in the transformation of all of the institutions (the transformation of the state), one would have the “dissolution of the state” as an orienting principle. However, this cannot take the form of the objective, empirical negation of these institutions, but rather must take the form of a responsible, democratic, popular, social, and participatory subjectivization of institutional functions, in which representation proceeds by approaching (to use a Kantian word) the represented. In this situation, the symmetrical participation of all those affected would become flesh in all political actions to such a degree that the state will cease to weigh so heavily, becoming lighter, more transparent, and more public and democratic. This would not be a “minimal state” (which leaves everything to the market or to the impossibility of perfect citizens99), but more accurately a “subjectivized state” in which the citizens will participate to such a degree that the existing institutional sphere will shift toward transparency, the bureaucracy will be the minimum necessary, while its efficacy and instrumentality when it comes to the permanence and extension of human life will nevertheless be at a maximum. I do not believe that it makes sense to attempt to transform political institutions without the state, without exercising power which is communicative, democratic, legitimate, participatory, socialized, and popular. It is, however, possible to declare a postulate which could never be realized, but which functions like the “North Star” that helped the Chinese navigators to sail at night. Despite all that I have expounded, I think that the postulate of the “dissolution of the state” is a strategic orienting principle that functions as a regulative horizon.

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In addition to a host of warnings, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">last Wednesday’s Congressional Budget Office report did contain a little bit of good news.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> The economy will grow slightly faster in the second half of 2012 than in the first half, and inflation will stay extremely low, according to projections in the CBO’s Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The bad news is that unemployment will probably remain above 8%. The worse news is that next year the U.S. faces continued high unemployment, below-average growth and the risk of a double-dip recession. The U.S. economy never built up much of a head of steam coming out of the 2007-09 recession, which saw the biggest drop in real GDP since the 1940s and the highest unemployment since the early 1980s. Historically, after such a major downturn ends, there’s typically a powerful rebound in which real GDP growth average</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">s</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> more than 4.5% annually over a period of two or three years and briefly hits annualized rates above 9%. By contrast, during the recovery that began in 2009, the economy has never grown faster than 4.5% and has averaged about 2.2% a year. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">And </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">next year, the global economic situation figures to be even less hospitable to growth, which will make it harder for the U.S. economy to speed up from its current disappointing pace.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Indeed, last week the ratings agency Standard & Poor’s released a report saying that the chances of a recession in the U.S. in 2013 had increased to 25%, up from 20% in February. A U.S. recession is by no means inevitable, but the domestic economy faces three large hurdles, any one of which could mean the difference between steady growth and another economic contraction. The fiscal cliff. Under current law, a variety of tax increases and spending cuts are scheduled to go into effect next year, with serious consequences. On the plus side, these measures would cut the deficit by more than $500 billion. The Federal debt, as a percentage of GDP, would slowly begin to shrink. All that deficit reduction, however, would come at the price of a likely reduction in the economy’s output of more than two percentage points, resulting in a mild-to-moderate recession. That’s just one of the reasons why these policies aren’t likely to go into effect as they stand. A gridlocked Congress and a closely-contested Presidential election make any sort of legislative action unlikely before November. But neither party wants to allow tax cuts to expire for the middle-class or to see more people get hit with the alternative minimum tax. And while the parties disagree on reductions in defense spending and Medicare payments to doctors, the cuts currently scheduled are so large that they will probably be modified or delayed. Historically, Congress has been very good at avoiding big middle-class tax increases and sudden, disruptive spending cuts. While the fiscal cliff may not be eliminated entirely, odds are it will be greatly reduced – even if only at the last possible moment. The global slowdown. While the U.S. economy is growing, albeit somewhat sluggishly, growth around the rest of the world is slowing. Several European countries are already in recession, and the continent as a whole is heading in that direction. Indeed, recent figures show that the private sector in the euro zone has been contracting for seven months. Even Germany’s economy is losing momentum, and current trends indicate that real GDP for the overall euro zone could fall by half a percentage point in the current quarter. Moreover, if there is some sort of euro currency crisis, the resulting shocks to major European banks could turn a minor slowdown into a severe and possibly worldwide recession. In addition, the U.K. has been in recession since late 2011. And some booming economies in the rest of the world – like China and Brazil – are looking at significantly slower growth, dashing the hopes of some that growth in newly advanced economies would blunt the impact of a recession in the developed world. The stimulus shortfall. Ordinarily, in a situation like this the Federal government would try to rev up the U.S. economy with fiscal and monetary stimulus. Only trouble is, the emergency fuel tank is empty. Over the past 12 years, taxes have been cut and kept low, government spending has ratcheted up, the Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates to a minimum and has even taken to stoking the money supply through a process known as quantitative easing (which amounts to creating money by purchasing government bonds). With yearly deficits topping $1 trillion, there is little appetite in Washington for further fiscal stimulus, either through tax cuts or spending. On the monetary side of things, the Fed can’t push interest rates much lower, and the impact of another round of quantitative easing is unlikely to last any longer than the effects of the previous two rounds. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">None of this means that a U.S. recession is inevitable. Sure, a mild slump in Europe, combined with slower growth in places like China, would affect U.S. multinationals that sell a lot overseas. And a financial crisis in the euro zone would doubtless hurt U.S. banks to some extent. But U.S. GDP growth depends largely on domestic factors, and there is still time for Congress to resolve the looming fiscal-cliff issues in a way that prevents a sudden shock to the economy and reduces the risk of another recession.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> But while the private and public sectors in the U.S. have the wherewithal to avoid contracting GDP, that doesn’t mean that we’ll see the kind of growth that will put a serious dent in the unemployment rate. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Even under the CBO’s optimistic scenario, real-GDP growth will pick up only from 1.75% at an annual rate to 2.25% later this year, and average 1.7% in 2013. Having failed to rebound when the weather was more favorable, the U.S. economy is hardly likely to do any better as storm clouds start rolling in.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">With the global financial system in serious trouble, is America's geostrategic dominance likely to diminish? If so, what would that mean? </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">One immediate implication of the crisis that began on Wall Street and spread across the world is that the primary instruments of U.S. foreign policy will be crimped. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The next president will face an entirely new and adverse fiscal position. Estimates of this year's federal budget deficit already show that it has jumped $237 billion from last year, to $407 billion. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">With families and businesses hurting, there will be calls for various and expensive domestic relief programs</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. In the face of this onrushing river of red ink, both Barack Obama and John McCain have been reluctant to lay out what portions of their programmatic wish list they might defer or delete. Only Joe Biden has suggested a possible reduction -- </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">foreign aid</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. This </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">would be one of the few popular cuts, but in budgetary terms it is a mere grain of sand.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Still, Sen. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Biden's comment hints at where we may be headed: toward a major reduction in America's world role, and perhaps even a new era of financially-induced isolationism. Pressures to cut defense spending, and to dodge the cost of waging two wars, already intense before this crisis, are likely to mount.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Despite the success of the surge, the war in Iraq remains deeply unpopular. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Precipitous withdrawal -- attractive to a sizable swath of the electorate before the financial implosion -- might well become even more popular with annual war bills running in the hundreds of billions. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Protectionist sentiments are sure to grow stronger as jobs disappear in the coming slowdown. Even before our current woes, calls to save jobs by restricting imports had begun to gather support among many Democrats and some Republicans. In a prolonged recession, gale-force winds of protectionism will blow. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Then there are the dolorous consequences of a potential collapse of the world's financial architecture. For decades</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> now, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Americans have enjoyed the advantages of being at the center of that system. The worldwide use of the dollar, and the stability of our economy, among other things, made it easier for us to run huge budget deficits, as we counted on foreigners to pick up the tab by buying dollar-denominated assets as a safe haven. Will this be possible in the future? Meanwhile, traditional foreign-policy challenges are multiplying. The threat from al Qaeda and Islamic terrorist affiliates has not been extinguished. Iran and North Korea are continuing on their bellicose paths, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are progressing smartly down the road to chaos. Russia's new militancy and China's seemingly relentless rise also give cause for concern. If America now tries to pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power vacuum. The stabilizing effects of our presence in Asia, our continuing commitment to Europe, and our position as defender of last resort for Middle East energy sources and supply lines could all be placed at risk. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In such a scenario </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">there are shades of the 1930s, when global trade and finance ground nearly to a halt, the peaceful democracies failed to cooperate, and aggressive powers led by the remorseless fanatics who rose up on the crest of economic disaster exploited their divisions. Today we run the risk that rogue states may choose to become ever more reckless with their nuclear toys, just at our moment of maximum vulnerability.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Geopolitical risk is on the rise after years of relative quiet</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> – potentially creating further headwinds to the global recovery just </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">as fears of a double-dip recession are growing</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, says Tina Fordham, senior political analyst at Citi Private Bank. “Recently, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">markets have been focused on problems within the eurozone and not much moved by developments in North Korea, new Iran sanctions, tensions between Turkey and Israel or the unrest in strategically significant Kyrgyzstan</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">,” she says. “But taken together, we don’t think investors can afford to ignore the return of geopolitical concerns to the fragile post-financial crisis environment.” Ms Fordham argues </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">the end of post-Cold War US pre-eminence is one of the most important by-products of the financial crisis. “The post-crisis world order is shifting. More players than ever are at the table, and their interests often diverge. Emerging market countries have greater weight in the system, yet many lack experience on the global stage. Addressing the world’s challenges in this more crowded environment will be slower and more complex. This increases the potential for proliferating risks: most notably the prospect of politically and/or economically weakened regimes obtaining nuclear weapons; and military action to keep them from doing so. “Left unresolved, these challenges could disrupt global stability and trade. This would be a very unwelcome time to see the return of geopolitical risk.”</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">High unemployment, languid economic growth and growing urbanization make transport’s role in driving growth more important than ever. Problems relating to congestion, the environment and safety, as well as opportunities presented by growing data and smarter consumers, must be addressed to help support job creation and growth</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. The intelligent transportation systems (</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">ITS) industry is helping build transport systems that address these issues</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. To sustain momentum, governments need to accelerate the development of common standards for ITS solutions and open data, the industry needs to collaborate across industry boundaries and cities need to continue building smarter transport networks. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The role of transport in driving jobs and growth is more important than ever Transport contributes directly to economic activity and employment</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> through bus, rail, road, air </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">and </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">maritime services. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">It also has a large indirect impact via all the other sectors and activities in the economy that depend on and use these various modes of transport to move people and goods around, nationally and internationally, in an efficient and safe manner. 1 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In the current economic environment, three interrelated factors are placing even greater weight on the role of transport in driving jobs and growth: • The rate of urbanization globally has been rising and, in 2008, for the first time in human history, the proportion of the worlds’ population based in urban areas was greater than 50 percent. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">In the United States, 82 percent of the total population is based in urban areas, and this is set to rise to 90 percent by 2050. Cities need to help ensure that their transportation networks can support this high and increasing level of human and economic activity </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">based in cities. 2 • </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The financial environment for cities and federal, state and local governments is challenging. Many states are amid their most severe fiscal crisis since the Great Depression. The largest collapse in state revenues on record combined with languid economic growth are constraining the use of traditional fiscal instruments to support job creation, as well as creating affordability and funding issues for large infrastructure investments. 3 Because of the importance of transport in supporting job creation, it can help address the pressing structural problem of unemployment in many advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> In the United States, long-term unemployment in particular is at crisis levels unprecedented in the post-war period. 4 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Yet,at a time when transport has never been more important in supporting growth and job creation, transportation systems in the United States and globally are facing several key challenges.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> There are also technological and socioeconomic trends that are creating new opportunities for transport providers (Figure 1). If unaddressed, these challenges and opportunities will inhibit the ability of transport to support job creation and growth. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Today’s transport challenges create an urgent need for action </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Demographic changes and more vehicles are placing new demands on existing networks. Many</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">transportation systems are facing rising demand driven by increased urbanization </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">of populations. Over the past decade, the biggest migration of Americans has been to cities with between 100,000 and 1 million residents. 5 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Many</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> of these </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">cities </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">are less than prepared to deal with this influx of individuals and, as a result, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">are struggling to manage these busier transport networks.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> But not all cities are facing the same challenge. Chicago and Detroit, for example, are actually experiencing population declines, and cities with populations greater than 10 million suffered a 10 percent rate of outmigration over the last decade. 6 This declining demand exacerbates existing revenue problems. Whether populations are increasing or declining creates a challenge for transportation providers in terms of maintaining an efficient and productive transport system in the face of population changes. In tandem, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">over the last 20 years, there has been substantial growth across all transport modes and, therefore, more vehicles and vessels using the transport network (see Figure 2). All these additional vehicles and vessels competing for limited capacity on the transport network create a challenge for transport providers trying to efficiently manage the network and balance demand and capacity Congestion is a growing problem that incurs significant costs. Congestion pressures faced by cities are worsening over time and cannot be ignored</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> – traffic congestion in the 100 biggest metropolitan areas in the United States increased by 11 percent last year. 7 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Congestion costs time and money – approximately US $101 billion and about 4.8 billion wasted hours last year in the United States</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. 8 It also negatively impacts quality of life by decreasing personal and business productivity, lowering air quality, creating noise pollution, adversely impacting health, as well as leading to the waste of nearly 1.9 billion gallons of fuel each year. 9 A large portion of congestion is not caused by limited highway capacity – </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">60 percent of all freeway congestion is caused by incidents such as wrecks and debris</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> on the road. 10 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">So, reducing these types of incidents could help reduce the incidence of congestion and the negative costs associated with it</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. “The numbers quantify what is intuitively evident – the extent and cost of congestion in cities of all sizes continue to significantly increase. The congestion numbers also demonstrate that we will not build our way out of the urban mobility problems that have developed.” Dennis Christiansen, Agency Director, Texas Transportation Institute </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Accidents</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> in the transport network take thousands of lives and cost billions of dollars each year. There are more than 10 million motor vehicle accidents in the United States every year. 11 In the United States, accidents are the leading cause of death among those aged 25 to 34 and cause almost 40,000 fatalities a year – equivalent to two jumbo jets crashing every week! 12 This figure has remained virtually unchanged over the last 20 years (Figure 3). In terms of injuries from vehicle crashes, more than 2.3 million adults are treated every year in emergency departments. 13 These events </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">impose about US$41 billion in medical and work loss costs every year. 14 As 20 percent of all freeway crashes are “secondary,” occurring because the roadway is blocked by an earlier incident, reducing congestion caused by accidents could potentially reduce these costs. 15 “Motor vehicle crashes and the resulting injuries and fatalities impose a huge cost on society. The often-overlooked economic impact of crashes is over US$230 billion annual</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Pressure is growing – nationally and internationally – to reduce emissions and the negative environmental impact of transport. As transportation greenhouse gases (GHG) account for 29 percent of total U.S. GHG and over 5 percent of total global GHG emissions, it is not surprising the transport industry has been subject to increasing levels of environmental regulations. 16 For example, steps were outlined by U.S. President Obama in May 2010 on the adoption of the first-ever GHG regulations for heavy-duty engines and vehicles, as well as the development of further light-duty vehicle GHG regulations. In August 2011, a regulation was signed relating to Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles. 17 The increase in regulation is not just happening at the national level. In recent decades, there has been a proliferation of multilateral environmental agreements. Global regulation is likely to continue and to extend to new areas. 18 Environmental pressure is also being driven by changing attitudes among consumers and cities as exemplified by movements such as “Car Free America” and efforts in Arlington County, Virginia, and other urban areas that promote the use of transportation modes other than single-occupancy vehicles. 19Technology and socioeconomic trends are creating new opportunities Transportation system providers can leverage technology to get closer to smarter citizens and give them access to their transport network. Transport system providers are facing smarter citizens as technology fundamentally changes the way they interact, obtain information and purchase goods and services. While 30.2 percent of the world’s population are online, that proportion is even higher in North America at 78.3 percent, representing an increase of 151 percent in North America between 2000 and 2011. 20 Ninety-one percent of the U.S. population has a mobile phone account, and Smartphone penetration of the U.S. mobile phone market will overtake feature phone penetration by the end of 2011. 21 There are over 425,000 iPhone apps and over 15 billion downloads – and this growth occurred in just four years. 22 What all of these statistics serve to illustrate is the growing familiarity that consumers have with technology. What it means for transportation system providers is that they are now facing consumers who are not just more informed, enabled and demanding, but who also increasingly expect technology to be embedded in the services they use. Transportation providers have more data and information at their disposal than ever before. From 2008 to 2009, the amount of digital information increased 62 percent to 0.8 zetabytes – and in 2010, it was estimated to have increased to 1.2 zetabytes. 23 A recent study put this into perspective by estimating this amount equals 75 billion fully loaded 16GB Apple iPads or 707 trillion copies of the 2,000 page U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 24 “In 2009, more than 40 million portable GPS devices were sold worldwide, and 52 percent of those sales were in the United States. 25 In transport, the amount data has also been growing. Several years of fast growth have led to well over 200 million “turn-by-turn navigation” systems in use worldwide, 20 percent of which are factory installed and aftermarket in-dash navigation systems. 26 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">About 10 percent of the world’s new cars in 2010 had factory-installed telematics – that is expected to increase to 62 percent by 2016. 27 Many cities are also sitting on potential treasure troves of data from individual tickets, journeys and usage of public transport to data in road charging or toll schemes. Transportation providers and agencies have a vast amount of information at their disposal from across their entire transport network. This represents a valuable opportunity to gain greater insight into the network, make better and more informed decisions, take appropriate action and help improve the quality of the transport services. Transport services can become a differentiator for cities to attract and retain the talent necessary to drive growth. Talent is becoming more and more important in driving economic growth in cities and regions</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. And while the number of mobile highly educated individuals is set to rise over the next 20 years, cities will face intensifying competition to attract and retain this talent. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">28 Transport services could become a significant differentiator, as they have a critical influence on the attractiveness and liveability of a location. For cities and regions that can attract this mobile talent, the resulting wealth can be spread out across the economy. More growth means more jobs – not only for higher-skilled but also for lowerskilled individuals</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. In addition, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">transportation enhancement can be leveraged by cities experiencing falling population numbers to stimulate recovery, jobs and growth and stem further population declines. To help drive growth and job creation, transport providers must address the challenges and opportunities </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">before them. In answering the question of “how” transport providers can deal with these pressures and opportunities, we now outline how “smarter,” more intelligent transport systems can help. “Economic growth will not be possible without increasing the efficiency and capacity of our highway systems. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">ITS has proven to be one of the quickest andmost cost-effective ways to accomplish these objectives.”</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Abbas Mohaddes, President and CEO, Iteris Inc. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Smarter transport helps drive jobs and growth through ITS solutions, jobs and revenue The ITS value chain spans 15 major industry groupings and accounts for 13 percent of total industry outpu</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">t. In the U.S. economy, this market includes both ITS-driven companies and also more diversified companies (Figure 4), illustrating the breadth of the ITS industry outside of transport. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The ITS industry enhances the potential of transport to drive growth and jobs through two key channels. First, it is developing innovative solutions that help transportation providers effectively deal with the challenges and opportunities they face and build smarter, more intelligent transportation systems. Second, the industry itself makes a major contribution to economic activity and jobs through its revenue and employment. ITS helps drive growth through innovative solutions that enable smarter transport systems</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Smarter transport systems are instrumented, interconnected and intelligent. The right type of data is collected, managed and integrated across different parts of the transport system, fleet or a single vehicle in a way that allows modern information technology and advanced analytics to be used for further insight. This insight can form the basis for more effective decision making and responses. For example, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">a smart system can support more efficient and effective use of limited resources</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> by allowing providers to “visualize” the transportation system, quickly identify the source of problems and rectify them, as well as by helping them be better prepared for responses to infrequent events. The </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">ITS </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">industry is helping build smarter transport </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">systems that enable data gathering and analysis and more effective responses to issues such as congestion, safety and environmental efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> For example, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">ITS solutions are relaying real-time traffic information via handheld devices and on-board traffic information advisory systems to help drivers avoid congestion and reroute. ITS solutions that provide information relating to carpools and parking can help increase vehicle occupancy and reduce the number of vehicles and their time on the road</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Making better information available for travelers can help facilitate a modal shift by giving them the ability to perhaps mix and match different modes or spread the load on the system through the timing of trips. In terms of safety, on-board collision avoidance systems can detect vehicles or other obstacles and alert drivers of looming threats – and eventually could impose brakes. Other solutions, such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems, enable vehicles to be fully “aware” of dynamic information of neighboring vehicles, helping them keep a safe distance and facilitating faster responses to traffic incidents. Such innovative solutions can make a real difference in helping reduce the existing safety problems across the transport network. The industry is also developing solutions to address environmental pressures. GPS-based eco-routing, one of the first applications currently in use, helps drivers choose a route with minimal environmental footprints and environmentally-relevant real-time transportation data. Having been promoted in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Applications for the Environment: Real-Time Information Synthesis’ (AERIS) program, this application empowers vehicles to mitigate their environmental impact. 29 “We can stay here, stuck in traffic, or we can invest in transportation and ITS technology that have the potential to transform how we travel. Whether it’s a commercial hauler seeking a route for his on-time delivery or a parent trying to make it from the office to her child’s soccer game, this technology can lower business costs, improve quality of life, ease traffic congestion and make us safer.” Kirk Steudle, Director, Michigan Department of Transportation Intelligent vehicle technologies will ultimately enable autonomous driving and cars that don’t crash. Not only will these vehicles revolutionize personal mobility, they also promise to dramatically decrease fuel consumption and emissions, greatly enhance traffic safety and provide significantly more value for consumers.” Nady Boules, Director, Electrical & Controls Integration Lab, General Motors Global Research & Development IBM Global Business Services 9 Solutions are also being created that help transportation system providers capitalize on opportunities to gain information and insight. Embedded and road-side sensors, along with information exchanged wirelessly, could provide more information to transportation agencies. And advanced analytics solutions could gather and help provide insights on which to act. Many organizations are overwhelmed by vast amounts of data and struggle to effectively use it to achieve business results – more than two thirds of organizations report that their organizations have more data than they know how to use effectively. 30 Analytics can help mitigate the mounting complexity resulting from the data deluge and facilitate more informed decision making. “…..the connected vehicle system holds the promise of reducing congestion, improving transport time and doing it in a safer fashion.” Dana Christensen, Deputy Laboratory Director for Science and Technology, National Renewable Energy Laboratory “A significant commitment to safety is needed to fund better data collection systems, road and vehicle improvements, and performance-based counter-measures that can have the greatest impact on saving lives and reducing crashes. Transportation technology solutions play a role in all of these areas.” Jill Ingrassia, Managing Director, Government Relations & Traffic Safety Advocacy, AAA Embedding technology in the transportation system, such as through integrated fare processing or smart cards, facilitates the “smarter” services that “smarter” consumers increasingly demand. Leveraging technology to enhance travelers’ experiences through smart and more accurate traffic signs and smart phone mobility apps, for example, could help cities improve transport services and perhaps attract talent. “ITS systems can now provide for detailed traffic and revenue analysis that truly informs decision making based in great detail on the ‘voices of the consumers’ and how they actually use our transportation systems.” Ken Philmus, Senior VP, Transportation Solutions Group, Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. “Our efforts with transportation agencies worldwide are driving better intelligence from these vast data stores in ways that help them plan, build, manage and measure the performance of our road networks for a fraction of the cost.” Bryan Mistele, President and CEO, Inrix Inc. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">ITS can thus help providers effectively deal with many of the pressures – and opportunities – they face and generate further spillover benefits for users of the systems. This, in turn, helps foster efficiency savings and benefits for citizens and businesses across the economy.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> And statistics point to the continued development of innovative solutions – ITS-related patents increased by 17 percent between 2007 and 2008 when overall patent applications in the United States were static. 3110 Transportation and economic development </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Smarter transport can directly impact economic activity through the revenue and jobs generated by the industry. The ITS end-use products and services market was US$52 billion in 2009 – larger in revenue size than motion picture and video production (US$48 billion), computers(US$44 billion), direct mail advertising (US$44 billion) or Internet advertising (US$23 billion). 32 Continued growth is projected through 2015 with the North American ITS market size expected to increase to US$73 billion </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">(consisting of US$67 billion for the United States and an additional US$6 billion for the rest of North America). </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">This amounts to a compound annual growth rate of 5.8 percent per annum over the 2009-2015 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">period. 33 In addition, as is evident from Figure 5, the </span>//<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 12pt;">annual growth rates for ITS are higher than the average growth for total North American revenue.</span>//<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> The ITS industry also directly affects the economy through number and quality of jobs and wages for those jobs. ITS industry employment in 2011 is estimated at over 513,000,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> with 306,000 in enabling services and components and 207,000 in end-use intelligent transport. This is a 4 percent increase of over 19,000 since 2009 – impressive growth considering an economic environment in which aggregate employment levels in the United States increased by just 4,000 over the same period. 34 The ITS U.S. and North American employment outlook is also positive. By 2015, the ITS value chain is projected to contribute over 564,000 jobs – an increase of 14 percent over 2009 levels. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Growth in employment in the ITS industry is also higher than other sectors and the economy overall. 35 ITS jobs typically command annual salaries above the national average</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> as they require specialized skills. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">ITS average salaries are more than US$32,000 above the national average of US$42,270. More than half of the U.S. ITS jobs categorized by occupation had salaries of US$69,000 or more (see Figure 6). These high-paying earners have a positive impact on the economy via the goods and services they purchase and those employed to provide them.</span>

**<span class="TagChar" style="background-color: #ffffff;">Belcher, ‘9</span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> (December 4, 2009 Scott Belcher, CEO and President, Intelligent Transportation Society of America, represents several hundred member organizations including public agencies, private industry leaders, and academic institutions involved in the research, development, and deployment of intelligent transportation systems that improve safety, increase mobility, and sustain the environment, “Congress: Invest in Intelligent Transportation Systems to create jobs”, [[http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/70623-congress-invest-in-intelligent-transportation-systems-to-create-jobs]])</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">As Congressional leaders work to craft a jobs package that will address our nation’s alarming unemployment levels, they would do well to invest in Intelligent Transportation Systems (</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">ITS</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">) and other transportation projects that </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">will modernize our nation’s aging infrastructure </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">and improve the performance of our multimodal transportation systems. ITS technologies are beginning to move our national transportation network into the digital age, and are already providing major improvements in transportation safety, mobility, efficiency, and the environment. A few examples include high-tech traffic and freight management systems, synchronized and adaptive traffic signals, smart transit systems, electronic tolling systems, weigh-in-motion truck inspections, ramp metering, advanced condition assessment technologies, and real-time traffic, transit and parking information. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Investing in ITS will create new jobs quickly because these technologies can be deployed without a lot of new construction or right-of-way issues. And 50 percent of every dollar spent on ITS deployment goes directly to wages and salaries, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Consider that an investment of $1.2 billion to deploy and operate real-time traffic information programs in all 50 states and the nation’s largest 50 cities would not only create new jobs and spur economic growth, but would also generate more than $30 billion in safety, mobility, and environmental benefits to the public</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, according to a newly-released GAO study. The future of ITS and its positive impact on our national economy are significant. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The U.S. DOT projects that the field of ITS could create almost 600,000 new jobs</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">over the next 20 years.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">With a federal commitment to ITS deployment, these figures could be significantly higher.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> In the United Kingdom, an investment of 15 billion British pounds (approximately $25 billion) in information and communications technology (</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">ITS</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, smart grid and broadband)</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> is estimated to create or retain 700,000 jobs, of which 360,000 are small business jobs. Several other segments of the economy will also benefit from federal investments in ITS.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Researchers from the London School of Economics and the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation have found </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">that investment in ITS</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">creates a ‘network effect’ throughout the economy and </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">directly benefits economic growth by stimulating high-tech job creation</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> across multiple sectors, including green jobs, high-tech, automotive, information technology, consumer electronics, and related industries; </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">and provides a foundation for long-term benefits,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">including government cost savings, economy-wide productivity, and an improved quality of life. It’s also important to recognize the international commitment to ITS is growing among other leading industrialized nations. China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Germany, Great Britain, and other nations today view their ITS industry as a key industrial base, and one capable of generating considerable economic growth. With unemployment rates reaching alarming levels and traffic congestion stifling our economy and quality of life, it’s time for the U.S. to make a commitment to ITS. ITS will play a major role in helping American workers retain existing jobs while providing new jobs for the unemployed. It will also provide lasting benefits by increasing safety, reducing congestion and emissions, improving system performance and creating more livable, sustainable communities.</span>

Bernanke said that small businesses support their local communities while also helping the U.S. compete globally. "They often offer a level of agility in bringing innovative products to the global marketplace that larger firms cannot match," Bernanke said. Bernanke also said that entrepreneurship offered "an important option for people confronting economic challenges in their lives, such as insufficient retirement savings." Many small businesses are still finding it hard to get credit after the financial crisis. The crisis has made small companies more vulnerable and banks more cautious in giving out loans to them. A Fed survey this week showed that fewer banks relaxed lending standards to business in the third quarter-- especially to small companies. Bernanke said Nov. 2 that the Fed stands ready to buy more mortgage-backed securities to aid an economy that's expected to remain weak for many more years, but he declined to commit firmly to such a move. The central bank last week refrained from taking new unorthodox steps to spur growth after taking them at previous meetings in August and September. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Small companies were more optimistic for the second month in a row in October as a bigger share of businessmen said they expect the economy to improve over the next six months</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, a survey showed Tuesday. But it was less pessimism that really moved the needle--not an increase in optimism. The level of the optimism index published by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) is still close to levels associated with recession and remains below last spring's level. Small companies' expectations of sales growth and business conditions stayed in negative territory, the NFIB survey showed.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Hiring prospects</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> also </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">remained dim last month, with only 3% of firms saying they plan to add employees to their workforce, down one percentage point from September and in line with the weak average seen over the past six months.</span>

As well as causing a large explosion, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">a "dirty bomb" attack would contaminate the area for many years. The briefings also state that al-Qaeda documents</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> found in Afghanistan in 2007 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">revealed that "greater advances" had been made in bio-terrorism than was previously realised</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. An </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Indian national security adviser told American security personnel</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> in June 2008 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">that terrorists had made a "manifest attempt to get fissile material" and "have the technical competence to manufacture an explosive device beyond a mere dirty bomb". Alerts about the smuggling of nuclear material, sent to Washington from foreign US embassies, document how criminal and terrorist gangs were trafficking large amounts of highly radioactive material across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The alerts explain how customs guards at remote border crossings used radiation alarms to identify and seize cargoes of uranium and plutonium. Freight trains were found to be carrying weapons-grade nuclear material across the Kazakhstan-Russia border, highly enriched uranium was transported across Uganda by bus, and a "small-time hustler" in Lisbon offered to sell radioactive plates stolen from Chernobyl. In one incident in September 2009, two employees at the Rossing Uranium Mine in Namibia smuggled almost half a ton of uranium concentrate powder – yellowcake – out of the compound in plastic bags. "Acute safety and security concerns" were even raised in 2008 about the uranium and plutonium laboratory of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the nuclear safety watchdog. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Tomihiro Taniguchi, the deputy director-general of the IAEA, has privately warned America</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> that the world </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">faces the threat of a "nuclear 9/11" if stores of uranium and plutonium were not secured against terrorists</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. But diplomats visiting the IAEA's Austrian headquarters in April 2008 said that there was "no way to provide perimeter security" to its own laboratory because it has windows that leave it vulnerable to break-ins. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Senior British defence officials have raised "deep concerns" that a rogue scientist in the Pakistani nuclear programme "could gradually smuggle enough material out to make a weapon,"</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> according to a document detailing official talks in London in February 2009.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Agricultural stores of deadly biological pathogens in Pakistan are also vulnerable to "extremists" who could use supplies of anthrax, foot and mouth disease and avian flu to develop lethal biological weapons. Anthrax and other biological agents, including smallpox and avian flu, could be sprayed from a shop-bought aerosol can in a crowded area, leaked security briefings warn.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> The security of the world's only two declared smallpox stores in Atlanta, USA, and Novosibirsk, Russia, has repeatedly been called into doubt by "a growing chorus of voices" at meetings of the World Health Assembly documented in the leaked cables. The alarming disclosures come after President Barack Obama last year declared nuclear terrorism "the single biggest threat" to international security with the potential to cause "extraordinary loss of life".</span>

Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, former Director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, U.S. Department of Energy, former Chief of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Department, Counter-terrorist Center, Central Intelligence Agency, recipient of the CIA Director’s Award, graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, West Point, “Al Qaeda Weapons of Mass Destruction Threat: Hype or Reality?”</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 8pt;">[[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/al-qaeda-wmd-threat.pdf]]</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">]</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Osama </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">bin Ladin’s assertion in 1998 that it was his Islamic duty to acquire weapons of mass destruction ensured that the fulfillment of this intent would become a top priority for his lieutenants in the ensuing years</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. In an effort to explain his thinking to his followers, and to help guide their efforts, the al Qaeda leader has offered a number of statements that provide a need and rationale for using weapons of mass destruction as a means of achieving the group’s concrete and ambitious goals. Most recently, he promised in a 2007 video release to “escalate the killing and fighting against you (Americans)”–on grounds of destroying an international conspiracy to control the world–adding, “The capitalist system seeks to turn the entire world into a fiefdom of the major corporations under the label of globalization in order to protect democracy.” </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">These statements should not be interpreted as empty rhetoric and idle threats: Osama bin Ladin has signaled a specific purpose for using WMD in al Qaeda’s quest to destroy the global status quo, and to create conditions more conducive to the overthrow of apostate regimes throughout the Islamic world</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. His argument is essentially that even weapons of mass destruction—which are outlawed under Islam—are a justifiable means of countering US hegemony. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Osama bin Ladin’s morality-based argument on the nature of the struggle between militant Islamists and the US-led coalition of secular forces focuses the group’s planning on the acquisition of strategic weapons that can be used in mass casualty attacks, rather than on the production of tactical, more readily available weapons such as “dirty bombs,” chemical agents, crude toxins and poisons</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. In this light, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">it is not surprising that the group’s top WMD priority has been to acquire nuclear and strategic biological weapons</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Considering the potential that such weapons hold in fulfilling al Qaeda’s aspirations, their </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">WMD procurement efforts have been managed at the most senior levels</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, under rules of strict compartmentalization from lower levels of the organization, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">and with central control over possible targets and timing of prospective attacks</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. In this sense, their approach has been “Muhammed Atta-like”—similar to the modus operandi Khaled Sheikh Mohammed employed in making preparations for the 9/11 attacks—</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">as opposed to resembling the signature characterizing most terrorist attacks to which the world has become accustomed</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Al Qaeda’s patient, decade-long effort to steal or construct an improvised nuclear device (IND) flows from their perception of the benefits of producing the image of a mushroom cloud rising over a US city, just as the 9/11 attacks have altered the course of history. This lofty aim helps explains why al Qaeda has consistently sought a bomb capable of producing a nuclear yield, as opposed to settling for the more expedient and realistic course of devising a “dirty bomb,” or a radiological dispersal device</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Another 9/11-scale operational plot managed by the al Qaeda core leadership was the development of anthrax for use in a mass casualty attack in the U</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">nited </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">S</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">tates. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The sophisticated anthrax project was run personally by al Qaeda deputy chief Ayman Zawahiri, in parallel to the group’s efforts to acquire a nuclear capability</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">; anthrax was probably meant to serve as another means to achieve the same effect as using a nuclear bomb, given doubts that a nuclear option could be successfully procured. Notably, al Qaeda’s efforts to acquire a nuclear and biological weapons capability were concentrated in the years preceding September 11, 2001. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Based on the timing and nature of their WMD-related activity in the 1990’s, al Qaeda probably anticipated using these means of mass destruction against targets in the US homeland in the intensified campaign they knew would follow the 9/11 attack</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">There is no indication that the fundamental objectives that lie behind their WMD intent have changed over time</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. On the other hand, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">the pursuit of crude toxins and poisons appears to have been of little interest to the al Qaeda leadership, even though the production of such weapons is easier and thus might seem more attractive for potential use in attacks</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Although experimentation and training in crude chemical agents and pathogens was standard fare in al Qaeda’s camps in Afghanistan before 9/11, their use in attacks appears to have been left to the initiative of individual cells and planners outside the direct supervision of the al Qaeda core leadership. Prominent examples of small-scale chemical- and biological- related activity include Midhat al-Mursi’s (aka Abu Khabab) basic training for operatives in the al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan before 9/11; the Abu Musab al Zarqawi network’s plotting to use ricin and cyanide in multiple attacks planned in Europe in late 2002-early 2003; and a Bahraini terrorist cell’s plot to use a crude cyanide gas device called the “mobtaker” (an Arabic word roughly meaning “invention”) in an attack on the New York City subway in the same time frame. In each of these cases, the evidence suggests that the al Qaeda senior leadership was not directly involved or apparently even aware of attack preparations until late stages of planning. Moreover, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">there is no evidence that the al Qaeda leadership regarded the use of crude toxins and poisons as being suitable for conducting what would amount to pin prick attacks on the U</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">nited </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">S</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">tates; </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">on the contrary, Zawahiri canceled the planned attack on the New York City subway for “something better,” suggesting that a relatively easy attack utilizing tactical weapons would not achieve the goals the al Qaeda leadership had set for themselves</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. So, why hasn’t a terrorist WMD attack happened since 9/11? </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">There are many plausible explanations for why the world has not experienced an al Qaeda attack using chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons, but it would be foolish to discount the possibility that such an event will occur in the future. To date, al Qaeda’s WMD programs may have been disrupted</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. This is in fact one likely explanation, given a sustained and ferocious counterterrorist response to 9/11 that largely destroyed al Qaeda as the organization that existed before the fateful attack on the US. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">If so, terrorists must continue to be disrupted and denied a safe haven to reestablish the ability to launch a major strike on the US homeland</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, or elsewhere in the world. Or perhaps, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">al Qaeda operational planners have failed to acquire the kind of weapons they seek, because they are unwilling to settle for anything other than a large scale attack in the US</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. It would surely be hard for al Qaeda to lower the bar they set on 9/11: what would constitute a worthy follow-up to 9/11, on their terms? What would they achieve through another attack? </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">There are few weapons that would meet their expectations in this regard. It is extremely difficult to acquire a functioning nuclear bomb, or to steal enough weapons usable material to build a bomb. And as al Qaeda probably learned in trying to weaponize anthrax, biological pathogens may seem simple enough to produce, but such weapons are not easy to bottle up and control</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. To complicate matters further, an attack on the scale of 9/11 is more difficult to accomplish in an environment of heightened security and vigilance in the US. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">But if Osama bin Ladin and his lieutenants had been interested in employing crude chemical, biological and radiological materials in small scale attacks, there is little doubt they could have done so by now</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. However, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">events have shown that the al Qaeda leadership does not choose weapons based on how easy they are to acquire and use</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, be they conventional or unconventional weapons. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">They choose them based on the best means of destroying the specific targets that they have in mind. Al Qaeda’s reasoning thus runs counter to analytic convention that equates the ease of acquisition of chemical, biological or radiological weapons with an increasing likelihood of terrorist use</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">—i.e., a terrorist attack employing crude weapons is therefore more likely than an attack using a nuclear or large scale biological weapon. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">In fact, it is the opposite: If perpetrating a large-scale attack serves as al Qaeda’s motivation for possessing WMD, not deterrence value, then the greatest threat is posed by the most effective and simple means of mass destruction, whether these means consist of nuclear, biological, or other forms of asymmetric weapons</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. An examination of the 9/11 attack sheds light on al Qaeda’s reasoning behind the selection of specific weapons, and how that may apply to the role WMD plays in their thinking. Al Qaeda opted to pursue a highly complex and artfully choreographed plot to strike multiple targets requiring the simultaneous hijacking of several 747 jumbo passenger aircraft, because using airplanes as weapons offered the best means of attacking the targets they intended to destroy. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">If conventional wisdom on assessing WMD terrorism threats had been applied to considering the likelihood of the 9/11 plot, analysts may well have concluded it never would have happened; at the time, it was simply hard to believe any terrorist group could pull off such an elaborate plot utilizing novel, unpredictable weapons that were so difficult to acquire</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Yet, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">WMD terrorism skeptics abound, and for understandable reasons. There is widespread suspicion in America and abroad that WMD terrorism is another phony threat being hyped for political purposes, and to stoke fears among the public</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. It is difficult to debunk this allegation, given the US government’s lack of credibility in the case of Iraqi WMD. That said, WMD terrorism is not Iraqi WMD. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The case that the WMD terrorism threat is real</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> bears no association with the Iraqi intelligence failure whatsoever, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">in terms of the reliability of the sources of intelligence, the quality of the information that has been collected, and the weight of the evidence that lies at the heart of our understanding of the threat. If anything, the biases in WMD terrorism analysis tilt towards treating the absence of information as an absence of threat; this could become a vulnerability in the defenses, considering the very real possibility that there may be a terrorist plot in motion that has not been found</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The expert community distinguishes pathways terrorists might take to the bomb</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> (discussed in detail in the next section of the report). </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">One is the use of a nuclear weapon that has been either stolen or bought on the black market</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. The probability of such a development is very low, given the high levels of physical security (guards, barriers, and the like) and technical security (electronic locks and related measures) of modern nuclear warheads. But </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">we cannot entirely rule out such a scenario</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, especially </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">if we recall the political instability in Pakistan</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, where the situation could conceivably develop in a way that would increase the chance that </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">terrorist groups might gain access to a Pakistani nuclear weapon A second pathway is the use of an improvised nuclear device built either by terrorists or by nuclear specialists that the terrorists have secretly recruited, with use of weapons-usable fissile material either stolen or bought on the black market</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.1 The probability of such an attack is higher than using stolen nuclear warheads, because </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">the acceleration of technological progress and globalization of information space make nuclear weapons technologies more accessible while the existence of the nuclear black market eases access of terrorists to weapons-usable fissile materials</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. A third pathway is the use of an explosive nuclear device built by terrorists or their accomplices with fissile material that they produced themselves—either highly enriched uranium (HEU) they managed to enrich, or plutonium they managed to produce and reprocess. Al-Qaeda and associated groups appear to have decided that enriching uranium lies well beyond the capabilities that they would realistically be able to develop. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">A fourth pathway is that terrorists might receive a nuclear bomb or the materials needed to make one from a state. North Korea</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, for example, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">has been willing to sell its missile technology to many countries</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, and transferred its plutonium production reactor technology to Syria, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">suffering few consequences</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> as a result. Transferring the means to make a nuclear bomb to a terrorist group, however, would be a dramatically different act, for the terrorists might use that capability in a way that could provoke retaliation that would result in the destruction of the regime. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">A far more worrisome transfer of capability from state to group could occur without the witting cooperation of the regime</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">A future A.Q. Khan-type</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> rogue nuclear supplier network operating out of North Korea or out of a future nuclear-armed Iran </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">could potentially transfer such a capability to a surrogate group and/or sell it for profit to the highest bidder. Global trends make nuclear terrorism a real threat</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Although the international community has recognized the dangers of nuclear terrorism, it has yet to develop a comprehensive strategy to lower the risks of nuclear terrorism. Major barriers include complacency about the threat and the adequacy of existing nuclear security measures; secrecy that makes it difficult for states to share information and to cooperate; political disputes; competing priorities; lack of funds and technical expertise in some countries; bureaucratic obstacles; and the sheer difficulty of preventing a potentially small, hard-to-detect team of terrorists from acquiring a small, hard-to-detect chunk of nuclear material with which to manufacture a crude bomb. These barriers must not be allowed to stand in the way of the panhuman universal priority of preventing this grave threat from materializing. If current approaches toward eliminating the threat are not replaced with a sense of urgency and resolve, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">the question will become not if, but when, where, and on what scale the first act of nuclear terrorism occurs</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question ‘‘Is Nuclear War Inevitable??’’ [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">most terrorists</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> obviously already </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">know</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. As Moore points out, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian ‘‘dead hand’’ system, ‘‘where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,’’ it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the U</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">nited </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">S</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">tates’’ [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal ‘‘Samson option’’ against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even ‘‘anti-Semitic’’ European cities [10]. In that case, of course, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Russia would retaliate</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> of the </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">major cities</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">nuclear winter</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> that </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">could last</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> as long as a </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">100 years, taking a savage toll upon the</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> environment and fragile </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">ecosphere</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> as well. And </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on. Any accident, mistaken communication, false signal or ‘‘lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason could, in a matter of a few minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons, and once a weapon is used, then the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is actually less probable since </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">each country would act under the ‘‘use them or lose them’’ strategy and psychology</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">; restraint by one power would be interpreted as a weakness by the other, which could be exploited as a window of opportunity to ‘‘win’’ the war. In other words, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">once Pandora’s Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, ‘‘everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors’’ [10]. In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">once even just one is used, it is very likely that many, if not all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of much of human civilization while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.</span>

In thinking about the potential for such a bioterror attack, several important questions serve to frame the discussion. Do terrorists have the desire to employ WMD, and in particular biological weapons? Under what conditions might biological weapons be an attractive choice for use by terrorists? Would they have the requisite knowledge, equipment, and organizational capacity to mount a biological warfare (BW) attack? Would they be successful in such an attack? What could we do to mitigate the effects of a bioterror attack? This article provides a framework for understanding the potential for a BW attack now and in the future by a terrorist or terrorist organization. In developing this framework, the findings hinge less on the technical capabilities than on the intentions of the potential perpetrator. State use of biological weapons in either large-scale strategic scenarios or as tools of assassination is not examined directly, although the framework could have equal application to a state BW program. The Potential Perpetrator Terrorism is a term that evokes strong emotions. Events of 9/11 brought terrorism to the forefront of the national security debate in the United States and arguably throughout the rest of the world. Despite this increased attention during the intervening period, the debate has seen little increased clarity. No agreed definition of terrorist has been developed, and the word has been used seemingly interchangeably with other terms such as insurgent, illegal combatant, and freedom fighter. The result is a politicization of the term that hinders global cooperation and confuses the issue. This can be seen in a discussion of the rationality of the terrorist. Many believe that terrorists are pathologically damaged, violent sociopaths who employ violence for their own perverted outcomes. Others believe that terrorists are calculating and highly rational actors with real or perceived grievances, employing a range of strategies from political actions to violence in order to achieve desired outcomes. Some have gone as far as to suggest that it is possible to reach a negotiated settlement with terrorists, in the same way that one might reach a postconflict settlement following a state-to-state conflict. 2 Regardless of the exact definition or the rationality of the terrorist, several important trends serve as the foundation for this analysis. First, terrorism is not a new phenomenon and has a long historical precedence. The direct origin of the term can be traced to the time of the French Revolution, although the period beginning in the 1970s is of the most interest for our discussion. It is during this period—with emphasis on the post-9/11 period—where we see the confluence of the use of high violence strategies, the rise of global terrorist organizations fueled by globalization, and increasing religious radicalization. 3 Second, terrorists are continually searching for new means to facilitate increasingly violent and spectacular attacks that will gain visibility for and further their causes. Attacks have become more frequent and more violent. Prior to the Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in the late 1990s, for instance, global casualties from terrorist attacks were fewer than 500 per year. 4 The Embassy bombings caused casualties in the thousands, and then the attacks of 9/11caused over 3,000 deaths with many more injured. In compiling terrorism trends for 2008, the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) identified 11,770 attacks that killed 15,765 (see figure 1). 5 A note of caution is in order for the reader who might want to directly compare the casualty figures. The different counting rules and definitions certainly contribute to some of the disparities noted. Additionally, the NCTC data include attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, which some might consider related to an insurgency rather than terrorist action. Still, the increases in violence and number of attacks are worth considering. A statement by noted terrorism expert Brian Jenkins summarizes the trends in terrorism: Over the past three decades, terrorists have multiplied the number of their victims by an order of magnitude every 15 years. In the 1970s, the bloodiest incidents involved tens of fatalities. By the 1990s, hundreds were killed and the incidents increased. In 2001, the number reached the thousands, and today we fear scenarios in which tens of thousands might die. 6 Third, general agreement now exists that terrorists are “rational” actors. Their actions may not be understood by their victims or the governments and law enforcement agencies that attempt to deal with these threats, but they are far from random irrational acts. One noted expert identifies alienation, humiliation, demographics, history, and territory as grievances that motivate terrorists. 7 Fourth, and related to their rational actor status, terrorists have constituencies they must satisfy. High violence strategies that indiscriminately kill and maim large numbers of people are not desirable as a long-term tactic. Likewise, failure to adequately gain visibility and promote a cause will likely be seen as ineffective by these constituencies. This will serve as both a motivating influence and a moderating factor that will feature prominently into the bioterror question. Fifth, the question of whether a terrorist will employ a unique means such as biological weapons is directly related to the ability to develop the capabilities, intentions, and knowledge necessary for perpetrating a bioterror attack. Some terrorist groups will likely find it outside of their operational envelope to employ such a technique. Others may find development of these capabilities too technically challenging. Still others may determine that use of these weapons may present an existential threat to the terrorist should the attacked nation employ a massive retaliatory effort (assuming, of course, that the perpetrators can be identified). </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Finally, terrorism today does not represent an existential threat to the United States or our friends and allies. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">However, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">this could change should terrorists develop or acquire the capability for conducting a WMD attack using either nuclear or biological weapons</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. In a harbinger of what the future might hold, Bruce Hoffman noted ominously that “many of the constraints (both self-imposed and technical) which previously limited terrorist use of WMD are eroding.” 8 What Is Biological Warfare? </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Biological warfare is the intentional use of microbes to cause disease in a target population.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Microbes are inherent in all life forms and include bacteria, viruses, protozoa, algae, and fungi. While some microbes are responsible for causing disease, many others serve vital functions for supporting all forms of plant and animal life. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">In BW, the attempt is to effectively and efficiently deploy weapons composed of biological material to attack a target and achieve a desired objective. The use of biological weapons is not a new tactic and in fact predates the understanding of disease</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. The history of biological warfare can be traced back to medieval times including the siege of Caffa on the Crimean Peninsula, the use of blood-laced arrows against enemies, and the catapulting of human and animal carcasses into enemy encampments and fortifications during the Crusades. The modern history of biological weapons includes programs by some 20 states beginning in the 1940s to the present. Often-cited efforts include the Japanese use of BW against China and captured prisoners in the World War II period; the massive Soviet program that continued through the end of the Cold War; and the programs and cooperation among Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States that began in the 1940s and continued until the United States unilaterally denounced biological weapons and toxins in 1969. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The modern history of BW also includes the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which was the first arms control treaty that banned the use of an entire class of weapons for offensive purposes. Also part of this history is the limited success the BWC has had with regard to halting the development of offensive BW capabilities by some of the convention’s signatory nation</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">s. The history of bioterror incidents is also instructive. One study concluded that from 1900 to 2003, there were only 77 total incidents. The data do not encompass state-sponsored BW or hoaxes. 9 The hoaxes in particular would include a large number of “incidents” as they tend to outnumber actual events by as much as 100 to 1. 10 The small number of incidents and the uniqueness of each limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions from the data. Instead, each requires analysis to determine the key parameters and outcomes that defined it and ultimately the success or failure of the attack. An important note is that </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">during combat operations in Afghanistan in 2001, documents were seized indicating al Qaeda’s interest in developing a BW capability</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">; few details have emerged concerning the intended purpose of the weapons or how far their developmental effort have progressed. In understanding BW, several factors contribute directly to the ability to develop and employ an effective biological weapon, including the agent or pathogen, deployment method, formulation, manufacturing process, and meteorological and terrain conditions. 11 It is instructive in understanding the potential for a bioterror attack to appreciate the choices that must be made. Will the agent be a bacteria, virus, or toxin? Should a contagious or noncontagious pathogen be selected? Should a lethal or an incapacitating agent be used? These initial decisions begin to determine the type of attack that will be possible and even the manner in which it should be conducted. In examining the deployment method, will the agent be delivered by aerosol, vector, food, or water? Will the pathogen be delivered using an explosive device or a spray nozzle? The formulation of the pathogen is also important. Will a wet or dry agent be used? Will the material be stabilized to make it more efficient and able to remain airborne for a longer period? What is the manufacturing process? How and in what quantities will the material be grown to mount an attack against the envisioned target? Will the material be dried and milled? What size are the particles? Do they support efficient respiratory infection or are they too large to be inhaled and remain deeply embedded in the alveoli within the lungs? Even once the initial agent, deployment method, formulation, and manufacturing process have been determined, success in the attack ultimately depends on the meteorological conditions when the weapon is deployed. What is the wind speed? Will the weapon be deployed in a city or open terrain? What time of day? Is there an inversion that would keep the agent on the ground and therefore be more effective against the intended target? These questions relate to the potential effectiveness of the biological weapon; however, another set of considerations is directly related to the effectiveness of the attack. They include the concentration, dose, stability, and target susceptibility. In considering these factors, the goal of the bioweaponeer is to have the highest concentration of organisms per milliliter or gram (depending on whether a liquid or dry formulation is used) of material. Another consideration is the lethal dose (LD) or infective dose (ID), which is normally measured in LD50 and ID50 , respectively, and relates to the dose required to cause mortality or infection in 50 percent of the people exposed. This becomes a major factor in considering the agent for weaponization. Consider that for the disease tularemia, the LD50 is approximately 50 organisms, while for anthrax it is approximately 8,000 spores. However, there are always tradeoffs to be made. Francisella tularensis, the organism responsible for tularemia, is highly susceptible to the environment and experiences biological decay at a rate of 2.5 to 5 percent per minute (depending on meteorological conditions and the weaponization of the pathogen), while Bacillus anthracis, the anthrax organism, is a hearty spore that experiences virtually no biological decay. The final consideration of target susceptibility is another important factor. Ultimately, the success of an attack will be determined by whether the deployed BW weapon will infect the target population in the appropriate manner to cause disease. If the target population has been vaccinated or is not susceptible to the weapon or if protective measures have been taken, the attack will fail. For example, if an anthrax attack against troops is initiated, but the soldiers all have personal protective equipment and have been vaccinated against the pathogen, the attack most likely will not be successful. An important note is in order at this point. When terms such as LD50 and ID50 are used, they normally are based on what the medical and public health community knows about the effect of the naturally occurring strains of the bacteria and viruses. But what if the biological material has been altered such that fewer particles cause disease or the virulence of the material reduces the incubation time? This would be the likely goal of a bioweaponeer. This previous set of questions contains a mix of operational and technical issues that the bioterrorist would need to master for a successful attack. It also serves as fodder for those who claim that developing a BW capacity is a nontrivial task too difficult for a terrorist to master. But what are the facts? Dual-use Technologies </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Central to the question of the potential for a bioterror attack is the ability of the terrorist to develop a viable BW capability, implying mastery of the biology, the technology for dispersing the pathogen, and the development of a scenario aligned with the objectives sought. Some believe that the technology is too sophisticated for mastery by a terrorist and that specialized capabilities are required.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Advocates of this position state that other terrorists such as Aum Shinrikyo and the Rajneeshee cult failed to acquire, process, weaponize, and successfully deploy a biological weapon. In another example, a postdoctoral student was given a year to develop this scenario using the pathogen Francisella tularensis. At the end of that period, when the results were briefed, the student had made three fatal errors that would have doomed the effort and prevented a successful attack. 12 In yet another anecdote that alludes to the difficulties of developing a biological weapons capability, Jerzy Mierzejewski, the retired director of the Polish biological defense laboratories who spent his career working with Clostridium botulinum, lamented that “one culture cycle would produce toxin that was lethal and a few months later the next would not, and so on over the years.” 13 Others argue that the development of biological weapons is almost trivial. One author wrote that producing biological weapons was “about as complicated as manufacturing beer and less dangerous than refining heroin.” </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">In seminar presentations a few years ago, former Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey claimed that “a B-plus high school chemistry student” could produce biological agents, and at a January 2000 meeting he described producing biological agents as being “about as difficult as producing beer.”</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> In her book The Ultimate Terrorist, Jessica Stern quotes Kathleen </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Bailey</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> who, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">after interviewing professors, graduate students, and pharmaceutical manufacturers, concluded that several biologists with only $10,000 worth of equipment could produce a significant quantity of biological agent</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. 14 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">In fact, the U.S. Government conducted an experiment in which a small team of experts was tasked with determining the feasibility of developing an “anthrax” weapon using readily available capabilities and equipment. The initiative—Project Bacchus— was sponsored by the</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Defense Threat Reduction Agency (</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">DTRA</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">) and demonstrated that</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> the development of these capabilities is not particularly complex or costly</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. 15 Does this important issue really come down to a question of whom one believes? </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Other insights can be gleaned from examining the trends in biotechnology that are placing ever increasing knowledge and capabilities in the hands of more people around the globe, undoubtedly including some who would use the technology for other than noble purposes.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> In fact, many believe that </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">we have entered the Age of Biotechnology</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. On the face of it, such a statement means little without further examining the likely impact for </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">key technologies</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> that </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">could be</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> used for the benefit of humankind or just as readily turned into </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">deadly weapons of mass destruction</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> One study conducted by the</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Department of Defense (</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">DOD</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">) concluded that capabilities</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> in several key technologies are experiencing a doubling every 6 months—a 400 percent increase per yea</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">r. Areas experiencing such increases include cell growth chambers and fermenters, encapsulization and stabilization, the human genome, pathogen efficacy, DNA engineering, sensors, vaccines and antibiotics, and nucleic acid synthesis. 16 By way of an example, the rate of vaccine development doubled every 5 years from 1940 to 1970. From 1970 to 1980, the rate increased fivefold such that the time to double the capabilities in the field of vaccines was 1 year. Over the next 20-year period from 1980 to 2000, the time to double in capability decreased to 6 months. Another field, DNA engineering, not even in existence until 1982, has doubled in capacity every 6 months since. This area is critically important to a variety of biotechnical advances including gene therapy, vaccine development, and sensors, as well as the potential of ominously increasing the virulence of a pathogen. The same is true for encapsulization and stabilization, which have potential for enhancing personal protection and therapeutics as well as making BW weapons more effective and stable in the environment. 17 As an example of what the future might hold, a recent article discusses the development of an artificial polio virus synthesized with nonliving components combined using specialized equipment and chemicals. 18 While this early work provides a proof of concept, genetic engineering and combinatorial chemistry in the future will allow for largescale, rapid synthesizing of peptides, polynucleotides, and other low weight molecular material, allowing for manipulation of the very building blocks of life. The polio virus, with its relatively simple structure and 8,000 base pairs in its genomic sequence, provides a glimpse into the possibilities as well as highlighting the potential for the development of, for instance, the smallpox virus in this manner. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Artificial development of the smallpox virus, with 200,000 base pairs and a considerably more complex structure, in this manner remains out of reach for the moment, but the Age of Biotechnology will likely make this development possible in the future.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Couple this with the ready </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">availability of the genomic sequences from a wide variety of disease-causing pathogens and organisms, and one can easily predict the potential for artificially developing pathogens, manipulating current pathogens to make them more virulent, or perhaps developing antibiotic-/ antiviral-resistant pathogens</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> Attempts to control or limit advances in biotechnology seem fruitless with an industry that has such potential for improving the quality of life and that comprises such a large part of the U.S. and global economies</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Additionally, the dual-use nature of biotechnology—that is, the very capabilities that allow </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">for developing prophylaxes and treatments and can be employed just as effectively for developing biological weapons—results in a conundrum that we cannot fail to recognize.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Framework for Analysis Successful employment of a bioterror weapon implies that a lone terrorist or terrorist organization has mastered five steps: acquire, process, and weaponize a pathogen, and plan the attack and deploy the weapon so as to cause disease in a target population. However successful, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">employment of a bioterror weapon should not be considered in isolation, but rather should be thought of as a two-sided proposition where our capabilities in preparedness and response as articulated in the D</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">epartment of </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">H</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">omeland </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">S</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">ecurity’s </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">doctrine of prevent, protect, respond, and recovery interact to either facilitate or hinder the terrorists’ capabilities in varying degrees across each of the five steps</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. This framework forms a matrix that allows us to consider this two-sided equation in detail (see figure 2). For our purposes, the matrix has been color-coded to reflect our ability to affect each of the bioterrorist’s necessary steps. A useful exercise is to look at the matrix in greater detail to gain an understanding of the potential for a bioterror incident and our ability to positively affect outcomes. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Our ability to prevent a terrorist from acquiring, processing, and weaponizing biological material is limited.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Deadly pathogens</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> are naturally occurring, and with the proliferation in the life sciences of knowledge, equipment, and capabilities, these collective steps have experienced a lowering of thresholds that allows for more biotechnology in the hands of a larger number of people, some of whom may desire to employ these capabilities as weapons. Equipment for fermentation, freeze drying, and milling—which can be found readily in local hardware stores or ordered from the comfort of one’s home—allows for developing and weaponizing these biological capabilities.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> This is not to say that all pathogens will be available to all terrorists. International efforts to prevent biological proliferation activities such as the Australia Group and the Proliferation Security Initiative have limited effectiveness given that pathogens are naturally occurring and that the equipment requirements for processing pathogens are not particularly sophisticated. Some will prove to be too difficult or dangerous to work with; however, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">a determined terrorist hoping to develop a basic BW capability would see thresholds lowered</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. In short, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">biological material suitable for use in an attack has become less technically challenging and therefore made these biological capabilities more readily available. Impacting the terrorists’ ability to acquire, process, and weaponize a pathogen is also limited by the modest requirements for developing a BW capability</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Unlike nuclear </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">weapons that have a requirement for highly specialized equipment and radioactive material with a large footprint and distinctive signature, BW weapons can be constructed in a small, confined space with little need for complex equipment and no discernible signature</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. In fact, the </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">DTRA study conducted as part of Project Bacchus established this clearly.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> We do have some ability to prevent terrorists from successfully planning and deploying such weapons. For example, buildings can be designed to prevent employment of biological weapons in certain scenarios. Standoff distances and limiting access to air intake systems will limit use of biological weapons against these types of hardened targets. In the category of protection, we do have greater ability to affect outcomes. Terrorists desiring to acquire, process, and weaponize a pathogen such as anthrax would likely be deterred from doing so if they intended to employ the BW weapon against a population that had been fully immunized against the pathogen. Development of vaccines and therapeutics can have an important deterrent effect as well. Likewise, conducting an attack against a building that has defensive measures built into the air handling system would probably not result in a successful attack and therefore would also serve as a deterrence measure. Developing and fielding new realtime sensors that provide a detect-to-warn capability will also be important. Today, the current suite of sensors, such as those in the BioWatch 19 program, are detect-to-treat with relatively long periods between exposure and establishing that an attack has occurred. This period may be as long as a day or more. In the future, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">new age biotechnological capabilities should begin to allow for real-time detection that will permit warning of the attack as it is occurring so people can be moved out of the attack area and begin receiving immediate treatment, and potential victims can be prevented from entering contaminated areas.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Protection also implies the employment of risk-based strategies to determine where attacks are most likely, and the deployment of deterrence and countermeasures to ensure adequate coverage of important locations and facilities. Examining the last two categories, respond and recover, we reach two important conclusions. First, these actions have no applicability to the terrorists’ ability to acquire, process, or weaponize a biological weapon. Second, these areas offer the greatest potential for us to affect outcomes with well considered and emplaced programs. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Response begins with the ability to sense that an attack is in progress or has occurred.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> It is related to our sensor technology as part of the BioWatch program, but also includes improved biosurveillance, stockpiling of critical treatments and vaccines, increased resilience in the health care system to handle surge requirements envisioned from a bioterror attack, and trained and ready first responders. The BioSense 20 and BioShield 21 programs are a start at improving biosurveillance and stockpiling, respectively, but more can and must be done. The readiness of our public health community and first responders is also a vital link in this system. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 21, “Public Health and Medical Preparedness,” of October 2007 identified the four most critical components of public health and medical preparedness as biosurveillance, countermeasure distribution, mass casualty care, and community resilience. 22 </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Today, we have no national biosurveillance system. Rather, we have a collection of state and local systems that have been cobbled together and that continue to rely on the capabilities of astute clinicians, doctors, and public health personnel. The picture is even worse globally as much of the reporting is spotty and incomplete at best, and even subject to politicization.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Certainly, we have the technical capability to develop an automated disease tracking system linked to hospitals, clinics, and public health facilities. Perhaps the more relevant question is whether we have the political will. On a positive note, the World Health Organization International Health Regulations that establish requirements for global disease reporting by 2012 represent an important step in global biosurveillance. Just as advances in biotechnology allow for the proliferation of increasingly dangerous dual-use capabilities, they also provide a greater capacity to develop new age treatments and prophylaxes. In the future, developing technologies such as DNA engineering and combinatorial chemistry combined with emerging technology such as nanotechnology will provide new opportunities for fighting naturally occurring disease as well as bioterror attacks. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The importance of casualty care and community resilience cannot be overstated. A bioterror attack will likely result in a mass casualty situation with large numbers of affected individuals and worried well converging on hospitals, clinics, and treatment facilities. The ability to rapidly assess and treat, instill public confidence, and communicate effectively will be essential for a quick response and recovery effort</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. The implications of the framework are important to developing comprehensive programs that are both effective and efficient in dealing with an attack. In an era of scarce resources, we must ensure that we are spending wisely. Biological laboratory safety and control of dual-use technologies have received much attention recently. Deficiencies at biological safety level (BSL) laboratories, both in the labs and in their physical security, have been publically noted. Better controls are necessary for BSL facilities, but they are not sufficient. Likewise, efforts such as those by the Australia Group 23 and through the Proliferation Security Initiative 24 have less applicability for biological weapons where the pathogens are naturally occurring, and there are only modest requirements for developing and deploying BW weapons. This strongly implies that novel approaches must be developed for preventing, responding to, or recovering from a potential bioterror attack. Bioterrorism is a very real and growing threat. We have seen a new type of terrorist emerge since the 1970s with a greater tendency toward taking global action and employing high violence strategies. This emerging terrorist has also demonstrated the propensity to employ nontraditional means such as airliners and fertilizers as weapons of mass destruction.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> It is becoming increasingly likely with trends in biotechnology that terrorists will turn to the use of biological pathogens for perpetrating bioterror attacks. The nature of BW suggests that our ability to prevent such bioterror attacks cannot be assured, given the natural availability of disease-causing pathogens and advances in biotechnology that are allowing proliferation of potentially dangerous biological capabilities. However, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">we control our own destiny with regard to protecting populations and mounting an effective response and recovery.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> All indications are that the time to prepare is now.</span>

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">A looming danger confronts the world—the threat of bioviolence. It is a danger that will only grow in the future, yet we are increasingly failing to confront it. With every passing day, committing a biocatastrophe becomes a bit easier, and this condition will perpetuate for as long as science progresses.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Biological warfare is as old as conflict, of course, but in terms of the objectives of traditional warfare— gaining territory or resources, compelling the surrender of an opposing army—biological weapons weren’t very effective. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">If the objective is to inflict mass death and panic on a mixed population,</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> however, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">emerging bioweapons offer remarkable potential. We would be irresponsible to presume that radical jihadists like al Qaeda have ignored said potential</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. What’s New in Bioviolence? </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Bioviolence refers to the many ways to inflict disease as well as the many people who might choose to do so, whether heads of states, criminals, or fanatics</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Fortunately, doing bioviolence is technically far more difficult than using conventional explosives. Natural pathogens like anthrax are difficult to weaponize. Smallpox remains unavailable (presumably); plague is readily treatable; Ebola kills too quickly to ignite a pandemic. But </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">emerging scientific disciplines—notably genomics, nanotechnology, and other microsciences— could alter these pathogens for use as weapons. These scientific disciplines offer profound benefits for humanity, yet there is an ominous security challenge in minimizing the danger of their hostile application</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. For example, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">highly dangerous agents can be made resistant to vaccines or antibiotics. In Australia, scientists introduced a gene into mousepox (a cousin of smallpox) to reduce pest populations—it worked so well that it wiped out 100% of affected mice, even those that had immunity against the disease. Various bacterial agents, such as plague or tularemia (rabbit fever), could be altered to increase their lethality or to evade antibiotic treatment. Diseases once thought to be eradicated can now be resynthesized, enabling them to spread in regions where there is no natural immunity</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. The polio virus has been synthesized from scratch; its creators called it an “animate chemical.” Soon, it may be resynthesized into a form that is contagious even among vaccinated populations. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Recreation of long eradicated livestock diseases could ravage herds severely lacking in genetic diversity, damage food supplies , and cause devastating economic losses. Perhaps the greatest biothreat is the manipulation of the flu and other highly contagious viruses, such as Ebola. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Today, scientists can change parts of a virus’s genetic material so that it can perform specific functions. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">The genomic sequence of the Spanish flu virus that killed upwards of 40 million people nearly a century ago has been widely published; any savvy scientist could reconstruct it.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> The avian flu is even more lethal, albeit not readily contagious via casual aerosol delivery. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">A malevolent bioscientist might augment its contagiousness. The Ebola virus might be manipulated so that it kills more slowly, allowing it to be spread farther before its debilitating effects altogether consume its carrier. A bit further off is genetic manipulation of the measles virus—one of the great killers in human history—rendering useless the immunizations that most of us receive in early childhood. Soon, laboratory resynthesis of smallpox may be possible. Advanced drug delivery systems can be used to disseminate lethal agents to broad populations.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Bioregulators — small organic compounds that modify body systems— could enhance targeted delivery technologies. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Some experts are concerned that new weapons could be aimed at the immune, neurological, and neuroendocrine systems. Nanotechnology that lends itself to mechanisms for advanced disease detection and drug delivery—such as gold nanotubes that can administer drugs directly into a tumor—could also deliver weaponized agents deep into the body, substantially raising the weapon’s effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Altogether, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">techniques that were on the frontiers of science only a decade or two ago are rapidly mutating as progress in the biological sciences enables new ways to produce lethal catastrophe. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Today, they are on the horizon. Within a decade, they will be pedestrian. According to the National Academies of Science, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">“The threat spectrum is broad and evolving—in some ways predictably, in other ways unexpectedly. In the future, genetic engineering and other technologies may lead to the development of pathogenic organisms with unique, unpredictable characteristics.” For as far into the future as we can possibly see, every passing day it becomes slightly easier to commit a violent catastrophe than it was the day before.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Indeed, the rapid pace of advancing science helps explain why policies to prevent such a catastrophe are so complicated. Bioviolence Jihad? </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Some experts argue that terrorists and fanatics are not interested in bioviolence and that the danger might therefore be overblown. Since there have been no catastrophic bioviolence attacks, these experts argue, terrorists lack the intention to make bioweapons</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Hopefully, they are correct.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> But an enormous amount of evidence suggests they are wrong. From the dawn of biology’s ability to isolate pathogens, people have pursued hostile applications of biological agents. It is perilous to ignore this extensive history by presuming that today’s villains are not fervent about weaponizing disease</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Not a single state admits to having a bioweapons program, but U.S. intelligence officials assert that as many as 10 states might have active programs, including North Korea, Iran, and Syria. Moreover, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">many terrorist organizations have expressed interest in acquiring biological weapons. Whatever weight the taboo against inflicting disease might have for nation-states, it is obviously irrelevant to terrorists, criminals, and lunatics. Deterrence by threat of retaliation is essentially meaningless for groups with suicidal inclinations who are likely to intermingle with innocent civilians. Al -Qaeda and affiliated Islamic fundamentalist organizations have overtly proclaimed their intention to develop and use bioweapons. The 11th volume of al-Qaeda’s Encyclopedia of Jihad is devoted to chemical and biological weapons. Indeed, alQaeda has acknowledged that “biological weapons are considered the least complicated and easiest to manufacture of all weapons of mass destruction.” Al-Qaeda is widely reported to have acquired legal pathogens via publicly available scientific sources. Before 9/11, al-Qaeda operatives reportedly purchased anthrax and plague from arms dealers in Kazakhstan, and the group has repeatedly urged followers to recruit microbiology and biotechnology experts. Following the Taliban’s fall, five al Qaeda biological weapons labs in Afghanistan tested positive for anthrax. Documents calculating aerial dispersal methods of anthrax via balloon were discovered in Kabul, along with anthrax spore concentrate at a nearby vaccine laboratory. According to a lengthy fatwa commissioned by Osama bin Laden, jihadists are entitled to use weapons of mass destruction against the infidels, even if it means killing innocent women, children, and Muslims. No matter that these weapons cannot be specifically targeted. “[N]othing is a greater duty, after faith itself, than repelling an enemy attacker who sows corruption to religion and the world.” According to the fatwa, “No conditions limit this: one repels the enemy however one can.” The sentiment might be reprehensible, but it is certainly not irrational. Even the most passionate terrorists must realize that conventional attacks are not bringing the West to its knees. The 9/11 strikes, the bombing of the Madrid and London subways, and numerous smaller attacks have all put civilization on edge, but history marches inexorably forward.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> A few thousand people can be killed, yet Western armies still traverse the world, and Western economies still determine winners and losers. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">From this perspective, the stakes must be raised. Bioviolence is perhaps the most dire, easiest means to execute existential danger.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> What Might Bioviolence Accomplish? Envision a series of attacks against capitals of developing states that have close diplomatic linkages with the United States. The attacks would carry a well-publicized yet simple warning: “If you are a friend of the United States, receive its officials, or support its policies , thou sands of your people will get sick . ” How many attacks in how many cities would it take before international diplomacy, to say nothing of international transit, comes to a crashing halt? </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">In comparison to use of conventional or chemical weapons, the potential death toll of a bioattack could be huge.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Although the number of victims would depend on where an attack takes place, the type of pathogen, and the sophistication of the weapons maker, there is widespread consensus among experts that a heightened attack would inflict casualties exceedable only by nuclear weapons. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">In comparison to nuclear weapons, bioweapons are far easier and cheaper to make and transport, and they can be made in facilities that are far more difficult to detect. The truly unique characteristic of certain bioweapons that distinguishes them from every other type of weapon is contagion. No other type of weapon can replicate itself and spread. Any other type of attack, no matter how severe, occurs at a certain moment in time at an identifiable place. If you aren’t there, you are angry and upset but not physically injured by the attack. An attack with a contagious agent can uniquely spread, potentially imperiling target populations far from where the agents are released. A bio-offender could infect his minions with a disease and send them across borders before symptoms are obvious. Carriers will then spread it to other unsuspecting victims who would themselves become extended bioweapons, carrying the disease indiscriminately</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. There are challenges in executing such an attack, but </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">fanatical terrorist organizations seem to have an endless supply of willing suicide attackers</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. All this leads to the most important characteristic of </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">bioviolence</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">: It </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">raises incomparable levels of panic. Contagious bioviolence means that planes fly empty or perhaps don’t fly at all. People cancel vacation and travel plans and refuse to interact with each other for fear of unseen affliction.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Public entertainment events are canceled; even going to a movie becomes too dangerous. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Ultimately, bioviolence is about hiding our children as everyone becomes vulnerable to our most fundamental terror: the fear of disease. For people who seek to rattle the pillars of modern civilization and perhaps cause it to collapse, effective use of disease would set in motion political, economic, and health consequences so severe as to call into question the ability of existing governments to maintain their citizens’ security.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> In an attack’s wake, no one would know when it is over, and no government could credibly tell an anxious population where and when it is safe to resume normal life. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">While it is difficult to specify when this danger will strike, there should be no doubt that we are vulnerable to a rupture. Just as planes flying into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, instantly became a historical marker dividing strategic perspectives before from after, the day that disease is effectively used as an instrument of hate will profoundly change everything. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">If you want to stop modern civilization in its tracks, bioviolence is the way to go.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;"> The notion that no one will ever commit catastrophic bioviolence is simply untenable.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> What Can We Do? </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">How can we confront these growing dangers?</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> First, we must appreciate the global nature of the problem. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Perpetrators from anywhere can get pathogens from virtually everywhere. Bioresearch labs that once were concentrated in about two dozen developed states are proliferating, expanding the risk that lethal agents could be diverted and misused. The knowledge needed to weaponize pathogens is available on the Internet. An attack can be prepared through easy networks of transnational communication</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Once a bioweapon is prepared, terrorists or other perpetrators from anywhere can slide across national boundaries and release disease anonymously. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Once released, a contagious agent would spread without regard for boundaries, race, religion, or nationality. Public health responses would have to be internationally coordinated</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. New modes of international legal cooperation would immediately be needed to investigate the crime. Thus, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">bioviolence dangers shrink the planet into an interdependent neighborhood. It makes no sense for any particular country to try to insulate its homeland from these dangers. No missile defense system will protect us from bioviolence.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Improved border security will not keep disease at bay. National efforts to enhance medical preparedness have virtues, but these defenses can be readily circumvented. To prevent bioviolence requires policies that focus on humanity as a species and that are implemented everywhere with centralized governance. Antibioviolence policies must be global. Ye t , advanc ing ant i -bioviol enc e policies is what the international community does worst. Bioviolence dangers are unnecessarily high because national and international antibioviolence strategies are gap-ridden, often incoherent, and not globally observed. As a result, we are all virtually naked in the face of unacceptable dangers. No other threat presents such a stark contrast between severity of harm and a failure of leadership to reduce risks. Most important, existing institutional arrangements are inadequate. In sharp contrast to most other global security challenges, there is no responsible international authority that defines relevant prohibitions and responsibilities, implements policies over time, or evaluates whether obligations are being fulfilled. With regard to global bioviolence prevent i o n p o l i c i e s , t h e r e ’ s n o b o d y i n charge. No one is responsible; no one is accountable. The absence of authority is profoundly dangerous. Bioviolence prevention and preparedness requires a sizable orchestra, made up of various instruments, to play complicated music in harmony. Today, there is not a bad “conductor”, there is no conductor at all. The result is cacophony. Simply stated, bioviolence is the dark s ide of global izat ion, ye t int e rna tional alarms of bioviolence ring nowhere! We need a comprehensive national and international strategy for bioviol enc e prevent ion . [See box: “Five S t r a t e g i e s f o r P r e v e n t i n g B i oviolence,” page 30.] Policies should be pursued within an integrated approach that enables each policy to gain strength from all the others. Such policies are potentially available and effective, but they demand progressive changes in our global order. The Security Mission Global bioviolence prevention and preparedness policies are imperative, but also imperative is recognition that the world faces natural disease horrors. Where mass public health challenges are daily phenomena, the risks of terrorists using pathogens must be weighed against more tangible natural threats. Simply stated, it is illegitimate to insist that every nation adopt policies for preventing human-inflicted disease without acknowledging the silent genocide of natural disease that is responsible for millions of deaths. But neither is it legitimate to view bioviolence dangers as distractions from efforts to combat natural disease and therefore to put off beneficial measures until those afflictions are defeated. To do so frustrates forward movement on cost-effective initiatives that could help build an international security architecture for advancing science and health. Thus, bioviolence prevention must be a facet of a broad international commitment to: 1. Prevent the spread of disease ( e .g. , through publ i c -heal th measures). 2. Enhance protection against and cures for disease (e.g., through vaccination and drug therapies). 3. Supervise the conduct of biological science. 4. Criminalize unauthorized or improper use of pathogens. From this foundation should flow a policy commitment to the growth of bioscience as a global public good. Policies to encourage its worldwide spread deserve vigorous support. This governance mission should, therefore, be conceived as a global covenant . As bios c i enc e goe s forward as a fundamental pillar of human progress, all nations must undertake common responsibilities to prevent bioviolence even as the burdens associated with those responsibilities are differentiated according to wealth and capability. From everyone according to their abilities—to all for the benefit of all. The United Nations’ Importance The United Nations represents the b e s t venu e fo r a new gove rnanc e platform that can accommodate the need for an integrated global strategy agains t bioviol enc e . Only the United Nations has the necessary in ternational legitimacy, and only the Uni t ed Nat ions can int egrat e the many sectors—health, law enforcement, science, military, emergency preparedness—that must devote expertise and resources. A primary consideration here is to minimize any bureaucratic reshuffling. There is certainly no need to modify or replicate existing capabilities. Many relevant governance tasks are already addressed by one or more international organizations. For example, the World Health Organization should continue to be responsible for addressing the health implications of a pandemic, whether natural or malevolent. Interpol should continue to be responsible for a d d re s s i n g b i o v i o l e n c e ’ s l aw e nforcement implications. Indeed, the UN’s role should be only to coordinate the performance of these tasks. Broadly viewed, the United Nations should be able to undertake three functions: First, a specific UN agency should stimulate bioscience development by incorporating security concerns into the fabric of scientific undertakings and by assisting countries in using bioscience in ways that are consistent with policies for preventing bioviolence. Because science, development, and security can and must be mutually reinforcing, this agency’s primary responsibilities would be to promote and distribute knowledge and build capacity to fulfill obligations, especially in developing nations. Second, a UN office should coordinate activities among the relevant international/regional organizations, professional networks, and expert bodies. For example, three major international organizations focus on health (World Health Organization, Animal Health Organization, and the Food and Agriculture Organization); Interpol and Europol both focus on law enforcement; a large array of organizations focus on conveyance of dangerous items (e.g., International Maritime Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization). This UN office should be a steering mechanism to engage each of these orga nizations’ specialized expertise and to identify synergies. Third, a Security Council Committee should be authorized to investigate bioviolence preparations as well as respond and coordinate assistance to a bioviolence attack. Situations that call for investigation or response arise rarely, but they carry disproportionate significance for international peace and security. The Security Council Committee should not advance programmatic agendas, but it should be able to wield expertise and political muscle in volatile situations. Its primary mission would be to enable the international community to sustain global order in the face of a bioviolence challenge.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Ever since someone harnessed a new technology to create a weapon with more devastating effects, there has been a link—a double helix—between the progress of science and the pursuit of security. This is inevitable.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> These dangers of bioviolence do not a rg u e f o r re l i n q u i s h i n g s c i e n t i f i c progress, but they disprove notions tha t n ew cha l l eng e s can b e e ff e ct ive ly addre s s ed wi th ye s t e rday’ s policies. </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">At bottom is a condition unique to this historical era: Scientific progress is intertwined with escalating malevolence threatening human security. Progressing capabilities improve our lives and yet, inextricably, enable truly harmful weapons against humanity. Here are the challenges to international peace and security at the beginning of the third millennium. Failing to do the right thing in response to these challenges could have dire consequences for all humanity. </span>

Staff responsible for managing ITS systems need knowledge in a variety of areas, including project management and systems engineering, according to two FHWA division office ITS engineers. Workforce demographic changes, the competitive labor market, new technologies, and new expectations in the transportation industry combine to make attracting and retaining a capable workforce difficult for state and local transportation agencies</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. In addition, a 2011 National Cooperative Highway Research Program study found that </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">U.S. universities produce too few skilled applicants for state and local DOTs. These issues combine to affect the ability of state and local agencies, especially smaller agencies, to manage ITS.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Many </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">state and local transportation agencies struggle to maintain inhouse staff with the skills and knowledge needed to manage ITS projects</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. Eight of the 15 experts we spoke with noted that agencies face challenges in maintaining staff with the expertise and skills needed for ITS. For example, 1 expert noted that ITS requires skills that civil engineers—with whom transportation agencies are generally well staffed—are not specifically trained in, such as understanding electrical systems, communication networks, and interagency relationship building. Another expert noted difficulty finding staff with other skills necessary to ITS management, such as contract management, systems integration, and information technology troubleshooting skills. In addition</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">, the fast pace of technological change and resource limitations put more demands on transportation officials and limit training opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> RITA officials told us that transportation agencies need systems engineers to manage ITS deployment and operations but do not have them in sufficient numbers. For example, a local government official told us he has been unable to fill a vacant ITS-related engineering position because of a hiring freeze that has been in effect for over 3 years. According to this official, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">this makes it difficult to complete ITS projects even when funds for projects are available.</span>

**<span class="TagChar" style="background-color: #ffffff;">Ezell, ’10 </span>**<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">[January, 2010, Stephen Ezell is a Senior Analyst with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, B.S. from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, with an Honors Certificate from Georgetown’s Landegger International Business Diplomacy program, “Intelligent Transportation Systems”, The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, [[http://www.itif.org/files/2010-1-27-ITS_Leadership.pdf]]]</span>
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">At the outset, this report provided a taxonomy classifying ITS applications into five categories. But another lens to categorize ITS applications, one more relevant to understanding ITS challenges, is to distinguish between two classes of ITS applications: 1) Those that can be deployed locally on an independent basis and deliver value, and 2) Those that must be deployed as part of a scalable interrelated system to deliver meaningful value. The distinction is useful because </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">many ITS applications are subject to system interdependency challenges, require system coordination to deploy, and must operate at scale to be effective.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In this dichotomy, the first class includes ITS applications such as ramp meters, computerized smart signals, roadside cameras, and even local traffic operations centers. Communities or regions can make independent decisions about whether to fund and deploy ramp meters or adaptive traffic signal lights, and these applications will deliver local benefits to motorists without having to be connected to a scaled system or without travelers having to adopt these technologies at the same time. (That is, traffic will flow more smoothly if a city or region optimizes its traffic lights or implements ramp metering, as the Minneapolis region experienced.) But </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">the vast majority of ITS applications—and certainly the ones primed to deliver the most extensive benefits to the transportation network—must operate at scale, often must operate at a national level, and must involve adoption by the overall system and by individual users at the same time to be effective, raising a set of system interdependency, network effect, and system coordination challenges.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">ITS applications that must operate at scale include VII and V2V systems, real-time traffic information systems, electronic toll collection systems, and vehicle miles traveled systems. For example, real-time traffic information systems are system interdependent. If a region or state makes all its roadways intelligent with real-time traffic data, such efforts do little good if motorists do not have telematics displays in their vehicles (or on mobile phones) to receive and act on that information. Likewise, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">consumers are unlikely to demand such devices for their vehicles if a large share of communities does not make that real-time traffic information available.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> VII and V2V systems such as the United States’ IntelliDrive initiative also experience network effects. Each additional IntelliDrive-equipped vehicle on the roadway adds value to the network (and over time, each addition to that network has a positive, downward effect on individual systems’ marginal costs). Moreover, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">VII systems like IntelliDrive must work on a national basis to be truly effective: it does a driver little good to purchase an IntelliDrive-equipped vehicle in Michigan if the system doesn’t operate when he or she is driving in Indiana.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Likewise, electronic toll collection systems present a far better driver experience when motorists can traverse a country with a single fare payment system, instead of having to acquire multiple passes to pay tolls in differing jurisdictions. The same holds true for vehicle miles traveled systems: </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">it makes little sense for states to independently develop a VMT system because, in addition to requiring a device in the vehicle</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> (ideally as part of the original factory-installed equipment), VMT requires a satellite system and a back-end payment system, and it makes little sense for each state independently to replicate investments in the infrastructure. Thus, </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">many intelligent transportation systems are subject to network effect and scale challenges, thus requiring extensive system coordination—often needed at the national level—to deploy and integrate ITS systems.</span>

Contemporary urbanization processes are<span class="Underline"> strongly </span>shaped by<span class="Underline"> the logic and policies of </span>neoliberalism<span class="Underline">.</span> Neoliberal ideology advocates<span class="Underline"> the extension of </span>market-based principles in<span class="Underline"> the arena of the </span>state<span class="Underline"> in order </span>to `liberate'<span class="Underline"> both public </span>services from<span class="Underline"> so-called `</span>state inefficiencies' and capital `squandered' by taxation<span class="Underline"> that could be more profitability deployed by private actors.</span> Accordingly, neoliberal<span class="Underline"> regulatory </span>frameworks promote market discipline<span class="Underline"> over the state, usually </span>achieved by such policy mechanisms as lowering taxes on businesses and the wealthy, shrinking or dismantling public services,<span class="Underline">and subjecting public services to the logic of markets through public - private partnerships or outright privatization</span>.The<span class="Underline"> creative-destructive </span>processes<span class="Underline"> of neoliberal state strategy reconfigure the territorial organization of accumulation, and consequently </span>produce<span class="Underline"> new forms of </span>uneven geographic development<span class="Underline">.</span>
<span class="Underline">The literature on neoliberal urbanization establishes the broader processes of political, economic, and social restructuring and rescaling in response to declining profitability of the Fordist accumulation regime</span> (Brenner and Theodore, 2002; Peck and Tickell, 2002). The roll-back of Fordist regulatory configurations and <span class="Underline">the roll-out of neoliberalization transformed the sociospatial hierarchy of regulatory frameworks with the nation-state as the center of state regulation to a more multiscalar regulatory framework articulated by the interactions of global, national, and local scales</span> (Brenner and Theodore, 2002). Cities emerged as crucial sites of neoliberalization<span class="Underline"> and institutional restructuring. In the U</span>nited <span class="Underline">S</span>tates, neoliberal policies restructured Fordist<span class="Underline"> forms of territorial </span>organization by devolving<span class="Underline"> the relatively </span>centralized<span class="Underline">, managerial -redistributive system of </span>urban planning<span class="Underline"> and financing at the federal level to subregional states and municipalities</span> (Eisinger, 1998; Harvey, 1989). Thus localities were forced to finance<span class="Underline"> local </span>infrastructure, transit<span class="Underline">, housing, </span>and<span class="Underline"> other forms of collective </span>consumption on their own or abandon them<span class="Underline"> altogether. </span>By starving cities<span class="Underline"> of revenues, neoliberal </span>state restructuring rendered states<span class="Underline"> and municipalities </span>more dependent upon<span class="Underline"> locally generated </span>tax revenues<span class="Underline"> as well as intensifying intercity competition</span> (Harvey, 1989).
Cities<span class="Underline"> starved by neoliberal state restructuring </span>responded<span class="Underline"> to their fiscal troubles </span>by adopting entrepreneurial norms<span class="Underline">, practices, and institutional frameworks. Entre-preneurial municipal </span>governments prioritize<span class="Underline"> policies that create </span>a good business climate<span class="Underline"> and competitive advantages for businesses</span> (Harvey, 1989; Smith, 2002) by “reconstituting social welfare<span class="Underline"> provisions </span>as anticompetitive costs'', and by implementing ``a<span class="Underline">n extremely </span>narrow urban policy<span class="Underline"> repertoire based on capital subsidies, place promotion, supply side intervention, central-city makeovers and local boosterism'</span>' (Peck and Tickell, 2002, pages 47 ^ 48). In effect, neoliberal urbanization encourages<span class="Underline"> local </span>governments to retreat from<span class="Underline"> social </span>redistribution and<span class="Underline"> integrated social </span>welfare<span class="Underline"> policies </span>in favor of<span class="Underline"> bolstering </span>business<span class="Underline"> activity</span> (Brenner and Theodore, 2002; Peck and Tickell, 2002; Swyngedouw et al, 2002). As a consequence, entrepreneurial mayors emerged in the 1980s to forge alliances between government and business leaders (what I refer to as the `global city growth machine') under the banner of urban revitalization (Judd and Simpson, 2003). <span class="Underline">City space is mobilized ``as an arena both for market-oriented economic growth and for elite consumption practices'' (Brenner and Theodore, 2002, page 21). <span class="Underline">The abandonment of Fordist planning</span>, privileging a more integrated urban form in favor of selective investment in privileged places, <span class="Underline">has resulted in</span> what scholars have variously deemed as <span class="Underline">a fragmented, polarized, splintered, or quartered urbanity</span> (Graham and Marvin, 2001; Marcuse and van Kempen, 2000; Sassen 1991; Swyngedouw et al, 2002).
The business-friendly policies and practices pursued by entrepreneurial urban governments must also be understood in relation to the global reorganization of production. Global cities emerged as the command and control nodes of the global economy, where multinational headquarters, producer services, and FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) firms cluster (Sassen, 1991). To lure multinational corporate headquarters, producer services, professional ^ managerial workers, and tourists to their city, municipal governments<span class="Underline"> recreate urban space by prioritizing megaprojects and infrastructure that </span>help businesses gain competitive advantages<span class="Underline"> and keep them connected within global networks </span>as well as providing<span class="Underline"> financing and </span>amenities for gentrification, tourism, and<span class="Underline"> cultural </span>consumption (Brenner and Theodore, 2002; Fainstein, 2008; Graham and Marvin, 2001; Peck and Tickell, 2002; Swyngedouw et al, 2002). These<span class="Underline"> urban development </span>strategies are<span class="Underline"> ideologically and discursively </span>legitimized by the global city growth machine as necessary<span class="Underline"> for `global city' or `world-class city' formation</span> (McGuirk, 2004; Wilson, 2004).
Public transportation<span class="Underline"> policy i</span>s one dimension of spatial restructuring<span class="Underline"> deployed by entrepreneurial governments </span>to create place-based competitive advantages for<span class="Underline"> global </span>capital<span class="Underline">. Transportation represents a fixed, place-based geographic element where the local and the global interact; where global processes shape local geographies and where local politics shape global networks.</span> As Keil and Young (2008) suggest, transportation should<span class="Underline"> now </span>be considered in relation to globalized trade<span class="Underline"> and economic networks and consumption-oriented patterns of everyday life. Growth </span>demands<span class="Underline"> in cities experiencing gentrification</span>, the development of luxury consumption spaces, and a surge of tourism <span class="Underline">have </span>placed pressure on<span class="Underline"> local agencies </span>to expand airports, roads, and rail and public transit<span class="Underline"> capacities. Large-scale </span>urban redevelopment plans have made a comeback<span class="Underline"> as city planners conceive of megaprojects that concentrate new public transit investment in the revalorized core</span> (Fainstein, 2008; Keil and Young, 2008; Swyngedouw et al, 2002).
Air transportation has become the leading form of global connectivity, influencing the decisions of global, national, and regional elites to create air-transportation infrastructure (Cidell, 2006; Erie, 2004; Keil and Young, 2008; Phang, 2007). For instance, there is a growing network of world-class cities (Shanghai, London, and Tokyo) that enables air travelers to connect seamlessly from one global city core to the next, with direct express train service from the downtown business core to the city's international airports (Graham and Marvin, 2001). These <span class="Underline">specialized public transit systems more closely integrate a city into global markets</span>, thereby making the city more attractive for business activities (Brenner and Theodore, 2002; Graham, 2000). The resulting<span class="Underline"> “premium </span>network spaces'' are ``geared to the<span class="Underline"> logistical and exchange </span>demands offoreign direct investors, tourist spaces or <span class="Underline">socioeconomically </span>affluent groups'' (Graham and Marvin, 2001, page 100). Interactions with the surrounding residential districts are carefully managed by filtering `proper' users through nonstop services or prohibitively expensive fares. In addition, premium transport services tend to be bundled with upscale shopping centers, entertainment spectacles, hotels, or office spaces to form a giant, integrated bubble of luxury. <span class="Underline">Subsequently, </span>sociospatial relations are reconfigured as<span class="Underline"> premium </span>infrastructure bypasses devalorized places and exclude economically disadvantaged usersfrom<span class="Underline"> accessing the </span>transit<span class="Underline"> service. </span>The<span class="Underline"> neoliberal </span>trend towards premium<span class="Underline"> public </span>transportation <span class="Underline">deployed </span>for<span class="Underline"> the purposes of constructing competitive advantages in </span>the global capitalist system privileges profit making<span class="Underline"> for capital, or exchange-value purposes, and </span>not necessarily <span class="Underline">for </span>everyday use<span class="Underline">, </span>or use-value purposes (Keil and Young, 2008; Logan and Molotch, 1987).
In order to finance new<span class="Underline"> urban transit </span>projects, cash-strapped<span class="Underline"> entrepreneurial </span>governments<span class="Underline"> are increasingly </span>enter<span class="Underline">ing into long-term </span>partnerships with the private sector, <span class="Underline">or public- private partnerships</span> (PPPs), <span class="Underline">in which the public sector pays for services and infrastructure delivered by the private sector</span> (Phang, 2007; Siemiatycki, 2006; Solin¬o and Vassallo, 2009). <span class="Underline">In studies of PPPs</span> used both for large-scale urban redevelopment projects and urban rail projects, <span class="Underline">scholars have noticed that </span>planning agencies are<span class="Underline"> increasingly </span>favoring infrastructure projects favoring affluent<span class="Underline"> segments of the population that have greater potential for profitability rather than delivering the largest public benefit</span> (Fainstein, 2008; Siemiatycki, 2006; Swyngedouw et al, 2002).
<span class="Underline">By privileging market-based metrics of efficiency, </span>entrepreneurial administrations have<span class="Underline"> profoundly </span>changed<span class="Underline"> the function of public </span>transportation<span class="Underline">.</span> In the Fordist era<span class="Underline">, public </span>transportation involved a modicum of centralized planning<span class="Underline"> aimed at industrial development, mitigating labor costs and alleviating the effects of uneven development</span> produced by the highly subsidized highway system (Grengs, 2004; Weiner, 1999). Neoliberal<span class="Underline"> statecraft </span>abandons<span class="Underline"> the </span>Fordist strategy <span class="Underline">of</span> territorial redistribution <span class="Underline">mobilizing public transportation to enhance economically disadvantaged groups' access to the city. </span>In its place, socially regressive neoliberal practices favor<span class="Underline"> market-oriented </span>growth and elite consumption<span class="Underline"> patterns</span> (Boschken, 2002; Grengs, 2004; Young and Keil, 2010). <span class="Underline">Thus, </span>public transportation<span class="Underline"> service </span>has become a battleground<span class="Underline"> in the global city growth machine's revanchist claims to the city</span> (Smith, 1996).
<span class="Underline">As municipalities sink their</span> meager financial <span class="Underline">resources into lumpy global city public transportation infrastructure, residents outside the myopic global city vision are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain development dollars for their communities</span> (Judd, 2003). In this regard, <span class="Underline">entrepreneurial public transportation policies are reshaping the contours of race-based social exclusion.</span> As real estate developers and creative class workers mobilize<span class="Underline"> their political and financial </span>power to outcompete lower income groups<span class="Underline"> for rights to the (central) city, </span>they are pushing<span class="Underline"> working-class and </span>minority residents to the margins<span class="Underline"> of the city and into the devalorized inner-suburban ring where affordable housing can be found but public transit service is meager</span> (Dreier et al, 2004). These<span class="Underline"> deepening </span>patterns<span class="Underline"> of exclusion </span>are<span class="Underline"> also </span>reinforced by policies dismantling and disbursing<span class="Underline"> public </span>housing<span class="Underline"> out of the central area and away from public transit. And yet, </span>poor urban African-Americans are<span class="Underline"> more </span>structurally dependent on public transportation<span class="Underline"> to access jobs, services, and cultural amenities</span> (Bullard and Johnson, 1997; Kasarda, 1989). In <span class="Underline">a </span>more egalitarian policy-making<span class="Underline"> environment, public </span>transportation<span class="Underline"> policy </span>can be a means to reduce<span class="Underline"> the effects of hyper sociospatial </span>racial segregation (Wilson, 1990). <span class="Underline">However, </span>in the neoliberal approach to urban planning and economic development, <span class="Underline">public </span>transportation<span class="Underline"> is but one of a constellation of institutions that </span>create and reproduce<span class="Underline"> spatialized </span>racial inequalities.

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">This attempt to exterminate public spaces is indicative of neoliberalism’s larger ideological function – as a system it </span><span style="font-family: Wingdings; font-size: 13pt;">è</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> social exclusion and racial apartheid </span>

The ideology and power of neoliberalism also cuts across national boundaries. Throughout the globe<span class="Underline">,</span> the forces of neoliberalism are on the march<span class="Underline">, </span>dismantling<span class="Underline"> the historically guaranteed </span>social provisionsprovided by the welfare state, defining profit-making as the essence of democracy, and equating freedom with the<span class="Underline"> unrestricted </span>ability of markets to “govern<span class="Underline"> economic </span>relations free of <span class="Underline">government </span>regulation<span class="Underline">.</span>” [5] Transnational in scope, neoliberalism<span class="Underline"> now </span>imposes its<span class="Underline"> economic </span>regime and market values on<span class="Underline"> developing and </span>weaker nations<span class="Underline"> through structural adjustment policies</span> enforced by powerful financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Secure in its<span class="Underline"> dystopian </span>vision that there are no alternatives<span class="Underline">,</span> as England’s former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once put it, neoliberalism obviates<span class="Underline"> issues of </span>contingency, struggle, and social agency by celebrating<span class="Underline"> the inevitability of </span>economic laws<span class="Underline"> in which the ethical ideal of intervening in the world gives way to the idea that we “have no choice but to adapt both our hopes and our abilities to the new global market.”</span> [6] Coupled with a new culture of fear, market freedoms seem<span class="Underline"> securely </span>grounded in a defense of<span class="Underline"> national </span>security, capital, and property rights<span class="Underline">. </span>When coupled with a media<span class="Underline"> driven </span>culture<span class="Underline"> of fear and the everyday reality of insecurity, </span>public space becomes<span class="Underline"> increasingly </span>militarized as state governments invest more in prison construction than in education. Prison guards and security personnel in public schools are two of the fastest growing professions.
In its capacity to dehistoricize and depoliticize society, as well as<span class="Underline"> in its aggressive attempts to </span>destroy<span class="Underline"> all of the </span>public spheres necessary for<span class="Underline"> the defense of a </span>genuine democracy, neoliberalism reproduces<span class="Underline"> the </span>conditions for unleashing<span class="Underline"> the most </span>brutalizing forces of capitalism<span class="Underline">.</span> Social Darwinism has been resurrected from the ashes of the 19th century sweatshops and can now be seen in full bloom in most reality TV programs and in the unfettered self-interests that now drives popular culture. <span class="Underline">As narcissism is replaced by unadulterated materialism, public concerns collapse into utterly private considerations</span> and where public space does exist it is mainly used as a confessional for private woes, a cut throat game of winner take all, or a advertisement for consumerism.
Neoliberal policies dominate the discourse of politics and use the breathless rhetoric of the global victory of free-market rationality to cut public expenditures and undermine those non-commodified public spheres that serve as the repository for critical education, language, and public intervention. Spewed forth by the mass media, right-wing intellectuals, religious fanatics, and politicians, neoliberal ideology, with its ongoing emphasis on deregulation and privatization, has found its material expression in an all-out attack on democratic values and on the very notion of the public sphere. Within<span class="Underline"> the discourse of </span>neoliberalism, the notion of the public good is <span class="Underline">devalued and</span>, where possible, eliminated as part of a wider rationale for a handful of private interests to control as much of social life as possible in order to maximize their personal profit. Public services such as health care, child care, public assistance, education, and transportation are<span class="Underline"> now </span>subject to the rules of the market<span class="Underline">.</span> Construing the public good as a private good and the needs of the corporate and private sector as the only source of investment, neoliberal ideology<span class="Underline"> produces, legitimates, and </span>exacerbates<span class="Underline"> the existence of persistent </span>poverty, inadequate health care, racial apartheid<span class="Underline"> in the inner cities, </span>and<span class="Underline"> the growing </span>inequalities between the rich and the poor.

He suggests that "the dreams of racism actually have their origin in ideologies of class, rather than in those of nation: above all in claims to divinity among rulers and to ‘blue' or ‘white' blood and breeding among aristocracies." </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">[[http://proxy.lib.wayne.edu:2128/journals/boundary/v029/29.1elden.html#FOOT40|40]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As Stoler has noted, for Foucault, it is the other way around: "A discourse of class derives from an earlier discourse of races." </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">[[http://proxy.lib.wayne.edu:2128/journals/boundary/v029/29.1elden.html#FOOT41|41]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But it is a more subtle distinction than [End Page 147] that. What Foucault suggests is that discourses of class have their roots in the war of races, but so, too, does modern racism; what is different is the biological spin put on the concepts. </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">[[http://proxy.lib.wayne.edu:2128/journals/boundary/v029/29.1elden.html#FOOT42|42]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But as well as emphasizing the biological, </span><span class="underline0">modern racism puts this another way: </span>to survive, to live, one must be prepared to massacre one's enemies<span class="underline0">, a relation of war. As a relation of war, this is no different from the earlier war of races</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that Foucault has spent so much of the course explaining. But when coupled with the mechanisms of mathematics and medicine in bio-power, this can be conceived of in entirely different ways. </span>Bio-power is able to establish<span class="underline0">, between my life and the death of the other, </span>a relation that is<span class="underline0"> not warlike or confrontational but </span>biological<span class="underline0">: "</span>The more inferior species tend to disappear<span class="underline0">, the more abnormal individuals can be eliminated, the less the species will be degenerated,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the more I—not as an individual but as a species—will live, will be strong, will be vigorous, will be able to proliferate." The death of the other does not just make me safer personally, but </span>the death of the other<span class="underline0">, of the bad, </span>inferior race<span class="underline0"> or the degenerate or abnormal, </span>makes life<span class="underline0"> in general </span>healthier and purer<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (FDS, 227–28). "The existence in question is no longer of sovereignty, juridical; but that of the population, biological. </span>If genocide is<span class="underline0"> truly </span>the dream of modern powers, this is not because of<span class="underline0"> a return today of the </span>ancient right to kill; it is because power is<span class="underline0"> situated and </span>exercised at the level of life<span class="underline0">, the species, </span>the race, and<span class="underline0"> the large-scale phenomena of population"</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (VS, 180; WK, 136). </span><span class="underline0">"</span>If the power of normalization wishes to<span class="underline0"> exercise the ancient sovereign right of </span>kill<span class="underline0">ing, </span>it must pass through racism<span class="underline0">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">And </span><span class="underline0">if,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> inversely, </span><span class="underline0">a </span>sovereign power<span class="underline0">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">that is to say a power with the right of life and death, </span><span class="underline0">wishes to function with the instruments, mechanisms, and technology of normalization, it </span>must<span class="underline0"> also </span>pass through racism<span class="underline0">" (</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">FDS, 228). This holds for indirect death—the exposure to death—as much as for direct killing. While not Darwinism, </span>this<span class="underline0"> biological </span>sense of power<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is based on evolutionism and </span>enables<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a thinking of colonial relations, </span><span class="underline0">the necessity of </span>wars<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, criminality, phenomena of madness and mental illness, class divisions, and so forth. The link to colonialism is central: </span><span class="underline0">This form of modern </span>state racism develops<span class="underline0"> first </span>with colonial genocide<span class="underline0">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The theme of the political enemy is extrapolated biologically. But what is important in the shift at the end of the nineteenth century is that </span><span class="underline0">war is no longer simply a way of securing one race by eliminating the other but of regenerating that race</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (FDS, 228–30). As Foucault puts it in La volonté de savoir: [End Page 148]</span>Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign<span class="underline0"> who must be defended; </span>they are waged on<span class="underline0"> behalf of the existence of </span>all<span class="underline0">; entire </span>populations are mobilized for<span class="underline0"> the purpose of </span>wholesale slaughter <span class="underline0">in the name of life necessity. Massacres have become vital</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [vitaux—understood in a dual sense, both as essential and biological</span><span class="underline0">]. It is as managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race, that so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars, causing so many men to be killed.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (VS, 180; WK, 136</span>)

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Free and accessible public transit solves – this concrete political strategy refuses crisis based politics and creates the conditions for broad movements against neo-liberalism </span>
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Schein</span> Assistant Prof Human Rights – The Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies at Carleton <span style="font-size: 13pt;">2011</span> Rebecca Free Transit and Social Movement Infrastructure: Assessing the Political Potential of Toronto’s Nascent Free Transit Campaign Alternate Routes volume 22 http://www.alternateroutes.ca/index.php/ar/article/view/14421
The demand for free and accessible public transit has the potential not only to develop<span class="Underline"> into </span>a broad-based movement<span class="Underline">,</span> but also to drive the development of the new kind of organization that the Assembly aspires to become. The Assembly is committed to its call for the outright abolition of transit fares, not merely a fare-freeze or fare-reduction. <span class="Underline">What is exciting</span> to me <span class="Underline">about the free transit campaign is that </span>the expression of a radical anti-capitalist principle—<span class="Underline">the outright </span>de-commodification of public<span class="Underline"> goods and </span>services<span class="Underline">—actually </span>serves<span class="Underline"> in this instance </span>to invite<span class="Underline"> rather than foreclose </span>genuine political dialogue<span class="Underline"> about values, tactics, and strategies</span>. While still in its early stages, the<span class="Underline"> free transit </span>campaign is already pushing us to elaborate<span class="Underline"> both </span>analytical and strategic links<span class="Underline"> between commodification, environmental justice, the limits and capacities of public sector unions, and the interlocking forms of exclusion </span>faced by people marginalized by poverty, racism, immigration status, or disability. Free transit couldrepresent<span class="Underline"> a site of </span>convergence between<span class="Underline"> many </span>distinct activist circles in the city and<span class="Underline"> foster greater </span>integration<span class="Underline"> and collaboration </span>between environmental advocacy, anti-poverty work, and<span class="Underline"> diverse </span>human rights<span class="Underline"> organizations. </span>If the free transit campaign does succeed in bringing diverse and distinct activist cultures into conversation with each other, it will force the Assembly to grapple with strategic questions about its relationship to less radical organizations in the city. Given the marginalization and isolation that have long plagued leftist groups in Toronto and elsewhere, this should be a welcome challenge, particularly if the Assembly hopes to become an effective left pole in a broad alliance.
Among the strengths<span class="Underline"> of the free transit campaign </span>is the concreteness of vision<span class="Underline">.</span> Within the left, efforts to elaborate a<span class="Underline"> broad </span>anti-capitalist vision<span class="Underline"> too </span>often run aground<span class="Underline"> at the level of abstractions, generalities, and platitudes. Most</span> Toronto residents <span class="Underline">would draw a blank if asked to “imagine a world without capitalism,” but</span> what Torontonian <span class="Underline">who</span> has ever waited for a bus <span class="Underline">can’t begin to imagine an alternate future for the city, built on the backbone of a fully public mass transit system? </span>The invitation<span class="Underline"> to imagine free transit </span>is an invitation for transit riders to imagine themselves not simply as consumers<span class="Underline"> of a commodity, </span>but as members of a public entitled to<span class="Underline"> participate in </span>conversations about the kind of city they want<span class="Underline"> to live in.</span> Without devolving into abstract and alienating debates over the meaning of, say, socialism, the call<span class="Underline"> for free transit </span>invokes<span class="Underline"> the </span>things we value: vibrant neighbourhoods; clean air and water; participatory politics; equitable distribution of resources; public space<span class="Underline"> where we are free to speak, gather, play, create, and organize. </span>Even the most skeptical response<span class="Underline"> to the idea of free transit—“</span>how will you fund it?”—is the opening of a productive conversation about taxation and control over public resources. The call <span class="Underline">for free transit </span>can<span class="Underline"> effectively </span>open a space for an unscripted political dialogue<span class="Underline"> about the meaning of fair taxation, public goods, collective priorities, and public accountability for resource allocation.</span>
But perhaps more fundamentally, the <span class="Underline">free transit </span>campaign <span class="Underline">is a rare example of a political project on the left that is not reactive, defensive, nostalgic, or alarmist, but hopeful,</span> proactive, and forward-looking. <span class="Underline">“Crisis talk” is pervasive in much of contemporary culture, but in left circles, it has become difficult to imagine a mode of organizing that is not oriented around predicting or responding to punctuated calamities </span>of various kinds—whether a financial meltdown, an un/natural disaster, the latest wave of layoffs and service cuts, or the systematic violation of basic civil liberties on a weekend in downtown Toronto. <span class="Underline">In the case of free transit, however, </span>we are freeto move ahead with the campaign on our own timeline, to seek out<span class="Underline"> and develop </span>the kinds of relationships<span class="Underline"> and democratic spaces </span>that are necessary to sustain grassroots movements<span class="Underline"> over the long term.</span> For the Assembly, this will mean having the space and time to realistically assess its own capacities and to organically develop its own strategies and priorities.
The Assembly does not have modest ambitions: it hopes to nurture a broad based anti-capitalist movement<span class="Underline"> and to vitalize a new working class politics</span> (Rosenfeld & Fanelli, 2010; Dealy, 2010). Its members are, I think, tired of listening to militant rhetoric unanchored to any genuine hope of winning. The push <span class="Underline">for an excellent, fully public and accessible transit system </span>is a radical demand with immense popular appeal, an ambitious, long-range goal<span class="Underline"> for which clear, achievable interim </span>political victories are possible<span class="Underline"> along the way.</span> Free transit is not a crazy idea. Arguments in favour of free transit have surfaced sporadically in Toronto over the years, whether in an editorial by CAW economist Jim Stanford in The Globe and Mail or in a CBC interview with Deborah Cowen, a professor of geography at the University of Toronto (Stanford, 2005; Cowen, 2010). Some cities already have free transit systems, and many have partially free systems—in the downtown core, during holiday seasons or off-peak hours, or on “spare the air” days when smog levels are high. But in Toronto there has not yet been an initiative focused on building a broad-based movement dedicated to the eventual abolition of transit fares in the name of social, economic, and environmental justice.
Without abandoning or compromising its radicalism, the Assembly can push for concrete steps in the direction of de-commodified transit and build productive relationships with individuals and organizations who do not necessarily identify themselves as anti-capitalist. It will be in the process of pushing for interim reforms along the way to a de-commodified transit system that the Assembly will most need to articulate its political principles and its analysis of the spatialization of race and class in Toronto. Free transit in the downtown core may, for instance, be good for Toronto’s tourism industry, but will it benefit the immigrant and working class communities in transit-poor areas of the inner suburbs, who spend proportionately more of their income to access poorer quality services than those available downtown?
Proposals to pay for free transit through suburban road tolls will similarly hit hardest those working class communities whose neighbourhoods are so underserved by transit that they have no choice but to drive into the city for work. The process of developing<span class="Underline"> interim </span>priorities will not<span class="Underline">,</span> in other words, postpone<span class="Underline"> the challenge of </span>articulating and popularizing a class-based and anti-racist argument for public infrastructure<span class="Underline">.</span> Instead, the Assembly will be forced to pursue its most radical aspirations by cultivating a sustained dialogue about the interim remedies and strategies that will both address real needs in our communities and help build a broad-based movement over the long term.
It will be through this process of dialogue, I hope, that a new<span class="Underline"> articulation of a politicized </span>working class identity might emerge<span class="Underline">.</span> Our earliest discussions<span class="Underline"> of the free transit campaign </span>are already pushing us to think about<span class="Underline"> the </span>social complexities<span class="Underline"> that will need to be navigated if we are to build an effective free transit movement.</span> Success will depend on our capacity to carve out and sustain a space for dialogue and negotiation among transit workers and riders, within unions, and across neighbourhoods and communities that have been unevenly affected by fare hikes and inadequate services. Questions of tactics and strategy cannot be divorced from the process of identifying, developing, and strengthening the complex connections between the people who need and use public goods and services and the workers who provide them. We will need to recognize the different ways in which our various constituencies are powerful and vulnerable and learn how to defend and protect each other. The free transit campaign lends itself to the kind of intensely local organizing through which honest dialogue, trust, and long-term relationships can be developed and nurtured—within and across neighbourhoods and among transit riders and workers. And of course, without these things, the campaign will go nowhere.
Among the strengths of the free transit campaign is its potential to foreground and develop an analysis of our collective stake in the protection of public goods. It is not difficult to talk about public goods in the context of mass transportation infrastructure. The shared benefits of public transportation are difficult to deny, particularly in a city as large and as sprawling as Toronto. Even setting aside the obvious ecological imperatives that should be driving public investment in greener infrastructure, there are powerful economic reasons to support a massive re-investment in Ontario’s transportation sector. A serious effort to expand the reach and accessibility of the public transit system would serve not only to ease the burden of Toronto’s most vulnerable residents and reduce the economic and health costs associated with air pollution and traffic congestion: such an investment could re-direct the wasted skills and resources embodied in Ontario’s laid-off auto-workers and silent auto-plants, which could be converted to the production of high efficiency mass transit vehicles. As Sam Gindin and Leo Panitch (2010) argued recently in the Toronto Star, public borrowing to finance such investments represents not a wasteful burden on future generations, but a commitment to securing them a future. The real squandering of our collective resources lies not in public borrowing or benefits packages for public employees, but in our failure to direct existing skills, knowledge, and material capacities into a coherent strategy for building sustainable communities.
The idea of a free transit movement immediately foregrounds a number of thorny strategic questions for the left in Toronto: how to build trust, dialogue, and support for a free transit movement within the transit union; how to address and re-focus the widespread anger, mistrust, and resentment directed at the public sector in the current climate; how to sustain and advance anti-capitalist principles while building productive relationships within broader progressive milieux. Navigating these questions will be challenging, and the Assembly is still a long way from a coherent and systematic approach to answering them. But the fact that these questions surface so quickly and urgently is a positive sign of the ambition and seriousness with which the Assembly is approaching the organization of a free transit movement. The free transit campaign will push the Assembly to develop further its internal organizational and decision-making capacities, but it will also demand an outward-looking, inclusive process, in which the Assembly’s role is to open space for debate, dialogue, and collective strategizing.
In fact, the transit system<span class="Underline"> itself </span>can provide the venue<span class="Underline"> for us </span>to stage public discussions about<span class="Underline"> our </span>collective resources and<span class="Underline"> to </span>share alternative visions<span class="Underline"> for our city: </span>the transit system is a readymade classroom<span class="Underline">, theatre, and art gallery, attended every day by people who could come to recognize their stake in the de-commodification of public goods of many kinds.</span> My hope is that Toronto’s <span class="Underline">buses, streetcars, and subway platforms could be places for experimentation, places to develop the new tactics, organizing skills, and relationships that might permit us to really depart from the prevailing script.</span>
===Challenging neo-liberal policy is key to establishing an alternative to market based rationality===

What remains<span class="underline0"> for the Left, then, </span>is to challenge emerging neo-liberal governmentality<span style="font-size: 8pt;">in EuroAtlantic states</span>with an alternative vision<span class="underline0"> of the good, one that rejects homo oeconomicus as the norm of the human and rejects this norm's correlative formations of economy, society, state and (non)morality. </span>In its barest form, this would<span class="underline0"> be a vision in which justice would </span>not center upon maximizing individual wealth or rights but on developing<span class="underline0"> and enhancing </span>the capacity of citizens to share power<span class="underline0"> and hence, collaboratively govern themselves.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In such an order, rights and elections would be the background rather than token of democracy, or better, rights would function to safeguard the individual against radical democratic enthusiasms but would not themselves signal the presence nor constitute the central principle of democracy. Instead</span>a left vision<span class="underline0"> of justice </span>would focus on practices and institutions of shared popular power<span class="underline0">; a modestly egalitarian distribution of wealth and access to institutions; </span>an incessant reckoning<span class="underline0"> with all forms of power -- social, economic, political, and even psychic; </span>a long view of the fragility and finitude of non-human nature<span class="underline0">; and the importance of both meaningful activity and hospitable dwellings to human flourishing. However differently others might place the accent marks, </span>none of these values can be derived from neo-liberal rationality<span class="underline0"> nor meet neo-liberal criteria for the good. The development and promulgation of </span>such a counter rationality<span class="underline0"> -- a different figuration of human beings, citizenship, economic life, and the political -- </span>is critical<span class="underline0"> both </span>to the long labor<span class="underline0"> of fashioning a more just future </span>and<span class="underline0"> to </span>the immediate task of challenging<span class="underline0"> the deadly policies of </span>the imperial U.S. state.
===Collective political strategies resist neoliberalism=== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Read</span> Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southern Maine <span style="font-size: 13pt;">2009</span> Jason A Genealogy of Homo-Economicus: Neoliberalism and the Production of Subjectivity, Foucault Studies http://rauli.cbs.dk/index.php/foucault-studies/article/viewFile/2465/2463
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Despite Negri’s tendency to lapse back into an opposition between labor and ideology, his object raises important questions echoed by other critics of neoliberalism. What is lost in neoliberalism is the critical distance opened up between different spheres and representations of subjectivity, not only the difference between work and the market, as in Marxism, but also the difference between the citizen and the economic subject, as in classical liberalism. All of these differences are effaced as one relation; that of economic self-interest, or competition, replaces the multiple spaces and relations of worker, citizen, and economic subject of consumption. To put the problem in Foucault’s terms, what has disappeared in neoliberalism is the tactical polyvalence of discourse; everything is framed in terms of interests, freedoms and risks. 22 As Wendy Brown argues, </span>one can survey the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> quotidian effects or </span>practices of governmentality<span class="underline0"> in the manner in which individualized</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">/market based </span>solutions appear in lieu of collective political solutions<span class="underline0">:</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> gated communities for concerns about security and safety; bottled water for concerns about water purity; and private schools (or vouchers) for failing public schools, all of </span>which offer the opportunity for individuals to opt out rather than address political problems<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 23 </span>Privatizationis<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not just </span>neoliberalism’sstrategy<span class="Underline"> for</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> dealing with the public sector, what David Harvey calls </span><span class="Underline">accumulation by dispossession,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> but a consistent element of </span><span class="Underline">its</span><span class="underline0">particular form of governmentality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, its ethos, </span>everything becomes privatized<span class="underline0">, institutions, structures, issues, and problems that used to constitute the public</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 24 </span><span class="underline0">It is privatization all the way down</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For Brown, neoliberalism entails a massive de-democratization, as terms such as the public good, rights and debate, no longer have any meaning. </span><span class="underline0">“</span>The model neoliberal citizen is one who strategizes<span class="underline0"> for her or himself among various social, political, and economic options, </span>not one who strives with others to alter<span class="underline0"> or organize </span>these options<span class="underline0">.”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 25 Thus, while it is possible to argue that neoliberalism is a more flexible, an open form of power as opposed to the closed spaces of disciplines, a form of power that operates on freedoms, on a constitutive multiplicity, it is in some sense all the more closed in that as a form of governmentality, as a political rationality, it is without an outside. It does not encounter any tension with a competing logic of worker or citizen, with a different articulation of subjectivity. States, corporations, individuals are all governed by the same logic, that of interest and competition</span>.
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Foucault’s development, albeit partial, of account of neoliberalism as governmentality has as its major advantage a clarification of the terrain on which neo-liberalism can be countered. It is not enough to simply oppose neoliberalism as ideology, revealing the truth of social existence that it misses, or to enumerate its various failings as policy. Rather any opposition to neoliberalism must take seriously its effectiveness, the manner in which it has transformed work subjectivity and social relationships. As Foucault argues, neoliberalism operates less on actions, directly curtailing them, then on the condition and effects of actions, on the sense of possibility. The reigning ideal of interest and the calculations of cost and benefit do not so much limit what one can do, neoliberal thinkers are famously indifferent to prescriptive ideals, examining the illegal drug trade as a more or less rational investment, but limit the sense of what is possible. Specifically </span>the ideal of the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> fundamentally self-interested </span>individual curtails any collective transformation<span class="underline0"> of the conditions of existence</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is not that </span><span class="underline0">such actions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are not prohibited, restricted by the dictates of a sovereign or the structures of disciplinary power, they </span><span class="underline0">are not seen as possible,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> closed off by a society made up of self-interested individuals. It is perhaps no accident that one of the most famous political implementers of neoliberal reforms, Margaret Thatcher, used the slogan, “there is no alternative,” legitimating neoliberalism based on the stark absence of possibilities. Similarly, and as part of a belated response to the former Prime Minister, it also perhaps no accident that the slogan of the famous Seattle protests against the IMF and World Bank was, “another world is possible,” and it is very often the sense of a possibility of not only another world, but of another way of organizing politics that is remembered, the image of turtles and teamsters marching hand and hand, when those protests are referred to. 26 It is also this sense of possibility that the present seems to be lacking; it is difficult to imagine let alone enact a future other than a future dominated by interest and the destructive vicissitudes of competition. </span>A political response to neoliberalism must meet it on its terrain<span class="underline0">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that of the production of subjectivity, freedom and possibility</span>.


Policy debates are critical to education about government action – refusal to debate specific policy alternatives cedes the whole discussion to elites
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Walt 1991</span>(Stephen, Professor at the University of Chicago, **//International Studies Quarterly 35)//**
A second norm is relevance, a belief that even highly abstract lines of inquiry should be guided by the goal of solving real-world problems. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because the value of a given approach may not be apparent at the beginning</span>-game theory is an obvious example-<span style="font-size: 10pt;">we cannot insist that a new approach be immediately applicable to a specific research puzzle</span>. On thc whole, however, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the belief that scholarship in security affairs should be linked to real-world issues has prevented the field from degenerating into self-indulgent intellectualizing</span>. And from the Golden Age to the present, security studies has probably had more real-world impact, for good or ill, than most areas of social science. Finally, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the renaissance of security studies has been guided by a commitment to democratic discourse. Rather than confining discussion of security issues to an elite group of the best and brightest, scholars in the renaissance have generally welcomed a more fully informed debate</span>. To paraphrase Clemenceau, i<span style="font-size: 10pt;">ssues of war and peace are too important to be left solely to insiders with a vested interest in the outcome. The growth of security studies within universities is one sign of broader participation, along with increased availability of information and more accessible publications for interested citizens.</span> Although this view is by no means universal, <span style="font-size: 10pt;">the renaissance of security studies has been shaped by the belief that a well-informed debate is the best way to avoid the disasters that are likely when national policy is monopolized by a few self interested parties</span>.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The decline of the public sphere</span>in late twentieth-century America<span style="font-size: 10pt;">poses a series of great dilemmas and challenges. Many ideological currents</span>scrutinized here ^ localism, metaphysics, spontaneism, post- modernism, Deep Ecology – intersect with and reinforce each other.

We desperately need authority at the highest levels of power to resolve racism

<span class="Underline">We now live in an age when the role of government is inevitably important</span> whether we are referring to preschool education in Seattle or the aircraft industry in that area, whether we are talking about welfare in Detroit or the creaky, wavering automotive industry there. <span class="Underline">What we need so desperately is the assumption of responsibility at the highest levels in the public and private sectors to make a strong pitch for the elimination of the uglier aspects of the color line so that we can have a healthier, happier, even gentler society. We need to appreciate the importance of legislation, judicial decisions, and executive orders in setting the stage for eliminating the color line. Without them it is not possible for individuals or groups of individuals, however dedicated, to make a good-faith and successful effort to eliminate the color line</span>. Yet we cannot expect too much of these public efforts, important as they are. These public efforts must be combined with private efforts to promote mutual respect and a willingness to make judgments of others based on what they have done and can do, and not on who they are. If we can somehow teach ourselves these lessons in human relations, perhaps we can take the first feeble steps toward creating the kind of community about which some of our forebears spoke and wrote, and the kind of nation about which so many of us have dreamed but never realized.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The other main possibility is to stress responsibility</span><span class="underline0">. Particularly in a field like security one has to make choices and deal with the challenges and risks that one confronts – and not shy away into long-range or principled transformations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The meta-political line risks<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (despite the theoretical commitment to the concrete other) </span>implying that politics can be contained within<span class="underline0"> large ‘</span>systemic’ questions<span class="underline0">. </span>In line with the<span class="underline0"> classical </span>revolutionary tradition<span class="underline0">, after the change</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (now no longer the revolution but the meta-physical transformation), </span><span class="underline0">there will be no more problems whereas in our situation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (until the change) </span>we should not deal with the ‘small questions’ of politics, only<span class="underline0"> with </span>the large one<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (cf. Rorty 1996). </span><span class="underline0">However, </span>the ethical demand<span class="underline0"> in post-structuralis</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">m (e.g. Derrida’s ‘justice’</span><span class="underline0">) </span>is of a kind that can never be instantiated in any concrete political order<span class="underline0"> – it is an experience of the undecidable that exceeds any concrete solution and re-inserts politics. Therefore, </span>politics can never be reduced to meta-questions<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span>there is no way to erase<span class="underline0"> the </span>small, particular, banal conflicts<span class="underline0"> and controversi</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">es. In contrast to the quasi-institutionalist formula of radical democracy which one finds in the ‘opening’ oriented version of deconstruction, we could with Derrida stress the singularity of the event. To take a position, take part, and ‘produce events’ (Derrida 1994: 89) means to get involved in specific struggles. Politics takes place ‘in the singular event of engagement’ (Derrida 1996: 83). Derrida’s politics is focused on the calls that demand response/responsibility in words like justice, Europe and emancipation. Should we treat security in this manner? No, security is not that kind of call. ‘</span><span class="underline0">Security’ is not a way to open</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (or keep open) </span><span class="underline0">an ethical horizon. Security is a much more situational concept oriented to the handling of specifics. It belongs to the sphere of how to handle challenges – and avoid ‘the worst’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Derrida 1991). Here enters again the possible pessimism hich for the security analyst might be occupational or structural. The infinitude of responsibility (Derrida 1996: 86) or the tragic nature of politics (Morgenthau 1946, Chapter 7) means that </span><span class="underline0">one can never feel reassured that by some ‘good deed’, ‘I have assumed my responsibilities’</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Derrida 1996: 86). If </span><span class="underline0">I conduct myself particularly well with regard to someone, I know that it is to the detriment of an other; of one nation to the detriment of another nation, of one family to the detriment of another family, of my friends to the detriment of other friends or non-friends, etc. </span>This is the infinitude that inscribes itself within responsibility<span class="underline0">; otherwise there would be no ethical problems or decisions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (ibid.; and parallel argumentation in Morgenthau 1946; Chapters 6 and 7) Because of this there will remain conflicts and risks – and the question of how to handle them. Should developments be securitized (and if so, in what terms)? </span><span class="underline0">Often our reply will be to aim for de-securitization and then politics meet meta-politics; but occasionally the underlying pessimism regarding the prospects for orderliness and compatibility among human aspirations will point to scenarios sufficiently worrisome that responsibility will entail securitization in order to block the worst. As a security/securitization analyst, this means accepting the task of trying to manage and avoid spirals and accelerating security concerns, to try to assist in shaping the continent in a way that creates the least insecurity and violence – </span>even if this occasionally means invoking/producing ‘structures’<span class="underline0"> or even using the dubious instrument of securitization. In the case of current European configuration, the above analysis suggests the use of securitization at the level of European scenarios with the aim of preempting and avoiding numerous instances of local securitization that could lead to security dilemmas and escalations, violence and mutual vilification.</span>

Individual advocacy fails- Appealing to frameworks of those in power is the only way to mobilize change.
Andrew Sullivan, Editor of the New Republic, 1995, Virtually Normal, p. 88-91
Moreover, a cultural strategy as a political strategy is a dangerous one for a minority-and a small minority at that. Inevitably, the vast majority of the culture will be at best uninterested. In a society where the market rules the culture, majorities win the culture wars. And in a society where the state, pace Foucault actually does exist, where laws are passed according to rules by which the society operates, culture, in any case, is not enough. It may be necessary, but it is not sufficient. To achieve actual results, to end persecution of homosexuals in the military, to allow gay parents to keep their children, to provide basic education about homosexuality in high schools, to prevent murderers of homosexuals from getting lenient treatment, it is necessary to work through the, very channels Foucault and his followers revile. It is necessary to conform to certain disciplines in order to reform them, necessary to speak a certain language before it can say something different, necessary to abandon the anarchy of random resistance if actual homosexuals are to be protected. As Michael Walzer has written of Foucault, he stands nowhere and finds no reasons, Angrily he rattles the bars of the iron cage. But he has no plans or projects for turning the cage into something more like a human home." The difficult and compromising task of interpreting one world for another, of reforming an imperfect and unjust society from a criterion of truth or reasoning, is not available to the liberationists. Into Foucault's philosophical anarchy they hurl a political cri de coeur. When it eventually goes unheard, when its impact fades, when its internal nihilism blows itself out, they have nothing left to offer. Other homosexuals, whose lives are no better for queer revolt, remain the objects of a political system which the liberationists do not deign to engage. The liberationists prefer to concentrate-for where else can they go?-on those instruments of power which require no broader conversation, no process of dialogue, no moment of compromise, no act of engagement. So they focus on outing, on speech codes, on punitive measures against opponents on campuses, on the enforcement of new forms of language, by censorship and by intimidation. Insofar, then, as liberationist politics is cultural, it is extremely vulnerable; and insofar as it is really political, it is almost always authoritarian. Which is to say it isn't really a politics at all. It's a strange confluence of political


Our framework is not a capitulation to the state but is necessary for their advocacy to solve – discussion of government policy and reform is critical to work societal change – theories without a link to policy will be ignored
Donovan and Larkin 2006 (Claire and Phil, Australian National University, Politics, Vol 26:l)
We do not suggest that political science should merely fall into line with the government instrumentalism that we have identified, becoming a ‘slave social science’ (see Donovan, 2005). But, we maintain that political scientists should be able to engage with practical politics on their own terms and should be able to provide research output that is of value to practitioners. It is because of its focus on understanding, explanation, conceptualization and classification that political science has the potential to contribute more to practical politics, and more successfully. As Brian Barry notes, ‘Granting (for the sake of argument) that [students of politics] have some methods that enable us to improve on the deliverances of untutored common sense or political journalism, what good do they do? The answer to that question is: not much. But if we change the question and ask what good they could do, I believe that it is possible to justify a more positive answer’ (Barry, 2004, p. 22). A clear understanding of how institutions and individuals interact or how different institutions interact with each other can provide clear and useful insights that practitioners can successfully use, making - or perhaps remaking -a political science that ‘directs research efforts to good questions and enables incremental improvements to be made’ (ibid., 19). In this sense, political science already has the raw material to make this contribution, but it chooses not to utilize it in this way: no doubt, in part, because academics are motivated to present their findings to other academics and not the practitioners within the institutions they study.



The impact is extinction
Boggs 1997(Carl, Professor of Political Sience – National University, Theory & Society 26, December, p. 773-4)
The decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century America poses a series of great dilemmas and challenges. Many ideological currents scrutinized here ^ localism, metaphysics, spontaneism, post- modernism, Deep Ecology – intersect with and reinforce each other. While these currents have deep origins in popular movements of the 1960s and 1970s, they remain very much alive in the 1990s. Despite their different outlooks and trajectories, they all share one thing in common: a depoliticized expression of struggles to combat and overcome alienation. The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change. As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved – perhaps even unrecognized – only to fester more ominously into the future. And such problems (ecological crisis, poverty, urban decay, spread of infectious diseases, technological displacement of workers) cannot be understood outside the larger social and global context of internationalized markets, finance, and communications. Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or side- step these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impotence. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to the increasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions.74 In the meantime, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The unyielding truth is that, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the United States, it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies. This last point demands further elaboration. The shrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehow disappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people's lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites – an already familiar dynamic in many lesser- developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world, not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a reassertion of politics in more virulent guise – or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collective interests that had vanished from civil society.75

Obama will win the election
Silver, ‘9/27 [9/27/12, Nate Silver, “Sept. 26: Could 2012 Be Like 2008?”, http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/sept-26-could-2012-be-like-2008/]
There’s no point in putting it gently: Mitt Romney had one of his worst polling days of the year on Wednesday. It began with a series of polls from The New York Times, CBS News and Quinnipiac University, released early Wednesday morning, which gave President Obama leads of between 9 and 11 points in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Later in the day, Mr. Romney got polls showing unfavorable numbers for him in Colorado and Iowa. Unlike many recent days, when Mr. Obama’s national polls were slightly less euphoric than his swing state surveys, Wednesday’s national polls seemed to support the notion that Mr. Obama has a clear lead in the race. The Gallup national tracking poll gave Mr. Obama a six-point lead among registered voters, close to his high mark on the year in that survey. The online tracking poll conducted by Ipsos gave him a six-point lead among likely voters. Another online tracking poll, from the RAND Corporation, put Mr. Obama’s lead at roughly seven and a half percentage points, his largest of the year in that poll. And a national poll for Bloomberg produced by the pollster J. Ann Selzer, who has a strong track record, put Mr. Obama six points ahead. The exception was the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll, which gave Mitt Romney a two-point lead among likely voters. (This was in the version of the poll that included voters who leaned toward a candidate, which is the one that FiveThirtyEight uses for all surveys.) What to think of the Rasmussen poll? Their surveys usually have a Republican lean, but it seems to have gotten stronger in the last few weeks. It has also been stronger in some years than others. Rasmussen got reasonably good results in years like 2006 and 2008 when their polls were close to the consensus. However, their polls were the least accurate of the major polling firms in 2010, when they had an especially strong Republican house-effect. The same was true in 2000, when they had a three- or four-point statistical bias toward Republican candidates. This feature is not unique to Rasmussen Reports: a poll that substantially differs from the consensus, whether in a Democratic or Republican direction, is usually not one that you’ll want to bet on. And there is even less reason to do so when a poll is taking a number of methodological shortcuts, while others are being more thorough. But there have been years when the whole polling average has been off in one direction or another, and the “outlier” polls turn out to look good. It’s also the case that a broken clock is right twice a day. Accounting for all of the data, including the Rasmussen Reports poll, the FiveThirtyEight forecast showed Mr. Obama making gains. His probability of winning the Electoral College is now listed at 81.9 percent, his highest figure of the year and up from 79.7 percent on Tuesday.


Spending on transportation infrastructure is unpopular with the public.
Ken Orski, editor and publisher of Innovation NewsBriefs, an influential and widely read transportation newsletter, served as Associate Administrator of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration under President Nixon and President Ford, and JD @ Harvard Law, 2-5-2012, NewGeography, http://www.newgeography.com/content/002662-why-pleas-increase-infrastructure-funding-fall-deaf-ears
Finding the resources to keep transportation infrastructure in good order is a more difficult challenge. Unlike traditional utilities, roads and bridges have no rate payers to fall back on. Politicians and the public seem to attach a low priority to fixing aging transportation infrastructure and this translates into a lack of support for raising fuel taxes or imposing tolls. Investment in infrastructure did not even make the top ten list of public priorities in the latest Pew Research Center survey of domestic concerns. Calls by two congressionally mandated commissions to vastly increase transportation infrastructure spending have gone ignored. So have repeated pleas by advocacy groups such as Building America’s Future, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. Nor has the need to increase federal spending on infrastructure come up in the numerous policy debates held by the Republican presidential candidates. Even President Obama seems to have lost his former fervor for this issue. In his last State-of-the-Union message he made only a perfunctory reference to "rebuilding roads and bridges." High-speed rail and an infrastructure bank, two of the President’s past favorites, were not even mentioned. Why pleas to increase infrastructure funding fall on deaf ears There are various theories why appeals to increase infrastructure spending do not resonate with the public. One widely held view is that people simply do not trust the federal government to spend their tax dollars wisely. As proof, evidence is cited that a great majority of state and local transportation ballot measures do get passed, because voters know precisely where their tax money is going. No doubt there is much truth to that. Indeed, thanks to local funding initiatives and the use of tolling, state transportation agencies are becoming increasingly more self-reliant and less dependent on federal funding Another explanation, and one that I find highly plausible, has been offered by Charles Lane, editorial writer for the Washington Post. Wrote Lane in an October 31, 2011 Washington Post column, "How come my family and I traveled thousands of miles on both the east and west coast last summer without actually seeing any crumbling roads or airports? On the whole, the highways and byways were clean, safe and did not remind me of the Third World countries. ... Should I believe the pundits or my own eyes?" asked Lane ("The U.S. infrastructure argument that crumbles upon examination"). Along with Lane, I think the American public is skeptical about alarmist claims of "crumbling infrastructure" because they see no evidence of it around them. State DOTs and transit authorities take great pride in maintaining their systems in good condition and, by and large, they succeed in doing a good job of it. Potholes are rare, transit buses and trains seldom break down, and collapsing bridges, happily, are few and far between.

“Transportation Infrastructure Weighs Heavy on the Minds of Voters” – May 29, 2012 – http://www.adslogistics.com/blog/bid/78595/Transportation-Infrastructure-Weighs-Heavy-on-the-Minds-of-Voters
With all the political issues you will be hearing about as the election nears, one important topic that will be on many Americans’ minds may surprise you. The transportation infrastructure concerns many in this country, and it will be heavily considered before voters decide who they want for the next president. In fact, according to Truckinginfo, about two thirds of American voters claim that each candidate’s stance on transportation infrastructure will help them vote. This is not exactly a hot button issue that you may see discussed on the news frequently, but it is clearly important to the average voter. The survey, which was conducted by HNTB Corp., also discovered the following results: 89% of citizens surveyed feel that federal funding is crucial to improve interstate highways. More than 80% wish to increase current funding for highways. 57% claimed that this country’s infrastructure is underfunded. Why Do Voters Care? Though people may not discuss this issue as much as they talk about hot topics, it is easy to see why it is important to most. When highways and bridges are left to deteriorate, they become unsafe for travel. In addition, when new roads and bridges are not being built as the population grows, travel becomes more difficult. A crumbling infrastructure is not just unsafe, it is also unappealing, as some older roads and bridges have simply become eyesores that passers-by and local residents alike do not want to look at. Putting additional money into improving the infrastructure, therefore, can increase safety, travel, and appeal. So it should be obvious now why so many voters will consider this issue when voting in the upcoming election


Romney win destroys Russia relations
Richter 12 – Paul Richter July 2, 2012 Russian official: Romney's hard line could bring 'full-scale crisis' http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-russian-official-romneys-hard-line-could-bring-fullscale-crisis-20120702,0,3241680,print.story
MOSCOW -- Mitt Romney’s comment that Russia is America’s “No. 1 geopolitical foe,” a red-meat line for Republicans, is also attracting some attention in Moscow. Alexey Pushkov, chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, said in a recent interview that Russian leaders have noted Romney’s comments with concern, and are watching with interest as neoconservative and “realist” advisers maneuver for influence within the campaign. “We don’t think that for us Romney will be an easy partner,” said Pushkov, an ally of President Vladimir Putin. “We think that Romney will be, on the rhetorical side, a replay of the Bush administration.” He also noted Romney’s statements that the United States should assert its dominance in the 21st century. “If he is serious about this, I’m afraid he may choose the neocon-type people…In the first year of his presidency, we may have a full-scale crisis,” he said. Romney, in an interview with CNN in March, called Russia "without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe, they fight for every cause for the world's worst actors.

Extinction
Allison ’11 [Graham, Director – Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard’s Kennedy School, and Former Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Robert D. Blackwill, Senior Fellow – Council on Foreign Relations, “10 Reasons Why Russia Still Matters”, Politico, 2011, http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=161EF282-72F9-4D48-8B9C-C5B3396CA0E6]
That central point is that Russia matters a great deal to a U.S. government seeking to defend and advance its national interests. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s decision to return next year as president makes it all the more critical for Washington to manage its relationship with Russia through coherent, realistic policies. No one denies that Russia is a dangerous, difficult, often disappointing state to do business with. We should not overlook its many human rights and legal failures. Nonetheless, Russia is a player whose choices affect our vital interests in nuclear security and energy. It is key to supplying 100,000 U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan and preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Ten realities require U.S. policymakers to advance our nation’s interests by engaging and working with Moscow. First, Russia remains the only nation that can erase the United States from the map in 30 minutes. As every president since John F. Kennedy has recognized, Russia’s cooperation is critical to averting nuclear war. Second, Russia is our most consequential partner in preventing nuclear terrorism. Through a combination of more than $11 billion in U.S. aid, provided through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, and impressive Russian professionalism, two decades after the collapse of the “evil empire,” not one nuclear weapon has been found loose. Third, Russia plays an essential role in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile-delivery systems. As Washington seeks to stop Iran’s drive toward nuclear weapons, Russian choices to sell or withhold sensitive technologies are the difference between failure and the possibility of success. Fourth, Russian support in sharing intelligence and cooperating in operations remains essential to the U.S. war to destroy Al Qaeda and combat other transnational terrorist groups. Fifth, Russia provides a vital supply line to 100,000 U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan. As U.S. relations with Pakistan have deteriorated, the Russian lifeline has grown ever more important and now accounts for half all daily deliveries. Sixth, Russia is the world’s largest oil producer and second largest gas producer. Over the past decade, Russia has added more oil and gas exports to world energy markets than any other nation. Most major energy transport routes from Eurasia start in Russia or cross its nine time zones. As citizens of a country that imports two of every three of the 20 million barrels of oil that fuel U.S. cars daily, Americans feel Russia’s impact at our gas pumps. Seventh, Moscow is an important player in today’s international system. It is no accident that Russia is one of the five veto-wielding, permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, as well as a member of the G-8 and G-20. A Moscow more closely aligned with U.S. goals would be significant in the balance of power to shape an environment in which China can emerge as a global power without overturning the existing order. Eighth, Russia is the largest country on Earth by land area, abutting China on the East, Poland in the West and the United States across the Arctic. This territory provides transit corridors for supplies to global markets whose stability is vital to the U.S. economy. Ninth, Russia’s brainpower is reflected in the fact that it has won more Nobel Prizes for science than all of Asia, places first in most math competitions and dominates the world chess masters list. The only way U.S. astronauts can now travel to and from the International Space Station is to hitch a ride on Russian rockets. The co-founder of the most advanced digital company in the world, Google, is Russian-born Sergei Brin. Tenth, Russia’s potential as a spoiler is difficult to exaggerate. Consider what a Russian president intent on frustrating U.S. international objectives could do — from stopping the supply flow to Afghanistan to selling S-300 air defense missiles to Tehran to joining China in preventing U.N. Security Council

“When a train travels at more than 200 miles per hour, there is much less time to react to emergencies. Even with a good warning system, a high-speed train needs quite a distance to stop. That gives it a certain amount of vulnerability. On the other hand, high-speed rail will attract a higher-end clientele that will have to make reservations and go through a screening process. That offers more protection than inter-city rail,” he said. 7 Others, such as Politico columnist Josh Gerstein, agree that there is a definite vulnerability. He wrote, “During a town hall meeting in Tampa today, President Barack Obama touted, as one of the benefits of high-speed rail that passengers wouldn't have to go through a security check that requires taking off their shoes... His remark got me wondering why rail security is so much more lax than airport security. And given that Obama was announcing that the federal government plans is [sic] awarding $8 billion in stimulus money for the planning and construction of high speed rail projects, wouldn't it be unwise to allow an Al Qaeda operative to blow up a chunk of that investment?” 8 He goes on to say that it’s true that terrorists seem focused on blowing up passenger planes, but anything high-profile can be a target. Any attack that would derail a train traveling more than 200 miles an hour wouldn’t be pretty, he wrote. Journalist Michael Scott Moore harbors a few concerns, as well. He wrote, “Simplicity is the best part of rail travel, and President Obama likes to say that American high-speed trains will involve no shoe checks. But Obama has his critics, and an expensive new high-speed line might look as tempting to an expansionist Transportation Safety Authority as to terrorists. So the question is worth some thought.”9 Some experts also agree that HSR has special vulnerabilities. Jenkins, Butterworth, and Clair (March 2010) say that, “In addition to the publicity, body count, and disruption sought by today’s terrorists, high-speed rail is an icon of technological progress, thus adding the emotional value that terrorists seek in their targets. For these reasons, the attempted derailment [of the French TGV], although fortunately a failure for the terrorists, takes on particular significance.”10 Therefore, it would appear that HSR could have real value as a target, especially as groups such as al Qaida continue to reach into the US to attract and train homegrown “lone wolf” terrorists – especially those who blend well with the local population – in its quest to attack Western cultural and economic symbols.11 So, while it is entirely possible – and perhaps even probable – that terrorists or anyone else with a degree of malicious intent could attack HSR in some way, is it necessary to implement specialized security planning and policies that go beyond those of inter-city rail? To answer that question, first we must examine the pattern of threats and incidents worldwide, and then we must determine what types of security policies and practices are already in place to address them. Next, we must assess whether HSR brings into play any specialized conditions that may require particular types of security unique to this mode. And finally, we must recommend the means to secure that asset.


Turns the case

EC April 26 2012 “Economic Impact of Terrorist Attacks Fifteen Times Higher Than Previously Thought”, http://www.economiccollapse.net/economic-impact-of-terrorist-attacks-fifteen-times-higher-than-previously-thought

The point of the study was not to generate anxiety, according to researcher William Burns of Design Research, who co-authored the study along with researchers from the University of Oregon, the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Brown University, Monash University and ABS Consulting. Rather, the investigators hoped to increase awareness of the potential impact on the public of terrorism and to highlight the importance of establishing effective risk communication as an important part of both disaster preparedness and response. Burns and his colleagues analyzed the level of residual fear likely to be generated by a dirty bomb attack and sought to determine how the public’s perception of risk would affect their willingness to return to the site of an attack to work, shop and spend leisure time. The researchers then attempted to determine the economic impact of the psychological effects of a hypothetical attack. The results of their efforts were published in the journal Risk Analysis as part of a special issue dedicated to risk analysis research as it applies to the economic impact of terrorist attacks and other disasters. The research presented in the special issue marks a departure from traditional risk analysis attempts, which historically focused only on the costs associated with the initial aftermath of a disaster. The cost of emergency, law enforcement and military response, along with the cost to evacuate and treat the injured, decontaminate and rebuild the area are traditionally combined with the immediate costs of temporary business closures to determine the economic cost of such an event. These figures only tell part of the story, however, and fail to consider the financial impact that often occurs when consumers and employees are reluctant to return to the site of the disaster. According to co-author Adam Rose, terrorist attacks have a greater impact on the behavior of consumers, and therefore on the economy of an attack site, than was previously believed. In general, he said, the economic impact of a public that is reluctant to return to the location of an attack is 15 times greater than traditional estimates indicate. Rose stressed that when dealing with such high figures, even efforts that make only a minor change in the way people view the risk of returning to an attack site can make a large difference in an area’s bottom line. To gauge the impact of perceived risk among the public following an attack, researchers showed participants fabricated news articles and broadcasts describing a dirty bomb attack. Then the participants were asked whether they would be willing to shop, eat out or work in the area at various intervals after the date of the mock attack. Based upon the responses, the researchers determined that over 40 percent of consumers would be reluctant to shop or dine in the rebuilt area after six months. They also determined that it would require a 25 percent increase in wages to lure employees back to work in the area even six months after the attack. The problem is compounded by the fact that modern transportation allows regional economies to compete with each other. For many consumers, identical goods and services can be accessed a short distance away from an area that is perceived to be unsafe. According to co-author James Giesecke, even a slight change in the public’s perception of an area’s risk can spell economic disaster for a city.



Extinction

Morgan, ‘9 [Dennis, Professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (South Korea, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race,” Futures, November, Science Direct]

In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question ‘‘Is Nuclear War Inevitable??’’ [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what most terrorists obviously already know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange. As Moore points out, all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian ‘‘dead hand’’ system, ‘‘where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,’’ it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States’’ [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal ‘‘Samson option’’ against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even ‘‘anti-Semitic’’ European cities [10]. In that case, of course, Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on. Any accident, mistaken communication, false signal or ‘‘lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason could, in a matter of a few minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons, and once a weapon is used, then the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is actually less probable since each country would act under the ‘‘use them or lose them’’ strategy and psychology; restraint by one power would be interpreted as a weakness by the other, which could be exploited as a window of opportunity to ‘‘win’’ the war. In other words, once Pandora’s Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them. Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, ‘‘everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors’’ [10]. In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and once even just one is used, it is very likely that many, if not all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of much of human civilization while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter.

Oil prices are high and climbing – rising US demand
AP ’12 (Associated Press. "Oil Price Climbs Above $90 On Stronger U.S. Demand." N.p., july 18, 2012. Web. 19 Aug. 2012. <http://k2radio.com/oil-price-climbs-above-90-on-stronger-u-s-demand/>. Alyssa)
NEW YORK (AP) — The price of oil climbed above $90 per barrel for the first time since May after the government said U.S. oil demand is on the rise. The Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that average oil demand increased last week in the U.S. for the third week in a row. Oil demand had been down most of the year, when compared with 2011, as manufacturing activity slowed and drivers cut back on travel. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 37 cents to $89.59 per barrel in New York. It hit $90.04 per barrel earlier in the day, the highest price since May 30. Meanwhile, retail gasoline prices rose 2 cents to a national average of $3.426 per gallon.

HSR ends oil dependence.
Kunz, ‘9 [Andy, “America's Transportation Future: Steel-Wheel, High-Speed Rail,” Engineering News-Record, Vol. 263, Issue 5, August 10]
Transportation delays currently cost America about $78 billion each year. The 21st Century transportation solution is high speed rail (HSR), steel wheels on steel track, which is fast, efficient, safe and has a very high capacity for moving large numbers of people and light freight quickly and without delay. Since HSR is powered by electricity, it can operate past the age of oil, and it is therefore not subject to the volatility of oil prices the way all our current modes of transportation are. HSR can be powered by clean, safe renewable sources of energy including a combination of wind, solar, geothermal and ocean or tidal power, depending on the region of the country. Freedom from oil enables this new transportation mode to end our serious oil dependency, which translates into energy security and national security. America currently spends about $700 billion each year purchasing foreign oil. This is a huge, unsustainable drain on our economy and transfers a large part of our wealth to other nations. As we build more miles of our national HSR system, this large trade deficit will be reduced each year by an ever-increasing amount to the point when the savings will be larger than the cost of constructing the national HSR system, which means the system will end up costing America nothing.

That causes Saudi Arabia to flood the oil market and collapse prices
Morse & Richards 2 (Edward L. Morse is Executive Adviser at Hess Energy Trading Company and was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Energy Policy in 1979-81. James Richard is a portfolio manager at Firebird Management, an investment fund active in eastern Europe, Russia, and Central Asia, Foreign Affairs, March/April)
A simple fact explains this conclusion: 63 percent of the world's proven oil reserves are in the Middle East, 25 percent (or 261 billion barrels) in Saudi Arabia alone. As the largest single resource holder, Saudi Arabia has a unique petroleum policy that is designed to maximize the benefit of holding so much of the world's oil supply. Saudi Arabia's goal is to assure that oil's role in the international economy is maintained as long as possible. Hence Saudi policy has always denounced efforts by industrialized countries to wean themselves from oil dependence, whether through tax policy or regulation. Saudi strategy focuses on three different political arenas. The first involves the ties between the Saudi kingdom and other OPEC countries. The second concerns Riyadh's relationship with the non- OPEC producers: Mexico, Norway, and now Russia. Finally, there is Saudi Arabia's link to the major oil-importing regions -- most importantly North America, but also Europe and Asia. Given the size of the Saudi oil sector, the kingdom has a unique and critical role in setting world oil prices. Since its overriding objectives are maximizing revenues generated from oil exports and extending the life of its petroleum reserves, Riyadh aims to keep prices high as long as possible. But the price cannot be so high that it stifles demand or encourages other competitive sources of supply. Nor can it be so low that the kingdom cannot achieve minimum revenue targets. The critical balancing act of Saudi foreign policy, therefore, is to maintain oil prices within a reasonable price band. Stopping oil prices from falling below the minimum level requires cooperation from other OPEC countries and occasionally from non-OPEC producers. Preventing oil prices from rising too high requires keeping enough spare production capacity to use in an emergency. This latter feature is the signal characteristic of Saudi policy. The kingdom can afford to maintain this spare capacity because of the abundance of its oil reserves and the comparatively low cost of developing and producing its reserve base. In today's soft market, in which Saudi Arabia produces around 7.4 mbd, the kingdom has close to 3 mbd of spare capacity. Its spare capacity is usually ample enough to entirely displace the production of another large oil-exporting country if supply is disrupted or a producer tries to reduce output to increase prices. Not only does this spare capacity help the kingdom keep prices in check, but it also serves to link Riyadh with the United States and other key oil-importing countries. It is a blunt instrument that makes policymakers elsewhere beholden to Riyadh for energy security. This spare capacity is greater than the total exports of all other oil-exporting countries -- except Russia. Saudi spare capacity is the energy equivalent of nuclear weapons, a powerful deterrent against those who try to challenge Saudi leadership and Saudi goals. It is also the centerpiece of the U.S.- Saudi relationship. The United States relies on that capacity as the cornerstone of its oil policy. That arrangement was fine as long as U.S. protection meant Riyadh would not "blackmail" Washington -- an assumption that is more difficult to accept after September 11. Saudi Arabia's OPEC partners must also cooperate with the kingdom in part to prevent Riyadh from producing a glut and having prices collapse; spare capacity also serves to pressure key non-OPEC producers to cooperate with Saudi Arabia when necessary. But unlike the nuclear deterrent, the Saudi weapon is actively used when required. The kingdom has periodically (and brutally) demonstrated that it can use its spare capacity to destroy exports from countries challenging its market share. This tactic is the weapon that Saudi Arabia could use if Moscow ignores Riyadh's requests for cooperation. Saudi Arabia has triggered its spare capacity twice in recent history, once when prices were especially low. Both cases demonstrated that the kingdom will accept those low prices so long as it suffers less than its targets do. In 1985, Saudi Arabia successfully waged a price war designed to force other oil producers to stop "free riding" on Saudi oil policy. That policy meant that those states had to cooperate with the kingdom by reining in production enough to allow Saudi Arabia to produce the minimum level that it targeted. Oil prices fell by more than half within a few months, and Saudi Arabia immediately regained the market share it had lost in the preceding four years, mainly to non-OPEC countries.


Drop in oil prices causes Russian ultranationalism
NEWSWEEK 8-15-2011 (“Fascist Russia?; The Kremlin plays a dangerous game by pandering to far-right hate groups,” lexis)
As Norway's tragedy showed, paranoid and violent minds can lurk in the calmest, most prosperous countries. But the cancer of ultranationalism has found a particularly fertile breeding ground in the frustrations and resentments of young Russians. Belov claims to have predicted his country's future as far back as August 1991. Manezh Square, in the shadow of the Kremlin, was thronged with Russians celebrating the sudden collapse of Soviet communism; to most, the evening marked the birth of Russian democracy. But Belov, who was there with a friend, distributing pamphlets for the anti-Semitic Pamyat organization, says he saw something else. "We knew that these liberals would fail," he says. "And that their failure would fuel our rise--the rise of the right."
Twenty years later, at least half of that apocalyptic vision has come true. Russia's liberals have indeed failed; Russia is now ruled by an authoritarian clique of former KGB men. And Belov may also have accurately foreseen the triumph of the far right. On the surface, a decade of high oil prices has brought ordinary Russians rising living standards and a semblance of political stability. But even the Kremlin's closest allies fear that when oil prices eventually fall and the tide of easy money recedes, the ugly reality of an angry, fascist Russia could be revealed.

Nuclear war
ISRAELYAN 1998 (Victor, For almost 50 years, Victor Israelyan was a Soviet ambassador, diplomat, arms control negotiator, and leading political scientistWashington Quarterly, Winter)
The first and by far most dangerous possibility is what I call the power scenario. Supporters of this option would, in the name of a "united and undivided Russia," radically change domestic and foreign policies. Many would seek to revive a dictatorship and take urgent military steps to mobilize the people against the outside "enemy." Such steps would include Russia's denunciation of the commitment to no-first-use of nuclear weapons; suspension of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) I and refusal to ratify both START II and the Chemical Weapons Convention; denunciation of the Biological Weapons Convention; and reinstatement of a full-scale armed force, including the acquisition of additional intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple warheads, as well as medium- and short-range missiles such as the SS-20. Some of these measures will demand substantial financing, whereas others, such as the denunciation and refusal to ratify arms control treaties, would, according to proponents, save money by alleviating the obligations of those agreements. In this scenario, Russia's military planners would shift Western countries from the category of strategic partners to the category of countries representing a threat to national security. This will revive the strategy of nuclear deterrence -- and indeed, realizing its unfavorable odds against the expanded NATO, Russia will place new emphasis on the first-use of nuclear weapons, a trend that is underway already. The power scenario envisages a hard-line policy toward the CIS countries, and in such circumstances the problem of the Russian diaspora in those countries would be greatly magnified. Moscow would use all the means at its disposal, including economic sanctions and political ultimatums, to ensure the rights of ethnic Russians in CIS countries as well as to have an influence on other issues. Of those means, even the use of direct military force in places like the Baltics cannot be ruled out. Some will object that this scenario is implausible because no potential dictator exists in Russia who could carry out this strategy. I am not so sure. Some Duma members -- such as Victor Antipov, Sergei Baburin, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and Albert Makashov, who are leading politicians in ultranationalistic parties and fractions in the parliament -- are ready to follow this path to save a "united Russia." Baburin's "Anti-NATO" deputy group boasts a membership of more than 240 Duma members. One cannot help but remember that when Weimar Germany was isolated, exhausted, and humiliated as a result of World War I and the Versailles Treaty, Adolf Hitler took it upon himself to "save" his country. It took the former corporal only a few years to plunge the world into a second world war that cost humanity more than 50 million lives. I do not believe that Russia has the economic strength to implement such a scenario successfully, but then again, Germany's economic situation in the 1920s was hardly that strong either. Thus, I am afraid that economics will not deter the power scenario's would-be authors from attempting it. Baburin, for example, warned that any political leader who would "dare to encroach upon Russia" would be decisively repulsed by the Russian Federation "by all measures on heaven and earth up to the use of nuclear weapons." n10 In autumn 1996 Oleg Grynevsky, Russian ambassador to Sweden and former Soviet arms control negotiator, while saying that NATO expansion increases the risk of nuclear war, reminded his Western listeners that Russia has enough missiles to destroy both the United States and Europe. n11 Former Russian minister of defense Igor Rodionov warned several times that Russia's vast nuclear arsenal could become uncontrollable. In this context, one should keep in mind that, despite dramatically reduced nuclear arsenals -- and tensions -- Russia and the United States remain poised to launch their missiles in minutes. I cannot but agree with Anatol Lieven, who wrote, "It may be, therefore, that with all the new Russian order's many problems and weaknesses, it will for a long time be able to stumble on, until we all fall down together." n12 There are signs indicating that this scenario is emerging. The new military doctrine has actually reversed the pledge never to use nuclear weapons first. Earlier this year, Ivan Rybkin, secretary of Russia's Security Council, said, "Everyone must know that in case of a direct challenge our response will be fully fledged, and we are to choose the use of means." n13 Later, in an interview, he said that parliamentary ratification of START II has become "almost impossible." n14 The Duma has again postponed the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, and Russian military planners are claiming that the only feasible military response to NATO expansion is the redeployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons closer to Russia's borders

TVOR 9/7/12 [2012, The Voice of Russia, “American companies urge repealing Jackson-Vanik amendment,” Moscow Times, http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_09_07/American-companies-urge-repealing-Jackson-Vanik-amendment/]
Leading American companies have addressed the U.S. Congress urging to speedily abolish the Jackson-Vanik amendment in relations with Russia, and grant the country a regular trade partner status. The appeal was made Thursday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In July, the bill to repeal the Jackson-Vanik amendment was approved by the relevant committees of the Senate and House of Representatives. Its further passage in the U.S. Congress has stalled because of party differences. It is expected that legislators will take the issue up again, once they reconvene after the August break.


Plan drains political capital and causes backlash
Freemark ’12 Yonah Freemark, Strategic Initiatives Fellow at MTA New York City Transit, Urban Fellow at the Next American City, founder of The Transport Politic, “On Infrastructure, Hopes for Progress This Year Look Glum”, January 25, http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2012/01/25/on-infrastructure-hopes-for-progress-this-year-look-glum/
The contributions of the Obama Administration to the investment in improved transportation alternatives have been significant, but it was clear from the President’s State of the Union address last night that 2012 will be a year of diminished expectations in the face of a general election and a tough Congressional opposition.
Mr. Obama’s address, whatever its merits from a populist perspective, nonetheless failed to propose dramatic reforms to encourage new spending on transportation projects, in contrast to previous years. While the Administration has in some ways radically reformed the way Washington goes about selecting capital improvements, bringing a new emphasis on livability and underdeveloped modes like high-speed rail, there was little indication in the speech of an effort to expand such policy choices. All that we heard was a rather meek suggestion to transform a part of the money made available from the pullout from the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts — a sort of war dividend whose size is undefined — to “do some nation-building right here at home.”
If these suggestions fell flat for the pro-investment audience, they were reflective of the reality of working in the context of a deeply divided political system in which such once-universally supported policies as increased roads funding have become practically impossible to pursue. Mr. Obama pushed hard, we shouldn’t forget, for a huge, transformational transportation bill in early 2011, only to be rebuffed by intransigence in the GOP-led House of Representatives and only wavering support in the Democratic Senate. For the first term at least, the Administration’s transportation initiatives appear to have been pushed aside.
Even so, it remains to be seen how the Administration will approach the development of a transportation reauthorization program. Such legislation remains on the Congressional agenda after three years of delays (the law expires on March 31st). There is so far no long-term solution to the continued inability of fuel tax revenues to cover the growing national need for upgraded or expanded mobility infrastructure. But if it were to pass, a new multi-year transportation bill would be the most significant single piece of legislation passed by the Congress in 2012.
The prospect of agreement between the two parties on this issue, however, seems far-fetched. That is, if we are to assume that the goal is to complete a new and improved spending bill, rather than simply further extensions of the existing legislation. The House could consider this month a bill that would fund new highways and transit for several more years by expanding domestic production of heavily carbon-emitting fossil fuels, a terrible plan that would produce few new revenues and encourage more ecological destruction. Members of the Senate, meanwhile, have for months been claiming they were “looking” for the missing $12 or 13 billion to complete its new transportation package but have so far come up with bupkis. The near-term thus likely consists of either continued extensions of the current law or a bipartisan bargain that fails to do much more than replicate the existing law, perhaps with a few bureaucratic reforms.
In the context of the presidential race, Mr. Obama’s decision not to continue his previously strong advocacy of more and more transportation funding suggests that the campaign sees the issue as politically irrelevant. If the Administration made an effort last year to convince Americans of the importance of improving infrastructure, there seems to have been fewer positive results in terms of popular perceptions than hoped for. Perhaps the rebuffs from Republican governors on high-speed rail took their toll; perhaps the few recovery projects that entered construction were not visible enough (or at least their federal funding was not obvious enough); perhaps the truth of the matter is that people truly care more about issues like unemployment and health care than they do for public transit and roads.
This does not mean an end to the beneficial shifts in national policy that have for the first time in decades really made transportation a tool for the improvement of conditions in cities large and small. This, ultimately, is the success of the Department of Transportation under Mr. Obama: Making livability and density primary goals of the mobility system. Even if little gets done in 2012, it is hard to see these ideas disappearing from the popular discourse.


PC is key
Kuchins ’12 Andrew C, senior fellow and director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies – 5/4/12, Vladimir Putin’s Return as Russian President, http://csis.org/publication/vladimir-putins-return-russian-president
The Obama administration will need to work hard and lay out considerable political capital to make PNTR happen. The administration does not really want to have a public debate over its Russia policy during a campaign year. But it will have to, and the administration should not fear it, because there is a very strong case to be made. Members of Congress will also be reluctant to make what will appear to be a gift or concession to Moscow during a campaign year, when Russia’s stock in Washington is down. At the end of the day, we will grant Russia PNTR status because it would basically be idiotic not to. But exactly when the “end of that day” will be is a mystery.


Failure to repeal is a fatal blow to relations.
Gvosdev ‘12 (World Politics Review, Nikolas K. Gvosdev is the former editor of the National Interest, and a frequent foreign policy commentator in both the print and broadcast media, http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/11441/the-realist-prism-resetting-the-u-s-russia-reset)
An upcoming decision-point could offer a good indication of what to expect. The World Trade Organization is expected to ratify Russia’s accession later this spring. However, American firms will not be able to take advantage of Russia's WTO membership as long as U.S. trade with Russia is still subject to the Cold War-era Jackson-Vanik amendment. Congress would first have to agree to "graduate" Russia from the terms of the legislation, but many members remain hesitant. An unofficial swap would see Russia given permanent normal trading relations status, but with new legislation applying "smart sanctions" against specific Russian individuals and entities accused of condoning human rights abuses, most notably in the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. Whether this Solomonic compromise could work, however, remains to be seen. The Russian government has already responded very negatively to sanctions unilaterally imposed by the State Department and may be quite unwilling to accept such a compromise, even if it means graduating Russia from Jackson-Vanik. At the same time, there remains resistance within Congress to "giving up" one of its last remaining tools to pressure Russia on a whole range of issues, from chicken imports to religious freedom. The fate of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, therefore, is the canary in the coal mine for U.S.-Russia relations. If a successful repeal is negotiated, it bodes well for regenerating the relationship. However, if Obama, like George W. Bush before him, is unable to secure Russia’s graduation, this could end up being a fatal blow to the whole idea of the reset.


Nuclear war
Nuclear war, nuclear terrorism, proliferation, war on terror, supply line to troops in Afghanistan, oil production, veto power in UN Security Council, economy, brain power, diplomatic stuff
Allison & Blackwill ’11 Graham Allison, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard’s Kennedy School, former assistant secretary of defense in the Clinton administration, Robert D. Blackwill, Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, former U.S. ambassador to India and deputy national security adviser for strategic planning in the Bush administration, October 30, “10 reasons why Russia still matters”, http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=161EF282-72F9-4D48-8B9C-C5B3396CA0E6
House Speaker John Boehner recently delivered a fiery indictment of Russia and the Obama administration’s entire “reset” in Russian policy.
From the vantage point of two longtime Russia watchers — one a Republican who served in the George W. Bush administration and the other a Democrat who served in the Pentagon under President Bill Clinton — Boehner misses the point.
That central point is that Russia matters a great deal to a U.S. government seeking to defend and advance its national interests. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s decision to return next year as president makes it all the more critical for Washington to manage its relationship with Russia through coherent, realistic policies.
No one denies that Russia is a dangerous, difficult, often disappointing state to do business with. We should not overlook its many human rights and legal failures. Nonetheless, Russia is a player whose choices affect our vital interests in nuclear security and energy. It is key to supplying 100,000 U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan and preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Ten realities require U.S. policymakers to advance our nation’s interests by engaging and working with Moscow.
First, Russia remains the only nation that can erase the United States from the map in 30 minutes. As every president since John F. Kennedy has recognized, Russia’s cooperation is critical to averting nuclear war.
Second, Russia is our most consequential partner in preventing nuclear terrorism. Through a combination of more than $11 billion in U.S. aid, provided through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, and impressive Russian professionalism, two decades after the collapse of the “evil empire,” not one nuclear weapon has been found loose.
Third, Russia plays an essential role in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile-delivery systems. As Washington seeks to stop Iran’s drive toward nuclear weapons, Russian choices to sell or withhold sensitive technologies are the difference between failure and the possibility of success.
Fourth, Russian support in sharing intelligence and cooperating in operations remains essential to the U.S. war to destroy Al Qaeda and combat other transnational terrorist groups.
Fifth, Russia provides a vital supply line to 100,000 U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan. As U.S. relations with Pakistan have deteriorated, the Russian lifeline has grown ever more important and now accounts for half all daily deliveries.
Sixth, Russia is the world’s largest oil producer and second largest gas producer. Over the past decade, Russia has added more oil and gas exports to world energy markets than any other nation. Most major energy transport routes from Eurasia start in Russia or cross its nine time zones. As citizens of a country that imports two of every three of the 20 million barrels of oil that fuel U.S. cars daily, Americans feel Russia’s impact at our gas pumps.
Seventh, Moscow is an important player in today’s international system. It is no accident that Russia is one of the five veto-wielding, permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, as well as a member of the G-8 and G-20. A Moscow more closely aligned with U.S. goals would be significant in the balance of power to shape an environment in which China can emerge as a global power without overturning the existing order.
Eighth, Russia is the largest country on Earth by land area, abutting China on the East, Poland in the West and the United States across the Arctic. This territory provides transit corridors for supplies to global markets whose stability is vital to the U.S. economy.
Ninth, Russia’s brainpower is reflected in the fact that it has won more Nobel Prizes for science than all of Asia, places first in most math competitions and dominates the world chess masters list. The only way U.S. astronauts can now travel to and from the International Space Station is to hitch a ride on Russian rockets. The co-founder of the most advanced digital company in the world, Google, is Russian-born Sergei Brin.
Tenth, Russia’s potential as a spoiler is difficult to exaggerate. Consider what a Russian president intent on frustrating U.S. international objectives could do — from stopping the supply flow to Afghanistan to selling S-300 air defense missiles to Tehran to joining China in preventing U.N. Security Council resolutions.
So next time you hear a policymaker dismissing Russia with rhetoric about “who cares?” ask them to identify nations that matter more to U.S. success, or failure, in advancing our national interests.

==Topicality== 
===1NC T USFG=== 

A. Our framework – debate should be a site for contest over political proposals. This requires that the affirmative present a topical plan of action and instrumentally defends that the United States federal government should increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States.

B. Our interpretation most predictable given the wording of the resolution:

1. The topic is defined by the phrase following the colon – the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters
Webster’s ‘00 [2000, Guide to Grammar and Writing, http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm]
Use of a colon before a list or an explanation that is preceded by a clause that can stand by itself. Think of the colon as a gate, inviting one to go on… If the introductory phrase preceding the colon is very brief and the clause following the colon represents the real business of the sentence, begin the clause after the colon with a capital letter.

2. “Resolved” expresses intent to implement the plan
American Heritage Dictionary ’00 [2000, www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=resolved]
To find a solution to; solve …
To bring to a usually successful conclusion

3. “Should” denotes an expectation of enacting a plan
American Heritage Dictionary ‘00 [2000, www.dictionary.com]
3 Used to express probability or expectation

4. “The United States federal government” is the central government in D.C
WEBSTER'S ’76 [1976, NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY UNABRIDGED, p. 833.]
Federal government. Of or relating to the central government of a nation, having the character of a federation as distinguished from the governments of the constituent unites [as states or provinces].

C. Violation – The affirmative is not an instrumental affirmation of the resolution – they affirm the topic as:

This is an explicit violation of our framework that undermines reliance on legal reformism
Lobel ‘6 [October 2006 , Orly Lobel, Assistant Professor of Law, University of San Diego, “The Paradox of Extra-Legal Activism: Critical Legal Consciousness and Transformative Politics” Legal Studies Research Paper No. 07-75]
Reflecting the aspiration to avoid the process of legal cooptation, three interrelated alternatives to the traditional focus on the legal system emerge in today’s literature. The first is the redefinition of the purpose of the legal system as serving indirect effects rather than direct outcomes, pointing to the ultimate insignificance of particular legal results. The second is the move away from the legal arena to an “extralegal” sphere of action, often portrayed as the realm of civil society. The third focal point is the reconceptualization of the meaning of “law” and “legality,” building on earlier notions of legal pluralism. As will be argued later, all three proposals reflect not only disillusionment and disappointment from the legal system as a potential engine for social reform, but also the convergence of progressive legal scholarship with current economic realities and shifting commitments of the state in an era of globalization.

D. Reasons to prefer –

1. Ground – The aff will always win that the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract – we can only debate the merits of their framework if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation
Ignatieff ‘4 [2004, Michael Ignatieff, Carr professor of human rights at Harvard, Lesser Evils p. 20-1]
As for moral perfectionism, this would be the doctrine that a liberal state should never have truck with dubious moral means and should spare its officials the hazard of having to decide between lesser and greater evils. A moral perfectionist position also holds that states can spare their officials this hazard simply by adhering to the universal moral standards set out in human rights conventions and the laws of war. There are two problems with a perfectionist stance, leaving aside the question of whether it is realistic. The first is that articulating nonrevocable, nonderogable moral standards is relatively easy. The problem is deciding how to apply them in specific cases. What is the line between interrogation and torture, between targeted killing and unlawful assassination, between preemption and aggression? Even when legal and moral distinctions between these are clear in the abstract, abstractions are less than helpful when political leaders have to choose between them in practice. Furthermore, the problem with perfectionist standards is that they contradict each other. The same person who shudders, rightly, at the prospect of torturing a suspect might be prepared to kill the same suspect in a preemptive attack on a terrorist base. Equally, the perfectionist commitment to the right to life might preclude such attacks altogether and restrict our response to judicial pursuit of offenders through process of law. Judicial responses to the problem of terror have their place, but they are no substitute for military operations when terrorists possess bases, training camps, and heavy weapons. To stick to a perfectionist commitment to the right to life when under terrorist attack might achieve moral consistency at the price of leaving us defenseless in the face of evildoers. Security, moreover, is a human right, and thus respect for one right might lead us to betray another.

2. Topical education - By manipulating the topic to access their political project they skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the government. Their education is distrusting of institutional study and pragmatic reform. Even if their intentions are noble, their message results in fascist totalitarianism
Lewis ’92 [1992, Martin Lewis, Assistant Professor at George Washington, Green Delusions p. 258]
A majority of those born between 1960 and 1980 seem to tend toward cynicism, and we can thus hardly expect them to be converted en masse to radical doctrines of social and environmental salvation by a few committed thinkers. It is actually possible that a radical education may make them even more cynical than they already are. While their professors may find the extreme relativism of subversive postmodernism bracingly liberating, many of today's students may embrace only the new creed's rejection of the past. Stripped of leftist social concerns, radical postmodernism's contempt for established social and political philosophy—indeed, its contempt for liberalism—may well lead to right-wing totalitarianism. When cynical, right-leaning students are taught that democracy is a sham and that all meaning derives from power, they are being schooled in fascism, regardless of their instructors' intentions. According to sociologist Jeffrey Goldfarb [1991], cynicism is the hallmark—and main defect—of the current age. He persuasively argues that cynicism's roots lie in failed left- and right-wing ideologies—systems of thought that deductively connect "a simple rationalized absolute truth ... to a totalized set of political actions and policies" [1991:82]. Although most eco-radicals are anything but cynical when they imagine a "green future," they do take a cynical turn when contemplating the present political order. The dual cynical-ideological mode represents nothing less than the death of liberalism and of reform. Its dangers are eloquently spelled out by Goldfarb [1991:9]: "When one thinks ideologically and acts ideologically, opponents become enemies to be vanquished, political compromise becomes a kind of immorality, and constitutional refinements become inconvenient niceties.

3. Extra-topicality – even if the affirmative claims to advocate the resolution, they skirt discussion of its instrumental by arguing the benefits derived from their contextualized advocacy outweigh. This is a voting issue because we’re forced to win framework just to get back to equal footing – extra topicality also proves the resolution insufficient and explodes aff ground.

4. Limits – there are limitless contexts or avenues through which they could purport to advocate the plan. Our interpretation limits debate to promote politically relevant dialogue and structured communication
Lutz ’00 [2000, Donald S. Lutz, Professor of Polisci at Houston, Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 39-40]
Aristotle notes in the Politics that political theory simultaneously proceeds at three levels—discourse about the ideal, about the best possible in the real world, and about existing political systems.4 Put another way, comprehensive political theory must ask several differ¬ent kinds of questions that are linked, yet distinguishable. In order to understand the interlocking set of questions that political theory can ask, imagine a continuum stretching from left to right. At the end, to the right, is an ideal form of government, a perfectly wrought con¬struct produced by the imagination. At the other end is the perfect dystopia, the most perfectly wretched system that the human imagi¬nation can produce. Stretching between these two extremes is an infi¬nite set of possibilities, merging into one another, that describe the logical possibilities created by the characteristics defining the end points. For example, a political system defined primarily by equality would have a perfectly inegalitarian system described at the other end, and the possible states of being between them would vary prima¬rily in the extent to which they embodied equality. An ideal defined primarily by liberty would create a different set of possibilities be¬tween the extremes. Of course, visions of the ideal often are inevitably more complex than these single-value examples indicate, but it is also true that in order to imagine an ideal state of affairs a kind of simpli¬fication is almost always required since normal states of affairs invari¬ably present themselves to human consciousness as complicated, opaque, and to a significant extent indeterminate. t A non-ironic reading of Plato's Republic leads one to conclude that the creation of these visions of the ideal characterizes political philoso¬phy. This is not the case. Any person can generate a vision of the ideal. One job of political philosophy is to ask the question "Is this ideal worth pursuing?" Before the question can be pursued, however, the ideal state of affairs must be clarified, especially with respect to con¬ceptual precision and the logical relationship between the proposi¬tions that describe the ideal. This pre-theoretical analysis raises the vision of the ideal from the mundane to a level where true philosophi¬cal analysis, and the careful comparison with existing systems can proceed fruitfully. The process of pre-theoretical analysis, probably because it works on clarifying ideas that most capture the human imagination, too often looks to some like the entire enterprise of political philosophy.5 However, the value of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's concept of the General Will, for example, lies not in its formal logical implications, nor in its compelling hold on the imagination, but on the power and clarity it lends to an analysis and comparison of ac¬tual political systems. Among other things it allows him to show that anyone who wishes to pursue a state of affairs closer to that summed up in the concept of the General Will must successfully develop a civil religion. To the extent politicians believe theorists who tell them that pre-theoretical clarification of language describing an ideal is the essence and sum total of political philosophy, to that extent they will properly conclude that political philosophers have little to tell them, since politics is the realm of the possible not the realm of logical clarity. However, once the ideal is clarified, the political philosopher will begin to articulate and assess the reasons why we might want to pursue such an ideal. At this point, analysis leaves the realm of pure logic and enters the realm of the logic of human longing, aspiration, and anxi-ety. The analysis is now limited by the interior parameters of the human heart [more properly the human psyche] to which the theorist must appeal. Unlike the clarification stage where anything that is logical is possible, there are now definite limits on where logic can take us. Appeals to self-destruction, less happiness rather than more, psychic isolation, enslavement, loss of identity, a preference for the lives of mollusks over that of humans, to name just a few possibilities, are doomed to failure. The theorist cannot appeal to such values if she or he is to attract an audience of politicians. Much political theory in¬volves the careful, competitive analysis of what a given ideal state of affairs entails, and as Plato shows in his dialogues the discussion between the philosopher and the politician will quickly terminate if he or she cannot convincingly demonstrate the connection between the political ideal being developed and natural human passions. In this way, the politician can be educated by the possibilities that the politi¬cal theorist can articulate, just as the political theorist can be educated by the relative success the normative analysis has in "setting the hook" of interest among nonpolitical theorists. This realm of discourse, domi¬nated by the logic of humanly worthwhile goals, requires that the theorist carefully observe the responses of others in order not to be seduced by what is merely logical as opposed to what is humanly rational. Moral discourse conditioned by the ideal, if it is to be suc¬cessful, requires the political theorist to be fearless in pursuing norma¬tive logic, but it also requires the theorist to have enough humility to remember that, if a non-theorist cannot be led toward an ideal, the fault may well lie in the theory, not in the moral vision of the non-theorist.

5. We win the race to the middle – the aff can claim kritikal advantages and still defend plan passage and the neg can run a K against a policy aff. This accesses all their offense.

E. Framework is a reason to vote negative –
You must use your ballot to ratify constraints on discourse to preserve fairness
Shively ’00 [2000, Ruth Lessl Shively, Assoc Prof Polisci at Texas A&M, Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 179]
To put this point another way, it turns out that to be open to all things is, in effect, to be open to nothing. While the ambiguists have commendable reasons for wanting to avoid closure—to avoid specify¬ing what is not allowed or celebrated in their political vision—they need to say "no" to some things in order to be open to things in general. They need to say "no" to certain forms of contest, if only to protect contest in general. For if one is to be open to the principles of democracy, for example, one must be dogmatically closed to the prin¬ciples of fascism. If one would embrace tolerance, one must rigidly reject intolerance. If one would support openness in political speech and action, one must ban the acts of political intimidation, violence or recrimination that squelch that openness. If one would expand delib¬eration and disruption, one must set up strict legal protections around such activities. And if one would ensure that citizens have reason to engage in political contest—that it has practical meaning and import for them—one must establish and maintain the rules and regulations and laws that protect democracy. In short, openness requires certain clear limits, rules, closure. And to make matters more complex, these structures of openness cannot simply be put into place and forgotten. They need to be taught to new generations of citizens, to be retaught and reenforced among the old, and as the political world changes, to be shored up, rethought, adapted, and applied to new problems and new situations. It will not do, then, to simply assume that these structures are permanently viable and secure without significant work or justification on our part; nor will it do to talk about resisting or subverting them. Indeed, they are such valuable and yet vulnerable goods that they require the most unflag¬ging and firm support that we can give them.

===1NC States vs. HSR=== 
The United States federal government should narrowly delegate authority over national inter-city and inter-state high-speed passenger rail to state governments, appropriate territories, and multi-state compacts related to corridors and hub networks. The state governments, appropriate territories, and multi-state compacts should substantially increase investment in a national network of inter-city and inter-state high-speed passenger rail. The United States federal government should not increase investment in high-speed rail.
CP solves the aff
Chicago Tribune ‘1
(“Let states drive high-speed train,” Dec 24, http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-12-24/news/0112240192_1_high-speed-rail-investment-high-speed-train-high-speed-rail)
Amtrak--the money-losing operation that poses as a national passenger railroad in the U.S.--is taking the lead in the development of a high-speed train network in the Midwest, comparable to the European trains that zoom by at more than 150 m.p.h. High-speed rail service in the Midwest is an interesting prospect--the market, as well as environmental, energy conservation and other concerns, may justify it. But putting Amtrak in charge and expecting the feds to pay for most of it certainly is a recipe for waste and bad planning. For the Midwest, at least, a frequent, comfortable and reliable high-speed rail system would be a new concept. It ought to be designed and operated as such, according to market demand, with a rigorous bottom-line approach. In other words, everything Amtrak is not. According to plans being circulated in Congress and promoted by several local groups, Chicago would be the hub of a series of high-speed rail lines zipping out to Minneapolis-St. Paul, Detroit, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Cleveland and other major urban areas, with stops at some smaller cities like Springfield, Ill., and Madison, Wis. New trains would run on upgraded freight tracks at estimated speeds of 110 m.p.h. The initial phase would be funded by approximately $4 billion, the Midwest's share of the $12 billion High Speed Rail Investment initiative, under consideration by Congress. Individual states have pledged smaller amounts to the effort, including Illinois' $50 million. A reverse logic animates this project: Instead of determining there is urgent demand--and then seeking funding--Midwestern supporters seem to be saying, "The pot of money is there, so we might as well get our share." That's not the way to build a new railroad, but to extend Amtrak domain which, torn by the incompatible demands of politics, public service and profitability, has evolved into anything but an efficient train system. States ought to take the lead in the high-speed rail effort, and contribute a substantial amount of the money. Perhaps the federal government could pay for the start-up infrastructure improvements, as it did to build the original interstate highway system in the 1950s. Then an independent multi-state agency could purchase the trains and turn over operations to a private concern. Such high stakes and strong participation by the states would lead to a far tougher analysis of what service is needed than the pinata-style planning at play here. Built modestly and incrementally, high-speed rail could work and even make money, at which time full privatization would be the next step. A Chicago-to-St. Louis line, running on relatively underutilized freight tracks through Normal and Springfield, could be a key test. Run efficiently, it could compete favorably with airlines on speed of downtown-to-downtown service, and certainly on roominess and comfort. Regional high-speed service has caught on in California and in the Northwest, and it may well do so here. Although Amtrak's math is complicated, the agency projects that, when fully operational, its high-speed Acela line on the Northeast will make about $180 million in annual profit Are there enough commuters and are they willing to give up their cars or airline seats in favor of high-speed trains? If it's their own money on the line, state officials, planners--and taxpayers--would make sure the project makes sense before any money is invested. High-speed train service in the Midwest is a prospect worth investigating, on the right terms.


===1NC Maritime Security CP=== 

The United States federal government should press littoral states to sign multilateral terrorism protocols, institute effective structures for measuring and ensuring compliance with their stipulations, conduct regular and rigorous threat assessments in order to inform the parameters of these multilateral protocols, redefine the mandates of existing multilateral security arrangements to play a greater role in countering maritime threats, and encourage the greater commercial use of communication and defensive technologies.

CP solves maritime terrorism by encouraging maritime cooperation
Chalk, ’08 – senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation [Peter Chalk, Ph.D. in political science, University of British Columbia; M.A. in political studies and international relations, University of Aberdeen “The Maritime Dimension of International Security”, RAND Report Prepared for the United States Air Force]
The maritime environment will likely remain a favorable theater for armed violence, crime, and terrorism given its expanse, lack of regulation, esoteric character, and general importance as a critical conduit for international trade. There is no quick fix or easy remedy for reducing this openness, and any attempt to institute total security is neither tenable nor desirable. The best that can be hoped for is the rational management of threats within acceptable boundaries. The United States is well placed to facilitate such an effort by virtue of its resources and global influence. At the policy level, there are at least four major contributions that Washington could make, all of which are variously highlighted in the 2005 U.S. National Strategy for Maritime Security.1 First, the United States could help further expand the nascent regime of post-9/11 maritime security, both in terms of pressing littoral states to sign multilateral protocols and instituting effective structures for measuring and ensuring compliance with their stipulations. To add credence to this effort, the United States should immediately ratify UNCLOS, one of the key international legal instruments governing sovereign rights at sea.2 Second, the United States could inform the parameters of bilateral and multilateral maritime security collaboration by conducting regular and rigorous threat assessments that are aimed at delineating high probability risk scenarios and quantifying their costs. Third, the United States could help redefine mandates of existing multilateral security and defense arrangements to allow them to play a more effective and inclusive role in countering maritime (and other transnational) threats. Fourth, the United States could encourage the commercial maritime industry to make greater use of enabling communication and defensive technologies and accept a greater degree of overall transparency in its underlying corporate structures.

===1NC Privatization CP - NextGen=== 
====Text – The United States Federal Government should organizationally reform air traffic control, making it self-supporting and managed by commercial operators.==== 

====Privatization solves safety, congestion, and efficiency better --- federal bureaucracy dooms the plan==== 
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Poole 10</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"> (Robert W. Jr., Director of Transportation Policy and Searle Freedom Trust Transportation Fellow – Reason Foundation, and Chris Edwards, Director of Tax Policy Studies – Cato Institute, “Airports and Air Traffic Control”, June, http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/transportation/airports-atc)</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Commercializing Air Traffic Control</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The </span>way to address<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">all three of these </span>organizational problems is to take the ATC system out of the federal budget process and make it a self-supporting entity, funded directly by its customers<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Variants of this commercialization approach have been recommended by a series of federal studies and commissions over the past 15 years.</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">As part of Vice President Al Gore's efforts at "reinventing government" in the 1990s, for example, the Clinton administration proposed turning the ATC system into a separate, self-funded, nonprofit government corporation within the Department of Transportation. The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission, which was chaired by Norman Mineta, similarly proposed moving toward a self-supporting air traffic control organization.29</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Commercialization would entail shifting from aviation-related taxes paid to the U.S. Treasury to fees for ATC services paid directly by customers to a new self-supporting Air Traffic Organization</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. This change would allow fees to grow in proportion to the growth of flight activity, rather than being tied to a less-stable variable, such as fuel prices or airline ticket prices. Moreover, a predictable revenue stream that was not subject to the federal budget process would provide the basis for the ATO to issue long-term bonds for funding capital investments.</span>
Commercialization would also address the management problems that have plagued the FAA's efforts to modernize. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A </span>non-civil-service <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ATO </span>could attract the best private-sector managers <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and engineers skilled at implementing complex technology projects</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Such an ATO could hire, fire, and compensate its employees as other high-tech businesses do. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Private sector </span>managers would have an incentive to ask tough questions about whether new investments offered real value for the money,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> a process that often doesn't occur at the FAA or in Congress</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">In addition, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a separate, self-supporting ATO</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">—no longer part of the FAA—</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would be overseen at arm's length for aviation safety by the remaining FAA. Numerous studies have pointed out that the </span>FAA's air-safety role is compromised when it comes to the ATC system, since that system is operated "in-house" by a different branch <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">of the same FAA</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. All other players in aviation—pilots, mechanics, aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and so forth—are regulated at arm's length for safety by the FAA. This separation of ATC operations from safety regulation is especially critical given the major changes entailed by shifting to the semi-automated NextGen, where numerous safety versus capacity questions will need to be addressed in a rigorous and transparent manner.</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Finally, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a self-supporting </span>ATO would address the political obstacles <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to improving system efficiency, such as making decisions to close facilities</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. By passing the enabling legislation for ATC reform, Congress would delegate such contentious issues to the customer-oriented ATO organization.</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">During the past two decades, nearly 50 governments have commercialized their air traffic control</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> systems. That means they have separated their ATC activities from their transport ministries, removed them from the civil service, and made them self-supporting from fees charged to aircraft operators. These new air navigation service providers (ANSPs) are usually regulated at arm's length by their government's aviation safety agency.</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Britain's ATC system has been commercialized by means of a "public-private partnership." National Air Traffic Services is a jointly owned company, with British airlines owning 42 percent, airport company BAA owning 4 percent, employees owning 5 percent, and the government owning the remaining minority stake. NATS is operated on a not-for-profit basis.</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Canada's ATC system has been fully commercialized</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.30 In 1996, Canada set up a private, nonprofit ATC corporation, Nav Canada, which is self-supporting from charges on aviation users. The Canadian system has been widely praised for its sound finances, solid management, and its investment in new technologies.31 The Canadian system is a very good reform model for the United States to consider.</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Nav Canada's corporate board is composed largely of aviation stakeholders.32 It has 4 seats for the airlines, 3 for the government, 2 for employees, and 1 for the non-commercial aviation industry. Those 10 stakeholders select 4 directors from outside aviation, and then those 14 select the company president, who becomes the 15th board member. To further strengthen governance, neither elected officials nor anyone connected with suppliers to Nav Canada can serve on the board. Nav Canada also has a 20-member outside Advisory Committee.</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A </span>//<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">number of studies</span>//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> have found that </span>ATC commercialization has generally resulted in //<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">improvements to service quality</span>//, //<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">better management</span>//, and //<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">reduced costs</span>//<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.33 At the same time</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span>air safety has<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">remained the same or </span>improved<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">in the countries that have pursued reforms to set up independent ANSP organizations.</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">A thorough 2009 report by Glen McDougall and Alasdair Roberts compared the performance of 10 commercialized ATC systems and the FAA during the 1997 to 2004 period.34 They looked at large amounts of performance and safety data from the systems in the various countries and conducted over 200 interviews with managers, workers, and users of the different systems. The researchers found:</span>

The United States federal government should provide a substantial increase its investment _
exclusively to areas in which private actors guarantee at least one-third of the funding upfront for a minimum of twenty years. In negotiating these partnerships, the United States federal government should open infrastructure plans to modification, including the possible transfer of project ownership to private actors. The federal government should make all necessary regulatory changes to encourage greater public-private partnerships

and provide necessary technical assistance for implementation.

So as Congress continues to develop its plans for the reauthorization of the nation’s surface transportation law it should support metro areas that raise their own revenue for the long term. Though a new partnership, the federal government should provide incentives to metropolitan areas that secure long-term and substantial regional funding sources approved for a minimum of 20 years and that equal a significant (one-third to one-half) portion of the annual federal transportation funding received. As to the incentives, a possible menu of options might include: more direct funding to metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), more flexible “mode neutral funding,” more streamlined planning processes, more direct reporting to federal agencies, and reduced bureaucracy.[7]

The net benefit is infrastructure accountability

Public investment is manipulated by project managers who cook the data to win project approval – exaggerates aff benefits and causes massive cost overruns

//This situation may need some explication, because it may sound to many like an unlikely state of affairs. After all, it may be agreed that project managers and other professionals involved in major infrastructure provision ought to be interested in being accurate and unbiased in their work. It is even stated in the Project Management Institute (PMI)’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (PMI, 2006, pp. 4, 5) that project managers should ‘provide accurate information in a timely manner’ and they must ‘not engage in or condone behaviour that is designed to deceive others’. Economists, engineers, planners, and others involved in major infrastructure provision have similar codes of conduct. But there is a dark side to their work, which is remarkably underexplored in the literature (Flyvbjerg, 1996).//
//On the dark side, project managers and planners ‘lie with numbers’. as Wachs (1989) has aptly put it. They are busy not with getting forecasts and business cases right and following the PMI Code of Ethics but with getting projects funded and built. And accurate forecasts are often not an effective means for achieving this objective. Indeed, accurate forecasts may be counterproductive, whereas biased forecasts may be effective in competing for funds and securing the go-ahead for a project. ‘The most effective planner,’ says Wachs (1989, p. 477), ‘is sometimes the one who can cloak advocacy in the guise of scientiﬁc or technical rationality.’ Such advocacy would stand in direct opposition to PMI’s ruling that project managers should ‘make decisions and take actions based on the best interests of society’ (PMI, 2006, p. 2).//
//Nevertheless, seemingly rational forecasts that underestimate costs and overestimate beneﬁts have long been an established formula for project approval as we saw above. Forecasting is here mainly another kind of rent-seeking behaviour, resulting in a make-believe world of misrepresentation which makes it extremely difﬁcult to decide which projects deserve undertaking and which do not. The consequence is, as even one of the industry’s own organs, the Oxford-based Major Projects Association, acknowledges, that too many projects proceed that should not. One might add that many projects do not proceed that probably should, had they not lost out to projects with ‘better’ misrepresentation (Flyvbjerg et al., 2002).//
//In this situation, the question is not so much what project managers can do to reduce inaccuracy and risk in forecasting, but what others can do to impose on project managers the checks and balances that would give managers the incentive to stop producing biased forecasts and begin to work according to their Code of Ethics. The challenge is to change the power relations that govern forecasting and project development. Better forecasting techniques and appeals to ethics will not do here; organizational change with a focus on transparency and accountability is necessary.//
//As argued in Flyvbjerg et al. (2003), two basic types of accountability deﬁne liberal democracies: (i) public-sector accountability through transparency and public control; and (ii) private-sector accountability via competition and the market mechanism. Both types of accountability may be effective tools to curb misrepresentation in project management and to promote a culture which acknowledges and deals effectively with risk, especially where large amounts of taxpayers’ money are at stake and for projects with signiﬁcant social and environmental impacts, as is common with major infrastructure projects.//

//Data cooking creates economic disasters – the worst projects are approved, and necessary infrastructure loses out – this turns the case//
//Flyvbjerg, 10 - Professor of Major Programme Management at Oxford University's Saïd Business School and is Founding Director of the University's BT Centre for Major Programme Management. He was previously Professor of Planning at Aalborg University, Denmark and Chair of Infrastructure Policy and Planning at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands (Bent, “Survival of the unﬁttest: why the worst infrastructure gets built—and what we can do about it,” Oxford Review of Economic Policy, Volume 25, Number 3, 2009, pp.344–367, Oxford Journals Online)//DH
In sum, the UK study shows that strong interests and strong incentives exist at the project-approval stage to present projects as favourably as possible—that is, with beneﬁts emphasized and costs and risks de-emphasized. Local authorities, local developers and land owners, local labour unions, local politicians, local ofﬁcials, local MPs, and consultants all stand to beneﬁt from a project that looks favourable on paper and they have little incentive actively to avoid bias in estimates of beneﬁts, costs, and risks. National bodies, such as certain parts of the Department for Transport and the Ministry of Finance who fund and oversee projects, may have an interest in more realistic appraisals, but so far they have had little success in achieving such realism, although the situation may be changing with the initiatives to curb bias set out in HM Treasury (2003) and UK Department for Transport (2006).
Wachs (1986, 1990) found similar results for transit planning in the USA. Taken together, the UK and US studies both account well for existing data on cost underestimation and beneﬁt overestimation. Both studies falsify the notion that in situations with high political and organizational pressure the underestimation of costs and overestimation of beneﬁts is caused by non-intentional technical error or optimism bias. Both studies support the view that in such situations promoters and forecasters intentionally use the following formula in order to secure approval and funding for their projects:
underestimated costs + overestimated beneﬁts = funding
Using this formula, and thus ‘showing the project at its best’ as one interviewee said above, results in an inverted Darwinism, i.e the survival of the unﬁttest. It is not the best projects that get implemented, but the projects that look best on paper. And the projects that look best on paper are the projects with the largest cost underestimates and beneﬁt overestimates, other things being equal. But the larger the cost underestimate on paper, the greater the cost overrun in practice. And the larger the overestimate of beneﬁts, the greater the beneﬁt shortfall. Therefore the projects that have been made to look best on paper in this manner become the worst, or unﬁttest, projects in reality, in the sense that they are the very projects that will encounter most problems during construction and operations in terms of the largest cost overruns, beneﬁt shortfalls, and risks of non-viability. They have been designed like that, as disasters waiting to happen.

The counterplan solves by doing less than the plan – the only projects that will be built are those that can secure private sector capital. This increases accountability in infrastructure design and reduces overall costs

In order to achieve accountability via competition and market control, the following would be required, again as practices that are both embedded in and enforced by the relevant institutions.
The decision to go ahead with a major infrastructure project should, where at all possible, be made contingent on the willingness of private ﬁnanciers to participate without a sovereign guarantee for at least one-third of the total capital needs. 7 This should be required whether projects pass the market test or not—that is, whether projects are subsidized or not or provided for social justice reasons or not. Private lenders, shareholders, and stock-market analysts would produce their own forecasts or conduct due diligence for existing ones. If they were wrong about the forecasts, they and their organizations would be hurt. The result would be added pressure to produce realistic forecasts and reduced risk to the taxpayer.
Forecasters and their organizations must share ﬁnancial responsibility for covering cost overruns and beneﬁt shortfalls resulting from misrepresentation and bias in forecasting.
The participation of risk capital would not mean that government reduces control of major infrastructure projects. On the contrary, it means that government can more effectively play the role it should be playing, namely as the ordinary citizen’s guarantor for ensuring concerns about safety, environment, risk, and a proper use of public funds.
Whether infrastructure projects are public, private, or public–private, they should be vested in one and only one project organization with a strong governance framework and strong contract-writing skills. The project organization may be a company or not, public or private, or a mixture. What is important is that this organization has the capacity to (i) set up and negotiate contracts that will effectively safeguard its interests, including in equity risk allocation, and (ii) enforce accountability vis-a-vis ` contractors, operators, etc. In turn, the directors of the organization must be held accountable for any cost overruns, beneﬁt shortfalls, faulty designs, unmitigated risks, etc. that may occur during project planning, implementation, and operations.
Experience with contract writing is a much-neglected topic, but is particularly important in developing and managing major infrastructure projects. This is because a fundamental asymmetry in experience with and resources allocated to contract writing often applies in the client– contractor relationship for such projects. Clients who decide to do major infrastructure—for instance, a city council deciding to build a new subway or toll road—do so relatively rarely, often only once, or never, in the lifetime of the individual city manager and council member. Learning is therefore impaired for clients, and if you do not know what your interests are, it is difﬁcult to safeguard them. Contractors, on the other hand, who bid for and build such projects, do so all the time. Contractors, therefore, typically know much more than clients about the ins and outs of projects and contracts, including the many risks and pitfalls that apply, plus which lawyers, bankers, and consultants to hire to safeguard their interests most effectively. This asymmetry has brought many a client to grief. A possible way to bring more symmetry into the client–contractor relationship would be for government to establish a central contract-writing unit at the state or national level, which would be in charge of negotiating, on behalf of local and other branches of government, the types of major contracts they do too infrequently to gain real experience. This would concentrate a larger number of contracts in one place, allowing experience—and the negotiating power that comes with it—to accumulate.
Fortunately, better governance along the lines described above has recently become stronger around the world. The Enron scandal and its successors have triggered new legislation and a war on corporate deception that is spilling over into government with the same objective: to curb ﬁnancial waste and promote good governance. Although progress is slow, good governance is gaining a foothold also in major infrastructure project management.
For example, in 2003 the Treasury of the United Kingdom required, for the ﬁrst time, that all ministries develop and implement procedures for major projects that will curb what the Treasury calls—with true British civility—’optimism bias’. Funding will be unavailable for projects that do not take into account this bias, and methods have been developed for how to do this (HM Treasury, 2003; Flyvbjerg and COWI, 2004; UK Department for Transport, 2006). In the Netherlands in 2004, the Parliamentary Committee on Infrastructure Projects for the ﬁrst time conducted extensive public hearings to identify measures that will limit the misinformation about large infrastructure projects given to the Parliament, public, and media (Tijdelijke Commissie Infrastructuurprojecten, 2004). In Boston, the government has sued to recoup funds from contractor overcharges for the Big Dig related to cost overruns. More countries and cities are likely to follow the lead of the UK, the Netherlands, and Boston in coming years; Switzerland and Denmark are already doing so (Swiss Association of Road and Transportation Experts, 2006; Danish Ministry for Transport and Energy, 2006, 2008).
Moreover, with private ﬁnance in major infrastructure projects on the rise over the past 15–20 years, capital funds and banks are increasingly gaining a say in the project development and management process. Private capital is no panacea for the ills in major infrastructure project management, to be sure (Hodge and Greve, 2009). But private investors place their own funds at risk, as opposed to governments who place the taxpayer’s money at risk. Capital funds and banks can therefore be observed not to automatically accept at face value the forecasts of project managers and promoters. Banks typically bring in their own advisers to do independent forecasts, due diligence, and risk assessments, which is an important step in the right direction. The false assumption that one forecast or one business case (which is also a forecast) may contain the truth about a project is problematized. Instead project managers and promoters are getting used to the healthy fact that different stakeholders have different forecasts and that forecasts are not only products of objective science and engineering but of negotiation. Why is this more healthy? Because it is more truthful about our ability to predict the future and about the risks involved.
If the institutions with responsibility for developing and building major infrastructures continued to implement, embed, and enforce such measures of accountability effectively, then the misrepresentation in cost, beneﬁt, and risk estimates, which is widespread today, might be mitigated. If this is not done, misrepresentation is likely to continue, and the allocation of funds for major infrastructure is likely to continue to be wasteful, unethical, and sometimes even unlawful.

Concerns of tolerance and equality subordinate and mystify capitalism as the fundamental antagonism.
Zizek, and Hanlon, Ph.D. from University of Massachusetts, 1999
(Slavoj and Christopher, “Psychoanalysis and the post-political,” October 5)
SZ: Right. But the point is that we now seem to believe that the economic aspect of power is an expression of intolerance. The fundamental problem then becomes "How can we tolerate the other?" Here, [End Page 10] we are dealing with a false psychologization. The problem is not that of intrapsychic tolerance, and so I'm opposed to this way in which all problems are translated into problems of racism, intolerance, etcetera. In this sense, I claim that with so-called postmodern identity politics, the whole concept of politics has changed, because it's not only that certain questions aren't any longer asked. The moment you begin to talk about . . . what's the usual triad? "Gender . . ." CH: "Gender/Race/Class"? SZ: Yes. The moment you start to talk this way, this "class" becomes just one aspect within an overall picture which already mystifies the true social antagonisms. Here I disagree with Ernesto Laclau's more optimistic picture of the postmodern age, where there are multiple antagonisms coexisting, etcetera . . . CH: . . . But aren't you then subordinating what is "merely cultural" to a set of "authentically" political problems? SZ: No, no. I'm well aware, for example, that the whole problematic of political economy also had its own symbolic dimension. . . . I'm not playing "merely cultural" problems against "real" problems. What I'm saying is that with this new proliferation of political subjects, certain questions are no longer asked. Is the state our ultimate horizon? Is capitalism our ultimate horizon? I just take note that certain concerns have disappeared.

It’s try or die for the revolution – capitalism will inevitably cause extinction in three decades, reform and incrementalism only hide this fact.
Kovel, Alger Hiss Professor of Social Studies at Bard College, awarded Fellowship at the John Guggenheim Foundation, 2002 (Joel, The Enemy of Nature, pages 5-7)

As the world, or to be more exact, the Western, industrial world, has leapt into a prosperity unimaginable to prior generations, it has prepared for itself a calamity far more unimaginable still. The present world system in effect has had three decades to limit its growth, and it has failed so abjectly that even the idea of limiting growth has been banished from official discourse. Further, it has been proved decisively that the internal logic of the present system translates 'growth' into increasing wealth for the few and increasing misery for the many. We must begin our inquiry, therefore, with the chilling fact that 'growth' so conceived means the destruction of the natural foundation of civilization. If the world were a living organism, then any sensible observer would conclude that this 'growth' is a cancer that, if not somehow treated, means the destruction of human society, and even raises the question of the extinction of our species. A simple extrapolation tells us as much, once we learn that the growth is uncontrollable. The details are important and interesting, but less so than the chief conclusion — that irresistible growth, and the evident fact that this growth destabilizes and breaks down the natural ground necessary for human existence, means, in the plainest terms, that we are doomed under the present social order, and that we had better change it as soon as possible if we are to survive. One wants to scream out this brutal and plain truth, which should be on the masthead of every newspaper and the station-identification of every media outlet, the leading issue before Congress and all governmental organ¬izations, the focus of every congregation and the centrepiece of every curriculum at all levels of education ... but is nothing of the kind. Yes, endless attention is paid to the crisis, a great deal of it useful, some of it trivial, and some plainly harmful. But where is the serious, systematic reflection of the brutal truth – that humanity is in the hands of a suicidal regime, which scarcely anyone thinks it either possible or desirable to funda¬mentally change? Where is the rational dissection of this system's assault on nature, and the derivation of a plan to really change it – not to regulate this or that, or to resort to prayer or inward change, but actually to address the cancer and lay out the lineaments of a cure? I should hope, here. In any case, that is my goal, and if what I have to say is not true in every detail, or even sadly mistaken, at least it can serve to push the debate about fundamentals along. I have no quarrel with many of the virtuous and sensible environmental schemes put forward these days. My quarrel is only with the judgment that holds that piecemeal reforms are all that is needed. My grievance is against the attitude that refuses to look at the problem as a whole and to contemplate radical change. For if the argument laid out above has even the slightest claim on plausibility –and it deserves repetition that the mass of evidence is such as to place the burden of proof on those who would deny it – then its implications need to be spun out without regard for how unfashionable or unsettling these may be. If there is no effective discourse on the logic of the system's growth, and the world now sits blandly in smug denial, or even uneasily in morbid contemplation, taking the word of greenwashers and conmen of all kinds instead of facing the ecological crisis squarely, then a work is needed that strives just for such a discourse. I have written The Enemy of Nature, therefore, not because there is a lack of address to our environmental woes, but because scarcely any of the innumerable works devoted to the subject develop the following implications from what has been sketched out above: That the 'reigning system' in question is capitalism, the dynamism of which, capital, is a strange beast indeed, not at all accessible to common sense, and extending far beyond its usual economic implications. That the 'growth' in question is essentially capital expressing its inner¬most being. That this is incorrigible; thus to seriously limit capital's expansion throws the system into deep crisis. For capital, it must always be 'Grow or Die!' It follows that capital cannot be reformed: it either rules and destroys us, or is destroyed, so that we may have a lease on life. That these implications demand of us that we rethink the question of revolution, now generally thought of as lying quietly in the dustbin of history. I would argue, instead, that capital's combined ecodestructivity and incorrigibility forces open the prospect of a total revolution, which I would call ecosocialist, related to but distinct from the socialisms of the past century. • That it is incumbent upon us to imagine the contours of such a revolu¬tion and spell them out, notwithstanding the currently miserable state of radical forces. Now it may be that the times are changing. Perhaps the long downturn of resistance is coming to a close, because capital, having achieved globaliza¬tion, can no longer rein in the contradictions stemming from its domination of nature and humanity, so that people everywhere break loose from the system. There are great signs to this effect, chiefly in the worldwide outbreak of demonstrations taken against the unholy trinity of global capital – the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO.4 Although The Enemy of Nature was begun well before the events in Seattle shook the world in 1999, it is, I believe, responsive to the same historical forces. It asks of those protesting globalization to consider where the logic of their actions points. How, in other words, do we go beyond the first stages of confronting the system? In what sense can the regime of capital be checked, if it can no more stop its unrelenting expansion than a man can voluntarily stop breathing? Are we ready to think through capital's overthrow and its replacement with a new kind of society based on a new kind of production? Are we ready, spurred by a dawning awareness that this crisis cannot be resolved within the existing system, to rethink this system in all its aspects, and really change it? These broad questions, and some of the innumerable issues arising from them, are addressed in the chapters to come.

Our alternative is to reject both reform and postmodern intellectualism and instead demand a radical destruction of the capitalist system.

(Rene Francisco, “The end of ant-capitalism as we knew it,” Socialist Review, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3952/is_200101/ai_n8932891)
Let me finish by addressing the "vision thing" in Marxist theory, and by putting forward some minimal suggestions for how to proceed. The problem with the Left in this country is not Marx's theorizing of capital, it is the Left's profound poverty of vision. Simply put, we cannot think "Revolution" anymore because we cannot think "Capitalism" anymore. What passes for "radical democracy" nowadays is so timid and so willing to declare and settle for quick victories that one has to wonder sometimes where exactly it is that the radicalism in radical democracy lies. And to make matters worse, we are living in a period in which the Left itself is the one in charge of convincing us that the "Revolution" is not only politically unfeasible, but also epistemologically impossible. To paraphrase Marx's famous eleventh thesis on Feuerbach, postmodern Marxists have interpreted the world for too long - the point is to change it. Do we need reform? Of course we do, but to construct reform as a "sufficient" condition for social change is to engage not in the politics of empowerment but in the practice of a politics of surrender with delusions of grandeur. Furthermore, in a post-structuralist epistemological framework in which structural and systemic explanations are forbidden, all we are left with is a blurred capacity to prioritize what is to be done. In short, in the postmodern Marxist world, it is impossible to structurally explain how the top 1 percent of the world population has more wealth than the bottom 92 percent. To do that would require the admission that there is something called capitalism with a logic to it. Recall that in the postmodern Marxist world, the political importance of "any relationship... [is determined by] how we wish to think of the complex interaction"; it is not based on institutional or systemic mechanisms of how inequality gets generated and reproduced.51 And given the postmodern Marxists' insistence on defining capitalism from the get-go as having "no essential or coherent identity,"52 it is no surprise that such academics are totally irrelevant to real people's struggles against globalization, the IMF, the WTO, and NAFTA. It's the case of the chicken coming home to roost. It is time to stop the politics of surrender and denial. It is time to stop pretending that if we repeat things over and over again for long enough (this is called "performative" in postmodern parlance), things will eventually change. The fact is that the Left has been getting crushed for quite some time now. The fact is that it is going to take more than a cadre of postmodern intellectuals and a new definition of capitalism to establish a just economic and political system. And attempts to co-opt and hijack Marxism for some reformist agenda is not going to do it either.

The aff’s RHETORICAL SILENCE PROTECTS THE INVISIBILITY OF WHITENESS AND PRESERVES WHITE PRIVILEGE
Crenshaw ‘97 [1997, Carrie, PhD, Prof of Speech Comm @ Univ. Ala. former director of debate @ Univ. of Ala.; WESTERN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION; Resisting Whiteness’ Rhetorical Silence; 61(3), Summer; pp. 253-278]
This analysis brings into focus several observations about how whiteness operates rhetorically and ideologically in public political discourse. First, the ideology of white privilege maintains its invisibility through rhetorical silence. Rhetorical silence protects the invisibility of whiteness because it both reflects and sustains the assumption that to be white is the "natural condition," the assumed norm. Rhetorical silence about whiteness preserves material white privilege because it masks its existence and makes the denial of white privilege plausible. Hall argues that language is the principle medium of ideologies because ideologies are sets or chains of meaning which are located in language. However, ideologies also "work" through rhetorical silences which conceal privilege. Ideological systems are made up of both presences and absences because positively marked terms "˜signify' "iii relation to what is absent, unmarked, the unspoken, the unsayable (Hall, "Signification" 109). In this case, the ideology of white privilege "works" through rhetorical silence about whiteness.

Vote neg - Racism must be rejected in EVERY INSTANCE. It justifies atrocities, creates an other and is truly the CAPITAL SIN.
Memmi ’00 [2000, Albert is a Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ Unv. Of Paris, Albert-; RACISM, translated by Steve Martinot, pp.163-165]
The struggle against racism will be long, difficult, without intermission, without remission, probably never achieved, yet for this very reason, it is a struggle to be undertaken without surcease and without concessions. One cannot be indulgent toward racism. One cannot even let the monster in the house, especially not in a mask. To give it merely a foothold means to augment the bestial part in us and in other people which is to diminish what is human. To accept the racist universe to the slightest degree is to endorse fear, injustice, and violence. It is to accept the persistence of the dark history in which we still largely live. It is to agree that the outsider will always be a possible victim (and which [person] man is not [themself] himself an outsider relative to someone else?). Racism illustrates in sum, the inevitable negativity of the condition of the dominated; that is it illuminates in a certain sense the entire human condition. The anti-racist struggle, difficult though it is, and always in question, is nevertheless one of the prologues to the ultimate passage from animality to humanity. In that sense, we cannot fail to rise to the racist challenge. However, it remains true that one’s moral conduct only emerges from a choice: one has to want it. It is a choice among other choices, and always debatable in its foundations and its consequences. Let us say, broadly speaking, that the choice to conduct oneself morally is the condition for the establishment of a human order for which racism is the very negation. This is almost a redundancy. One cannot found a moral order, let alone a legislative order, on racism because racism signifies the exclusion of the other and his or her subjection to violence and domination. From an ethical point of view, if one can deploy a little religious language, racism is “the truly capital sin.”fn22 It is not an accident that almost all of humanity’s spiritual traditions counsel respect for the weak, for orphans, widows, or strangers. It is not just a question of theoretical counsel respect for the weak, for orphans, widows or strangers. It is not just a question of theoretical morality and disinterested commandments. Such unanimity in the safeguarding of the other suggests the real utility of such sentiments. All things considered, we have an interest in banishing injustice, because injustice engenders violence and death. Of course, this is debatable. There are those who think that if one is strong enough, the assault on and oppression of others is permissible. But no one is ever sure of remaining the strongest. One day, perhaps, the roles will be reversed. All unjust society contains within itself the seeds of its own death. It is probably smarter to treat others with respect so that they treat you with respect. “Recall,” says the bible, “that you were once a stranger in Egypt,” which means both that you ought to respect the stranger because you were a stranger yourself and that you risk becoming once again someday. It is an ethical and a practical appeal – indeed, it is a contract, however implicit it might be. In short, the refusal of racism is the condition for all theoretical and practical morality. Because, in the end, the ethical choice commands the political choice. A just society must be a society accepted by all. If this contractual principle is not accepted, then only conflict, violence, and destruction will be our lot. If it is accepted, we can hope someday to live in peace. True, it is a wager, but the stakes are irresistible.
