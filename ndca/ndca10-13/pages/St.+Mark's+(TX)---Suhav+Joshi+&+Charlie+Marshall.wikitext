<span class="s2">**Independently – the plan is the vital concession for Chinese co-operation on North Korea** </span>
<span class="s6">**Carpenter 10**</span><span class="s1">—vice president for defense and foreign-policy studies at the Cato Institute, PhD in history (Ted Galen, 3 August 2010, China Spats, <span class="s4">[[http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/china-spats-3778]]</span>, RBatra)</span>

<span class="s6">Beijing's failure to rein in </span><span class="s1">an increasingly reckless </span><span class="s6">Pyongyang is a legitimate security issue</span><span class="s1"> for the United States. So too are China's breathtakingly broad claims in the South China Sea. China regards virtually that entire sea as its territorial waters—something that, if enforced, would have profound implications for international navigation and commerce. As the world's leading maritime and trading power, the United States cannot tamely accept such a brazen attempt to change the status of international waters through which much of the world's commerce flows.</span>
<span class="s7">But </span><span class="s1">even on those issues, Washington needs to understand that some **concessions may need to be made to secure Chinese**</span><span class="s7"> </span><span class="s1">**cooperation**</span><span class="s7">. </span><span class="s1">It is unrealistic to expect</span><span class="s7">, for example, that </span><span class="s1">China will incur the risks involved in pressuring North Korea if the U</span><span class="s7">nited </span><span class="s1">S</span><span class="s7">tates </span><span class="s1">offers nothing</span><span class="s7"> in return. </span><span class="s1">Beijing worries that coercing Pyongyang could cause </span><span class="s7">Kim Jong-il's regime to unravel—perhaps even cause the North Korean state itself to implode, much as East Germany did at the end of the 1980s. That development would produce massive refugee flows into China, and possibly result in the emergence of </span><span class="s1">a united Korea closely allied to the U</span><span class="s7">nited </span><span class="s1">S</span><span class="s7">tates and </span><span class="s1">with a U.S. **military presence on the peninsula**</span><span class="s7">.</span>
<span class="s1">If we want China to take on serious risks to tame North Korea, </span><span class="s6">we have to offer some incentives</span><span class="s1">. Promising to assist Beijing in dealing with the probable refugee problem would seem to be the absolute minimum. In all likelihood, </span><span class="s6">Chinese leaders would also want a **commitment to phase out** American **military bases in Korea** if the North Korean threat were neutralized</span><span class="s1">. Yet </span><span class="s6">Washington has not offered **the slightest hint of concessions**</span><span class="s1"> on either issue.
