The mobility of the homeless is often constrained by certain social and geographic factors,
AND
of their lack of flexibility in both spatial and temporal dimensions of commuting.


**Homelessness is not a problem that the state encounters—it is constitutive exclusion—necessary for creating the protected polity of the modern state. Homelessness becomes bare life—homo sacer—that which can be killed without punishment.**

Feldman 4
(Leonard Feldman 2004 (Leonard, Prof of PoliSci at UOregon, Citizens Without Shelter, p. 18-19)
But because naked life is represented by whole groups of people, such as the
AND
all these polarities have been structured by political power~’s isolation of bare life.


**The political position of the homeless is a prerequisite to genocidal violence**
Anawim 12
(Anawim Christian Community, coalition to end homelessness, April 10, 2012
[[http://anawimcc.org/how-are-the-homeless-dehumanized/-http://anawimcc.org/how-are-the-homeless-dehumanized/]])

Almost every person who is homeless goes through a process of dehumanization. Here are
AND
being concerned can only come about when we know those who are suffering.


**In the modern state, the home is a requirement for citizenship. The exclusion of homelessness is the first move in the creation of inside/outside and friend/enemy—the consequence is "social death" and the logic of apartheid and genocide.**
Arnold 4
(Kathleen, asst prof Political Theory UT-San Antonio, Homelessness, Citizenship, and Identity)

More often than not, homelessness is studied as a sociological problem and the dynamics
AND
subject to the deployment of prerogative (that is, nondemocratic) power.

===Plan=== 
Thus, we demand that:
**The judiciary of the United States rule that the United States federal government should substantially increase its investment in transportation infrastructure to ensure homeless persons~’ access to transportation infrastructure. The United States judiciary should base its decision on Tobe v. City of Santa Ana.**

===Contention Two is Solvency=== 
**Our demand on the judiciary is essential – two reasons**
**The legal move of Tobe v. Santa Ana is crucial—the legal recognition of public space as a zone of indistinction between homed and homeless is the only way to disrupt bare life. The plan reads the law against itself to recognize the universality of dwelling—we are all homeless—rejecting the securitized "home" defended against the "outside."**

Feldman 4
Leonard Feldman 2004 (Prof of Poli Sci at UOregon, Citizens Without Shelter, p. 141-146)

In response to this double standard—to law~’s rigorous separation of cit­izenship and
AND
a way to resist the pressures of spatial exclusion and identity purification.25 


**Second is Social Impact — Court action to destabilize the social status of homelessness is crucial to end exclusion—material improvements alone are not enough.**

Jocoy and Del Casino 10
(Christine and Vincent, Ph.Ds and Profs of Geography @ Cal State, Environment and Planning A 2010, volume 42, pages 1943-1963 "Homelessness, travel behavior, and the politics of transportation mobilities in Long Beach, California")

Clearly, the relationships between mobility/immobility and power/powerlessness (ie,
AND
might be viewed as a solution to the problems associated with social exclusion.


===Contention Three: The Ballot=== 


**We can no longer view politics exclusively within the existing political framework. Instead of relying on preset understandings of political possibilities, we must insist on our own ethical responsibility for the way we construct the realm of politics.**

Daly, Senior Lecturer in Politics, 2004~~[Glyn, Conversations with Žižek, p.8-9~~]
For Žižek, a confrontation with the obscenities of abundance capitalism also requires a transformation
AND
that, like Žižek~’s own thought, exhorts us to risk the impossible.

**Use the ballot to affirm a commitment to new political universals that confront the global neoliberal capitalist order. This is a paradoxical empty universal that identifies the entire social order with the part of the social body that is constitutively excluded—the part which has no part. The metaphoric condensation of the universal demand for equaliberty is essential for changing our current political coordinates.**


Zizek, Professor of Philosophy, 1999
~~[Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology, p. 187-8, 195, 207-8, 223-5~~]
What, for Rancière, is politics proper? A phenomenon which, for the
AND
—in order to be informed that they were excluded from this community…).

**Allowing the homeless to inhabit the public space is an act of theoretical and literal "exposure therapy" which creates a gaping disruption in the ideology of postindustrial neoliberalism.** 

Feldman 4
(Leonard, Prof of Poli Sci at UOregon, Citizens Without Shelter, p. 39-45)

A second critical strategy, rather than presenting a narrative of the end of public
AND
, prohibits both solicitation in an aggressive manner and solicitation in certain places. 


**It is necessary to crystallize the demand for equaliberty in a concrete political prescription. It is only with prescriptive mobilization combative to particular neoliberal policies that one can gain a foothold in the political situation. Abstract rejections of capitalism or the nation-state are doomed to failure.**

Hallward, Professor of Modern European Philosophy, 2005 
~~[Peter, "The Politics of Prescription," The South Atlantic Quarterly 104(4), p.782-4~~]
A consequential prescription requires an effective foothold in the situation it transforms. Guided by
AND
no doubt remain a model for the imminent democratization of the Middle East.

**We must rupture the naturalized assumptions undergriding common debate practice. The traditional policy framework of debate only serves to inscribe us more deeply within the discourse of the University, or biopolitical administration. We must not presume the neutrality of knowledge and instead politicize our very participation by identifying with the excluded non-part of the political situation**

Žižek<span style="font-size: 13pt;">,</span> Professor of Philosophy, 2004 ~~[Slavoj, Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle, p.131-157~~]
Instead of one symbolic Order, with its set of a priori rules which guarantee
AND
state itself emerges as the new Master: the state is run by the expertise of qualified bureaucrats.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">AND</span>

===Thus the plan:=== 

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The federal judiciary of the United States should rule that its decision in Clark vs. CCNV and thus all laws and policies which discourage homeless persons’ access to transportation infrastructure are invalid as unconstitutionally overbroad and vague per the California Court of Appeals decision in Tobe v. City of Santa Ana, requiring federal investment to ensure transportation infrastructure accommodates all needs of people without homes. Enforcement is guaranteed.</span>**</span>

===Contention Two is Transport Infrastructure as a “Zone of Indistinction”=== 

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Bus, air, and train infrastructure lay bare the reality—the homeless are indistinguishable from those with homes when in transit.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Returning public space to all is a “politics of homelessness”—a prerequisite to the homeless action—and allows openness to the other. This creates new forms of cosmopolitan justice for the “other” which resist the inside-outside split and break down the violence of security.</span>**

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">AND</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">answer but rather a home right here, where the Other already exists.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The federal judicial theory of anti-homeless law enforces a vision of the citizen as productive, consumptive, and ceaselessly in motion, an unachievable fantasy which, in its failure, justifies a “war on homelessness.” Allowing the homeless to inhabit the public space is an act of theoretical and literal “exposure therapy” which creates a gaping disruption in the ideology of postindustrial neoliberalism.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Must overrule Clark v. CCNV—Clark’s reasoning strips the homeless of their “right to rights”—to transportation, to speech, to all rights.

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The aff is a uniquely subversive act because it makes actualizable demands on the system that the system expects will never be made.
