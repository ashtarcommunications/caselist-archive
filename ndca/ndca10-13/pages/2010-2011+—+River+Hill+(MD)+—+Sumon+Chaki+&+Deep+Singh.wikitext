===<span style="font-size: 120%;">Observation 1 is War</span>=== 

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It is insufficient to discuss war only at the macro level. </span>****<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This is because the power which creates war does not begin at the state, it begins with the self.</span>****<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> War is a natural outlet of a force called fascism. Ignoring the desire for war causes fascism to continue unabated, creating an imperialism within all of us that once it resonates into the totalitarian state leads to mass suicide and butchery. </span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Deleuze and Guattari 1980</span>** (A Thousand Plateaus 214-215)

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Microfascist desires become political justifications for state based forms of fascist subjugation carried out at the macro level. Our reasoning for entering Iraq was not to fight a war against terror in the name of “peace”, nor was it to “promote democracy.” The “war on terror” was merely a façade to cover up the most relevant of actions; the U.S. desire to extend its colonial reach and to strengthen its geo-political position in the Middle East.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Once fascism meets totalitarianism, a despotic state is achieved – all surplus is owed to despot, including money, lives, and even the womb. The impact is no value to life and limitless slaughter.</span>**

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**Thus Deep and I advocate that United States Federal Government should eliminate its military and police presence in Iraq through the lens of schizophrenic politics. We reserve the right to clarify.**</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">**The United States Federal Government should eliminate its military and police presence in Iraq. We do not engage the plan in a normative action, instead we use it as means to affirm the rhizomatic structure.** </span>

===**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Observation 2 is The Iraqi Nomad </span>**=== 

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Nomad has become a minority force in Iraq – constantly coded and stratified by United States military forces as the US seeks to militarize Nomads to bolster the war effort. The figure of the nomad is alive today, but its message and potential is smothered by militarism. To combat fascism, we invoke the ethic of the Iraqi Nomad – a political force which resolves conflict at the local level of tribe, clan and family. Ultimately, we must seek a free Nomad, disconnected from the state and its desire for purified goals and objectives. Before meaningful political change can be made at the macro level, we must learn from the ethic of the Nomad. </span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Greenberg 2007</span>** (Ilan, Associated Press, "Ancient Nomads Offer Insights to Modern Crises", http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/world/asia/08nomads.html)

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Our affirmation of the Iraqi nomad is meaningful in that it challenges the dominant hegemonic order of the state and its ability to control both thought and action. We criticize a capital-S State – not necessarily the USFG, but the ideology of imperialism which seeks to expand centralized power at the expense of free spaces. Our affirmation of the minority identity of the Nomad is an echo of a larger struggle against the mechanisms of State Fascism. We are against divisions and articulations of place and order. We affirm instead a politics of continuation – of constantly seeking new political outlets and investigating their potential. In this sense, our affirmation is one which cannot be tied down or controlled – we move beyond the simple binary of beginning and ends and seek to explore the vast middle ground of infinite possibilities. </span>**

===**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Observation 3 is Debate </span>**=== 

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The logic of facile, uncritical affirmation of the resolution is founded by a managerial discourse bent on maintaining stifling, predictable order at all costs. The point of policies advocated in this manner has never been their explicit aims but to leave unchallenged and uncontested our fundamental assumptions about our political reality. Our affirmative instead attempts to speak in a critical language of desire. Our goal is not to begin a political movement in the liberal-democratic sense but to invent new tropes of political reality. This process, once begun, escapes from the blind alleys of pre-established political identities. </span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Goddard in 2k6</span>** (July 6th, 2006: The Encounter between Guattari and Berandi and the Post – Modern Era “Felix and Alice in Wonderland”; http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpbifo1.htm)

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Desire manifests itself at the local level – the unconscious – and resonates into a group order, powering politics. Failure to investigate motivations at the level of desire abandons any possibility of understanding how political formations come to be and ensures serial policy failure. </span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Ballantyne 2007</span>** (Andrew, Tectonic Cultures Research Group at Newcastle University , "Deleuze and Guattari for Architects" 27-28)

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We will argue there is no higher power to determine language for us, and instead we should question what that language DOES, not what it MEANS. We should question what these political affirmations DO, not whether can even discuss them. We believe no one should pay much attention to how we derived these ideas; instead they should focus on what those ideas DO and how they formulate on the body of existence. </span>**

**<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Finally, this affirmation is a record. And like the Led Zepplin “best of”, there are some tracks we hate and some we can never forget. If there is a particular song that doesn’t interest you, ignore it. If there is a track you can’t stand, delete it off your flow. Philosophy, like The Zep, is always changing its outlook, content, and sound. Certainly a core is retained, but the excesses to that core have a way of evolving.</span>**
