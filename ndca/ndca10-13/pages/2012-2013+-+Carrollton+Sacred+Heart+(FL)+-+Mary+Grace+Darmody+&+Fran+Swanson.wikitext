<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The </span>profound injusticesthat inhere in climate change's disproportionate effects are obvious, yet two of them bear explication. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">One is that </span>the unequal burden <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that is occurring, and is predicted</span>, falls on those who have not been primarily responsible for climate change, domestically as well as internationally. 75 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">African Americans, for example, are "less responsible for climate change than other Americans; ... at present, African Americans emit 20 percent less greenhouse gases per household</span>," 76 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and on a per capita basis</span>. 77 It is also true that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the less wealthy half of America, regardless of race, is far less responsible for carbon dioxide emissions as well. </span>78 Further, historically these percentage disparities were even higher. 79 The secon<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">d, and perhaps most compelling, </span>injustice is the compounding effect of the environmental risk on the underlying societal inequities - inequality that resulted in the uneven patterns of development and access to resources and opportunity in America. 80 In other words, the legacy of [*188] slavery, segregation,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the</span> placement of reservations for indigenous populations, and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the </span>more elusive systemic discrimination <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that has followed</span>, for example, is <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">now</span> locking in differentiated experiences of a warming planet<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.</span> The reach of that racial discrimination has deep implications for the structuring of sound and just climate policy. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The</span> distribution of climate change impacts is <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">likely to be </span>increasingly unjust; for that reason, it is imperative that the solutions proffered neither entrench existing vulnerabilities nor introduce new ones. 81 Without early and meaningful participation from EJ communities, the interests and needs of those communities will insufficiently inform strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. 82 In short, climate policy for both mitigation and adaptation can create its own "winners and losers," 83 and without fair decisionmaking in the process of crafting solutions, "fair outcomes will only ever be coincidental."

Climate change is as much a problem across space as it is one through time<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Studies by development agencies demonstrate that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">weather events that are either caused by </span>climate change<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or closely resemble those that are likely to become increasingly common due to it, </span>are already devastating the lives of some of the world’s poorest people, who usually <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**live in far away countries**</span> about which we know little.From floods in West Bengal to drought in Kenya to rising sea levels in Tuvalu, global warming is already having major human impacts<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and is forcing people to protect their livelihoods with new flood defences, fastermaturing crops and other emergency measures. Oxfam estimates that the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries will be at least US$50bn each year, every year (Raworth, 2007: 3). So </span>we need to take action to help alleviate the difficulties faced by people today whose lives are threatened with<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a </span>severe<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> development reversal caused by excessive GHG </span>emissions in rich countries<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>Unfortunately rich countries have a poor record of coming to the assistance of those who are distant across space, especially people<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from developing countries or </span>whose cultures are very different from their own<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In 1970 wealthy nations committed to contribute 0.7 per cent of their annual gross national incomes as development aid. Today, the average figure is just 0.28 per cent, with the United States providing only 0.16 per cent (Norway and the Netherlands are among the few countries to have achieved the target). We sometimes pour money into major emergency situations, as has occurred on multiple occasions since the Biafra crisis of the late 1960s, but our staying power is limited and we are easily distracted by other matters closer to home. By the end of April 2008, rich nations had paid only $92m into a UN fund to help the least developed countries with their most urgent and immediate adaptation needs, which is less than what Americans spend on suntan lotion each month (Oxfam, 2007: 1). </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Why don’t we do more to help? There are major academic industries in politics, sociology and cultural studies that attempt to answer this question. Some people argue that it is due to racial prejudices</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the legacies of colonialism. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Others, that nationalism prevents us looking beyond borders</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or that we maintain ourselves in a state of collective psychological denial about the lives of the poor and our responsibility for their plight. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There are those who believe that we have become anesthetized to</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">images of poverty</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and destitution we see on television, or who suggest that most people feel that whatever they can give is too little to make any real difference so they do not bother.

And even if their loved ones were safe, people could easily envision how one of their close friends or children travelling around Asia on a gap year might have lost their lives.

Allyson, “THE NEED FOR ICE BREAKERS ON THE GREAT LAKES,” http://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/443/115604/
Before the years of WWII the shipping season would come to a stand-still and the shipping trade would stop. During the war it was important to keep the steel mills running so products could be continually produced for the war effort. Today the shipping season is still kept steaming with<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Coast Guard </span>icebreakers<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> breaking the way,</span> and helping to keep more than one million people in the state of Ohio alone employed. During normal winters the Coast Guard will spend more than 4,000 hours breaking ice to keep shipping moving. However, the winter of 2005/2006 has seen some unseasonably warm temperatures throughout the region which has raised the question of whether or not there is now a need for large Coast Guard cutters on the lakes to break ice. "One must remember this is an unusual winter," Lt. Cmdr. Charles Alcock, the Ninth District's assistant to aids to navigation chief. "Just three years ago we had one of the worst winters in years." That particular winter, 2002/2003, was one of the most severe winters the Great Lakes region has experienced in the last 50 years. Ice formation started in early December, a full month ahead of forecasts and normal dates. Records for earliest recorded freezes were set in many waterways. Conditions continued to worsen throughout the navigation season, and icebreaking continued until late April. Temperatures were so cold that four of the five major lakes completely froze over: Superior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. For the first time in 25 years ice breaking was required near Chicago. What is to be done? "It would be like a city saying ‘Well, we didn't have any fires this week, so we don't need fire fighters anymore,'" said Glenn Nekvasil, the vice president of corporate communications of the Lake Carriers Association based in Cleveland. Up until the late 19th century and early 20th century most of the shipping<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> trade on the lakes </span>had to //come to a halt// due to<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the lakes </span>freezing<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> over</span>. Once the spring started to thaw the ice on the lakes, smaller icebreakers would break up the ice enough to get commerce moving again, though the waterways of the Straits of Mackinac and the St. Mary's River annually became jammed with ice, creating a stand-still in shipping. The first Cutter Mackinaw breaks ice in the Great Lakes. Official Coast Guard photo. Two of the early icebreakers were the Cutters Escanaba and the Tahoma. Both were 165 feet long and built for light ice breaking, law enforcement and rescue work. The Tahoma was home ported in Cleveland from 1934 to 1941 and the Escanaba in Grand Haven, Mich., from 1932 to 1941. With the onset of the World War II both cutters were needed for patrolling and ice breaking outside of the Great Lakes. During the war the need to keep the shipping industry on the Lakes open year became a necessity. The Commandant of the Coast Guard at the time, Adm. C.A. Park estimated that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if the shipping season could be lengthened by just 10 more days that would mean 3.5 million tons of resources could be moved</span>, helping the war effort to include feeding American Soldiers with product made from 120 million more bushels of grain. On Dec. 17, 1941 legislation was passed to build a cutter made specifically for icebreaking on the Great Lakes. In March 1943 the keel was laid for the Cutter Mackinaw and it was officially accepted into service Dec. 20, 1944. For more than 60 years the Mackinaw has been breaking ice, keeping industry moving on the lakes. Just last year alone it spent almost 700 hours breaking ice, and that was considered a normal winter. During the winter of 2002/2003 it spent just over 1,300 hours breaking ice, keeping the shipping lanes open. In June 2006 the older Mackinaw is scheduled to be replaced by a newer Mackinaw. At a cost of $90 million, paid for by American taxpayers (not just Great Lakes takes payers) Mackinaw is a one-of-a-kind 240-foot icebreaker and buoy tender, built at the Marinette Marine Corporation shipyard. The Coast Guard's Great Lakes Icebreaker Replacement Project, a major acquisition to replace its WW II-era predecessor, began in 2001 when the contract was awarded to Marinette Marine. The ship's primary missions are: Maritime Homeland Security, Ice Breaking, Aids to Navigation, Law Enforcement, Marine Environmental Protection, and Search and Rescue. Though shipping has declined slightly since WW II (62 million tons of cargo today as opposed to approximately 90 to 100 million tons), shipping is<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> still the </span>ideal<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> way to transport raw materials to the steel mills</span>. Most of America's "steelmaking capacity remains rooted in the Great Lakes<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> basin. </span>Steel made in Great Lakes mills //powers// the nation's //economy//." (Lake Carriers' Association 2006 Position Papers) "//Seventy percent// of the nation's automobiles are produced in the Great Lakes<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> basin... [</span>and] accounts for more than half of all //heavy manufacturing//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">." </span>In 2005 17 million tons of cargo was shipped during the ice season (Dec. to April), which "16% of the annual shipping total with a product estimated value of $800 million," Nekvasil said. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Shipping</span> these <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">raw materials via the lakes is</span> still the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">easiest</span>, safest and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">most economical</span> mode of transporting the raw materials: 1 Laker = 7 100-car unit trains; 1 Laker = 2,800 trucks "Trains would burn an additional 14 million gallons of fuel and generate another 4,321 tons of emissions. Moving just one million tons of cargo by truck...would increase fuel consumption by 3.4 million gallons and emissions by 570 tons," according to the LCA Papers. The LCA Papers predicted a "vessel-to-rail shift for the 11 cargo flows would statistically result in 36 rail-crossing accidents, 14 derailments and one train collision... trucks would statistically produce 141 truck/car accidents on the roads and highways - one quarter of which would have the potential for fatalities or serious injuries." The winter of 2005 will be remembered as a "warm" winter through the Great Lakes. Icebreaking operations were cancelled due to limited or no ice. The Coast Guard's newest ice breaker, the Mackinaw, also cancelled ice trials because of the scarce ice formation in the region. But even in the "warm" winter a couple of lakers were in need of help and needed to be broken out of the ice to keep commerce steaming. Weather patterns will change as they have done so for the past 4,600 million years or so. Though Great Lakes shipping hasn't been around that long, it, too, is just as //important// to the region and goes hand-in-hand with //ice breaking//, and for now, they are here to stay.

It is no overstatement to say that the end of the Cold War was one of the most important events in recent world history. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Scholars</span> from many areas of study <span style="font-size: 11pt;">have used the fall of the Soviet Union as a starting point to explain shifts in security, globalization, humanitarianism and institutional integration</span>, all of which played important roles in world affairs in the immediate post-Cold War era. Since 1991, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">explanatory modelsfor international</span> and global <span style="font-size: 11pt;">politics have </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">broadened</span>////<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> their scope</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">to include variables such as individual preferences, capitalist oppression, ideational construction, environmentalism, gender and sexual politics, and discursive power to levels </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">previously unforeseen</span>// throughout the Cold War years. As such, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">we now see the world as</span> a <span style="font-size: 11pt;">far more complex</span> and nefarious arena in which power and dominance are exercised each day. At the systemic level, the fall of the Soviet Union equated to nothing short of a monumental shift in the way states would make foreign and defence strategy. For 50 years, the bipolar system was dominated by two superpowers constantly competing and building arms in an effort to balance one another. The end of the Cold War signalled a major shift in systemic arrangement, as the system went from being bipolar to the world entering what was often referred to as the “unipolar moment.”1 <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The era of unipolarity and American hegemony</span> in the international system <span style="font-size: 11pt;">has been marked by stability</span> in an interstate sense, and the realignment of various spheres of influence in the wake of the Soviet Union’s demise. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Far from being just a theoretical notion, the unipolar moment has also provided states with an environment in which to pursue their national self-interest where the likelihood of conflict is </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">decreased</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and great power security competition has been </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">minimized</span>//.2 As such, new areas of foreign affairs and defence strategy have become far more important than they could have been throughout the bipolar con- strained Cold War years. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">One of the most notable examples in this regard has been the increased desire for territorial protection and extension in the Arctic region</span>. In an era of state preoccupation with humanitarianism, terrorism and economic reces- sion, it is being suggested by some observers that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the Arctic has become the </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">primary stage</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> through whichstates</span>, both great and minor in power, can <span style="font-size: 11pt;">pursue</span> their <span style="font-size: 11pt;">self-interest</span> in a way that combines soft power cooperation through bodies of gov- ernance with hard power and military build-up. As things presently stand, there are a variety of nations and institutions all seek- ing to claim governing authority over different parts of the circumpolar region. Nations making claims to parts of the Arctic Ocean or other northern waters include Canada, Russia, the United States, Norway, Iceland and Denmark/Greenland. On the institutional side, Arctic governance has been debated and defined by bodies such as the United Nations, the European Union, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Arctic Council.3 To date, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">no clear resolution to competing claims is in sight</span>, and in some cases <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the situation is on the verge of becoming far more</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">competitive</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">as nations such as Russia have resorted to asserting possible military solutions to contested Arctic issues to bolster their declarations</span>. It is important to note the increased levels of interest over Arctic relations between states, but, on this point, little attention has been given to the influence of the international system over this situation. If the unipolar moment has been defined as an era of relative stability and diplomatic coexistence, and tensions in the Arctic are already on the rise, what is to happen when the multipolar system finally emerges in the near future? Since 2005, the status of the United States as systemic hegemon has been in decline due to economic, military and political strains placed on American power capabilities throughout the Bush era and beyond. This decrease in relative power preponderance has been even further exacerbated by the economic recession starting in 2008 and the nation’s inability to stabilize its markets. As such, the predictions of those like Christopher Layne and John Mearsheimer are on the verge of coming to fruition, in that the unipolar moment is about to end.4 New great powers are ris- ing, the United States is no longer able to prevent these nations from balancing their power, and the once obvious prevalence of American power is far murkier than it was a decade ago. As the multipolar era becomes increasingly likely, one must ponder the effects this shift might have on state foreign and defence strategy- making, especially towards the Arctic region. To date, though its relative power position has declined significantly in recent years, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the United States </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">remains the hegemon</span>// of the international system, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">but it is</span> contended here that such status is //<span style="font-size: 11pt;">soon to evaporate</span>//. In this context, this article argues that the emergence of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">a multipolar</span> systemic <span style="font-size: 11pt;">arrangement is very likely to increase security competition in the system</span> as a whole, and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the Arctic will be at the </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">epicentre</span>// of such conflict. To lend support to this hypothesis, an examination of the impending shift from unipolarity to multipolarity will be made, as will an account of current security dynamics in the circumpolar region. The article concludes with a stark warning that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">without some kind of real action</span> towards settling competing Arctic claims, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">it will beleft to states to secure their own territorial assertionsthrough</span>hard power <span style="font-size: 11pt;">and forceful means</span>. The system is unipolar ... for now In order to evaluate the polarity of the international system in a given historical period, one must identify the hierarchy of power in terms of the number of super or great powers dominating international outcomes. Counting great or super powers can be somewhat difficult in contemporary international relations, as scholars have begun to expand the notions of power and capabilities, but the clearest guideline for being able to identify great powers is through determining capabilities. The rea- son it is essential to understand the great powers in international relations is that they, above all other states, institutions, non-state actors and ideational forces, are responsible for the daily conduct of behaviour in the international system, and they have been historically accountable for substantial alterations to power distribution since the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. Measuring capabilities allows observers to explain which states are most likely to affect the behaviour of other states, to use force or violence; also, the number of great powers in a given era determines how stable or unstable the international system will be. Identifying great powers is literally done by evaluating each state’s capabilities in essential areas of political life that can maximize security or extend one’s power. When discussing the distribution of power across states, there is a clear hierarchy of capabilities among states that leads observers to classify these utility maximizing, rational actors as super, great, major, middle or minor powers in the international system. In terms of actual measurement, Kenneth Waltz argues: “Their rank depends on how they score on all of the following items: size of population and territory, resource endowment, economic capability, military strength, political stability and competence.”5 Once these various factors are taken into account, one can clearly determine the given polarity of the system at a given moment in history. Why is polarity important? According to structural realist theory, the number of great powers in the system determines how conflictual, violent or stable interna- tional politics will be. While the overall structure of the system remains anarchic, meaning a clear absence of a governing authority above states that can control their actions, there can be consequential variations within the anarchic structure that can impact how states will evaluate their foreign and defence policy strategies and affect their overall behaviour. Waltz claims that “ ‘consequential’ variations in number are changes of number that lead to different expectations about the effect of structure on units.”6 There are three types of structure within the system that have been determined throughout the history of the modern state system – unipolarity, bipolar- ity and multipolarity. The consequential variations described by Waltz take place when great powers either rise or fall, and induce shifts from one type of polarity to another. The rise and fall of great powers is perhaps the most important explanatory aspect of international politics because it is these states that “inherently possess some offensive military capability, which gives them the wherewithal to hurt and possibly destroy each other.”7 Though the primary motivation for all states is secu- rity maximization, great powers become the most important actors because while they are capable of defending themselves, they also have the ability to extend their sphere of influence in offensive posturing. It is in this context that the polarity of the system becomes even more vital, in that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the more great powers there are, the greater likelihood of</span>violence and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">conflict</span> there is. In each systemic arrangement, the abilities of great powers to pursue their ultimate goal, which is hegemony, dic- tates whether foreign and defence policy strategies will be overtly defensive or potentially offensive. All states are like-units, in that they all strive for survival by making rational calculations about how to best pursue their interests in an anarchic system. Of course, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">strategies of states will differ greatly based on the distribution of power</span>, meaning that great powers are able to pursue their goals more freely than minor powers because they can operate without allies or institutions in achieving their goals. Lesser powers, however, typically try to increase their power position in world affairs through various alliance blocs and institutional binding. In doing so, it is hoped that middle and minor powers are able to guarantee their survival by align- ing themselves with powers larger than themselves. Given the arrangement of the system, the number of alliances or blocs of power will differ, which also contributes to just how stable or violent the system will be. Conflict, or the possibility of it, is a constant problem in international relations due to the anarchic structure of the international system. Anarchy, by its definition, denotes a lack of overarching authority and thus states, especially the most powerful states, are able to behave as they would like, without any external body capable of controlling their actions. Robert Art and Robert Jervis aptly define anarchy by argu- ing: “States can make commitments and treaties, but no sovereign power ensures compliance and punished deviation. This – the absence of a supreme power – is what is meant by the anarchic environment of international politics.”8 In anarchy, just as in the state of nature or war prior to the establishment of civilized human society, there is no harmony and actors are left to their own inclinations to pursue their self-interest. The key elements of anarchy that precipitate conflict are the con- stant distrust of others’ motives, the assumption that other actors may not be as rational as oneself, and, as Waltz notes, “a state will use force to attain its goals if, after assessing the prospects for success, it values those goals more than it values the pleasures of peace.”9 The constant tensions between states, and the ability of great powers to more freely pursue their national interests, contributes to a system where security and survival are at a premium, and the polarity of the system matters to all states. By definition, bipolar systems are the most stable. According to Mearsheimer, this assumption is made based on three criteria: First, the number of conflict dyads is fewer, leaving fewer possibilities for war. Sec- ond, deterrence is easier, because imbalances of power are fewer and more easily averted. Third, the prospects for deterrence are greater because miscalculations of rela- tive power and opponents’ resolve are fewer and less likely.10 By contrast, multipolar systems have a far greater probability of conflict, tension and distrust among states. War is far more likely in multipolar systems because major power dyads are more numerous, each posing the potential for conflict. Conflict could also erupt across dyads involving major and minor powers. Dyads between minor powers could also lead to war [...]. Wars in a multipolar world involving just minor powers or only one major power are not likely to be as devastating as a conflict between two major powers. However, local wars tend to widen and escalate. Hence there is always a chance that a small war will trigger a general conflict.11 While bipolarity is considered to be the most stable arrangement, and multipolarity the least stable, there is also the rare time when the system is unipolar in character. Put simply, unipolarity occurs when there is such a preponderance of power by one state that others are incapable of balancing against it. According to William Wohl- forth, unipolarity is also a stable and peaceful arrangement: unipolarity favors the absence of war among the great powers and comparatively low levels of competition for prestige or security for two reasons: the leading state’s power advantage removes the problem of hegemonic rivalry from world politics, and it reduces the salience and stakes of balance-of-power politics among the major states.12 <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The status of the hegemonic power</span> in a unipolar system allows for the expansion of its normative agenda, but also <span style="font-size: 11pt;">allows it to pacify internationalaffairs because it lacks both a hegemonic rival and the effects of balance of power politics</span>.13 As such, unipolar systems can be stable, depending on whom the hegemon is and what its vision for dominance might be. Since the end of World War II, only two types of polarity have been seen. Between 1945 and 1991, the system was bipolar, in that there were only two super- powers dominating the affairs of international politics. This bipolar arrangement was surprisingly stable and though smaller proxy wars erupted throughout the years of the Cold War, the relations between the two dominant powers, namely the United States and the Soviet Union, never came to a head. There are various explanations for why this was the case, but John Mearsheimer provides perhaps the most concise and accurate explanations as he contends that the absence of war in Europe and beyond throughout the Cold War can be attributed to three specific factors: the bipolar distribution of military power on the [European] Continent; the rough mili- tary equality between the two states comprising the two poles in Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union; and the fact that each superpower was armed with a large nuclear arsenal.14 At the conclusion of the Cold War, there was a clear and major shift in the distribution of power in the system, which translated into the unipolar moment. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States retained its superpower status and held a preponderance of power in virtually all areas of capabilities measurement. Christopher Layne contends that American hegemony is contingent upon two factors: First, the United States enjoys a commanding preeminence in both military and eco- nomic power. Second, since the Soviet Union’s disappearance, no other great power has emerged to challenge US preponderance. In this sense, US hegemony is the result of objective material conditions.15 Throughout the Clinton and early years of the Bush administrations, the role of the United States as systemic hegemon was virtually unquestioned, and it seemed as if American hegemony could last for a very long time. It was not until the latter years of the Bush administration that the waning of American hegemony began to become apparent. One of the key reasons the system remains unipolar is that there has yet to be a state that can balance against US power in either the hard or soft power senses. That said, the main reason for the decline in American hegemony has been a costly set of irrational and ill-advised foreign policy decisions, combined with years of economic overvaluation that eroded the hegemonic position of the world’s lone superpower.16 Both the intervention into Iraq, starting in 2003, and the fallout of the 2008 recession have served to substantially weaken the United States in both the hard and soft power contexts, and thus it is clear that a multipolar system is on the horizon. As Layne notes, “although a new geopolitical balance has yet to emerge, there is considerable evidence that other states have been engaging in bal- ancing against the United States – including hard balancing.”17 The <span style="font-size: 11pt;">emerging great powers</span>, especially China and Russia, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">will have a profound impact on</span> the conduct of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">international relations</span> in the years to come. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Perhaps the most important area of security competition that has gone under- scrutinized</span> from a systemic standpoint <span style="font-size: 11pt;">is the increased level of interest in the </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Arctic</span>//. Currently, the competing claims for <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the</span> circumpolar region are mostly peaceful and focusing on diplomatic and legal battles, but recent trends suggest that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">non-violent strategy may not continue. As the era of American hegemony comes to an end,</span> and a multipolar system begins to emerge, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the impact on the Arctic region is likely to be </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">profound</span>// <span style="font-size: 11pt;">due to the militaristic nature of state security strategies, unpredictability and a potential </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">retreat from cooperation</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> normally seen in multipolar structures</span>. The Arctic in the unipolar moment <span style="font-size: 11pt;">One of the cornerstones of America’s unipolar moment has been the remarkable decline in interstate conflict</span>. Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the interna- tional system has not been on the verge of any major war, nor have great powers aggressively pursued policies that would balance against American power in a way that would be taken seriously. According to many scholarly studies, the world since the end of the Cold War has become far more secure in the interstate sense, and security and defence policies of states are now preoccupied more with human- centric and intrastate variables than anything else. Though it is difficult to deny that the world has become more stable at the systemic level, the role of hard power and military capabilities did not disappear with the Soviet Union; instead, the use of militarism to achieve national goals in the unipolar moment greatly decreased as a direct result of the values and grand strategy of the United States. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The</span> impact of a unipolar <span style="font-size: 11pt;">systemic arrangement</span> on state behaviour <span style="font-size: 11pt;">is </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">best explained</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> by the hegemonic stability theory</span>.18 According to this theory, a unipolar structure is able to pacify the relations of states because there is recognition of the hegemon’s ability to control or intervene in conflicts that may threaten its power, or the order of the system. Wohlforth summarizes the basic precept of hegemonic stability theory by contending: The theory stipulates that especially powerful states (“hegemons”) foster international orders that are stable until differential growth in power produces a dissatisfied state with the capability to challenge the dominant state for leadership. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The clearer and lar- ger the concentration of power</span> in the leading state, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the more peaceful the international order</span> associated with it will be [...] If the system is unipolar, the great power hierar- chy should be much more stable than any hierarchy lodged within a system of more than one pole. Because unipolarity is based on a historically unprecedented concentra- tion of power in the United States, a potentially important source of great power con- flict – hegemonic rivalry – will be missing.19 It is essential to note two things about the status of the United States as systemic hegemon throughout the immediate post-Cold War era – first, that its preponderance of power in every area of capability measurement created a stable and less tense system in which states were able to interact; and second, that the United States’ time as hegemon has fostered the growth of multilateral institutions and agreements rather than a bullying type of unipolarity.20 From a systemic standpoint, it would seem that there is little reason to be concerned about military aggression, arms racing and distrustful competition in the modern system, but one vital concern to note is that much of the unipolar and hegeomic stability literature completely ignores the role of the Arctic in state security calculations. Throughout an era of institutional binding, regional integra- tion, humanitarianism and soft power growth, the competition for the Arctic was following much of the same pattern, with states preferring to make their claims in institutional or legal settings. Yet, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">as the unipolar moment has started to decline</span>, and multipolarity is on the horizon, the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">competition in the circumpolar region has taken on a very different tone</span>. Competing claims over Arctic territories, such as the Northwest Passage, Beaufort Sea and other maritime boundaries, and the use of the region as a space for military exercises are by no means new and they have not come to the forefront of the strategic security agendas of states since the post-9/11 era. Rather, throughout the Cold War, the Arctic was a realm of constant supervision, not because either superpower wanted to develop the region, but more because of the mutual fear each side had of offensive attacks being launched over the pole. Even throughout the unipolar moment, the Arctic has been a space for sovereignty competition, but the nature of the competition had been mostly legal, institutional or soft power focused.21 Worth noting as well is the very complex nature of reasons for state interests in the Arctic. Mark Nuttall effectively summarizes the complexities of the high north as he claims: In the post-Cold War world [the Arctic] is seen as a natural scientific laboratory, under- stood as a homeland for indigenous peoples, a place of sovereignty conflicts, an emerg- ing hydrocarbon province with which the world is coming to think of as one of the last major frontiers for oil and gas, and a region of dramatic environmental change.22 Though the intricacies of Arctic competition are intriguing to note, it is how states are strategically asserting their claims that is of particular importance. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The start of America’s</span> hegemonic <span style="font-size: 11pt;">decline has allowed states to revisit their approaches to theArctic</span> as nations jockey for position by balancing or rivalling American preferences. As a result, the nature of Arctic competition has incorporated both soft power and hard power elements. Further, the nature of militarism and hard power tension has increased due to the recent spending and strategic shifts by many Arctic states in recent years, including Canada, Norway, Sweden and Russia.23 The reasons for America’s decline are relatively unsurprising – military overextension in Afghanistan and Iraq; the lack of international support for American foreign policy objectives throughout the Bush era; the 2008 economic recession; and the utter dis- trust by most states, including close American allies, of the United States’ political objectives.24 <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The system remains unipolar, of course, but</span> as stated above, the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">pre- ponderance</span> of power capabilities <span style="font-size: 11pt;">has</span> substantially <span style="font-size: 11pt;">diminished, opening the door for others to balance and rival American power</span> in the coming years. Coincidentally, it has also been the revelations of science in recent years that have also promoted a faster pace for those states making Arctic claims. The role of climate change and its impact over the Arctic has allowed for states to more freely move into the region and pursue strategies previously unavailable.25 According to Lotta Numminen, climate change has recently affected states’ perceptions of the possible economic opportunities in the Arctic in four ways: first, that the subsurface of the Arctic Ocean floor is assumed to contain substantial oil and gas reserves, to which there will be increased access; second, that melting waters will provide new waters for international fisheries; third, the increase in research strategies; and fourth, is the greater access to sea passages.26 One of the main reasons states see the Arctic region as such a lucrative area is the potential for increasing their respec- tive economic and natural resource capabilities. Previously, the northern ice caps prevented states from entering most of the Arctic Ocean and surrounding areas, but as these environmental situations change, states have readily identified the high north as a priority in both their security and economic strategies. Among the main reasons the Arctic has not been more readily seen as a poten- tial area for security competition and conflict is the interpretation that the United States has little or no interest in the circumpolar region at all. According to Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth, American hegemony throughout the post-Cold War era was seen as passive, stable and enduring because of the lack of counterpower being demonstrated in the system: Bounded by oceans to the east and west and weak, friendly powers to the north and south, the United States is both less vulnerable than previous aspiring hegemons and also less threatening to others. The main potential challengers to its unipolarity, mean- while – China, Russia, Japan, and Germany – are in the opposite position. They can- not augment their military capabilities so as to balance the United States without simultaneously becoming an immediate threat to their neighbors. Politics, even interna- tional politics, is local. Although American power attracts a lot of attention globally, states are usually more concerned with their own neighborhoods than with the global equilibrium. Were any of the potential challengers to make a serious run at the United States, regional balancing efforts would almost certainly help contain them, as would the massive latent power capabilities of the United States, which could be mobilized as necessary to head off an emerging threat.27 Almost completely omitted from such interpretations, however, are America’s north- ern borders over Alaska and into the Arctic. Latitudinal thinking would seem to indicate that Brooks and Wohlforth are correct in terms of America’s interests in many areas of the globe, but this ignores what has been happening at the top of the world in the high north. It is not as if the United States has been ignorant of its own decline in power, especially regarding the Arctic. In 2009, the United States issued National Security Presidential Directive 66 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 25 that deal exclusively with American Arctic policy. According to these directives, the altera- tions to national policies of other states regarding the Arctic compelled the United States to clearly outline the security and development strategies they would use to protect its Arctic interests. Among the first, and most clear, elements of the direc- tives is the clear intention of the United States to defend their national security interests. According to Article III, subsection B 1 of the directives: The United States has broad and fundamental national security interests in the Arctic region and is prepared to operate either independently or in conjunction with other states to safeguard these interests. These interests include suchmatters as missile defense and early warning; deployment ofsea and air systems for strategic sealift, strategic deterrence, maritime presence, and maritime security operations; and ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight.28 The contemporary changes to the international system <span style="font-size: 11pt;">as</span> the era of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">American hegemony has begun to wane,</span> the effects of climate change and greater access, and the increasingly militaristic strategies of most every Arctic state have led to a situa- tion where tensions are at an all time high, and that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">legal or institutional processes are unlikely to resolve </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">anything</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> amicably</span>. As the system continues its transition away from unipolarity, observers are left to ponder what might come next after an era of relative interstate stability. Multipolarity and the circumpolar In their 2002 article on the nature of United States primacy and the enduring aspects of American hegemony, Brooks and Wohlforth argue that the United States would have to act as a benevolent hegemon in order to prevent counterbalancing and to be able to build effective regimes worldwide. They argue: Magnanimity and restraint in the face of temptation are tenets of successful statecraft that have proved their worth from classical Greece onward. Standing taller than lead- ing states of the past, the United States has unprecedented freedom to do as it pleases. It can play the game for itself alone or for the system as a whole; it can focus on small returns today or larger ones tomorrow. If the administration truly wants to be loved as well as feared, the policy answers are not hard to find.29 The problem with such analyses of American hegemony is that the Bush administration chose to ignore utterly such warnings and, rather than acting mag- nanimously, post-9/11 American foreign policy did precisely what it should not have. Pre-emption, coercion and irrational interventions, combined with a major economic recession, all serve to explain why American hegemony began to decline by 2005 in terms of both actual power levels and perceptions of legitimate hege- monic status.30 The clearest sign that American exceptionalism has been decreasing is the aggressive and regional balancing dynamics taking place between states in the Arctic region. Security strategy in the circumpolar region has altered dramatically since 2005, with more states showing interest, hard power spending increasing, and legal pro- cesses being coupled by at times overtly offensive strategy.31 Russia, Canada and a number of European states, especially Norway and Sweden, exemplify this line of argument about how sovereignty claims have become focused on traditional inter- state arms racing and militarism while soft power components, like governance structures and legal processes, continually evolve.32 As mentioned previously, even the United States has woken up to see that, as their hegemony declines, other states have begun to balance against them in the Arctic, thus provoking the 2009 Presi- dential Directives. Even so, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Arctic interested nations have not yielded to American claims,</span> nor has there been any evidence of America’s closest allies backing down in the face of its Arctic assertions, most clearly evidenced by Canada’s continued claims over the Northwest Passage.33 <span style="font-size: 11pt;">In the international relations canon, most observers point to either India or China as emerging great powers</span> that are the most likely to counterbalance Ameri- can power. The 2004 American National Intelligence Council report highlights this theory by stating: The likely emergence of China and India as new major global players – similar to the rise of Germany in the 19th century and the United States in the early 20th century – will transform the geopolitical landscape, with impacts potentially as dramatic as those of the previous two centuries. In the same way that commentators refer to the 1900s as the American Century, the early 21st century may be seen as the time when some in the developing world led by China and India came into their own.34 Both China and India have recently expressed their interest in Arctic affairs, but <span style="font-size: 11pt;">no power is as close to rivalling or challenging American power in hard power terms than </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Russia</span>//. This is especially true in the Arctic, as <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Russia’s Arctic policies have made its intentions towards asserting its control over territory it deems to be sovereign very clear</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The role of the Arctic in Russian foreign policy </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">cannot be understated</span>//. According to Russia’s 2008 Arctic policy document, the region is seen as the epicentre of Russia’s military and socio-economic development. The top two priorities for Russian Arctic interests are defined as follows: (a) In the sphere of socio-economic development – the expansion of the resource base of the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation, in order to substantially satisfy Russia’s needs in hydrocarbon resources, hydro-biological resources, and other types of strate- gic raw materials; (b) In the sphere of military security, defense, and safekeeping of the state borders of the Russian Federation located in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation – the upkeep of a favorable operational regime in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federa- tion, including the maintenance of the required combat potential of military groupings under the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, other troops, military formations and agencies in this region [...]35 In order to achieve these goals, the Russians have created a unique military brigade to be permanently posted in the Arctic, have placed a Russian Federation flag on the Arctic Ocean seabed, have conducted various missile tests, have sailed their nuclear submarines through contested waters and have openly challenged the abilities of other states to enforce their own claims. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">In response to Russian offensive posturing and the inability of the United States to dissuade security competition</span> in the area, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">middle and minor powers have begun to use hard power as a means of trying to enforce their sovereignty</span>. Perhaps the best example here is Canada, whose military capabilities are extremely weak, but strong rhetoric and a drastically increased level of high-north military spending since 2006 seems to indicate that the Canadian government cannot rely on its American alliances to protect its interests, and that posturing by states like Russia or even Denmark clearly threaten Canada’s national interests. As Norway, Sweden and Denmark have begun to put an emphasis on hard power capabilities to extend or defend northern claims, Canada has done the same. Worth noting as well in the Canadian context is that, while great powers like Russia and the United States can easily defeat any middle or minor power, Canada’s capabilities are being either rivalled or surpassed by European states like Norway.36 Canada’s realization of the evolving security and environmental climate in the Arctic has compelled changes to its domestic and foreign security policies, each seeking to assert Canadian sovereignty over areas of the Arctic, especially the Northwest Passage. One of the main components of now Prime Minister Harper’s 2005–06 campaign was to bolster Arctic security resources, as many Canadians have identified the region as an essential part of Canada’s national security and identity.37 Rob Huebert argues: The Harper government has increasingly recognized the significance of maintaining a strong presence in the Arctic and has vigorously begun to improve Canada’s northern abilities [...] The Harper government has also made a series of promises to consider- ably expand Canada’s northern capability [...] If these promises are implemented, Canada will have significantly improved its ability to control activity in its Arctic.38 In virtually any other area of the world, Canadian national security cannot be divorced from the United States, which is a partial explanation for why Canada has traditionally been considered a middle power since the end of World War II.39 Yet, since the start of American decline, the Canadian government has recognized that its fate in the Arctic will be its own, and not intrinsically tied to the protection of the United States, as the Americans have their own interests in the region and have shown a complete disregard for Canadian claims over the Northwest Passage and the Beaufort Sea. As the world moves towards multipolarity, it has become increasingly obvious that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the Arctic region represents an area of increased security competition and a potentially conflictual region in the future. Multipolar systems are the most unsta- ble, and history has shown these to produce military conflict due to the natural effects brought by a larger number of self-interested powers vying for power and security</span>. Further, as new great powers begin to emerge, American strategic consid- erations will be spread so thin that they will be unable to prevent against their even- tual loss of hegemony. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">The largest mistake being made at this time by international security scholars</span> and policymakers <span style="font-size: 11pt;">is their</span> normal <span style="font-size: 11pt;">obsession with China, India and latitudinal thinking. The next area of major war is not likely to be the Middle East</span>, the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Indian Ocean or</span> the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">South China Sea, due to traditional security balancing, deterrence and economic interests in each of these areas</span>. Multipolarity naturally brings the possibility of war. Mearsheimer contends that war is far more likely in multipolar systems for three reasons: First, there are more opportunities for war, because there are more potential conflict dyads in a multipolar system. Second, imbalances of power are more commonplace in a multipolar world, and thus great powers are more likely to have the capability to win a war, making deterrence more difficult and war more likely. Third, the potential for miscalculation is greater in multipolarity: states might think they have the capabil- ity to coerce or conquer another state when, in fact, they do not.40 Presently, there is little reason to believe that tension and strategic posturing will lead to the outbreak of war in the near future. That said, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">as America’s influence continuesto wane</span>, other <span style="font-size: 11pt;">states have shown their desire to take full advantage of the United States’ inability to control northern affairs. If the United States does lose its hegemony</span>, which many commentators believe is inevitable, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">there will be</span> at least four dyads in security calculations, with Russia, China and India entering the fray, and two of those states have Arctic borders and a historical legacy of conflict. Power imbalance in the Arctic is already apparent, with only Russia and the United States as great powers, while the other Arctic states are middle or minor powers with <span style="font-size: 11pt;">no hope of preventing</span> a great power from doing as it pleases. Lastly, //<span style="font-size: 11pt;">miscalculation</span>// is evident in the present context, as Sweden and Norway are both arming for possible Russian aggression, though Russia has shown little or no overtly aggressive tendencies towards Nordic nations. Unipolarity was not going to last forever, but as it fades <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the probability of northern conflict is ever increasing</span>. The shift to hard power strategies, the effects of cli- mate change, and the decline of the United States all speak to the fact that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">multipolarity can increase levels of tension and mistrust</span>, thus altering the currently stable nature of Arctic affairs. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Efforts at Arctic governance</span> through institutional binding or legal claims, as seen in the Arctic Council and UNCLOS, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">are able at present to mitigate</span> the ongoing and ever increasing security <span style="font-size: 11pt;">competition</span> in the high north, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">but as the system changes from unipolarity to multipolarity, constraining state behaviour becomes increasingly difficult</span>. As such, observers must be mindful of the systemic variables at play when explaining and forecasting Arctic politics, as <span style="font-size: 11pt;">changes to the structure are very likely to translate into changes to state security strategies</span>.

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">With the increased interest in Antarctica, human presence has increased</span> over the years as <span style="font-size: 11pt;">more nations have joined the Antarctic Treaty system, and</span> many more <span style="font-size: 11pt;">scientific stations have been established</span>. It is important to note, however, that the maximum number of U.S. personnel present in Antarctica actually peaked during Operation Deep Freeze at the height of the Cold War. Since that time, the increased level and complexity of human activities in Antarctica have been due to the ever-increasing presence of other nations’ personnel and the establishment of additional scientific bases in Antarctica. In addition, as technology and scientific advances shrink the globe, interest in the natural resources of Antarctica has increased. Although no mineral or resource exploitation (other than fisheries and tourism) has taken place in Antarctica, as perceived distances to market decrease and commodity prices increase, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the pressure to exploit this once-remote continent areexpected to increase. The United States has strong interest in preserving and protecting one of the most pristine environments on the globe, ensuring that the Antarctic continent is reserved exclusively for peaceful purposes, and pursuing unique opportunities to gain new scientific knowledge. In support of these interests, the United States does not claim territory in Antarctica</span> (although it does maintain the basis for a claim) and it does not recognize the (overlapping) territorial claims made by seven other countries (Figure 2.1). Although, the U.S. Antarctic Program remains by far the largest in the world,3 the operation of the treaty by unanimous consent and the one country-one vote approach has meant in recent years that <span style="font-size: 11pt;">U.S. influence has diminished and its leadership is challenged on a regular basis</span>. However, as the lead proponent of the original treaty, the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">United States</span> has established an influential <span style="font-size: 11pt;">presence</span> in Antarctica and as such <span style="font-size: 11pt;">has served a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Antarctic Treaty</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and fostering an </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">atmosphere of cooperation</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">partnership</span>//. The <span style="font-size: 11pt;">influential U.S. presence</span> in Antarctica <span style="font-size: 11pt;">is</span> principally <span style="font-size: 11pt;">a result of</span> the operations of the U.S. Antarctic Program and its three year-round <span style="font-size: 11pt;">research stations</span>: McMurdo Station, Palmer Station, and South Pole Station. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">This presence protects the U.S. stance on Antarctic sovereignty, secures the United States an influential role in the treaty’s decision-making system, and helps maintain the political and legal balance necessary for success of the treaty. Many view the permanent year-round presence of the United States as a </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">major deterrent</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> to those countries that might otherwise wish to exercise their territorial claims.</span> The South Pole Station is of particular importance to sovereignty issues because the South Pole is at the apex of the areas claimed by the seven countries that assert territorial claims. The <span style="font-size: 11pt;">year-round presence of U.S. scientists</span> at South Pole Station <span style="font-size: 11pt;">preserves U.S. interests and influence. The U.S. national presence in the Antarctic is possible</span> at present <span style="font-size: 11pt;">because of</span> the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">logistical support of</span> U.S. military forces that are charged to resupply the permanent science stations. Both Navy and U.S. Coast Guard <span style="font-size: 11pt;">icebreakers</span> supported Antarctic operations until the U.S. Coast Guard assumed all polar icebreaker responsibilities in 1965. The U.S. Navy continued to provide airlift support to Operation Deep Freeze (the long-lived science mission) until the mid-1990s, when this task was transferred to the Air National Guard. The principal role of the U.S. Coast Guard has been to provide logistics support to the U.S. Antarctic Program by breaking a channel into McMurdo Sound to allow resupply of McMurdo Station by tanker and cargo ships. Supplies from McMurdo are transferred to the South Pole Station by air, recently supplemented on a developmental basis by ground traverse. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Icebreakers are</span> a lifeline to and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">critical for</span> the maintenance of USAP <span style="font-size: 11pt;">operations at</span> the shore of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">McMurdo</span> Sound <span style="font-size: 11pt;">and at the South Pole</span>. Until recently, the two Polar class icebreakers (sometimes together and sometimes separately depending on ice conditions) were used to break open a channel for resupply.4 However, more challenging ice conditions and the deteriorating status of the Polar class ships now adds uncertainty and risk of failure to the operation. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is concerned that the lack of reliable icebreaking support may make it increasingly difficult to maintain the permanent stations and associated science programs. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Investigations of alternate logistics plans</span> by NSF (discussed in Chapter 8) <span style="font-size: 11pt;">have reaffirmed that icebreaker support isnecessary to the Antarctic resupply chain for now and in the foreseeable future.</span> According to a representative of the Department of State assigned to Antarctic issues, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">if resupply of South Pole Station is not successful</span> and the station were abandoned, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">this would jeopardize</span>, and probably reduce, <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the influence of the United States in Antarctic governance. There wouldbe significant consequences because abandonment of that key site would create a </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">vacuum in leadership</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">and</span> likely result in <span style="font-size: 11pt;">a </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">scramble for control</span>//. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Abandoning it would be detrimental to the U.S. position as well as to the stability of the treaty system. To preserve</span> the <span style="font-size: 11pt;">U.S. presence</span> in Antarctica <span style="font-size: 11pt;">and</span> hence its influential role in <span style="font-size: 11pt;">the AntarcticTreaty, it is paramount to maintain</span> the three <span style="font-size: 11pt;">permanent research stations</span> and their associated active research programs throughout the Antarctic continent. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Icebreaker operations are </span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;">critical</span>//<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> to the continued existence of these stations and their associated outlying field sites</span>.

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The word </span>“infrastructure” //originated// in military parlance, referring to fixed facilities such as air bases (OED). Today it has become a slippery term, often used to mean essentially any important, widely shared, human-constructed resource. The American Heritage Dictionary defines the term as (1) “an underlying base or foundation, especially for an organization or a system,” and (2) “the basic facilities, services, and installations needed for the functioning of a community or society, such as transportation and communications systems, water and power lines, and public institutions including schools, post offices, and prisons.” In 1996-97 the US Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP) chose the following as fundamental to its own definition: • transportation • oil and gas production and storage • water supply • emergency services • government services • banking and finance • electrical power • information and communications.

__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Despite the historical frequency of underbalancing, little has been written on the subject</span>__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. Indeed, Geoffrey Blainey's memorable observation that for "every thousand pages published on the causes of wars there is less than one page directly on the causes of peace" could have been made with equal veracity about overreactions to threats as opposed to underreactions to them.92 Library __shelves are filled with books on the causes and dangers of exaggerating threats__, ranging from studies of domestic politics to bureaucratic politics, to political psychology, to organization theory. __By comparison, there have been few studies at any level of analysis__ or from any theoretical perspective __that directly explain why states have with some__, if not equal, **__regularity underestimated dangers to their survival__**. __There may be__ __some cognitive or normative bias at work here.__ Consider, for instance, that __there is a__ commonly used __word, paranoia__, __for the unwarranted fear that people are,__ in some way, __"out to get you__" or are planning to do oneharm. I suspect that just as __many__ people __are afflicted with the opposite psychosis: the delusion that everyone loves you__ when, in fact, they do not even like you. __Yet, we do not have a familiar word for this phenomenon__. Indeed, I am unaware of any word that describes this pathology (hubris and overconfidence come close, but they plainly define something other than what I have described). That noted__, i__nternational __r__elations theory __does have a frequently used phrase for the pathology of states' underestimation of threats to their survival, the__ so-called __Munich analogy__. The term is used, however, in a disparaging way by theorists to ridicule those who employ it. The central claim is that the naïveté associated with Munich and the outbreak of World War II has become an overused and inappropriate analogy because few leaders are as evil and unappeasable as Adolf Hitler. Thus, the analogy either mistakenly causes leaders [End Page 198] to adopt hawkish and overly competitive policies or is deliberately used by leaders to justify such policies and mislead the public. __A more compelling explanation for the paucity of studies on underreactions to threats__, however, __is the tendency of theories to reflect contemporary issues as well as the desire of theorists and journals to provide society with policy- relevant theories that may help resolve or manage urgent security problems__. Thus, born in the atomic age with its new balance of terror and an ongoing Cold War, t__he field of security studies has naturally produced theories of and prescriptions for national security that have had little to say about__—__and are,__ in fact, __heavily biased against warnings of—the dangers of underreacting to or underestimating threats__. After all, the nuclear revolution was not about overkill but, as Thomas Schelling pointed out, speed of kill and mutual kill.93 __Given the apocalyptic consequences of miscalculation__, accidents, or inadvertent nuclear war, __small wonder that theorists were more concerned about overreacting to threats than underresponding to them__. At a time when all of humankind could be wiped out in less than twenty-five minutes, theorists may be excused for stressing the benefits of caution under conditions of uncertainty and erring on the side of inferring from ambiguous actions overly benign assessments of the opponent's intentions. The overwhelming fear was that a crisis "might unleash forces of an essentially military nature that overwhelm the political process and bring on a war thatnobody wants. Many important conclusions about the risk of nuclear war, and thus about the political meaning of nuclear forces, rest on this fundamental idea."94 Now that the Cold War is over, we can begin to redress these biases in the literature. In that spirit, I have offered a domestic politics model to explain why threatened states often fail to adjust in a prudent and coherent way to dangerous changes in their strategic environment. The model fits nicely with recent realist studies on imperial under- and overstretch. Specifically, it is consistent with Fareed Zakaria's analysis of U.S. foreign policy from 1865 to 1889, when, he claims, the United States had the national power and opportunity to expand but failed to do so because it lacked sufficient state power (i.e., the state was weak relative to society).95 Zakaria claims that the United States did [End Page 199] not take advantage of opportunities in its environment to expand because it lacked the institutional state strength to harness resources from society that were needed to do so. I am making a similar argument with respect to balancing rather than expansion: incoherent, fragmented states are unwilling and unable to balance against potentially dangerous threats because elites view the domestic risks as too high, and they are unable to mobilize the required resources from a divided society. The arguments presented here also suggest that __elite fragmentation and disagreement within a competitive political process__, which Jack Snyder cites as an explanation for overexpansionist policies, __are more likely to produce underbalancing__ than overbalancing behavior among threatened incoherent states.96 This is because __a balancing strategy carries certain political costs and risks with few, if any, compensating short-term political gains, and because the strategic environment is always somewhat uncertain.__ Consequently, logrolling among fragmented elites within threatened states is more likely to generate overly cautious responses to threats than overreactions to them. This dynamic captures the underreaction of democratic states to the rise of Nazi Germany during the interwar period.97 In addition to elite fragmentation, I have suggested some basic domestic-level variables that regularly intervene to thwart balance of power predictions.</span>

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Kratochwil 8</span> – professor of international relations – European University Institute
Friedrich, “The Puzzles of Politics,” pg. 200-213
The lesson seems clear. Even at the danger of “fuzzy boundaries”, when we deal with “practice” ( just as with the “pragmatic turn”), we would be well advised to rely on the use of the term rather than on its reference (pointing to some property of the object under study), in order to draw the bounds of sense and understand the meaning of the concept. My argument for the fruitful character of a pragmatic approach in IR, therefore, does not depend on a comprehensive mapping of the varieties of research in this area, nor on an arbitrary appropriation or exegesis of any specific and self-absorbed theoretical orientation. For this reason, in what follows, I will not provide a rigidly specified definition, nor will I refer exclusively to some prepackaged theoretical approach. Instead, I will sketch out the reasons for which a pragmatic orientation in social analysis seems to hold particular promise. These reasons pertain both to the more general area of knowledge appropriate for praxis and to the more specific types of investigation in the field. The follow- ing ten points are – without a claim to completeness – intended to engender some critical reflection on both areas. Firstly, a pragmatic approach does not begin with objects or “things” (ontology), or with reason and method (epistemology), but with “acting” (prattein), thereby preventing some false starts. Since, as historical beings placed in a specific situations, we do not have the luxury of deferring decisions until we have found the “truth”, we have to act and must do so always under time pressures and in the face of incomplete information. Pre- cisely because the social world is characterised by strategic interactions, what a situation “is”, is hardly ever clear ex ante, because it is being “produced” by the actors and their interactions, and the multiple possibilities are rife with incentives for (dis)information. This puts a premium on quick diagnostic and cognitive shortcuts informing actors about the relevant features of the situ- ation, and on leaving an alternative open (“plan B”) in case of unexpected difficulties. Instead of relying on certainty and universal validity gained through abstraction and controlled experiments, we know that completeness and attentiveness to detail, rather than to generality, matter. To that extent, likening practical choices to simple “discoveries” of an already independently existing “reality” which discloses itself to an “observer” – or relying on optimal strategies – is somewhat heroic. These points have been made vividly by “realists” such as Clausewitz in his controversy with von Bülow, in which he criticised the latter’s obsession with a strategic “science” (Paret et al. 1986). While Clausewitz has become an icon for realists, only a few of them (usually dubbed “old” realists) have taken seriously his warnings against the misplaced belief in the reliability and use- fulness of a “scientific” study of strategy. Instead, most of them, especially “neorealists” of various stripes, have embraced the “theory”-building based on the epistemological project as the via regia to the creation of knowledge. A pragmatist orientation would most certainly not endorse such a position. Secondly, since acting in the social world often involves acting “for” some- one, special responsibilities arise that aggravate both the incompleteness of knowledge as well as its generality problem. Since we owe special care to those entrusted to us, for example, as teachers, doctors or lawyers, we cannot just rely on what is generally true, but have to pay special attention to the particular case. Aside from avoiding the foreclosure of options, we cannot refuse to act on the basis of incomplete information or insufficient know- ledge, and the necessary diagnostic will involve typification and comparison, reasoning by analogy rather than generalization or deduction. Leaving out the particularities of a case, be it a legal or medical one, in a mistaken effort to become “scientific” would be a fatal flaw. Moreover, there still remains the crucial element of “timing” – of knowing when to act. Students of crises have always pointed out the importance of this factor but, in attempts at building a general “theory” of international politics analogously to the natural sci- ences, such elements are neglected on the basis of the “continuity of nature” and the “large number” assumptions. Besides, “timing” seems to be quite recalcitrant to analytical treatment.

**Even if there are problems with capitalism, a utilitarian framework prevents moral tunnel vision**

**Issac, 02—**Professor of Political Science at Indiana-Bloomington, Director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life, PhD from Yale (Jeffery C., Dissent Magazine, Vol. 49, Iss. 2, “Ends, Means, and Politics,” p. Proquest)
As a result, the most important political questions are simply not asked. __It is assumed that U.S. military intervention is an act of "aggression," but no consideration is given to the aggression to which intervention is a response__. __The status quo ante in Afghanistan is not, as peace activists would have it, peace, but rather terrorist violence abetted by a regime--the Taliban--that rose to power through brutality and repression__. This requires us to ask a question that most "peace" activists would prefer not to ask: __What should be done to respond to the violence of a Saddam Hussein, or a Milosevic, or a Taliban regime?__ What means are likely to stop violence and bring criminals to justice? __Calls for diplomacy and international law are well intended and important; they implicate a decent and civilized ethic of global order. But they are also vague and empty, because they are not accompanied by any account of how diplomacy or international law can work effectively to address the problem at hand__. The campus left offers no such account. __To do so would require it to contemplate tragic choices in which moral goodness is of limited utility.__ Here what matters is not purity of intention but the intelligent exercise of power. Power is not a dirty word or an unfortunate feature of the world. It is the core of politics. Power is the ability to effect outcomes in the world. __Politics, in large part, involves contests over the distribution and use of power. To accomplish anything in the political world, one must attend to the means that are necessary to bring it about__. And to develop such means is to develop, and to exercise, power. __To say this is not to say that power is beyond morality. It is to say that power is not reducible to morality__. As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, __an unyielding concern with moral goodness undercuts political responsibility____.__ The concern may be morally laudable, reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from three fatal flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one's intention does not ensure the achievement of what one intends. __Abjuring violence or refusing to make common cause with morally compromised parties may seem like the right thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience of their supporters;__ (2__)__ __it fails to see that in a world of real violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in injustice__. This is why, __from the standpoint of politics--as opposed to religion--pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and__ (3) __it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant____.__ Just as the alignment with "good" may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of "good" that generates evil. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one's goals be sincere or idealistic__;__ __it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways. Moral absolutism inhibits this judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness.__

Instead, the Left must think of ways to rearticulate capitalism without either giving up the critique or naively assuming that it can create capitalism with a human heart.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” Leaving such images to Hollywood, the Left can organize to change specific axiomatics of capitalism in particular local, regional, national and global contexts. For example, there is good evidence that the ways in which contemporary American corporations have chosen to deal with labor are not necessarily the most effective in terms of capital productivity itself. This does not entail simply championing unions as they have existed, but restructuring unions to meet the new demands of a changing labor force and to work within the new systems of global capitalism. we can recognize and argue that the rich are no longer primarily entrepreneurs being rewarded for taking risks, but managers (CEOs)and financial manipulator, even criminals of various sorts. The expansion of capital as a social utility has given way to its immediate private appropriation. this little reinvestment into capitalism's future. It therefore seems reasonable to limit the ability to privately appropriate wealth In this context we might argue a guaranteed minimum and maximum income, linking such arguments to notions to the value of human life. We might propose to limit investors’ abilities to reap short-term profits by a number of means, including linking executives’ salaries to capital gains and investments rather than profits.</span>

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Nuclear</span> prolif<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">eration</span> - be it among nations or terrorists - greatly increases the chance of nuclear violence on a scale that would be intolerable. Proliferation increases the chance that nuclear weapons will fall into <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the hands of </span>irrational people<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, either suicidal or with no concern for the fate of the world. Irrational or outright psychotic leaders of military factions or terrorist </span>groups might decide to use <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a few </span>nuclear weapons <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">under their control </span>to stimulate a global nuclear war, as an act of vengeance against humanity as a whole. Countless scenarios of this type can be constructed. Limited nuclear wars between countries with small numbers of nuclear weapons could escalate into major nuclear wars between superpowers.

===Chow K=== 
====1nc Chow==== 
The affirmative takes the position of the Maoist—their veneration of the oppressed constructs an ideal subaltern with whom they can engage in parasitic solidarity—this is virulent form of colonialism which turns the academy into a site for the consumption of Otherness for personal gain
Chow, Professor Comparative Lit at Brown, ’93 (Rey, “Writing Diaspora” p 10-13)
The Orientalist has a special sibling whom I will, in order to highlight her significance as a kind of representational agency, call the Maoist. Arif Dirlik, who has written extensively on the history of political movements in twentieth-century China, sums up the interpretation of Mao Zedong commonly found in Western Marxist analyses in terms of a "Third Worldist fantasy"‚—"a fantasy of Mao as a Chinese reincarnation of Marx who fulfilled the Marxist promise that had been betrayed in the West."16 The Maoist was the phoenix which arose from the ashes of the great disillusionment with Western culture in the 1960s and which found hope in the Chinese Communist Revolution." In the 1970s, when it became possible for Westerners to visit China as guided and pampered guests of the Beijing establishment, Maoists came back with reports of Chinese society's absolute, positive difference from Western society and of the Cultural Revolution as "the most important and innovative example of Mao's concern with the pursuit of egalitarian, populist, and communitarian ideals in the course of economic modernization" (Harding, p. 939). At that time, even poverty in China was regarded as "spiritually ennobling, since it meant that [the] Chinese were not possessed by the wasteful and acquisitive consumerism of the United States" (Harding, p. 941). Although the excessive admiration of the 1970s has since been replaced by an oftentimes equally excessive denigration of China, the Maoist is very much alive among us, and her significance goes far beyond the China and East Asian fields. Typically, the Maoist is a cultural critic who lives in a capitalist society but who is fed up with capitalism‚—a cultural critic, in other words, who wants a social order opposed to the one that is supporting her own undertaking. The Maoist is thus a supreme example of the way desire works: What she wants is always located in the other, resulting in an identification with and valorization of that which she is not/does not have. Since what is valorized is often the other's deprivation‚—"having" poverty or "having" nothing‚—the Maoist's strategy becomes in the main a rhetorical renunciation of the material power that enables her rhetoric. In terms of intellectual lineage, one of the Maoist's most impor- tant ancestors is Charlotte Brontes Jane Eyre. Like Jane, the Maoist's means to moral power is a specific representational posi tion‚—the position of powerlessness. In their reading of Jane Eyre,Nancy Armstrong and Leonard Tennenhouse argue that the novel exemplifies the paradigm of violence that expresses its dominance through a representation of the self as powerless: Until the very end of the novel, Jane is always excluded from every available form of social power. Her survival seems to depend on renouncing what power might come to her as teacher, mistress, cousin, heiress, or missionary's wife. She repeatedly flees from such forms of inclusion in the field of power, as if her status as an exem- plary subject, like her authority as narrator, depends entirely on her claim to a kind of truth which can only be made from a position of powerlessness. By creating such an unlovely heroine and subjecting her to one form of harassment after another, Bronte demonstrates the power of words alone. This reading of Jane Eyre highlights her not simply as the female underdog who is often identified by feminist and Marxist critics, but as the intellectual who acquires power through a moral rectitude that was to become the flip side of Western imperialism's ruthlessness. Lying at the core of Anglo-American liberalism, this moral rectitude would accompany many territorial and economic conquests overseas with a firm sense of social mission. When Jane Eyre went to the colonies in the nineteenth century, she turned into the Christian missionary. It is this understanding‚—that Bronte's depiction of a socially marginalized English woman is, in terms of ideological production, fully complicit with England's empire-building ambition rather than opposed to it‚—that prompted Gayatri Spivak to read Jane Eyre as a text in the service of imperialism. Referring to Bronte's treatment of the "madwoman" Bertha Mason, the white Jamaican Creole character, Spivak charges Jane Eyre for, precisely, its humanism, in which the "native subject" is not created as an animal but as "the object of what might be termed the terrorism of the categorical imperative." This kind of creation is imperialism's use/travesty of the Kantian metaphysical demand to "make the heathen into a human so that he can be treated as an end in himself. "19 In the twentieth century, as Europe's former colonies became independent, Jane Eyre became the Maoist. Michel de Certeau describes the affinity between her two major reincarnations, one religious and the other political, this way: The place that was formerly occupied by the Church or Churches vis-a-vis the established powers remains recognizable, over the past two centuries, in the functioning of the opposition known as leftist. . . .There is vis-a-vis the established order, a relationship between the Churches that defended an other world and the parties of the left which, since the nineteenth century, have promoted a different future. In both' cases, similar functional characteristics can be discerned. The Maoist retains many of Jane's awesome features, chief of which are a protestant passion to turn powerlessness into "truth" and an idealist intolerance of those who may think differently from her. Whereas the great Orientalist blames the living "third world" natives for the loss of the ancient non-Western civilization, his loved object, the Maoist applauds the same natives for personifying and fulfilling her ideals. For the Maoist in the 1970s, the mainland Chinese were, in spite of their "backwardness," a puritanical alternative to the West in human form‚—a dream come true. In the 1980s and 1990s, however, the Maoist is disillusioned to watch the China they sanctified crumble before their eyes. This is the period in which we hear disapproving criticisms of contemporary Chinese people for liking Western pop music and consumer culture, or for being overly interested in sex. In a way that makes her indistinguishable from what at first seems a political enemy, the Orientalist, the Maoist now mourns the loss of her loved object‚— Socialist China‚—by pointing angrily at living "third world" natives. For many who have built their careers on the vision of Socialist China, the grief is tremendous. In the "cultural studies" of the American academy in the 1990s, the Maoist is reproducing with prowess. We see this in the way terms such as "oppression," "victimization," and "subalternity" are now being used. Contrary to Orientalist disdain for contemporary native cultures of the non-West, the Maoist turns precisely the "disdained" other into the object of his/her study and, in some cases, identification. In a mixture of admiration and moralism, the Maoist sometimes turns all people from non-Western cultures into a generalized "subaltern" that is then used to flog an equally generalized "West."21 Because the representation of "the other" as such ignores (1) the class and intellectual hierarchies within these other cultures, which are usually as elaborate as those in the West, and (2) the discursive power relations structuring the Maoist's mode of inquiry and valorization, it produces a way of talking in which notions of lack, subalternity, victimization, and so forth are drawn upon indiscriminately, often with the intention of spotlighting the speaker's own sense of alterity and political righteousness. A comfortably wealthy white American intellectual I know claimed that he was a "third world intellectual," citing as one of his credentials his marriage to a Western European woman of part-Jewish heritage; a professor of English complained about being "victimized" by the structured time at an Ivy League institution, meaning that she needed to be on time for classes; a graduate student of upper-class background from one of the world's poorest countries told his American friends that he was of poor peasant stock in order to authenticate his identity as a radical "third world" representative; male and female academics across the U.S. frequently say they were "raped" when they report experiences of professional frustration and conflict. Whether sincere or delusional, such cases of self-dramatization all take the route of self-subalternization, which has increasingly become the assured means to authority and power. What these intellectuals are doing is robbing the terms of oppression of their critical and oppositional import, and thus depriving the oppressed of even the vocabulary of protest and rightful demand. The oppressed, whose voices we seldom hear, are robbed twice‚—the first time of their economic chances, the second time of their language, which is now no longer distinguishable from those of us who have had our consciousnesses "raised."

This utilization of the “other” as a site for knowledge-gathering is inseparable from the militaristic logic which views everything in terms of its usefulness to the US – the affirmative’s assistance can only show us a target to be destroyed by US bombs—nuclear genocide is inevitable in the world of the affirmative.
Chow, Professor Comparative Lit at Brown, ‘6 (Rey, “The Age of the World Target” p 40-42)
Often under the modest and apparently innocuous agendas of fact gathering and documentation, the "scientific" and "objective" production of knowledge during peacetime about the various special "areas" became the institutional practice that substantiated and elaborated the militaristic conception of the world as target.52 In other words, despite the claims about the apolitical and disinterested nature of the pursuits "I higher learning, activities undertaken under the rubric of area studies, such as language training, historiography, anthropology, economics, political science, and so forth, are fully inscribed in the politics and ideology of war. To that extent, the disciplining, research, and development of so-called academic information are part and parcel of a strategic logic. And yet, if the production of knowledge (with its vocabulary of aims and goals, research, data analysis, experimentation, and verification) in fact shares the same scientific and military premises as war‚—if, for instance, the ability to translate a difficult language can be regarded as equivalent to the ability to break military codes53‚—is it a surprise that it is doomed to fail in its avowed attempts to "know" the other cultures? Can "knowledge" that is derived from the same kinds of bases as war put an end to the violence of warfare, or is such knowledge not simply warfare's accomplice, destined to destroy rather than preserve the forms of lives at which it aims its focus? As long as knowledge is produced in this self-referential manner, as a circuit of targeting or getting the other that ultimately consolidates the omnipotence and omnipresence of the sovereign "self"/"eye"‚— the "I"‚—that is the United States, the other will have no choice but remain just that‚— a target whose existence justifies only one thing, its destruction by the bomber. As long as the focus of our study of Asia remains the United States, and as long as this focus is not accompanied by knowledge of what is happening elsewhere at other times as well as at the present, such study will ultimately confirm once again the self-referential function of virtual worlding that was unleashed by the dropping of the atomic bombs, with the United States always occupying the position of the bomber, and other cultures always viewed as the military and information target fields. In this manner, events whose historicity does not fall into the epistemically closed orbit of the atomic bomber‚—such as the Chinese reactions to the war from a primarily anti-Japanese point of view that I alluded to at the beginning of this chapter‚—will never receive the attention that is due to them. "Knowledge," however conscientiously gathered and however large in volume, will lead only to further silence and to the silencing of diverse experiences.54 This is one reason why, as Harootunian remarks, area studies has been, since its inception, haunted by "the absence of a definable object"‚—and by "the problem of the vanishing object."55 As Harootunian goes on to argue, for all its investment in the study of other languages and other cultures, area studies missed the opportunity, so aptly provided by Said's criticism of Oriental ism, to become the site where a genuinely alternative form of knowledge production might have been possible. Although, as Harootunian writes, "Said's book represented an important intellectual challenge to the mission of area studies which, if accepted would have reshaped area studies and freed it from its own reliance on the Cold War and the necessities of the national security state,"56 the challenge was too fundamentally disruptive to the administrative and instrumentalist agendas so firmly routinized in area studies to be accepted by its practitioners. As a result, Said's attempt to link an incipient neocolonial discourse to the history of area studies was almost immediately belittled, dismissed, and ignored, and his critique, for all its relevance to area studies' future orientation, simply "migrated to English studies to transform the study of literature into a full-scale preoccupation with identity and its construction."57

You should reject the affirmative because of their failure to question the indebtedness of their intellectual project to institutions mired in the very privilege they sanctimoniously criticize—your obligation as an intellectual is to struggle against becoming the object and instrument of power
Chow, Professor Comparative Lit at Brown, ’93 (Rey, “Writing Diaspora” p 16-17)
While the struggle for hegemony remains necessary for many reasons – especially in cases where underprivileged groups seek privilege – I remain skeptical of the validity of hegemony over time, especially if it is hegemony formed through intellectual power. The question for me is not how intellectuals can obtain hegemony (a question that positions them in an oppositional light against dominant power and neglects their share of that power through literacy, through the culture of words), but how they can resist, as Michel Foucault said, the forms of power that transform them into its objects and instrument in the sphere of knowledge, truth, consciousness and discourse. Putting it another way, how do intellectuals struggle against a hegemony which already includes them and which can no longer be divided into the state and civil society in Gramsci’s terms, nor be clearly demarcated into national and transnational space? Because borders have so clearly meandered into so many intellectual issues that the more stable and conventional relation between borders and the field no longer holds, intervention cannot simply be thought as the creation of new fields. Instead, it is necessary to think primarily in terms of borders – of borders, that is, as para-sites that never take over a field in its entirety but erode it slowly and tactically. The work of Michel de Certeau is a helpful for the formulation of this parasitical intervention. De Certeau distinguished between strategy and another practice – tactic – in the following terms. A strategy has the ability to transform the uncertainties of history into readable spaces. The type of knowledge derived from strategy is one sustain and determined by the power to provide oneself with one’s own place. Strategy therefore belongs to an economy of the proper place and to those who are committed to the building, growth,, and fortification of a field. A text, for instance, would become in this economy “a cultural weapon, a private hunting preserve,” or “a means of social stratification” in the order of the Great Wall of China (de Certeau, p. 171). A tactic, by contrast, is a “calculated action determined by the absence of a proper locus” (de Certeau, p. 37). Betting on time instead of space, a tactic “concerns an operational logic whose models may go as far back as the age-old rules of fishes and insects that disguise or transform themselves in order to survive, and which has in any case ben concealed by the form of rationality currently dominant in Western culture” (de Certeau. P. xi). Why are "tactics" useful at this moment? As discussions about "multiculturalism," "interdisciplinarity," "the third world intellectual," and other companion issues develop in the American academy and society today, and as rhetorical claims to political change and difference are being put forth, many deep-rooted, politically reactionary forces return to haunt us. Essentialist notions of culture and history; conservative notions of territorial and linguistic propriety, and the "otherness" ensuing from them; unattested claims of oppression and victimization that are used merely to guilt-trip and to control; sexist and racist reaffirmations of sexual and racial diversities that are made merely in the name of righteousness‚—all these forces create new "solidarities" whose ideological premises remain unquestioned. These new solidarities are often informed by a strategic attitude which repeats what they seek to overthrow. The weight of old ideologies being reinforced over and over again is immense. We need to remember as intellectuals that the battles we fight are battles of words. Those who argue the oppositional standpoint are not doing anything different from their enemies and are most certainly not directly changing the downtrodden lives of those who seek their survival in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan spaces alike. What academic intellectuals must confront is thus not their "victimization" by society at large (or their victimization-in-solidarity-with-the-oppressed), but the power, wealth, and privilege that ironically accumulate from their "oppositional" viewpoint, and the widening gap between the professed contents of their words and the upward mobility they gain from such words (When Foucault said intellectuals need to struggle against becoming the object and instrument of power, he spoke precisely to this kind of situation.) The predicament we face in the West, where intellectual freedom shares a history with economic enterprise, is that "if a professor wishes to denounce aspects of big business, ... he will be wise to locate in a school whose trustees are big businessmen."2* Why should we believe in those who continue to speak a language of alterity-as-lack while their salaries and honoraria keep rising? How do we resist the turning-into-propriety of oppositional discourses, when the intention of such discourses has been that of displacing and disowning the proper? How do we prevent what begin as tactics‚—that which is "without any base where it could stockpile its winnings" (de Certeau, p. 37)‚—from turning into a solidly fenced-off field, in the military no less than in the academic sense?

The aff has taken on the role of the traveler, discussing and proposing notions of travel and mobility through the eyes of those who travel – this distorts understandings of mobility by ignoring marginalized perspectives
Frello, Professor Culture and Identity at Roskilde University, ‘8 (Birgitta, January, “Towards a Discursive Analytics of Movement: On the Making and Unmaking of Movement as an Object of Knowledge” Mobilities, Vol 3 Issue 1, p 25-50, T&F Online)
In the introduction to this paper, I quoted Avtar Brah for stating that what matters is not just who travels, but also the circumstances under which the travelling takes place. It should be emphasized that the question of ‘circumstances’ is a discursive as well as a material one. What matters is not just ‘who can travel where, when and how?’ but also ‘who gets to tell the story?’ Clifford illustrates the significance of who is doing the accounting of the travel as travel by pointing to the difference between interpretations of the activities of Victorian bourgeois travellers on the one hand and the activities of their accompanying – often non<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span>white – servants on the other. The servants never acquired the status of ‘travellers’ because, ‘in the dominant discourses of travel, a non<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span>white person cannot figure as a heroic explorer, aesthetic interpreter, or scientific authority’ (Clifford, 1997, p. 33).4 Here, an important criterion for being a ‘true traveller’ is closely related to (racially defined) criteria for who can be perceived as an interpreting subject.5¶ The conventions determining who can meaningfully be described as a ‘traveller’, and thus as an active subject and interpreter of the world, have of course changed since Victorian travellers set out with their staff of servants. The inclination to set up hierarchies between more or less ‘authentic’ travellers has not changed, however. Hierarchical distinctions between movements are not only encountered when travellers of various kinds attempt to distinguish themselves in relation to mass tourism (cf. Urry, 1990; Kaplan, 1996) or even avoid the ‘tourist’ label altogether, as when organizers as well as participants in heritage tours prefer to interpret their travel in terms of a ‘pilgrimage’.6 We also meet it in Ulf Hannerz' distinction between the cosmopolitan attitude on the one hand and what he calls ‘home<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span>plus’ on the other (Hannerz, 1992, 1996; see also D'Andrea, 2006). We find here a hierarchy between various groups of travellers depending on their inclination towards cosmopolitanism. Being a ‘true’ cosmopolitan hinges on one's ability as a traveller to distance oneself from one's cultural background and engage in other cultures. And this in turn depends on the movement being voluntary. Therefore, according to Hannerz, real cosmopolitans are likely to be diplomats and intellectuals, rather than work migrants and refugees, who, like tourists, are characterized by attempting to build ‘surrogate homes’ in order not to become involved with other cultural experiences and surroundings.¶ Assessing the ‘authenticity’ of movement is linked here to the assessment of the relationship between self and other. This, however, raises the question of what the criteria for designating the (distance between) self and other are, and who determines these criteria. When is the other an ‘other’, and which activities and attitudes involve a transgression of the distance between self and other? Hannerz argues that migration and exile do not constitute good bases for transgressing the local. Conversely, other scholars emphasize the importance of what Clifford (1997, p. 36) has called ‘discrepant cosmopolitanisms’, describing migration and exile as central modern experiences that provide the very possibility to transgress locally bounded perspectives (Bhabha, 1994; Hall & Sakai, 1998; Said, 2001). What is at issue in such contrasting accounts is the question of agency, which in this context is tantamount to a question of who are trustworthy subjects for the transgression of the particular, locally bound perspective and hence trustworthy interpreters of the encounter with the other. Hence, although the Victorian period is over, social parameters such as race, class and gender are still decisive in assessing whose practices of ‘getting between locations’ can become visible even in the basic sense of being recognized as ‘movement’ at all. What ‘counts’ as movement is contextual and depends on perspective: one's position as a ‘true traveller’ is an asset in a world in which the mastering of movement is an unequally distributed and highly valued resource.


Their discourse about the racial Other perpetuates domination – exploring difference and alterity through the mask of dominant-based racial politics simply demonstrates a desire to escape their burden of privilege by silencing racialized Others**
Guenther, Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt, ’12 (Lisa, “The Ethics and Politics of Otherness: Negotiating Alterity and Racial Difference” philoSOPHIA, Vol 1 Issue 2, ProjectMuse)
In her essay "Choosing the Margin," bell hooks draws attention to the way uncritical celebrations of difference and otherness often act as an alibi for progressive politics. hooks writes:
I am waiting for them to stop talking about the "Other," to stop even describing how important it is to be able to speak about difference. It is not just important what we speak about, but how and why we speak. Often this speech about the "other" is also a mask, an oppressive talk hiding gaps, absences, that space where our words would be if we were speaking, if there were silence, if we were there. This "we" is that "us" in the margins, that "we" who inhabit marginal space that is not a site of domination but a place of resistance. Enter that space. (hooks 1990, 151)¶ The recent proliferation of discourses on alterity, particularly with the growth of Levinas studies, makes hooks's critique all the more relevant for ethical and political theory today. To what extent has this emphasis on alterity affected the dynamics of philosophical and political life? Does it fall into the trap that hooks identifies here as a mask with which privileged subjects present themselves as critical thinkers, while failing to listen to the diverse voices of concrete others gathered under the rubric of "the Other"? It is one thing to affirm one's infinite responsibility for the Other, and quite another thing to make good on that responsibility in specific contexts, especially in a political landscape where [End Page 195] some faces are more visible than others, and some voices more likely to be heard. Unless we can flesh out Levinas's ethical project with a political project of resisting oppression, his ethics risks a level of abstraction that covers over its own blind spots. And unless we can distinguish rigorously between otherness as a sign of political exclusion and otherness as a source of ethical command, we risk repeating the conflation of certain others with a position of weakness and victimhood, where "we" can feel responsible for "them" without having to listen to anyone but ourselves.¶ Hooks's critique of the empty invocation of difference and otherness is crucial; and yet, emancipatory politics cannot do without some working concept of difference and otherness. Indeed, I think we need two distinct concepts: a difference that refers to the multiplicity of relational, historically specific modes of differentiation, and an alterity that refers to the singular, nonrelational otherness of one who remains irreducible to anything or anyone else. In what follows, I develop these two concepts in response to hooks's critique, as a way of heeding her imperative to "enter that space" of critical marginality which fosters resistance and the growth of political solidarity. I begin with hooks's analysis of the use and abuse of concepts such as difference and otherness, teasing out a sense of difference as social positionality. Then, through a reading of Levinas, I develop an account of alterity as ethical singularity and the provocation of critical questioning. Throughout my analysis, I draw on the work of other ethical and political theorists to help distinguish between helpful and pernicious concepts of difference and otherness. My ultimate aim is to develop a workable theoretical language for something that already exists in practice in coalition-based political movements, but risks being undermined by the clunky language of identity politics: namely, a politics of difference rooted in an ethics of alterity.¶ Locating Difference When does discourse about the Other function as a mask for uninterrogated privilege and colonial domination? For hooks, this happens when words hides gaps and absences where other voices would be, if they were not excluded from the conversation in advance. The worst part about this silencing is that it is done in the name of those whose otherness it celebrates. hooks explains:¶ Often this speech about the "Other" annihilates, erases: "No need to hear your voice when I can talk about you better than you can speak about yourself. No need to hear your voice. Only tell me about your pain. I want to know your story. And then I will tell it back to you in a new way. Tell it back to you in such a way that it has become mine, my own. Re-writing you, I write myself [End Page 196] anew. I am still the author, authority. I am still the colonizer, the speaking subject, and you are now at the center of my talk." Stop. (hooks 1990, 151-52)¶ To the extent that otherness is identified with being a victim, however much this victimization is lamented, it continues to silence "others" and to perpetuate their domination. The other is approached not as an interlocutor, but as an oppositional support for one's own identity. Theorists as different as Hegel, Sartre, Butler, Kristeva, and William Connolly have described processes by which one's own sense of identity is formed in the tension between a desire for the other (for recognition, for love, for connection) and a rejection, abjection, or battle to the death with the other, in which the other emerges as everything that I am not. As Connolly (2002) puts it: "Identity requires difference in order to be, and it converts difference into otherness in order to secure its own self-certainty" (64). I know that I am good, smart, safe, or powerful by reassuring myself that the other is bad, stupid, dangerous, or endangered. This is what makes the suffering of the other such attractive material for my own self-narration; the worse things are for her, the more thankful I feel for my own lot in life.¶ But racism does not always operate through exclusion and hostility; even the desire for proximity to otherness can become a vehicle for oppression when racial difference is depoliticized and celebrated as a source of exotic delight. In her essay, "Eating the Other," hooks explores the power dynamics of a desire for racial difference as a supplement for white identity. She relates a conversation overheard on the Yale campus in which several young white men list off the "kinds" of women they want to have sex with—Asian, black, and so forth—as if they were on a treasure hunt. For them, nonwhite women seem to evoke an aura of mystery and excitement promising an escape from the dullness of social privilege and the repressive limitations that come along with it. Rather than excluding racial difference in a hostile way, these men seek to include it in their own identity by extracting the quality of otherness from race, simultaneously depoliticizing and eroticizing it, in order to construct the fantasy of a lover who spices up their lives without making any demands on them. Hooks comments: "Displacing the notion of Otherness from race, ethnicity, skin-color, the body emerges as a site of contestation where sexuality is the metaphoric Other that threatens to take over, consume, transform via the experience of pleasure" (hooks 1992, 22). This desire to "get a bit of the Other" for oneself does not encounter the other person as an interlocutor or even as a sexual partner, but only as a function of one's own desire to escape the burden of privilege without giving up its power. This move includes the Other as excluded, thus reducing racial difference to just another commodity offered up for the delight of the white palate, and releasing whites from the shame of racism without forcing us to confront its deeper structures. [End Page 197]¶ In this approach to otherness, specific racial differences are decontextualized and rendered politically moot at the very moment that they are emphasized as aesthetically or erotically salient. While these differences are not exactly erased (since their visibility is the mark of their attraction), those who display racial difference are silenced and negated as others. To anticipate the language I will develop in the next section, it's not just the specificity of their differences that is betrayed, or their agency to narrate the meaning of those differences, but also their alterity as others to whom one must respond in their singularity, and not just as tokens of a type. Hooks is equally critical of two common responses to this betrayal of black alterity: the effacement of racial difference in the name of color-blind equality, and the appropriation of racial difference as the foundation of an exclusively Afrocentric identity politics. While the first approach tries to make the problem of racism disappear by erasing racial differences, the second approach risks imposing new constraints on black subjectivity, new ways of shaming those who are not "black enough," or not black in the right ways (hooks 1990, 28-31). In her essay "Postmodern Blackness," hooks argues that one cannot separate the postmodern politics of difference from the politics of racism without silencing black voices and suppressing the emergence of new forms of black subjectivity (26).1 But a radical postmodernism that interrogates differences in race, class, sexuality, and other aspects of identity, promises to "serve as a base for solidarity and coalition" across the lines by which these markers of identity are so often drawn (27). It's by crossing these lines attentively, without pretending they don't exist, that we build communities of resistance rather than battlegrounds for the fight over identity-territory.


Decentering the affirmative’s logic of self-referentiality allows us to turn our attention to structures of intelligibility by refusing a reality that has given authority over meaning and knowledge production
Chow, Professor Comparative Lit at Brown, ‘6 (Rey, “The Age of the World Target” p 20-23)
In this spirit we can begin to imagine a project called "European Theory In America" that would make full historical acknowledgment as well as creative use of the complexity‚—for those of us working in America‚—of the self-referential phrase "in America." This complexity has to do with a persistent paradox, comprising both the recognition of the imperialist status of the United States in postwar world politics (of which the institution of area studies remains a dominant manifestation) and the continual dismissal, if not erasure, of the United States as an agent of intellectual change whenever it is pitted against "elite" phantom indexes such as "French theory" and "comparative literature." Between these two polarized and, hitherto, mutually unengaged positions of America, innumerable possibilities of rethinking await notice. Foucauldian Inspirations By the problematic of self-referentiality, then, I do not intend a discussion of the popular thematic of the self, nor do I mean to offer a moralization of what we call selfishness. In the terms provided by poststructuralist theory, in which language and signification have become, in modernity, irrevocably self-referential, self-referentiality would seem at once an inevitability and a predicament in the historical trajectory of Western thought. An inevitability, insofar as certain modalities of language and signification must resist the onslaught and complete cooptation by modern instrumentalism and bureaucratization; a predicament, because such resistance seems rather ineffectual in the face of tendencies toward blatant self-aggrandizement and promotions of self-interest‚—such as when cultures encounter one another, as they do as a routine, on fundamentally inequitable premises. Given this conundrum, what are the elements of poststructuralist theory that continue to be useful and useable? Can we hold onto the possibility of a self-consciousness that does not, simply because it must be critical of oppressive forces, repeatedly, fold in upon itself, becoming self-referential—and self incarcerating—in the form of that non-communicative language that Foucault (mis)recognizes as "literature as such"? These questions are taken up in the chapter "The Interruption of Referentiality," in which I briefly revisit key moments of the emergence of poststructuralism as an intellectual event‚—how it enabled (without completing) an analysis of petty bourgeois mass culture, how it transformed and complicated the way we approach a perennial problem such as literariness, and how it laid down productive, yet also self-contradictory, directions for scholars interested in minority culture and identity issues. In particular, I consider the implications of poststructuralist theory's most influential and controversial contribution, its gesture of bracketing what is called referentiality. My thinking in this book is, quite obviously, indebted to the work of Foucault, though readers will see that I use that work somewhat eccentrically, dwelling on aspects that have not always been considered to be Foucault's key contributions. As I have indicated elsewhere, Foucault's work, even though it undoubtedly shares many of the poststructuralist perspectives on language and subjectivity that specialize in a particular kind of negativity‚—namely, the suspension and/or undoing of the ground of signification‚—nonetheless also provides examples of analysis and argumentation that amount to a detour and a deviation from‚—and a purposeful evasion of‚—such negativity." Such informed negotiations with negativity are, for me, the strongest forms of inspiration offered by this work. On the question of self-referentiality, for instance, it is noteworthy that a thinker whose early work partakes of the structuralist fascination with language, systems of representation, and archaeologies of knowledge, and whose best-known books focus attention on the relentless subjection of modern individuals by institutions of surveillance, punishment, and incarceration, returned in his last works to what seems to be a deceptively simple notion of the self. The direction in which Foucault seemed to be moving in his last two books‚—The Use of Pleasure and The Care of the Self‚—is highly suggestive in this regard.34 In his detailed references to the prescriptive lexis on (ideal) sexual conduct for free men in Greek and Graeco-Roman antiquity, Foucault was obviously drawn to an ethics of self-orientation that, considered from the perspective of the late twentieth century (the time of his writing), marked a decisive break from the modern (and modernist) modes of self-referentiality that he has dissected so well in all his works. Be it in the form of the deconstruction of ground or of the recurrent recoiling of the self toward itself, such modes of self-referentiality tend to invest in a compulsive ontological move to interiorize (in the form of language or of subjectivity) as the only barrier against external aggression. (In other words, incomprehensible self-deconstructing writing and neurosis/psychosis have become the only weapons‚—aesthetic as much as libidinal‚—against oppression.) By contrast, the qualities of self-restraint‚—and with them the goals of self-governance and self-mastery‚—that Foucault delineates in the ancients stem from a refusal of this ideologically loaded gesture of interiorization as the only feasible intellectual solution. It is beyond both my expertise and the purpose of this introduction to debate the scholarly merits of Foucault's last works. But what I trace in them is a thought-provoking supplement to his ongoing approaches to the problematic of self-referentiality‚—the collective frenzy of our age‚—and the possibility of a critical self-consciousness that can be imagined in ways other than the delirium of self-abnegation or self-aggrandizement.35 In the final chapter, turning once again to Foucault's The Order of Things, I raise the question of comparison. Can the problematic of self- referentiality‚—be it in the form of linguistic resistance, poststructuralist reference bracketing, or strategic area knowledge production‚—be raised to a different conceptual plane by a turn to comparative work? Interestingly, much like area studies (itself arguably "a kind of weak comparativism"),36 comparative literature as a field of learning arose in an era in which the world was at war‚—when European states were, as usual, engaged in various struggles with one another during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. With its goal of bringing together different national traditions of fiction through the democratic notion of a world literature, comparitivism was advanced as a possible peaceful remedy to intercultural conflict. Once again, post-Second World War North America plays a crucial role as mediator and transition point: the discipline of comparative literature as we know it today is very much a legacy of the work of European literary scholars, many of whom were exiled from their homelands because of racial and political persecution, who found institulional support for their Utopian vision of literature in the United States. How is the problematic of self-referentiality configured in a field that emphasizes linguistic pluralism as its very disciplinary (and epistemic) ground? Beyond the con tinental European focus of its original context, what are the possibilities of reading‚—if any‚—held open by comparative literary and cultural studies today? Taking my hint from Deleuze's imaginative reading of Foucault, I offer responses to these questions in the following pages as part of an effort‚—replete with risks, to be sure, but hopefully also with potentialities‚— to "restore words and things to their constitutive exteriority."
