4.5  LEVINAS’ PHILOSOPHY OF THE ENCOUNTER¶ ‘The other is not
AND
to a response that does not condemn the other through assumptions of recognition.

Our ethic is a “first philosophy” that __precedes__ and __refutes__ rule systems like utilitarianism, which reduce the Other to a calculable entity – ethics should come from experience, not knowledge
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Introna, professor of ethics, 3</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – Professor of Organization, Technology, and Ethics at Lancaster University (Lucas, 2003, “Workplace Surveillance ‘is’ Unethical and Unfair,” //Surveillance & Society//, Volume 1, Number 2, pp. 210-216, [[http://library.queensu.ca/ojs/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/download/3354/3317]])</span>

For Levinas the ‘force’, or rather the gravity, of ethics lies in
AND
). The force of the Other is fragile, not secure at all.

Ethical framing conditions all political practice – this recognition solves conflict
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Dauphinee, professor of politics, 9</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at York University (Elizabeth, “Emmanuel Levinas,” from //Critical Theorists and International Relations//, edited by Jenny Edkins (Professor of International Politics at Aberystwyth University) and Nick Vaughan-Williams (Lecturer in International Relations at the University of Exeter), pp. 241-242)</span>

Writing about the war in Bosnia, David Campbell argues that Levinasian thought is ‘
AND
, at reconciliation and refugee return (Campbell 1998a: 219–40).

===1AC Totality=== 
Contention two is totality

The opposite of __infinity__ is __totality__, the attempt to break down and understand everything – this leads to impersonal control and tyranny
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Wild, professor of philosophy, 80</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – Professor of Philosophy at Yale University (John, Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, professor and chair of philosophy at Northwestern University, 2/29/80, Introduction to //Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority//, book written by Emmanuel Levinas, Springer, pp. 15-19, [[http://m.friendfeed-media.com/48926eed43741a4e07a8241b7ee87bd55b666514]])</span>

Hegel and his followers have also seen the accidental biases and eccentricities that make the
AND
as right, and history itself is not the final judge of history.

This logic of control and refusal of our finitude causes the destruction of the Earth through endless consumption and machination
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Joronen, Ph.D. in geography, 11</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – Ph.D. in Human Geography from the University of Turku (Mikko, Postdoctoral Researcher and head of the Development Studies programme in the Department of Geography and Geology at the University of Turku, //Antipode//, Vol. 43, No. 4, “Dwelling in the Sites of Finitude: Resisting the Violence of the Metaphysical Globe,” Pg. 1127-1154)</span>

In spite of the revolutionary sense of “power-free letting-be”,
AND
and domination of nature, capable of calling the living earth a home.

The root causes of war are power, heroism, threat construction, and fear – this taints their security logic – our ethic focuses these issues on the other and solves conflict
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Molloy, Ph.D. in sociology, 99</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology and Equity Studies in Education at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto (Patricia, teaches in the Department of Communication Studies at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, 1999, “Desiring security/securing desire: (Re)re‐thinking alterity in security discourse,” //Cultural Values//, Volume 3, Number 3, pp. 304-328, p. Taylor and Francis)</span>

The Will to Kill: War as Desire¶ Desire, as Shapiro points out
AND
. For in the infinite waters of responsibility, there are no pirates.

Universal catastrophe will end space-time altogether – this rupture in time means that extinction has already happened
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Brassier, professor of philosophy, 7</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – Associate Professor of Philosophy at the American University of Beirut (Ray, Research Fellow at the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy, 2007, //Nihil Unbound: Enlightenment and Extinction//, pp. 223-230, [[http://rosswolfe.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/ray-brassier-nihil-unbound-enlightenment-and-extinction.pdf]]) [note: “[existence]” is added]</span>

7.3 Solar catastrophe: Lyotard¶ This latter question lies at the heart
AND
an ‘anterior posteriority’ which usurps the ‘future anteriority’ of human existence.

===1AC Uncertainty=== 
Contention three is uncertainty

Linear policy predictions are impossible
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Sa, professor of policy, 4</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">– Associate Professor of Public Administration and Policy at Dong-U College in South Korea (Deug-Whan, received his DPA from the Korea University, 2004, “Chaos, Uncertainty, and Policy Choice: Utilizing the Adaptive Model,” //International Review of Public Administration//, Volume 8, Number 2, pp. 119-128, [[http://www.kapa21.or.kr/data/data_download.php?did=1473]])</span>

In many cases, a small choice might lead to overwhelming results that generate either
AND
model provides decision-makers enough confidence to naturally accept uncertainty and chaos.

This is an independent reason to vote aff – we must embrace transformation through chaos
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Ankor 9</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – Ph.D. thesis for the Graduate School of the University of Technology in Sydney (Jo, BA in Cultural Tourism, December 2009, //Pleasure and Dread: The Paradox of Travel//, pp. 139-141, [[http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/2100/1178/02Whole.pdf?sequence=2]])</span>

When events without assignable causes happen that disrupt the order of established situations and when
AND
Levinas’ encounter is synonymous with Badiou’s point of rupture with respect to being.

Death is an Other like any other Other – we should encounter it ethically to transcend it
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Hofmeyr, professor of philosophy, 7</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – Associate Professor and Senior Lecturer in the Department of Philosophy in the School of Basic Social Sciences at the University of Pretoria in South Africa (Benda, Ph.D. on the work of Foucault and Levinas from Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, Research Fellow and Guest Lecturer in the Department of Philosophical Anthropology in the Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Science of Radboud University Nijmegen, 2007, “Dying the Human Condition Re-reading Ivan Ilyich with Levinas,” The International Journal of the Humanities, Volume 5, Issue 2, pp. 129-136, [[http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:ZJwem4DpYQgJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5]])</span>

Suffering and death announce the absolute strangeness of a future ever future. Death is
AND
the relation with the Other (TA, 81-812/180).

Great-power war is implausible
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Deudney and Ikenberry, professors of politics, 9</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – *Professor of Political Science at Johns Hopkins University AND **Albert G.

ProQuest)</span>

Fortunately, this new conventional wisdom about autocratic revival is as much an exaggeration of

Nuclear war doesn’t cause extinction
<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Robock, professor of climatology, 10</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> – Professor II (Distinguished Professor) of climatology in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University (Alan, Director of the Rutgers Undergraduate Meteorology Program, Ph.D. in Meteorology from MIT, former State Climatologist of Maryland, Past-President of the Atmospheric Sciences Section of the American Geophysical Union, Retiring Chair of the Atmospheric and Hydrospheric Sciences Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, member of the Board of Trustees of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, “Nuclear Winter,” WIREs Climate Change, May/June, Wiley Online Library via University of Michigan Libraries)</span>

While it is important to point out the consequences of nuclear winter, it is
AND
consequences of nuclear winter are extreme enough without these additional effects, however.

to a response that does not condemn the other through assumptions of recognition.

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Our ethic is a “first philosophy” that precedes and refutes rule systems like utilitarianism, which reduce the Other to a calculable entity – ethics should come from experience, not knowledge</span>

For Levinas the ‘force’, or rather the gravity, of ethics lies in
AND
). The force of the Other is fragile, not secure at all.

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">Our framework interpretation is that we will defend the implementation of the plan in the context of the adoption of our ethic – ethical framing conditions all political practice – this recognition solves conflict</span>

Writing about the war in Bosnia, David Campbell argues that Levinasian thought is ‘

, at reconciliation and refugee return (Campbell 1998a: 219–40).
===Totality=== 

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">The opposite of infinity is totality, the attempt to break down and understand everything – this leads to impersonal control and tyranny</span>

Hegel and his followers have also seen the accidental biases and eccentricities that make the
AND
as right, and history itself is not the final judge of history.

<span style="font-size: 17.3333px;">This logic of control and refusal of our finitude causes the destruction of the Earth through endless consumption and machination</span>

===AT: K Affs=== 
====AT: Narratives==== 
**Narratives perpetuate hegemonic structures – the use of these unquestionable stories allows existing violent ideologies to hijack them to exacerbate problems – the 1AC is epistemologically suspect and retracts from the political sphere**
**__Ewick and Silbey__**, 19**__95__** [Patriciaand Susan S. //Law & Society Review//, 00239216, Vol. 29, Issue 2]

In the previous section, we discussed how narratives, like the lives and experiences

==Disadvantages== 
===Fiscal Cliff=== 
Fiscal cliff deal’s coming now—bipartisan optimism after yesterday’s talks prove
AP 11/16—David Espo, AP Special Correspondent [Associated Press, 11/16/2012, “Hill leaders voice new confidence in deficit deal,” [[http://seattletimes.com/html/politics/2019695661_apusfiscalcliff.html]]]

One way President Obama could help reduce the deficit is to trim funds planned for

Cuts to nuclear weapons as a result of deficit reduction also pose potential international problems

Perceptions of a compromised U.S. nuclear deterrent as described above would have

scale far more catastrophic than what nuclear-armed terrorists alone could inflict.


==Kritiks==

It is here of course that language plays an important role in imagining the other
AND
a state of mind and, most importantly, a way of thinking.

===Capitalism=== 
====vs. Race==== 

The aff is just a shift from the coercive strategy of capitalist exclusion to the incorporative strategy for furthering capital production by subsidizing elements of basic consumption and creating new avenues of exploitation. “Integration” is the ruse of choice for elites to ensure that the underprivileged think that they have dignity and rights, when really they are only being abused for their labor

Despite these evasions, active policies to manage the poor and poverty have been implemented
AND

Federal infrastructure projects are a tool to integrate the nation and the world into the capitalist order of the US – This create an imperial ideology that justifies ruthless expansion AND causes environmental collapse

By using the lens of political economy to focus on the New Deal's public works

his subordination to rationalized work and more work, accumulation and more accumulation.

Vote neg – the purpose of the debate should be envisioning a different relationship toward the knowledge capital produces – only by situating ourselves as intellectuals outside of state politics can solvency start – reformism is the link means the perm gets co-opted too
Meszaros, professor of philosophy 8 (Istvan, Chair of Philosophy at the University of Sussex, The Challenge and Burden of Historical Time, p323-328)

The unreality of postulation the sustainable solution of the grave problems of our social order
AND
synonymous with the withering away of the state as an ongoing historical enterprise.

===N-Word=== 
Rejecting the use of the N-word by anyone is key to reverse psychological damage done by racist cultural practices- its use must be banned and sanctioned

Fairchild, (former) Association of Black Psychologists president, 9-16- 1987 [Halford, "N Word Should Be Odious From Anyone," LA Times, [[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-16/local/me-5239_1]]]

N Word Should Be Odious From Anyone Two recent events, one in a

===Framework=== 

A – Interpretation:

Topical affirmatives must affirm the resolution through instrumental defense of action by the United States Federal Government.
B – Definitions

Should denotes an expectation of enacting a plan

United States (Government), the combination of federal, state, and local laws, bodies, and agencies that is responsible for carrying out the operations of the United States. The federal government of the United States is centered in Washington, D.C.
Resolved implies a policy

Louisiana House 3-8-2005, [[http://house.louisiana.gov/house-glossary.htm]]

Resolution A legislative instrument that generally is used for making declarations, stating policies, and making decisions where some other form is not required. A bill includes the constitutionally required enacting clause; a resolution uses the term "resolved". Not subject to a time limit for introduction nor to governor's veto. ( Const. Art. III, §17(B) and House Rules 8.11 , 13.1 , 6.8 , and 7.4)

C – Vote neg – We have four net benefits

First is Decisionmaking

The primary purpose of debate should be to improve our skills as decision-makers. As individual policy-makers our daily choices affect people around us—we have an obligation to those people to utilize debate to hone critical thinking and information processing abilities

Austin J. Freeley and David L. Steinberg – John Carroll University / U Miami – 2009, Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making, p. 1-4, googlebooks
After several days of intense debate, first the United States House of Representatives and

AND

customer for out product, or a vote for our favored political candidate.

Second is Predictable Limits - The resolution proposes the question the negative is prepared to answer and creates a bounded list of potential affs for us to think about. Debate has unique potential to change attitudes and grow critical thinking skills because it forces pre-round internal deliberation on a of a focused, common ground of debate

Robert E. Goodin and Simon J. Niemeyer- Australian National University- 2003,

When Does Deliberation Begin? Internal Reflection versus Public Discussion in Deliberative Democracy, POLITICAL STUDIES: 2003 VOL 51, 627–649, [[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0032-3217.2003.00450.x/pdf]]

What happened in this particular case, as in any particular case, was in

AND

least one possible way of doing that for each of those key features.
Third is Dogmatism – Most problems are not black and white but have complex, uncertain interactions. By declaring that _ is always bad, they prevent us from understanding the nuances of an incredibly important and complex issue. This is the epitome of dogmatism

Keller, et. al,– Asst. professor School of Social Service Administration U. of Chicago - 2001

(Thomas E., James K., and Tracly K., Asst. professor School of Social Service Administration U. of Chicago, professor of Social Work, and doctoral student School of Social Work, “Student debates in policy courses: promoting policy practice skills and knowledge through active learning,” Journal of Social Work Education, Spr/Summer 2001, EBSCOhost)

John Dewey, the philosopher and educational reformer, suggested that the initial advance in

AND

systems, the learning process will be facilitated" (p. 28).

The authors believe that involving students in substantive debates challenges them to learn and grow

AND

yield a reevaluation and reconstruction of knowledge and beliefs pertaining to the issue.
Our method solves – Even if the resolution is wrong, having a devil’s advocate in deliberation is vitally important to critical thinking skills and avoiding groupthink

Mercier and Landemore, professors of political science, 11

Hugo Mercier and Hélène Landemore- 2011

(Philosophy, Politics and Economics prof @ U of Penn, Poli Sci prof @ Yale), Reasoning is for arguing: Understanding the successes and failures of deliberation, Political Psychology, [[http://sites.google.com/site/hugomercier/publications]]
Reasoning can function outside of its normal conditions when it is used purely internally.

AND

a situational approach to improving reasoning We have argued that reasoning should not be

evaluated primarily, if at all, as a device that helps us generate

suggestions have been made in the past (e.g., Bohman,

2007; Sunstein, 2003, 2006), the present theory provides additional arguments

AND

(e.g. Schweiger, Sandberg, & Ragan, 1986).

Fourth is Policy Education

A focus on policy is necessary to learn the pragmatic details of powerful institutions – acting without this knowledge is doomed to fail in the face of policy professionals who make the decisions that actually affect outcomes

McClean, Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at Molloy College in New York, 2001

(David E., “The Cultural Left and the Limits of Social Hope”, Conference of the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy, [[http://www.americanphilosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2001/]])
Or we might take Foucault who, at best, has provided us with what

Interpretation – “Transportation infrastructure” is strictly defined as facilities of transport --- this excludes security, law enforcement, and military support

Musick, Congressional Budget Office, 10 (Nathan, Microeconomic and Financial Studies Division – United States Congressional Budget Office, Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure, p. 2)
Although different definitions of "infrastructure" exist, this report focuses on two types AND

those conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers following Hurricane Katrina in 2005).

Independently, they don’t meet investment – have to enhance the private sector

GAO 93 [Christine E. Bonham, Assistant Director of the Accounting and Information Management Division of the GAO, Robert M. Sexton, Evaluator-in-Charge of the same division, Hannah R.

The current budget structure does not highlight for decision making purposes the differences between spending

In this pre-rational order, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">one finds oneself always already in the presence of others who call forth an ethical response. There is no need to construct a widened community of justice in the manner of Feinberg</span>, for example, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">because the community in which one finds oneself already is that community.¶ The Feinberg technique of arriving at wider ethical communities has been described by David Cooper in terms of an 'expanding circle'. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The expanding circle</span> school <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">argue</span></span>, as we saw in the last chapter, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;">that</span> 'whatever the crucial determinant of moral concern-- happiness, rights, sentiment--the argument is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that it is irrational to restrict</span> such <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">concerns to human</span> beings, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">since the </span></span>//<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">differences</span>//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> between ourselves and some other species which would alone justify such a restriction simply </span>//<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">do not exist'</span>// ( Cooper 1995: 139). Cooper criticizes this approach on a number of grounds ( Cooper 1995: 140-1), the most important of which for us reads as follows:¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;">the [expanding</span> circle] <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">'model' implies</span> that moral <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">progress</span> always <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">occurs through recognizing that some</span> previously excluded <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">group... is similar</span></span>, in all relevant respects, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to a group already included in the circle of moral concern. But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">this</span> is to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ignore</span> the possibility... <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that a species ought to engage our concern because</span> of the respects in which <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it </span></span>//<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">significantly differs</span>//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;"> from ourselves.</span></span> ( Cooper 1995: 141)¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This last sentence</span>--'this is to ignore the possibility... that a species ought to engage our concern because of the respects in which it significantly differs from ourselves'--<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">provides the background to an alternative to the expanding circle technique</span>, and it may be that this alternative is the one most suited to the intentions of the 'natural value' conception of environmental sustainability. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is likely to be hard to argue of a great number of the carriers of 'natural value' which lie at the heart of this conception that they are 'similar, in all relevant respects' to human beings</span> (for example). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">if</span>, on the other hand, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they 'engage our concern' because they differ</span> from us, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">then </span></span>//<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">the range of concern is widened at a stroke</span>//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;">.</span></span>¶ It has to be admitted that the intellectual resources at the disposal of the expanding circle school are considerably greater than those at the disposal of the 'difference' school. As Wissenburg has rightly remarked, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">'The reason why we love others, according to Kant and the whole of Western philosophy since the Stoics and long before, is that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">we </span></span>//<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">recognise ourselves</span>//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;"> in the other</span>, or to be more specific, we recognise our essence as rational, morally free, and responsible beings with plans, aims and ends'</span> ( Wissenburg 1993: 13). But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is a subordinate tradition of ethical concern, represented by Emmanuel Levinas</span>, and to which we have already referred, which Wissenburg also mentions ( Wissenburg 1993: 16)--although he chooses not to follow the trail, believing that the demands of a Levinasian approach to ethics are altogether too demanding-- even self-contradictory: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">'Is it really possible to conceive of nature in terms or concepts which we, and only we understand, without epistemologically and </span>//<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">ethically colonizing it</span>//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">?</span>' ( Wissenburg 1993: 16).¶ Despite these reservations, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;">it is</span></span> nevertheless <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: lime;">surprising that Levinasian ethics have not received</span> more <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">attention from the environmental community</span>, and particularly from those members of it looking for a way to express their intuition that the natural world</span> (or carriers of 'natural value' in our present terms) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">demands ethical attention because of, not despite, its manifest, differences from ourselves.</span> What follows should not at all be taken as a wholehearted endorsement of a Levinasian approach to environmental ethics (nor, more broadly, of a 'postmodem' approach). 'I simply want to signal the potential available here. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Levinas's view is that difference invites 'nonindifference'</span>:¶ We must note that for Plato <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a relation may be possible between the one and the other, though they</span> are 'dead to the world', and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">lack</span>, as a result, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a shared other; that a relation might be possible without a common ground, that is to say, a relationship in difference; that the difference signifies a nonindifference</span>; that this nonindifference might</span>
