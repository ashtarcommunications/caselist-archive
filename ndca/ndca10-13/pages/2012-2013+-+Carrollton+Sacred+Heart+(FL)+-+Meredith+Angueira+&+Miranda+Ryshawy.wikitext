The world will not collapse into trade wars if the WTO is dismantled. Quite

AND

what the WTO is meant to do but fails so miserably to achieve.

====Lack of US trade leadership collapsing the WTO, causes shift to RTAs==== 

<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">Huang</span>, Professor Law Wuhan University, <span style="font-size: 17.33px;">’11</span> (Zhixiong- Fulbright Visiting Scholar at Harvard Law School, “Rise and Fall of Trade Multilateralism: A Proposal for “WTO à la Carte” as an Alternative Approach for Trade Negotiations” Front Law China, Vol 6 No 1, p 35-43, SpringerLink)

It has to be admitted that the crisis that the WTO currently faces is of

AND

accounts for the relative “rise and fall” between regionalism and multilateralism.

====WTO collapse key to Asian regionalism==== 

<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">Desker</span>, Director Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University, ‘<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">4</span> (Barry, March, “In defence of FTAs: from purity to

pragmatism in East Asia” The Pacific Review, Vol 17 No 1, p 3-26, T&F Online)

Those who argue that sharp differences exist among regions on developing institutional approaches to cooperation

AND

resulting in more East Asian WTO members turning to bilateral and regional FTAs.

====Solves successful TPP conclusion – this year is key==== 

<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">Plummer</span>, Professor International Economics Johns Hopkins University, <span style="font-size: 17.33px;">’12</span> (Michael, October, “The Emerging “Post-Doha” Agenda and the New Regionalism in the Asia-Pacific” ADBI Working Papers, http://www.adbi.org/files/2012.10.02.wp384.post.doha.new.regionalism.asia.pacific.pdf)

Hence, the Crisis itself set the stage for serious and durable East Asian regionalism

AND

is a good deal of membership overlap between the EAFTA and TPP economies.

====TPP key to prevent Chinese aggression over the Senkakus==== 

<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">Kasai</span>, Chairman of Central Japan Railway Co, <span style="font-size: 17.33px;">’10</span> (Yoshiyuki, November 9, “Japan shouldn't hesitate to join TPP” Yomiuri Shimbun, http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/columns/commentary/T101108001345.htm)

However, at around the same time, the world had become concerned by the

AND

neighbors disillusioned with Japan, for they are frightened of Beijing's increasing influence.

====War over the Senkakus causes global conflict escalation and draws in other powers====

ONE thing leads to another. Tensions between neighbours flare up at the slightest provocation

AND

showing its muscle to Japan the way America showed its muscle to Iraq.

====Derailing multilateral trade key to solve warming==== 

<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">Bello</span>, Executive Director Focus on the Global South, <span style="font-size: 17.33px;">‘9</span> (Walden, October, “The deadly triad: Climate change, free trade, and capitalism” Critical Currents, No 6)

The way out of the global recession, it is alleged by figures ranging from

negative ecological consequences of a successful deal, it is a necessary condition.

The best estimates for global warming to the end of the century range from 2

AND

adaptation to these extremes would mean profound social, cultural and political changes.



====Multilateral trade weakens ties between proximate countries – causes conflicts to escalate==== 

<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">Thoma</span>- Economics Prof, U of Oregon- ‘<span style="font-size: 17.33px;">7</span> Mark, Trade Liberalization and War, July, http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/trade-liberaliz.html

Globalisation is by construction an increase in both bilateral and multilateral trade flows. What

AND

economic ties, may therefore be a necessary political counterbalance to economic globalisation.



====US trade leadership is key to multilateral trade in a way that trades off with RTAs====
