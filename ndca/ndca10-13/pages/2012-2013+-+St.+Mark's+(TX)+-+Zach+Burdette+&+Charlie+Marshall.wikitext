<span style="font-size: 6pt;">As Obama and Congress talk jobs, ….</span>__.__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> An initial government investment of $10 billion could leverage up to $600 billion in private funds.But regulatory impediments must also be removed. They take an estimated $250 billion in global capital out of play. If that private capital were invested in infrastructure projects, it could create 1.9 million jobs over 10 years and spur untold economic growth. As for public investments, sooner or later we'll have to face the fact that the federal fuel tax has not been raised 1 cent in 17 years. The country needs modest, phased-in increase. Comprehensively restoring America's infrastructure and revitalizing the economy are monumental tasks. Fortunately, we are the same nation that built our world-class system in the first place.

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">America needs to invest in infrastructure. Despite signs of improvement, our economy is still in crisis. We could create millions of jobs by rebuilding our transport and water systems – ending the congestion that stifles our ports, airports, railroads and highways; increasing productivity; and empowering the US to compete with countries that are investing in infrastructure on a massive scale. Infrastructure financing tools are available, providing Washington wants to use them. They could bolster investment by leveraging hundreds of billions of dollars in private and international capital. The potential tools include a national infrastructure bank and other relatively minor legislative changes to encourage private investors off the sidelines. American mutual funds, pension funds and retail investors allocate relatively small portions of their $37,000bn in capital to new infrastructure initiatives. Creating a national infrastructure bank is not a new idea but it finally may be gaining traction. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro has introduced a House bill to create one, and Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Kerry co-sponsored similar legislation in the Senate. President Obama also supports a such a project. So do the AFL-CIO labour group and the US Chamber of Commerce, organisations that differ sharply on many issues but unite in calling for the US to rebuild. A national infrastructure bank could be independent and transparent. Government-owned but not government-run, it would have a bipartisan board and a staff of experts and engineers to plan projects based on quality and public need, not on politics. The bank would leverage public-private partnerships to maximise private funding and launch projects of regional and national significance with budgets of $100m or more. The infrastructure bank also should have authority to finance projects by issuing bonds with maturities of up to 50 years. These long-duration bonds would align the financing of infrastructure investments with the benefits they create, and their repayment would allow the bank to be self-financing.</span>
