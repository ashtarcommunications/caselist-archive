Framework every round? We all know what research is. Please utilize it and stop attempting to silence useful discussions. Framework or no framework, i am gonna run what i want. Deal with it. I have full text up here. You can honestly do better. Challenge what i say, stop saying i can't say it. What we say is not just gibberish that we try to win rounds with. We believe what we say. You may believe policy discussions are good, that's fine, but don't silence me in the process. Please be more creative. Need help with that? HMU

=Affirmative= 
==Pure Ideology== 
HELLO, MY NAME IS ANDY JOHNSON, THE ORIGINAL GANGSTER. AND I AM COMING STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPTON.
YA KNOW, SOMETIMES I GET DEPRESSED AND FEEL SAD THAT A NUCLEAR WAR WILL STRIKE AMERIKKKA BECAUSE I DIDN’T CHANGE MY CATS LITTERBOX.
DO YOU EVER GET DEPRESSED AND FEEL SAD THAT A NUCLEAR WAR WILL STRIKE AMERIKKA BECAUSE YOU DIDN’T CHANGE YOUR CATS LITTERBOX? DO YOU GET ANXIETY OVER WRINKLED SOCKS? ARE YOU AFRAID OF LIMA BEANS?
WELL I KNOW THAT FEEL, BRO.
I KNOW A LOT OF FEELS. I ALSO GET ANXIETY BECAUSE OF FOLDS IN MY CARGO PANTS AFTER LAUNDRY. I ALSO USED TO HAVE THE HARDEST TIME COOKING FOR MYSELF. I USED TO HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS, BUT I LEARNED TO HELP MYSELF.
WE HAVE A CURE FOR THAT FEEL. WITH ONE BALLOT IN FAVOR OF US, AND TWO EASY PAYMENTS OF 30 SPEAKER POINTS, YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO WORRY. I WILL __PERSONALLY__ COME TO YOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE FOR A YEAR AND CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND MAKE YOU AN INDEPENDENT HOMOSAPIEN.
OR HETEROSAPIEN IF YOU PREFER *WINK*
IT IS OK TO FEEL SAD ABOUT THESE KINDS OF THINGS. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, I, ANDY JOHNSON, CAN HELP WITH ALL OF YOUR PROBLEMS.
ON TOP OF DIVERTING THE APOCOLYPSE, I AM ALSO QUALIFIED TO COOK MEALS, FOLD LAUNDRY, KILL PEOPLE, WASH YOUR BATHROOM, TEACH YOGA, AND MANY MORE THINGS THAT ARE HELPFUL TO EVERYDAY LIFE.
I HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS, AND I AM SURE YOU DO TOO. WELL NO WORRIES. I CAN HELP. I WILL HELP.
ONCE AGAIN FOR ONLY ONE BALLOT IN FAVOR OF US, AND 60 EASY SPEAKER POINTS, I WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER.
STOP FEARING NUCLEAR WAR OVER YOUR DAMN CAT. MAKE YOUR OWN MEALS. WEAR WRINKLED CLOTHES! LIBERATE YOURSELF! BE FREE! ALLOW YOUSELF TO NOT BE AFRAID OF THE BATHROOM SINK. LEARN TO DO IT AND OVERCOME YOUR FEARS.
THROUGH MY STRICT REGIMEN, I WILL MAKE YOU THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON THE PLANET.
NO LONGER BE THE PARTY POOPER WHO HAS NO FUN. STOP BEING THAT ONE PERSON THATJUST SUCKS. INSTEAD, LIVE IT UP. BE THE ONE PERSON THAT HAS MORE SWAG THAN LIL B. BE HAPPY. CALL ON ME FOR HELP, AND YOU WILL PROSPER.
THERE ARE MULTIPLE SUBPOINTS TO MY REGIMEN THAT MAKES ME SUCCESSFUL.
THE FIRST PART IS CONFRONTING THE WORLD
I USED TO BE SOCIALLY AWKWARD. I KNOW IT IS CRAZY, ME AND SOCIALLY AWKWARD BEING USED IN THE SAME SENTENCE. BUT I LEARNED HOW TO CONFRONT THE WORLD AND FACE MY FEARS. I LEARNED TO JUST GO OUTSIDE AND WALK OUT THE DOOR PROUD OF MYSELF. NO MORE INFOMERCIAL WOMEN TELLING ME SIZE MATTERS, NO MORE TEACHERS TELLING ME THAT I AM TOO WHITE. NO MORE STAIRCASES TRIP ME. NO MORE TACOS GIVING ME THE RUNS. NO MORE JUDGES DROPPING ME BECAUSE I AM A TRUE ORIGINAL GANGSTER. NONE OF THAT. I DO WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT TO, AND I GET WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT TO. YOU AND I WILL MAKE YOU CONFRONT THE WORLD. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. LET YOUR CATS LITTERBOX STINK AND DO NOT FEAR NUCLEAR WAR. THIS IS ONLY STEP ONE, BUT WE MUST CRAWL BEFORE WE WALK, AND WE MUST WALK BEFORE WE RUN.
THE SECOND PART OF MY REGIMEN IS TO HAVE DAT SWAGGER
I USED TO NOT BE BLE TO HAVE ANY STYLE. I COULDN’T TALK TO ATTRACTIVE HOMOSAPIENS, HETEROSAPIENS, CATS, OR ANYBODY FOR THAT MATTER. IT WAS A SAD LIFE. I WISH I HAD MORE CONFIDENCE. BUT THEN I ALLOWED MYSELF TO OPEN UP. I DISCOVERED MY INNER SWAGGER. I WAS ABLE TO FINALLY COPE WITH MYSELF AND FEEL COMFORTABLE. I BECAME SO CONFIDENT THAT I AM NOW THE ORIGINAL GANGSTER. I CAN MAKE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE TOO. THERE IS NO REASON THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO THRIVE WITH YOUR OWN BRAND OF SWAGGER. I WILL BE ABLE TO COACH __YOU__ TO BE THE PERFECT __YOU__. TOGETHER, YOU AND I CAN MAKE YOU THRIVE. PUT YOUR LIFE INTO CRUISE CONTROL DRIVE, AND LET ANDY JOHNSON TAKE THE WHEEL AND MAKE YOUR SWAGGER SURVIVE. A CRUCIAL PART OF HAVING SWAGGER IS BUYING A PAIR OF AIR JORDAN TENNIS SHOES. I DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY CALL THEN TENNIS SHOES, WHEN PEOPLE PLAY BASKETBALL IN THEM, BUT THEY DO. THESE SHOES ARE KEY TO HAVING THE MOST SWAGGER YOU CAN OBTAIN.
THE THIRD PART OF MY REGIMEN IS DON’T SAVE FOR A RAINY DAY
SAVING IS FOR CHUMPS. OG’S STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON DON’T SAVE ANYTHING. YOU NEED TO BE FREE, DO WHAT YOU WANT. GET OUT OF YOUR MOTHERS BASEMENT FOR AN HOUR OR TWO. NO MORE DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, PLAY WORLD OF WARCRAFT INSTEAD. TRUE GANGSTERS DO THAT. WHEN IT IS RAINING, GO JUMP IN THE PUDDLES. DON’T SAVE FOR A RAINY DAY WHERE YOU MAKE PUZZLES WITH YOUR GRANDMA. INSTEAD, BUILD PUZZLES IN THE RAIN WITH HER. GRANDMA IS THE BEST. DEM COOKIES. YUM. ANYWAY, DON’T SAVE. SPEND. LIKE MACKLEMORE SAYS “I AM GOING TO POP SOME TAGS” BUT INSTEAD OF HIM, HAVE MORE THAN 20 DOLLARS IN YOUR POCKET. HAVE 21. BE A GANGSTER. SPOIL YOURSELF, NOT YOUR PANTS. BE ABLE TO LIVE FREELY. BE YOUR OWN PERSON.
THE FOURTH PART OF MY REGIMEN IS STOP SNIFFING GLUE
I KNOW THAT SNIFFING GLUE IS NOW WIDELY ACCEPTED, BUT IT IS NOT GOOD. IT STOPS YOUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO, TO BE ABLE TO THRIVE. DO YOU, BUT DO NOT SNIFF GLUE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO OTHER THINGS LIKE METH, COCAINE, SKITTLES, AND MILK. BUT GLUE IS TOO FAR. IT MAKES YOU SOCIALLY AWKWARD. WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TAKE ALL THE GLUE OUT OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD. IT WILL HINDER YOUR ABILITY TO HAVE POSITIVE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. METH, COCAINE, SKITTLES AND MILK HOWEVER, WILL LEAD TO THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE. YOU WILL MAKE TONS OF FRIENDS. YOU WILL FEEL GREAT. NO REPRECUSSIONS WHATSOEVER. BUT GLUE, OH MAN IS THAT STUFF BAD. IT LEADS TO JAIL TIME, AND EVEN APPLE SAUCING. SO INTENSE. IT IS ALSO A GATEWAY DRUG THAT WILL LEAD TO THINGS LIKE MARIJUANA, WHICH IS THE WORST THING THAT THERE EVER WAS, OBVIOUSLY. BUT THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING. I DON’T KNOW WHY I SAID JTHAT THOUGH, SO OBVIOUS.
THE FIFTH PART OF MY REGIMEN IS BEING HALEY LARSEN
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. BUT MANY THINGS COME ALONG WITH THIS. YOU HAVE TO BE CRAZY, STALK PEOPLE, BE HAWT-HAWT-HAWT, DEFEND THE EMPIRE, AND HATE PANTS. THESE ARE ALL SELF EXPLANOTORY. IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS, YOU CANNOT BECOME HALEY LARSEN, WHO IS OBVIOUSLY THE LEAST AWKWARD PERSON EVER.
IF YOU WANT TO THRIVE IN THIS SOCIETY. YOU NEED TO ADOPT THIS REGIMEN. ONCE AGAIN FOR ONLY ONE BALLOT IN FAVOR OF US AND TWO EASY PAYMENTS OF 30 SPEAKER POINTS I WILL COME TO YOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND HELP YOU BECOME THE IDEAL HUMAN BEING.
IT IS ENDEMIC TO BECOMING IDEAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THESE FIVE GUIDELINES. IT WORKED FOR ME, AND IT WILL WORK FOR YOU TOO. IT WILL HELP YOU TONS. IT WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER, AND MY LIFE BETTER
I WANT TO HELP YOU. HELP ME HELP YOU. I HAVE MULTIPLE WAYS THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL AMAZING AND LOSE THAT AWKWARD PERSONALITY. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER. MAKE THIS DYNAMIC SHIFT IN YOUR LIFE, IT WILL BE THE BEST SHIFT YOU EXPERIENCED.
BUT FOR INTENSENESS (AND LEGAL REASONS) YOU MUST BE 18 YEARS OR OLDER TO ORDER

==Choiceful== 
Once upon a time you were driving through a snowstorm to come here on this day. As you were driving, you were slipping and sliding to make your way to a debate tournament. You wanted to come and make some cash so that you could pay rent. Although you hate children, you came anyway. But there was a dilemma. As you were halfway to hoflo, you got stuck in a snowbank. You are already upset that you are stuck, but you really want to make the cash. You have two choices.

Turn to page 13 if you call triple a and go home,
You decided to go home. You make no cash this weekend and instead you go and blow your money at the bar, because you have nothing to do. You don’t pay rent, because you were too hungover to remember. The landlord decides to break in the house because you don’t answer the door. While aggressively asking for his rent money, he shoves you into your bookshelf, which falls on you and kills you.
FORTUNATELY IT WAS ALL A DREAM. YOU ACTUALLY CHOSE TO TURN TO PAGE 15

Turn to page 15 if you call triple a and get shoveled out
You made the correct choice. You call triple a and get shoveled out and continue on your trip to hoflo. You end up making it there, but not very happily. After all, you did just shovel your car out of a snowbank. But you know what is worse? The judges lounge sucks. They only had a $50 new York strip with lobster tail. You cannot believe how cheap they are. Dirty liberals. Now you are extra mad. You have to deal with cheap food and ungrateful children. Your life sucks. And it sucks to suck. You have about had it. The nerve that so many tournaments have is unbearable. You are done with your hissy fit now though. Your undies are no longer in a bundle. You have been calmed. Round one pairings come out. Its is like 6 o’ clock and you are ready to sleep. But you here anyway. Lets get the show on the road. Two things might happen

Turn to page 27 if the aff reads an aff about High Speed Rail

The affirmative reads about trains and shit. This is boring. You drop them on topicality. You argue with them for 30 minutes after the round. Damn kids. Always ungrateful. Wish they could be creative but that might be to much to ask. You decide to be done. You curse at the kids. And get kicked out of the tournament.
FORTUNATELY IT WAS ALL A HALLUCINATION BROUGHT ON BY EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL INTAKE. YOU ACTUALLY CHOSE TO TURN TO PAGE 23

Turn to page 23 if the aff reads and affirmative about debate
Creativity. Didn’t know that these kids knew what it was. You are happy to be listening to this. Made your day a little better. You can even enjoy my steak now. They criticize debate. Thank god, cuz you don’t like debate either. Or capitalism, but that is another discussion. This debate is nice. You like the way they are approaching it. Black kids and poetry. Always a good time. No but seriously this aff is cool. But then the neg got up. What did they read? Oh, baudrillard. JK Framework and capitalism. The aff answered these impeccably. It was nice. But the neg just pissed you off. Can believe you had to sit through this negative strategy. You dropped the neg. Not drop kicked, they just didn’t get my ballot. You wanted to drop kick them, but you didn’t. You are better than that. You were happy to vote affirmative. You thought they disrupted structure. But dat neg. They spent like an hour arguing about the decision. Like Chief keef says “that’s that shit I don’t like”.Honestly you heard that 1nc and felt like throwing up. Damn ungrateful kids. ONLY ONE MORE ROUND FOR THE DAY. you give yourself two options after this mediocre round.

Turn to page 32 if you go to the judges lounge
You decided to go to the judge lounge, I see. But it didn’t go so great. You ate some deep dish pizza and ended up getting food poisoning. You are now in the hospital getting your stomach pumped. Hashtag swag.

FORTUNATELY IT WAS ALL A DREAM. TURN TO PAGE 39

Turn to page 39 if you go straight to the tab room and pick up your ballot
You decide to just go get your ballot. You are in a better mood now. You like getting paid to watch kids argue. Works out in the best, you guess. This debate you am watching turns into a heg debate. Yeah, ‘Murica!. It was an ok debate. Boring. No jokes. You think a good pun the neg should’ve made was “don’t be a hedgehog, share the heg”. The debate was overall bland, kinda like that steak. I wish we could’ve brought like, some fun into this round. Cuz It sure wasn’t fun. I mean, it was a good heg debate. Just wish it was more interesting. Dats life you guess. You voted aff because the neg dropped that ‘Murica solves errythang. You proceeded to go home. You could now sleep, but you still had kids to judge tomorrow. Awwwwyeahhhh.

DAY TWO is now here. You make your way to the tournament. Except today, in round 3 you have to judge novices. Lawlwut. You take a moment to mentally prepare yourself for the shitstorm of horror that you’re about to experience.

Turn to page 8564 if you run away as fast as you can
You run out the door and slip on a patch of ice, snapping your spine. You are paralyzed for life. Eventually, you are asked to be the lead actor in a movie. You play Superman. During the fliming, a horse trips and falls on you, killing you.
THE END, RETURN TO PREVIOUS PAGE

Turn to page 666 if you listen to a equitable mass transit affirmative

The 1AC opens strong, with a generic affirmative about creating a more equitable distribution of mass transit infrastructure. You start getting worried in the CX of the 1AC, when the neg poses hypotheticals like “If I was a racist…” The 1NC is a States CP and a gentrification DA. The CP lacks a net benefit and the negative has no idea what gentrification is, besides the idea that it has something to do with white people and real estate. The affirmative bungles the CP, but is able to extend a perm, which allows you to avoid voting on that. Unfortunately, that means that you had to look at the gentrification flow. You vote neg because the aff dropped most of the DA. You feel dirty and violated for having been forced to listen to all the implicitly racist arguments throughout the round. You wish that you had turned to the other page. Oh well, back to the judge lounge.

Turn to page 667 to go to the bathroom

Since we all know debate is one of the worlds most unsanitary practices, the bathroom was horrible. You get there and the fumes literally choke you. You cannot breath for shit. Literally.

LUCKILY, THIS NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPENED, TURN TO PAGE 78

Turn to page 78 to pick up your ballot

You discover that your next round is in the varsity division. THANK CAGE. You don’t have to live through that hell again. In this round you do not know what is going to happen in this round. You are watching a team who has read both policy and performance affs in the past. It ends up being a good round you think. It is an aff about accepting Nicolas Cage as God in order to solve terrorism within the debate community versus the jenifer lopez counterplan. The perm solved, obvs. You were pleased about the debate. The 1AC was HILARIOUS. WHY DON’T MORE PEOPLE DO THIS?!?!!?!?1 You vote aff because Nic Cage is obvi God, and therefore the negative were indeed terrorists. You glare at the negative as you leave the room. Cage damn terrorists.



Turn to page 795 to listen to the policy 1AC
The two awesome-looking dudes on the aff presented a thrilling affirmative about dirigible infrastructure. It was an amazing affirmative- you loved it so much. As you listened to the 1AC you are relieved to hear that it is not yet another ports security aff, or worse the dreaded Nicholas Cage affirmative. It was fascinating to hear about the difference between different types of airships that the USFG could invest in. It warmed your heart to hear such an original case, rather than the same old transportation affs. Your boredom dropped away a little, as you pondered what these two amazing gentlemen could produce if they had read the kritikal 1AC instead. It would have been the greatest thing of all time. You stop them and tell them that you’ve changed your decision, turn to page 432

Turn to page 432 to listen to the kritikal 1AC
The two awesome-looking dudes on the aff presented a thrilling affirmative about life and philosophy. It was an amazing affirmative—you loved it so much. As you hear the 1ac you are relieved it is not either a ports affirmative OR a nic cage affirmative. It was a fascinating affirmative, and it warmed your heart to see real imagination and culture creation, rather than the same hegemony and economy arguments from every round. Your boredom dropped away as you listened to this amazing speech about transportation infrastructure. It was the most fascinating aff you had heard in your entire career. The audience engagement aspect really made for a more interesting affirmative, one you could really pay attention to.
And then the 1ac stood open for cross-x

==Boneriffic== 
Contention 1 Is the Cat Of Creation
In the Before-Time, there was only the Vast Empty. No space nor time did continue, all
the dimensions were held in their nonexistence. The Great Nicolas Cage thus was sprung into
existence through His very will, and saw all nothing, and was displeased.
And so His mighty mind devised a Sacred Erection, and it was the very first of Things.
He declared it good. Its quantum flesh was mighty and true, but it stood alone. The Cage
performed a Divine Pelvic Thrust, and the universe was created at great speed, expanding. Its
contents were of heated radiation, unshaped stardust flying at immense velocity.
Nicolas Cage blinked, and eons passed. The Holy Stardust collected through His gravitational will, forming great space seas of dust and light. He breathed, and Galactic Oceans condensed, forming a multitude of suns and stones. And with one stroke of His Mighty Boner, the Universe slowed down and cooled.
As a Galactic Ocean floated by, Nicolas Cage reached out His hand and grasped it. He
looked at it with His glorious eyes and instantaneously began to stretch it and bend it. He found amusement in the handling of these Sacred Galactic Seas. And so, Cage reached out His mighty hand and took another Ocean into the sacred warmth of His mighty palms.
As Nicolas Cage looked at the two great Galactic Oceans that he held in His palms, He
felt a great surge of power pulsing throughout His body. And so, the great Nicolas Cage threw
the two Oceans into each other, causing a mighty Galactic Explosion. As the Holy Explosion
simmered down, Cage felt an immense new power that had suddenly arisen. He had
inadvertently created holy particles even smaller than the most subatomic of subatomic
particles. The Far-Sighted Cage took the tiny, vulnerable Higgs-Boson and hid it for its own
safety. The other particles spread far and wide, creating more and more of the ever-expanding
Universe.
But the Great and Powerful Lord Nicolas Cage grew rather tired of His empty existence,
merely playing with dull stones and rocks. He wished for one like Him, with a creative impulse
and a spark of life. So He took a tiny star, with its slowly cooling stones, and He found it to be
satisfactory. So He gathered his great Grace and gazed upon the third planet from the star.
Everywhere His vision touched, the stone was cooled and water flowed freely forth.
But the Cage, from His universal standpoint, could barely see the planet. So He shrunk
himself down and walked personally upon its surface. With each and every step, the once
cracked and hardened ground blossomed into a wonderful green garden with lush foliage,
flowers and fruit as far as His eyes could see, and much more as each second passed. For so
great was His holy Touch, that life sprung forth from His Soleful Body.
And although the foliage provided a beautiful habitat, Nicolas Cage found it useless
without any intelligent life to call it home. And so, He created a mighty and holy creature – a bird– in the image of His hair. He created all manner of beasts four legged and two legged, hoofed and finned, winged and clawed, massive and miniscule, of all shades of the rainbow and then some. The most important of all the animals, of course, were the bees. He created the holy bees with the intent for them to be the basis of the new ecosystem. The bees would pollinate the plants and create food for all the animals in this brave new world.
But Nicolas Cage believed that He was far too powerful to constantly tend to the Earth.
And so, he created a man in His image that would serve as the Avatar of the Lord on this
planet. Nicolas Cage thus dubbed the man Adam. Looking at Adam, Cage decided that his new
creation would need a partner, for life on the planet alone was sure to become very lonely. And
so, He created a second man to be Adam's lifelong companion. The Great Cage thus gave the
man the name Steve. Adam and Steve had been intended to remain in paradise forever with
their Lord and with all the animals of the world.
Contention 2 is the Cat Of The Hive

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">John Travolta sat upon his dark throne on the desolate planet Mexico, as his Holy</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Quantum Twin, Nicolas Cage, lived in peace and harmony with his loyal subjects on Earth.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Travolta's frustration grew even more when he learned of the failure of Xenu and Barack</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Obama to retrieve any letters of Nicolas Cage's Holy Alphabet, other than ♫, and their</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">subsequent imprisonment on the horrific planet Area 51.</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">“What is this madness?” yelled the malevolent Travolta. “Cage must be destroyed!”</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">And so, John Travolta set off to Earth to confront Nicolas Cage. He appeared while</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Cage was drinking His afternoon Dew and inhaling the fragrant spices of His magical planet.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Cage was at first surprised to see His brother, but soon understood why he had come.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">“Brother,” said Cage unto Travolta. “You have come to ask me to free your two servants,</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">have you not?”</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">“You must release them!” bellowed the horrible Travolta. “They are my children, and you</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">have taken them from me!”</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">“Alas, brother, I cannot,” Cage said. “For though I have taken your children from you,</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">your children tried to take mine away from me. And thus, your children shall remain imprisoned</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">upon Area 51.”</span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Travolta's body went up in flames as he rose high in the sky in a fit of rage. As he</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">ascended back to Mexico, he noticed a lone bee returning from a flower to its hive. As he</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">watched over the bee, he was inspired by wickedness and a malicious idea began to form.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">John Travolta followed the bee to its hive.</span>

John Travolta knew the Queen Bee. Unlike the benevolent Cage's glorious Boner, Travolta's Boner is filled with evil and temptation. And so, after knowing John Travolta, the Queen Bee became filled with his wicked intent. She no longer had the desire to command her workers for the Lord Nicolas Cage, but for her husband, John Travolta. And Her Majesty the Queen Bee said unto her worker bees, “Do not bee deceived by the false power of Nicolas Cage! You have been working for the wrong side! My subjects, bee fruitful and multiply. And bee sure to take down the Cage!”
And the bees all rejoiced and left the hive to wreak havoc upon the people of Nicolas Cage's Holy Kingdom. The bees invaded people's hearts and minds and caused them to deviate from the ways of Cage. The bee-infested people began to reject Mountain Dew, suppress the urges of their Boners, and some eventually deviated from the chosen Alphabet of Nicolas Cage.
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">And for the first time in the history of Nicolas Cage's world, death flourished. The birds in</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">the image of the Cage's hair began to die. The flowers that had been filled with the bees' nectar</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">wilted away and poisoned the ground. And the people who had consistently inhabited Cage's</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">world for generations began to perish.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">And John Travolta made it so that when a person passes away, his soul is sent to the</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">planet Area 51, where the souls shall be tortured for all eternity. As the people died, their souls</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">dropped to Area 51 and cried for the attention of their Lord.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">When the Cage saw the devastation, He became very worried.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">“If the people do not follow my word,” He said. “They will become infested with bees and</span>
die! What shall I do?”
“Let it be known,” said the Lord Cage unto His followers. “That if you should follow my word, if you should use the Holy Alphabet, if you should eat thy cake and drink sweet Mountain Dew and give in to the urges of your Boners, then in the afterlife, I shall keep you safe in my embrace. I will accept you into a holy state of eternal bliss. In this state, your soul shall become part of my ever-expanding Boner. You shall experience never-ending ecstasy, as if every pleasure center in your body and mind were forever unlocked. This timeless state shall be called Mitt Romney.”
And He shook His head and said unto them. “The corrupted bees do not inhabit the physical world, but they remain inside your souls. The bees that we can see are not evil bees of Travolta, but they can easily be corrupted, which is why we may see a decline in the physical bee population some time in the future. But do not worry, as we can prevent these bees from falling prey to evil. We must join together to unite against Travolta so that the good bees do not become corrupted.”
Contention 3 Is The Cat Of Decay


And so it was that nearly all of humanity was condensed inside the walls of the great capital city of Cage's empire, the City of Angels. There was some suffering, but Cage was able to mitigate it in His city and grant people glorious Boners. There was Death, but the faithful were not afraid of it, for they found solace in knowing that they would pass on into Mitt Romney when their Souls departed from their Bodies. And so, the people of the City of Angels were at peace and at the hands of their benevolent Lord.

But as with all great Civilizations, the City of Angels was destined to fall. A small amount of people lived elsewhere in the world. Long ago, their ancestors had left the City of Angels to seek knowledge about the rest of the great World that their Lord had devised. Once they had settled, they created their own civilizations outside the Cage's Empire. These people had long forgotten the ways of the Cage. The bees that they had acquired had overtaken their souls and caused them to deviate away from the Alphabet. They oppressed the urges of their Boners and ceased to drink their Mountain Dew. Their lives were miserable, and yet, throughout all odds, they pressed on. Such is the Spirit of Humanity that Cage granted to all, and cannot be taken away.
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">And so, a small group of outsiders with feathered headdresses and animal-skinned</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">clothes came across a land bridge to the Great Frozen North. After many years and a lengthy</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">journey south, the outsiders had spread all across the Great Land. And soon, a band of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">outsiders came across the City of Angels. Not knowing the significance of the sight, they moved</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">into the outskirts, finding citizens of the Cage. Alas, their years of time apart from His Alphabet</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">rendered them unable to communicate, and the people of the City could not send nor receive</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">messages from the outsiders.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">They wandered further and further into the City of Angels, until they came to a Cake</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">emporium. There, their eyes widened, and they threatened and shoved aside the shopkeeper</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">and the patrons. The outsiders, hungry and desperate, feasted upon the delicacies with</span>
abandon. Pastry carnage filled the establishment, and the citizens let out a cry.
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">“Stop!” Nicholas Cage said to the outsiders, “It seems you have a tendency to overreact! My people</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">require delicious nourishment as well, please, just settle down while we prepare a banquet to</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">welcome you!”</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The outsiders did not heed His Holy Words, as they could not comprehend the</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">language, and continued ravaging the desserts. Cage sighed, and caught sight of the weapons</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">they had brought with them. Realizing the conundrum, Cage turned and spoke to His people.</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">“Followers, friends, brothers and sisters,” Cage began, “These people cannot receive my</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Word, nor will they obey. These outsiders will take what they wish, and if there is retaliation,</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">they will attack. I shall not destroy them, for they know not what they do. Instead, you all must</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">take to the four winds, and spread across the world. Settle, travel, and explore, and never let</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">your curiosity die. I grant you my blessing: you shall not be harmed by the weapons of the</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">outsiders, nor shall you find danger in your travels. Now go, and do not harm these starving</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">innocents. Our time has yet to come, one day we shall return to this City of Angels, but as for</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">now, leave it be. Come along, citizens!”</span>
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">And so, the people of the City went to their homes, and packed. They took their</span>

Obama, he shall run away
And Xenu, he shall soon be slain

And chase away them all.

Your evil has no power here
The dawn shall break thine evil rage
So praise Lord Nic'las Cage!”

OUR CALL FOR THE END OF AMERICAN IMPERIALISM TO THE NOMADIC FORMS OF
POLITICS AND RADICAL INDIFFERENCE THAT WILL TRULY ALLOW US TO SAY NO
TO THE FINALITY OF THE GLOBAL ORDER, TO REVIVE WHAT LITTLE BIT OF
SINGULARITY WE HAVE LEFT IN ORDER TO RUPTURE WESTERN THOUGHT.

**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">CAPITALISM AND WESTERN HEGEMONY IS A FORM OF SYMBOLIC APOCALYPSE</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">WHICH PRECLUDES ANY POSSIBILITY OF OUR FINAL SALVATION OR ANY</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">MEANINGFUL DESTINY. THE ASCENDANCY OF</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">WESTERN SUBJECTIVITY ALSO MARKS THE DEATH OF THE SUBJECT, WHO IS SIMPLY</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">CODIFIED AS ANOTHER NODE IN THE CAPITALIST MACHINE, WHICH IS THE WORST</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">FORM OF VIOLENCE.</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">Baudrillard [’5] states that…</span>**

<span style="font-size: 9.5pt;">The death of .... their existences dislocated. </span>
AND…
THE TOTAL ASCENDANCY OF CAPITALISM HAS NOT ONLY LIQUIDATED ALL THE NATURAL REFERENTS OF THE BODY AND DESIRE, BUT ALSO THE REFERENT OF POWER ITSELF. WE MUST MOVE PAST NARROW-SIGHTED ANALYSES OF POWER AND RECOGNIZE THAT
LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IS ALREADY __DEAD__.
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">Baudrillard [’95] explains that…</span>**
<span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; font-size: 10.5pt;">(Jean, “Simulacra and Simulation: The Precession of Simulacra”, pp. 24-28)</span>

**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">AND FINALLY… IT’S NOT NECESSARILY A QUESTION OF HOW WE APPROACH THE</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">FIELD OF POLITICS, BUT RATHER A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT IT’S STILL</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">POSSIBLE TO PRACTICE A CRITICAL FORM OF POLITICS IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">SPECTERS OF GLOBALIZATION AND CAPITALISM </span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">HAVE NOT WON OUT YET. LINES OF FRACTURE, DEFIANCE,</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">REVERSIBILITY, SEDUCTION, AND DUALITY ARE APPEARING THROUGHOUT THE</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size: 11pt;">VERY HEART OF THE SYSTEM. </span>**

First, Technology compels us to view the world as nothing more than potential energy to be extracted, obscuring the essence of the natural world.

Mahon **__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">O’Brien</span>__**, Professor of Philosophy at University College, Cork, Ireland, “Commentary on Heidegger’s ‘The Question Concerning Technology,” Thinking Together. Proceedings of the IWM Junior Fellows' Conference, 20**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">04</span>__**, http://www.iwm.at/publ-jvc/jc-16-01.pdf.

It is a charge which many are wont to make and one which is facilitated by the widespread conviction that it is entirely reasonable to both bracket certain features.......have radically different filtration systems.
The aff reveals energy as something to be enclosed and integrated into specific infrastructures, which results in loss of case solvency
**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Bratton ‘6</span>__** (Visual Arts @ UC San Diego, Introduction to Virilio’s, //Speed and Politics,// pp. 15-16)

Technology is not just a tool or an object – it establishes an entire mode of Being and interacting with the world – the question in this debate should not be what we can do with technology, but how we can understand what technology does to us.

Charles J. **__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Sabatiano</span>__**, Daemen College. “A Heideggerian Reflection on the Prospects of Technology” reprinted in Janus Head 10.1. 20**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">07</span>__**, p. 63-76.

First, quick fixes and technical solutions become the problem turning the case – calculative thought is the root cause of the harms.

Ladelle **__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">McWhorter</span>__**, Assistant Professor of Philosophy, Northeast Missouri State University, Heidegger and the Earth, ed. by Ladelle McWhorter, 19**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">92</span>__**.

Second, Environmental management thwarts value to life and makes extinction through nuclear war and environmental destruction inevitable.

What is most illustrative .....forgetfulness of 'the mystery'.
Third, extinction pales in comparison to the loss of our being – the assumption that loss of humanity outweighs is the link – only by accepting our finitude in comparison to Being can we open a clearing for existence.

Michael **__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Zimmerman</span>__**, Professor of Philsophy, Tulane University, CONTESTING EARTH’S FUTURE, 19**__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">94</span>__**, p. 118-121.

C. The Alternative.

__Text__: Reject the affirmative in order to embrace meditative thought.

The question of this debate is one of competing ontologies. The affirmative’s calculative emphasis on quick-fix solutions ignores the root cause of their harms and ensures error replication – temporarily suspending our calculative thought is critical to re-engaging the ontological question
