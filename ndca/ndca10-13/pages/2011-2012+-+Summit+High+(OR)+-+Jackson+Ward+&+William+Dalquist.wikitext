====<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The desk you are sitting in rests on stolen land. No matter where you go and what you do, millions were killed and their blood rests in the ground beneath our feet.</span>==== 
====<span style="font-size: 13pt;">If we want to come to grips with reality. We must begin by rethinking our relationship to the Western ontological predisposition to colonize and destroy.</span>==== 
====<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Even if there is a such thing as “beneficial imperialism,” those benefits are more accidental than causal.</span>==== 
===The inherent contradiction of the Western Metanarrative permits the atrocities of Enlightenment and Manifest Destiny by rationalizing the benefits. It is this complacency, however, which makes global violence both possible and inevitable=== 

====Spanos, Distinguished Professor of English and comparative literature at Binghamton University “America's shadow: an anatomy of empire,” 2000==== 

===<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Only by giving back the land and rethinking our relationship to this colonization as THE starting point to oppression can we solve the classism, racism, sexism, and militarism which make violence and extinction inevitable</span>===

===Ergo the plan text: The United States should relocate itself into outer space there by ceding the land back to the First People.=== 

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The only way to dismantle the empire is to send the US off the planet</span>

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">There is no such thing as beneficial colonialism as it relates to the First Peoples. Embedded in the American state of being is the attempt to destroy Native Americans. The American character is infested with the desire to kill, and the killing of Native Americans makes all other killing possible. </span>

==Plan== 
===The United States federal government should direct the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Energy to develop laser propulsion technology that disposes of nuclear waste materials into Venus’s orbit.===

===Narrative (It Changes)=== 
===The 1AC is not just a narrative, but a political act, aimed at breaking down the walls of homophobia and attempting to create cracks for openness within the community and becomes a cultural turning point for queer politics, Marc Polonsky Writes:===

===Status quo queer politics has created an idealized white male queer which ignores the complexities that exist in queerness. This form of politics has served to reinforce a system where queer youth and queer kids of colors are left without hope. José EstebanMuñoz writes:===

===<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Second: The politics of space, specifically the discourse centered on exploration, development, and colonization reproduce heteronormative hierarchies, which ensure such hierarchies spread to space.</span>===

(eds), Securing Outer Space. London and New York: Routledge, pp.59-60)

===<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Furthermore: It’s hunting season for the homos! –Homophobic violence is not only a common and accepted form of violence but continues to perpetuate even in accademic institutions. The ability to accept the norms of heteronormativity makes violence inevdiable.</span>===

Project Muse RC)

===<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The failure to create an open space for individuals to come out of the closet makes oppression inevitable as they have to give up their identity in order to survive. They are forced to normalize their queer bodies making queer bodies nothing more then heteronormative. Gust Yep writes … </span>===

===<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Lastly, Heteronormativity is inherently unstable. It is constantly putting up borders to protect itself from the queer. This is the same way heteronormativity operates in this room, in debate. Debate is heteronormative: Just wait until the 1NC, there will be a bunch of Framework, or T: borders put up to keep the queer from penetrating the debate space</span>===

==<span style="font-size: 13pt;">SUBSTANTIATE MEANINGFUL EPISTEMOLOGICAL GROWTH</span>== 

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">We pedagogically prioritize purpose allowing epistemological growth to ALTER the social structure. Moving BEYOND the limits of WINS/LOSSES, we strive to make the WIN matter, to make debate matter, to DEVELOP self through the exploration of the discussion that happen within debate rounds. My indianess is a process that NEVER ends an ongoing dynamic that is fostered within the process of debate,</span>
===OUR DISCUSSION OF THE TOPIC BEGINS WITH A REINTERPRETATION OF SPACE=== 
===Space is the unknown that offers the potential of unlimited benefits a chance to start over once we have exhausted the possibilities of exploitation that are harnessed within our grasp.===

===A metaphorical interpretation of the resolution solves best. It allows us as debaters to regain our agency and stop engaging in the collective hallucination of fiat. Like Elizabeth Jones says: My words right here, right now can’t change the state, but they can change the state of debate.===

===OUR SPEAKING STYLE IS IMPORTANT TO THE EVALUATION OF THE DEBATE=== 
Language functions as a model of one’s culture. Hip Hop language is an elaborate and unique speaking style that emphasizes performance and relies heavily on the use of Metaphors rejecting the SOLE reliance on logic and evidence. The use of Hip Hop language is our defiance to the TOTAL INDOCTRINATION of white America.
Our metaphorical interpretation of the resolution is an active criticism that serves to liberate us by embracing and preserving our heritage.

===Therefore Will and I advocate the rejection of all policy options and pedagogical options for the extension of state power in favor of a politics for the decolonization of the mind.
