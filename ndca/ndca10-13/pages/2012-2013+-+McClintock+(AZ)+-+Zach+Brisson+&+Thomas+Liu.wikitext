Preventative action is necessary—we don’t get a second chance.

Our approach to existential risks cannot be one of trial-and-error. There is no opportunity to learn from errors. The reactive approach – see what happens, limit damages, and learn from experience – is unworkable. Rather, we must take a proactive approach. This requires foresight to anticipate new types of threats and a willingness to take decisive preventive action and to bear the costs<span style="font-size: 10.66px;"> (moral and economic) </span>of such actions<span style="font-size: 10.66px;">.</span>

Wars will be limited and no incentive for escalation— your scenario isn’t unique
Fettweis, 6(Christopher J., Assistant Professor in the Political Science Department at Tulane University/strategist for two year at the US Naval War College, “A Revolution in International Relation Theory: Or What if Mueller Is Right?”, International Studies Review, p. 677-697)
Third, and most important, the end of major war is not good news
AND
as an opportunity to increase their power at the expense of their rivals.

No scientific evidence for nuclear annihilation
