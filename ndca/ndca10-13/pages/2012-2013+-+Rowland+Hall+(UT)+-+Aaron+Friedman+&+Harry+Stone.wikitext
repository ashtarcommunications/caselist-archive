**A. Uniqueness: Sequestration deal is on track – there is already an established framework and bipartisan cooperation for deficit reduction in the lame duck.**
**Krawzak, 10/21** (Paul M., Congressional Quarterly Staff, “Efforts for Plan to Avoid Fiscal Cliff Pick Up Speed,” CQ TODAY ONLINE NEWS, 2012, [[http://public.cq.com/docs/news/news-000004167600.html]])

With the days counting down to the lame-duck session, efforts to devise a bipartisan plan to avoid the fiscal cliff are taking on new urgency in the Senate...
Some speculate that Republican and Democratic lawmakers, despite their contrasting positions on taxes and entitlement programs, could build a bridge between the House legislation and emerging Senate proposals.
**B. Links: Transportation spending collapses bipartisanship and dooms the deal.** 
**Schank, ‘12** (Joshua, President and CEO of the Eno Center for Transportation a neutral, non-partisan think-tank, Is Partisanship the Problem?, April 16, 2012, [[http://www.enotrans.org/eno-brief/is-partisanship-the-problem]])

The partisan differences between the parties on the issue of transportation are likely resolvable. Admittedly, we are not immune from the larger political partisanship infecting the nation at the moment...
If we focused less on funding levels, and more on program purpose, we might just find ourselves in a better position.

**C. Impacts: Sequestration destroys US global military power – collapses deterrence and triggers multiple scenarios for nuclear war (Iranian prolif, African instability, terrorism, Korean war, Taiwan war, and Russian military modernization).**
**Hunter, ’12** (Duncan is a U.S. Representative from Alaska. "SEQUESTRATION SENDS WRONG MESSAGE TO U.S. FRIENDS AND FOES ALIKE," September 30, 2012, http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/sep/30/tp-sequestration-sends-wrong-message-to-us/?page=1~~%23article)

To most Americans, the term “sequestration” does not mean a whole lot, at least right now, but it should, given the uncertain future facing U.S. national security...
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The clock is ticking to stave off sequestration — </span>a move that would signal to our friends and enemies<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> alike that we uphold our promises and stand ready to defend our interests against any threat</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

7. Policies which pursue the goal of reorganizing, maintaining and generalizing exchange relationships make use of a specific sequence of instruments….Social conflicts and political struggles do not, of course, emerge automatically from this contradiction. They are waged by political forces which are willing and able to defend the reformist policies of the capitalist state against the obstructive resistance of the capitalist class itself.

**Capitalism is the driving force behind global wars that will culminate in extinction.**
**Callinicos ’04** [Alex, Director of the Centre for European Studies at King’s College, The Revolutionary Ideas of Karl Marx, 2004 pg. 196-197]

Capitalism has not changed its spots. It is still based on the exploitation of the working class, and liable to constant crises….‘The philosophers have interpreted the world,’ wrote Marx, ‘the point, however, is to change it.’ If Marxism is correct, then we must act on it. 


**<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Alternative text: Reject the affirmative as a means of refusing complicity with capitalism. </span>**

**<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Rejecting capitalism is key to opening up new alternatives. Only complete refusal, not piecemeal reform, can prevent otherwise inevitable slavery and extinction. </span>**
**<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Herod, 04</span>**<span style="font-family: Georgia;"> (James, http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/4thEd/4-index.htm, Getting Free, 4th Edition</span>
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">A sketch of an association of democratic, autonomous neighborhoods and how to create it, Fourth Edition, January 2004</span>

It is time to try to describe, at first abstractly and later concretely, a strategy for destroying capitalism….Otherwise we are doomed to perpetual slavery and possibly even to extinction. 

**The entire HS topic is alarmist nonsense**
**Lane, 11**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – member of the Washington Post’s editorial board (Charles, “The U.S. infrastructure argument that crumbles upon examination,”10/31,</span>

For all its shortcomings, U.S. infrastructure is still among the most advanced in the world — if not the most advanced….Barbados has one commercial airport. The United States has more than 500.
