===Death K===

**We begin this speech with the words of the eternal and all-powerful, not the mere mortals cited by the 1AC. Death, the Master of Life and Beyond, has spoken thus: I am the only certainty, feared by all in spite of my inevitability. The affirmative stands aligned with the zombie consciousness robots typical of human beings, “living” to sponge up the knowledge of others and perfect in order to defer Death. This is no way to live at all. Such participation in the stupid programmed zombie consciousness espoused by the 1AC is a voting issue for education**

This is Death, yes I am in an expression...It dies with me, Death.



**Death is a fantasy – our biology means we cannot truly “die” or cease to be, rather we enter a new form of becoming: becoming earth. Even if we are all wiped from the face of the earth in a hailstorm of nuclear bombs the process of life goes on even at the micro level. There is no unique warrant for why the biological construct of human deserves a place higher than the construct of atoms. This desire to be secure from death is the most personal level of microfascism that negates our ability to live life to its fullest and breeds ressentiment.**

Philosophically, it is a terrible mistake. It is a terrible...that non-organic life has this breathing rhythm all to itself.

===Dialectical Materialism=== 
====1NC==== 
**The failure of the Left**

**More than a century and a half ago, the intellectual climate in Germany collapsed into philosophy. German philosophers emphasized the transformative potential of ideas, and sought to emancipate themselves and politics through transformations in consciousness.** 

**It was in this intellectual climate that Karl Marx emerged. His central thesis was that this philosophy of ideas not only distracted attention from the very real material conditions that structure our existence, but also made progressive social change impossible.** 

**The insights of Karl Marx are perhaps even more pertinent today, when the liberal academy and intellectuals have begun to assert that discourse and performance are avenues for confronting oppressive power structures. This trend of the Left today is embodied in the affirmative’s politics, in their naïve and unproblematic endorsement of discourse as they desperately struggle to believe that what they have done in this debate is itself transformative and empowering.**

**Against this paralyzing politics, it is more important that ever to return to Marx, and to emphasize his insight that transformations in consciousness can never lead to social transformations—only struggling to transform the real material conditions that structure social relations can bring about social change**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Marx, 1845</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">(Karl, The German Ideology, http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm)</span>
This conception of history depends on our ability...makes men just as much as men make circumstances. 



**Unfortunately, Marx’s insight has been all but discarded by the new left, with its emphasis on being postmodern, postcolonial, poststructural, postMarxist, or post-anything. This post-al politics of the contemporary left focuses on discourse and language at the expense of analyzing real material conditions. This post-al logic is complicit with capitalism, especially insofar as it obscures the operation of political economy and the material reality of capitalism**
