<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Defined benefit pension plans have become a unique luxury of the public sector. DB plans are available to 84 percent of state and local workers, but to just 21 percent of private workers.20 Furthermore, public sector plans are generally more generous than the remaining private-sector plans.21 The good news is that a number of states are starting to tackle the high costs of these government employee benefits.</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">From a federal perspective, the thing to note is that the 50 states are in quite different fiscal positions. For example, a report by Moodyâ€™s shows that state-level debt varies from more than 8 percent of state GDP in Hawaii and Massachusetts to near zero in Iowa, Wyoming, and Nebraska.22 There are also large differences between the states in pension funding gaps.23 Part of these fiscal differences likely stem from the wide variations in public sector unionization between the states.24</span>
