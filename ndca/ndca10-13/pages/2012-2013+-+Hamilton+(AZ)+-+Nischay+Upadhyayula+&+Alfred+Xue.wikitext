<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Welcome to the sacred site known as the wiki page of Alfred and Nischay, Affred and Negschay, Alfy and Nietzsche, etc.</span>


<span style="line-height: 1.5;">See the Hamilton RS wiki and the Hamilton CP wiki.</span>
Nothing Nischay and Alfred run has anything to do with anything the above teams run; just see the wikis.

Clarification: Nischay and Alfred are the A team. They are the deities to whom Gokul, Kevin, and Malhar pray (Zoheb's Muslim so it's ok). They are the 39845367th and 39845368th Hindu gods.

"Why are there no cites on this page?" you may ask.
We may __[[#|answer]]__: it's because we're similar to an innocent toddler falsely accused of sabotaging a vase in that we haven't broken anything. Besides, it's not like the cites would help you or anything. I mean, our teammate was almost the head engineer. You can't beat that.
Edit: Zoheb IS the head engineer. Not almost. He is. You definitely can't beat that.

"Why set your sights on cites? I have yet to see a person who cites the sight of cites on this site as the reason for his or her success in debate. This site is not a site for cites; this site is a site for insights. The sight of a site lacking cites incites excitement in the souls of most policy debaters, and it is for precisely that reason that there are no cites in sight on this site." - Gokul Ramadoss

Also, if you think Nischay and Alfred are inhumanly good and must thus be cheating by taking steroids or other such methods, the following quotes will set your mind at ease:
"I'll kill you." - Nischay Upadhyayula, context irrelevant.
"I'm not cheating; I'm just calculating how to get the maximum distance in the minimum time." - Alfred Xue, context irrelevant.

<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">
</span><span style="display: block; text-align: left;">The spikes on the pineapple symbolize the hardships we've been through. The missing leaves also symbolize the hardships we've been through. The green color symbolizes our love and appreciation of the environment. The yellow color symbolizes Alfred's skin. The succulent fruit within symbolizes the success we've had as we've overcome our various hardships - our efforts literally come to __[[#|fruition]]__, as a farmer's do every harvest season (assuming his/her literal harvest is bountiful like our figurative harvest). The Nischay symbolizes the Nischay. The way the left hand cradles the pineapple and allows it to maintain its upright position symbolizes capitalism; I feel that no explanation is necessary for that one. The khaki pants symbolize the cockiness which we do not have. Speaking of cocks, why did the chicken cross the road? Because Nischay did it, only a few seconds after this picture was taken. Alfred's absence from this picture symbolizes his humility and his unparalleled ability to spread while burping and/or burp while spreading. We call it spurping. Just kidding, no we don't. That'd be dumb. Finally, the belt symbolizes our role in society: we are the expensive metal-tipped strip of fabric which loops through and holds together the sagging pants of humanity, the sole protectors of the excess loose fabric around the belt area known in some circles as "waist waste," the only thing preventing said metaphorical pants from slipping from the aforementioned metaphorical waist and revealing the stained underpants of the human race.</span>
