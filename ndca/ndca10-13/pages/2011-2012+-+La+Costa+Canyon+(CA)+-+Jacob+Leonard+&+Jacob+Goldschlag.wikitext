===Contention 1: The Omniscient Gaze=== 

===1. The biopolitical gaze cast by “the eyes in the sky” makes state sponsored ethnic cleansing and population annihilation inevitable===

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">As we have already encountered in Foucault....is the condition of possibility for info-war</span>

===2. This apparatus of force and violence towards a “surveillant subject” and the omniscient observer from above encompasses all other civilian surveillance systems, and creates a distance that ensures subjectivity and control===

===3. This division between ideal forms of species is the root cause of conflict---wars are fought not because of a particular sovereign geopolitical interest but because of the biopolitical commitment to eugenic violence===

(Stuart, boundary 2 29.1 (2002) 125-151, “The War of Races and the Constitution of the State: Foucault's «Il faut défendre la société» and the Politics of Calculation,” Project Muse

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">The reverse side is the power to allow death... </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">wars, causing so many</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;"> men </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">to be killed</span>


===Contention 2: The Cyborg=== 


===1. Military surveillance blurs the line between the human and the machine used to monitor them- creating virtual imagery and technical interoperability that establishes the perfect metaphorical cyborg=== 

<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Harris</span>, C. V. , 20<span style="font-size: 13pt;">07</span>-05-23 "Google Earth® and the Omniscient Gaze" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, TBA, San Francisco, CA Online <PDF>. 2010-06-04 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p172524_index.html

===2. This sustains government attempts to computerize and mechanize populations- they become commodities that are assimilated into the cybernetic infrastructure of the state security network=== 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dillon & Reid</span> 20<span style="font-size: 12pt;">01</span> (Michael and Julian, Michael Dillon is Professor of Politics in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Lancaster and Julian Reid is a Doctoral Student in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Lancaster, Global Liberal Governance: Biopolitics, Security, and War, 2001. Millennium - Journal of International Studies, pp.56-57)

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">As the bios is reinterpreted scientifically so... </span><span style="font-size: 90%;">character of all problematisations of security.</span>

===3. Constant surveillance in the pursuit of a perfectly ordered population with machine quality precision fortifies disciplinary powers that turn humans into machines who act as the political tells them too- this eliminates all freedom and justifies mass atrocities.=== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Clifford</span> 20<span style="font-size: 13pt;">01</span> (Michael Clifford is a professor of philosophy at the Mississippi State University. He holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from
Vanderbilt University. "Political Genealogy After Foucault." Routledge Publications, 2001. pg. 48 DC)
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">The chief function of disciplinary power," says Foucault...</span>would become intrinsic to most modern institutions.

===4.) The impact is extinction – a commitment to the administration of life establishes a power-knowledge regime that makes wars, conflicts, and the death of entire populations vital – we detach ourselves from those we must kill – who put society’s stability at risk===

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">The title of this paper alludes less to Nietzsche...human </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">existence </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">[bios] to biological life [zoe].</span>

===Contention 3: Infinite Responsibility=== 
===1. The victims of the government high-tech war machine, or the “spied upon” become the Other- terminally warred against and subject to the state’s precision weaponized violence=== 
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Huhtinen</span>, Aki-Mauri. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and Rantapelkonen</span>, Jari. "The War Against the Other and the Us - Political and Philosophical Problems of Postmodern World’s Atmosphere" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association 48th Annual Convention, Hilton Chicago, CHICAGO, IL, USA, Feb 28, 20<span style="font-size: 12pt;">07</span> Online <PDF>.2011-03-13 <http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p178927_index.html>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">Thanks to the information revolution warfare...answered the questions: </span><span class="underline" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">“</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 90%;">We are all Americans</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 90%;">”</span>.</span>

===2. Infinite responsibility to the Other is necessary to solve genocide and demands that we challenge the state’s actions despite politics or the possibility of war to prevent injustice through personal and political action.=== 
David <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Campbell</span>, professor of international politics at the University of Newcastle, 19**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">99</span>**, Moral Spaces, p. 40-41
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">Even though Levinas's limited reservations about...is informed by the proximity of my relation to the other</span>

===3. All evil is committed in the name of Survival=== 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Callahan</span>, institute of Society and Ethics, 19<span style="font-size: 12pt;">73</span> (Daniel, “The Tyranny of Survival”, p. 91-3)

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">The value of survival could not be so readily abused...It would be the Pyrrhic victory to end all Pyrrhic </span>

===4. Through our relationship to the Other, we can short-circuit apocalyptic confrontations and violence===

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">The best way to describe the "style" of the theology...</span>possible style for a postmodern alienated theology. 4-5

===Contention 4: Solvency=== 

===1. The only way to drive a stake through the heart of the imperial gaze, is to step decisively away from it- only when we detach ourselves from responsibility does violence occur=== 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Harris</span>, C. V., 20<span style="font-size: 12pt;">07</span>-05-23 "Google Earth® and the Omniscient Gaze" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, TBA, San Francisco, CA Online <PDF>. 2010-06-04 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p172524_index.html
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">In order to illustrate this process, I will discuss...</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 90%;">interpellated in a dominant imperial gaze. </span>

===2. Its try or die – Resistance must start now, but can be effective in the form of taboos established around the use of military recon satellites – the plan kindles awareness in the general population and can create widespread social change=== 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Duvall</span>, Raymond. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">and Havercroft</span>, Jonathan. "Taking Sovereignty Out of This World: Space Weaponization and the Production of Late-Modern Political Subjects" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, Town & Country Resort and Convention Center, San Diego, California, USA, Mar 22, 20<span style="font-size: 12pt;">06</span> Online<PDF>. 2011-03-13 <http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p98680_index.html>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">Given these grim prospects for a de-territorialized...</span>themselves become potential targets of such weapons.

===3. Our demand turns the tables of the biopolitical apparatus. Our discourse and plan are a strategy that reverses power relations=== 
David <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Campbell</span>, professor of international politics at the university of Newcastle, Writing Security, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">1998</span>, pg. 204-205
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">Recognizing the possibility of rearticulating... </span>have also issued claims on society.

===4. Prefer Pragmatism- Deconstruction without action for material justice blocks political escape from oppression and reinforces ivory tower elitism=== 
Anthony <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cook</span>, Associate Professor at Georgetown Law, New England Law Review, Spring, 19<span style="font-size: 12pt;">92</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">The effect of </span><span class="underline" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">deconstructing </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">the power ... </span>eloquence, prestige, wealth and <span class="underline">power.</span>

==Plan Text== 
===<span style="font-family: Times;">The United States Federal Government should mandate that all of the United States Federal Government’s reconnaissance satellites explore space only beyond the Earth’s mesosphere. </span>=== 


===Contention 5: We dare you to run the politics disad=== 

===1. We cannot use political expediency as an excuse to rank and choose priorities- political influence is not finite and does not justify putting civil rights on the back burner=== 

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ruby-Sachs</span>, J.D. from the University of Toronto and practices civil litigation, 20<span style="font-size: 12pt;">08 </span>(Emma, 11/24, “Ranking the issues: Gay Rights in an Economic Crisis", http://www.huffmgtonpost.com/emma-rubysachs/ranking-the-issues-gay-ri_b_146023.html, Accessed: 7/7/2009)

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">On Friday, the Washington Times reported that Barack Obama ... and hopefully will, remain a priority for all of us</span>

===2. Don’t evaluate the reactions of others to your ethical decision to uphold the rights of the individual – invites atrocities=== 
Gewirth, Prof of Philosophy at the University of Chicago, 1982
(Alan, Human Rights: Essays on Justification and Application, p. 229-230)
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">Nevertheless, the distinctions can be supplemented ... so that her correlative right remains absolute</span>

===We should resist calls to maintain current policies out of fear of a political backlash—this same utilitarian calculus has been continually used to justify the slaughter of millions of innocent people=== 
John <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Shattuck</span>, John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, “Book Launch—‘Freedom on Fire: Human Rights Wars and America’s Response,’” 20<span style="font-size: 13pt;">03</span>, http://wwics.si.edu/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.print&event_id=31841&stoplayout=true

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">As Assistant Secretary, Shattuck found himself ... </span>subsequently invoked successfully in Haiti and Kosovo.

===Util is based on a sovereign subjectivity which reduces human lives to currency.===

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">The return of the ontological thus became ... </span>we have to bear witness to it.
