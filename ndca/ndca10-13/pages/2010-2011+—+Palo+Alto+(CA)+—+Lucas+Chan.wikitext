===Indo-Pak AC=== 

O1. Because res does not say "all states" Affs can defend at least one state and remain consistent with text of res.

O2. The aff can run a plan saying that current nuclear weapons-owning nations can dispossess them because
# <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The AC gives the NC access to stable counter-plan ground because the NC can run PICs and counterplans to the text of the AC plan while understanding the intricacies of the AC. NCs should have counter plan ground since a lot of the most qualified literature on the topic concerns evidence specific to the nuclear stockpiles of any of these nations and since NCs would get access to a larger quantity of ground that they would not have if the AC did not run a plan. This is a unique benefit that can be accessed only by the AC running plans. Counter-plan ground is key to education since it forces debaters to conduct cost-benefit analysis on courses of action akin to how policy actions are actually made. Counter-plan ground is also key to fairness since counter-plans are the only way to test the competitiveness of AC advocacies.</span>
# <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Running a plan means that the AC is bound to the text offered in the 1AC. This makes the AC tied to defending a specific advocacy that they cannot shift or kick out of in the 1AR, making me more predictable and allows the NC to devote their attention toward debating my advocacy instead of worrying about which argument I will go for in the 1AR if the AC had no plan text. Stable advocacies are key to fairness because it encourages NCs to fully debate an argument instead of trying to badly apply generic arguments in the interest of coverage to prevent multiple strategies in the 1AR.</span>
O3. The affirmative will only defend disarmament if the NC provides disadvantages that are applicable to the specific countries in the plan text and at the very least talk about countries already with nuclear weapons since otherwise it explodes the AC research burden and makes the NC extremely unpredictable. This also makes sense logically since the AC should not have to defend disarming a country X if the entirety of the plan regards disarming a completely unrelated country Y. Thus, the negative must link their arguments about disarmament to the specific scenario outlined in the text of the AC.

Thus, the text of the plan is as follows: “//Pakistan// //ought to completely eliminate their stockpiles of nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons making facilities, and weapons-grade nuclear fuel to thwart non-state actors from acquiring them.”//

Part 1. Uniqueness.
First, Pakistan is extremely unstable; it is ranked as the world’s fifth most unstable country. <span class="Underline">**<span style="text-decoration: none;">Dawn.com, June 2010</span>**</span>//[1]]]////<span class="Underline">

Part 4. Solvency

I will defend disadvantages to disarmament towards these two countries.

First, India and Pakistan will not go to war because nuclear weapons were not deterrent factors anyway. Nuclear weapons empirically have not deterred conventional wars. Nor do they translate to clear international advantages.** Jacek Kugler[[[//**6]**]] **writes:

Second, denuclearizing Pakistan would solve for all the problems because Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal will be eliminated, which decreases the chance of nuclear terrorism because we will be denying terrorists the source of their nuclear weapons power.

<span style="display: block; font-size: 19px;">Stock AC</span>


I Affirm.
Ought is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as bound or under moral obligation. Thus, the value, //or what we are striving to achieve,// is morality.
<span style="color: #002060;">States have moral obligations to protect individuals. Eric Beversluis[[#_ftn1|[1]]] writes: </span>
<span style="color: #002060; font-size: 8pt;">As I see it, ...</span><span style="color: #002060;"> **__having moral responsibility.__**</span>
//First, the resolution is a question of what states ought to do, and states are inherently interested in protecting individuals.//
//Second, the main focus of morality is the individual, so protecting individuals is the most important obligation if we are trying to be moral.//
Thus, the criterion, //the best way to achieve morality,// is protecting individuals.
**First, I contend that possession of nuclear weapons will permit nuclear terrorists to attain and use nuclear weapons.**
First, Terrorists can get nuclear weapons by stealing them or buying them on the nuclear black market, and are currently trying to do so.
The US Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism[[#_ftn2|[2]]] writes:
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">At the moment,..</span> **__a nuclear weapon.__**
<span style="tab-stops: 4.5pt;">Second, Nuclear weapons labs are not secure, which leaves them susceptible to terrorist raiding. Steven Candell[[#_ftn3|[3]]], director of development and public affairs for the nuclear age peace foundation, writes:

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But it may ...</span> **__of fissile material."__**</span>
Thus, we must rapidly reduce nuclear weapons stockpiles in order to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons from poorly defended nuclear labs.
Third, terrorists can't be deterred.
Josiane Gable[[#_ftn4|[4]]], in the Washington Quarterly, writes:
**__First,__** <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">as recent ... here in its traditional way.</span>
Classical nuclear deterrence depends on deterring the enemy with weapons they are scared of. Since terrorists are not states, not centrally organized, and extremely committed to their cause, we can't deter them with nuclear weapons, so there is no point in having nukes. Also, terrorists are the most likely threat in today's world, because they are widely spread, and the risk of an interstate war is becoming increasingly unlikely.
A single terrorist nuclear strike in a densely populated area would kill about 1 million people.
Graham Allison[[#_ftn5|[5]]], Director of the Belfer Center for International Affairs at Harvard, writes:
**__New York City...__** **__fire, and fallout.__**

Thus, states shouldn't have nuclear weapons because nukes are dangerous and cannot serve any useful purpose when attempting to combat terrorists. This is the first reason to Affirm.

**Second, I contend that nuclear war due to accidental nuclear launch is likely if we continue to proliferate.**

===<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in;">The twentieth century is likely to see a nuclear strike, due to accidental launch or mistakes, unless we stop current proliferation. </span>=== 
===<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in;">Stephen Cimbala[[#_ftn6|[6]]] , Professor of Political Science at Penn State, writes: </span>=== 
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">If the possibility ... based warfare.15 </span>

So, nuclear weapons are extremely dangerous in the modern world, because there is no organizing force of the two warring powers, such as during the cold war. A nuclear war is becoming more likely the longer we have nuclear weapons, so you should Affirm.

</span>


----
<span style="display: block;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">**Deontology-Plan AC**</span>
</span>
I affirm.
The OED defines the following terms
1. possess as “to own or gain ownership of”[[#_ftn1|[1]]]. Thus the resolution constitutes a prohibition on an action not just the action itself.
2. ought as “bound or under moral obligation”. Thus, the value is morality[[#_ftn2|[2]]]
The resolution implies a moral framework and thus mandates that, in order to win, the negative must show that nuclear weapons are ethically justified not just that they are necessary.
<span style="font-size: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0.1pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0.1pt;">The standard is treating people as ends in and of themselves for four reasons.</span>
First, each individual has intrinsic value. John Taurek[[#_ftn3|[3]]] writes:
<span style="margin-left: .5in;">**__For each of__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ...</span> **__one of the five.__**</span>
As a result, aggregating harms makes no sense morally.
<span style="margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: .1pt;">Second, consequentialism is circular.

Third, A. consequentialism requires infinite calculation, preventing the validation of action.

B. Settling for an approximation of the best end-state is equally problematic. </span>
Fourth, aggregative ethics fail because it is ultimately impossible to change the amount of utility in the world. Nick Bostrom writes[[#_ftn4|[4]]]:
<span style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Modern cosmology teaches... </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">to ... prevent another holocaust. 3</span></span>
<span style="margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: .1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Next, the only multilateral justification that states ought to possess nuclear weapons is for the intended purposes of deterrence. Deterrence theory relies on holding hostage citizens of a nation to the threat of a nuclear attack based on the actions of its leaders. This treats people as a means to an end for two reasons. Steven Lee</span>[[#_ftn5|[5]]]<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> explains:</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-left: 0.5in;">What is morally ... this kind of case.</span>
<span style="margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: .1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If we evaluate the round from a deontological standpoint and the resolution is a prohibition on an action, then we affirm if there is a deontological violation stemming from states possessing nuclear weapons. </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thus, the affirmative plan text is that all nine nuclear weapon holding nations ought to ratify a new International Security Treaty that entails nations submitting their nuclear weapons-grade material to the United Nations and eliminating their existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons. I reserve the right to clarify.</span></span>
Roger Speed[[#_ftn6|[6]]] further explains the plan text.
<span style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: .5in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; vertical-align: baseline;">**__<span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: none; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: none; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: none; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: none; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">A new security ...</span>__****__<span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: none; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: none; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: none; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: none; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;"> nuclear weapons tests.</span>__**</span>
To eliminate stockpiles, all nations ought to launch their weapons into space. I reserve the right to clarify.
Also, affirmative plans are good for debate and legitimate since:
<span style="margin-left: 32.2pt;">1. My interp increases the quality of the argumentation by forcing debaters to engage in the substance of the plan. </span>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0.1pt; margin-left: 32.2pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0.1pt;">2. They stabilize AC advocacies. </span>

<span style="margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: .1pt;">Moreover, the plan has the following additional advantages.

A. The international agency would be able to stop other nations from acquiring weapons. </span>

Next, an international organization would eliminate the prospect of proliferation, arms races, and terrorists from stealing weapons. Speed[[#_ftn8|[8]]] 3:
<span style="margin-left: .5in;"><span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: none; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: none; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: none; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: none; border-top-width: 1pt; font-size: 8pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">The final objective would be ... </span><span style="font-size: 13px;">for more than four decades.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">If the possibility ... information-based warfare.15 </span>
At a consequentialist level these impacts are the fastest and most probable way of leading to nuclear war. The impact of nuclear war is extinction. Gene Williams 1 writes, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Prof of electrical enginerring, university of MN, Nuclear War, Nuclear Winter, 1987]</span>
“**__Nuclear winter is__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">a... light reaching the ground.”</span>
Williams 2, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">summarizing </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">plant ecologist </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Joseph Berry </span>explains how catastrophic this can be.
**__“If the light ...__** **__oxygen-breathing life on earth.”__**

Furthermore, killing the plants which are at the bottom of the food chain topples the entire food chain, so humans would have no food left, leading to extinction.

<span style="display: block;"><span style="font-size: 19px;">I negate. </span><span style="font-size: 19px;"> Ought is defined by the OED as “expressing what is advisable.”<span style="mso-footnote-id: ftn;">[[#_ftn1|[1]]]</span> Prefer this definition since: The resolution questions the legitimacy of an action taken by a state; however, only individual actors can have moral obligations. Hans Morgenthau<span style="mso-footnote-id: ftn;">[[#_ftn2|[2]]]</span> writes: <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Realism maintains that ...</span>__**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"> by its political consequences</span>**__. The value is an optimal foreign policy since nuclear states-craft involves questions concerning interstate interactions and international power relations.
The criterion for the round therefore is maximizing international stability. Abraham Denmark 2010<span style="mso-footnote-id: ftn;">[[#_ftn3|[3]]]</span>: **<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__The international system...__</span>****<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="font-size: 11.5pt;"> through the air.</span>__</span>****<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span>__</span>** Thus my thesis and contention is that nuclear weapons are an optimal way of maintaining this stability. First, rogue states have the technological know-how and support from non-Western nations to acquire nuclear weapons. This is exemplified by the conducted nuclear weapons testing from North Korea and the increasingly more advanced nuclear program in Iran. Next, nuclear weapons optimize the deterrence capabilities of nations because it is the ultimate counter weapon. Jeffrey Record <span style="mso-footnote-id: ftn;">[[#_ftn4|[4]]]</span> explains: The wisdom and necessity ... <span style="font-size: 8pt;"> friends and allies.</span> The zero-sum logic behind nuclear deterrence ensures that even rogue states will not strike; only nuclear weapons have the symbolism and power behind them to make safeguard nations against rogue state action.
