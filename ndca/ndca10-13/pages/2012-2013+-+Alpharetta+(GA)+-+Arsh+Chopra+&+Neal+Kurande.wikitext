===Advantage 1 is the North=== 
Scenario 1 is Russia

Risk of conflict is high.

The geopolitics of the Arctic are stuck in a paradox: The more regional players

The plan~’s reverses this trend – a clear signal is key to avert Arctic war.

One reason a military presence will be necessary is the possibility of accidents caused by

Russia, as it stands could make the largest territorial gain from the Arctic,
AND
Russian export market and fundamentally the Russian itself, may depend on it.

Those go nuclear
**Wallace, 10** (Professor Emeritus at the University of British Columbia, March, "Ridding the Arctic of Nuclear Weapons A Task Long Overdue", http://www.arcticsecurity.org/docs/arctic-nuclear-report-web.pdf)
The fact is, the Arctic is becoming a zone of increased military competition.

geo-political/economic significance of the Arctic because of climate change."

Best scholarship proves our impact

It is no overstatement to say that the end of the Cold War was one

Scenario 2 is Spills

First, drilling is inevitable

For several weeks now the public and the media have cast increasing attention on Arctic
