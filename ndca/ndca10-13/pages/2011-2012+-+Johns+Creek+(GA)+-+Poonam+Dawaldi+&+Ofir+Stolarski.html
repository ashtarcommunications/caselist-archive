‘Freedom’ is a ubiquitous concept, ... the wants of its subjects.<br />
<br />
<strong>This eternal projection of capitalism into the future is a denial of the challenge of historical time- the slogan “there is no alternative” is mindlessly repeated as the “end of history” is declared. This attempt to maintain the eternal present as the ideal of history ignores vast structural inequalities and ongoing genocidal wars, threatening human survival.</strong><br />

<strong>Thus we affirm the utopian possibilities latent in the resolution.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Observation Two: The Dispossessed</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Ursula K. Le Guin’s novel The Dispossessed tells a story of Urras and Anarres, a double planet system. Urras is dominated by a competitive libertarian worldview. The Urrasti are obsessed with status, wealth, and power-- the society has descended into an eternal war of each against all.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Anarres is a barren moon, colonized by those who have been dispossessed by Urrasti society. It is a society without government, founded on principles of mutual aid.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The Dispossessed tells the story of Shevek, a brilliant Anarresti physicist who travels to Urras to develop a General Temporal Theory. Shevek realizes over the course of the novel that both Urrasti and Anarresti society have stagnated because of the walls built up between them.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Terra, Earth-- is also represented in the novel, but only as a dead world spoiled by humanity, now governed by total centralization.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The story is a warning- Terra and Anarres are both possible futures for the United States. Anarres is a not a blueprint for a perfect static utopia, but offers the hope as an ongoing process of freedom and mutuality. However, Anarres cannot come to us- the United States must initiate the journey of exploration on its own.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Stillman 5</strong> [Peter G. Stillman is Professor of Political Science at Vassar College “ The New Utopian Politics of Ursula K. Le Guin’s The Dispossessed” – pg. 68-69, Chetan]<br />
In the face of those difficulties, ... act, and make the attempt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The Dispossessed disrupts the idea of time as a linear progression towards the “end of history”— the story of the past is never finally told and the future is never fully closed.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Only uniting past, present, and future can save either world. The wall built up between the real world of Urras and the utopia of Anarres prevents change in both societies- Anarres loses its connection with past history on Urras, and Urras loses the utopian hope represented by the possible future of Anarres.</strong><br />

The masculine self-identity of pilots has often been understood through an eroticized desire for risk and suffering, or what Law (2002) terms ‘Thrills and spills’ (p. 32). Similarly, McCurdy (1993), quotes one Apollo astronaut as saying, ‘Recognition of risk is what made us as good as we were’ (p. 62), while another states ‘But if it [risk of death] was like, one in one hundred, you would do it, you take it . . . There were so many ways it could happen’ (p. 63). Across such statements astronauts’ fetishized tolerance of risk as a part of the performance of manliness; risk became part of the astronauts’ identity, contributing to what Tom Wolfe's novel (1979) famously referred to as ‘The Right Stuff’. Yet this attitude towards physical and mental subjugation was not mere blind masochism; it was, also predicated upon a set of techniques concerned with the control of bodies wherein the astronauts were rigorously tested to confirm a high degree of corporeal control and calculation over their own bodies and perform tasks in this hostile environment – to maintain control in a situation despite the discomfort and vulnerability and get the job done. Within all these images of the astronaut there exist mutually shaping essentializing associations between masculinity, corporeality, outer space, risk and high-technology that prefigure the identity construction of ‘The Right Stuff’; becoming increasingly evident when challenged with transgressive Other(s), namely female bodies. 6 Such an instance occurred in 1962, when a small group of women successfully passed the some of same physical and psychological tests as the Mercury astronauts, in a privately funded women astronaut study organized by a physiologist called Dr. William Lovelace (see Shayler and Moule, 2003; Weitekamp, 2004). The women now sought NASA's support to become astronauts. ‘Lovelace's Women in Space Project’ (Weitekamp, 2004) or ‘The Mercury 13’ (Ackmann, 2004) de-stabilized many of the iterative bodily performances enacted through NASA that prescribed binary gendered assumptions. 7 The desire of these women to become astronauts and their embodied suitability, transgressed the tacitly masculinist spatio-temporal categorization of different bodies under modernity (Massey, 2005: 93). These bodies offered, in Judith Butler's (1990) terms, a sense of hope ‘in the possibility of a failure to repeat, a de-formity, or a parodic repetition that exposes the phantasmatic effect of abiding identity as a politically tenuous construction’ (p. 192). Just as some homosexual bodily performances may present a particular body in an opposing gender role (see Butler, 1990: 167–170), thus exposing the de-stabilized ‘ground’ of both gendered identities, these astronauts tacitly desired to place a female body in a hegemonically masculine guise. Yet equally, as Butler (1990) makes clear, such transgressions, while sometimes transformative, are frequently accompanied by ‘punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them’ (p. 190). For example, in 1962 Dr. Lovelace sought the Navy's permission to expand his use of their facilities to provide further evidence of the women's suitability. The official reply to the Navy was that ‘NASA does not at this time have a requirement for such a program’ (Weitekamp, 2004: 128). This reply was then made known to Dr. Lovelace and the women involved; it effectively cancelled the nascent woman into space project. Here, the twin spectres of technological determinism and instrumentalism (Feenberg, 1999) are used to conjure up a belief in value-neutral, automatic and unilateral technical decision-making. In turn, this meant that the space programme could be constructed as if it were an inevitable temporal sequence, expressing natural gender roles and bodily practices, and devoid of ethno-political import (Shayler and Moule, 2003). The decision was re-examined in a heated Congressional hearing in July 1962, in which the Lovelace Women, led by Geraldine ‘Jerrie’ Cobb, were cross-examined by Congressmen partly in an attempt to illustrate their technical worth objectively, above and beyond their male peers (Shayler and Moule, 2003, p. 149). The women demonstrated the capacity of their bodies to pass the same flight-tests as men, as well as possessing some important advantages, not least their requirements for less food and oxygen – on account of their smaller size (Penley, 1997: 55). Ultimately, however, the women's transgressive bodily desires were blocked through quasi-judicial significations of risk. Namely, a belief asserted by NASA that astronauts had to be jet test pilots, a profession women were already barred from, because only jet test pilots possessed the necessary experience to undertake high-risk flight experiments. This point appeared already undermined by NASA's own demonstration that spacecraft could fly automatically in outer space (Penley, 1997), combined with the rejection of many skilled test pilots by the astronaut selectors, such as Chuck Yeager. NASA's Chief of Manned Space Flight, George Low, then explained to Congress how NASA support for the women-in-space project would set his work back, despite the fact that Lovelace had requested the very limited use of Navy not NASA facilities (Ackmann, 2004: 166). More implicitly, it appears the decision revolved around a belief that women were excluded from becoming jet test pilots (or astronauts) because it was deemed too risky (Weitekamp, 2004: 149). In this case, a masculinized relationship between technology and risk within American modernity proved intractable; accordingly men were able to dictate thresholds of female risk. As Weitekamp (2004) explains, the male construction of female risk prevalent in NASA was two-fold: on the one hand, NASA seemed reluctant to subject women to degrees of risk because ‘the prospect of subjecting a woman to mortal danger betrayed the rigidly defined gendered roles asserted in post-war America’ (p. 3). On the other hand, this paternalist designation of women as needing protecting might itself lead the public to conclude that if women flew in spacecraft then the craft themselves might be deemed too straightforward and safe. Thus as Weitekamp (2004) puts it, if ‘a woman could perform those tasks [it] would diminish their prestige’ (p. 3). The appropriation within NASA of risk as the legitimate means by which to exclude women from outer space appears only strengthened through its seemingly contradictory blending of different masculine identities. In this case, risk is alternately, and seemingly paradoxically, constructed as both a cipher for the rational management of hazards and the manly celebration of danger. Here the capacity to render masculinity fractionally coherent (Law, 2002) renders it more, not less, persistent in justifying patriarchal norms. The Mercury astronaut John Glenn, who had just returned back to Earth to a ticker-tape parade after being the first American to orbit the Earth, summarized his verdict in a final statement within the hearing: I think this gets back to the way our social order is organized really. It is just a fact. The men go off and fight the wars and fly airplanes and come back and help design and build and test them. The fact that women are not in this field is a fact of our social order. It may be undesirable (quoted in Weitekamp, 2004: 151). While Glenn's reference to ‘undesirable’ may be telling of shifting attitudes towards women, he nevertheless asserts that there is something inherently masculine about these interactions between bodies, risk and technology, so that only particular bodies were deemed not just more desirable but almost factually suitable. After the hearing, female astronauts were frequently the subject of further derision, often evoking the ‘heterosexual matrix’ of submissive female sexuality, as Wernher von Braun demonstrated in a speech given at Mississippi State College (19 Nov. 1962): Well, all I can say is that the male astronauts are all for it. And as my best friend Bob Gilruth [director of Johnston Space Center of manned spaceflight] says, we're reserving 110 pounds of payload for recreational equipment (from Parade Magazine Sunday Supplement, December 1962 – quoted in Kevles, 2003: 4).<br />

It is important to note that while normative gendered binaries continue to be performed within NASA into the 21st century (even in the accounts of women previously suffering from such narrow identity prescriptions), the enduring passion and skill with which many women invested themselves in spaceflight subverts many gender essentialisms, not least the premise that womanly and manly desires can only be understood through a neat heterosexual matrix of oppositions (Butler, 1990). Indeed, as Butler (2004) suggests, it is inaccurate to equate any measure of institutional identity with either strictly masculine or feminine identities, values or behaviours. Rather we should describe the ongoing dis/organization of normative gender practices and foreground those moments – as Carolyn Huntoon’s account might example – when the easy mapping of concepts of gender and sexual difference onto organizational and technical efficacy becomes problematic. The next section develops this line of thinking about transgressive desires and bodily competences by attending to a set of bodies that offered potentialities to throw into relief perhaps one of the most popularly understood ‘masculine’ technical environments: the spacecraft.<br />

Humans, suggests Crawford, 'bring speed, agility, versatility and intelligence to exploration in a way that robots cannot', justifying to many the employment of astronauts as 'field scientists' on other planets (Crawford 2005: 252). The consistent discursive articulation of outer space as a frontier, a 'threshold' for human intervention requiring the utmost in human performance, depends on a regulatory framework wherein 'humanity' is able consistently and without obstacle (material, psychological or otherwise) to seize the challenge of exploiting and controlling its natural environment and resources. Rarely conceived of purely in technological, aphysical terms, Space is a politics (in US discourse) entirely constituted in reference to the corporeal attributes of the (neo-liberally) human. Within the heteronormative, heterosexual, regulatory framework of US outer space discourse, the ideal, space-able, individual is constructed and reproduced within an unspoken but unequivocal heteronormative framework of reproductive sexuality, as a model that others should approximate: a person, evolved of heterosexual binaries, who is reactive but calm, reproductive but sexually restrained, agile but not hyperactive, versatile but not sexually ambiguous, rational but not mechanical, adventurous but competent (see, e. g. Seguin 2005). Located within a 'masculine context', such a framework has only solidified the sense of male bodies existing as the norm against which female bodies are evaluated, and male physiology the standard by which female bodies are judged (Casper and Moore 1995: 316-319). This regulatory masculinism has undoubtedly resulted in the overwhelming dominance of male astronauts in space. Although the first American female went into space in 1983, in 2001 of an active astronaut corps of 158, only thirty-five were women (NASA 2001), and of the 2004 class of astronauts, only two of eleven were female (NASA 2004). But the predominance of male astronauts also stems from the gendered nature of space discourse itself. The quest to conquer space that began with the Cold War 'space race' has long been coded (heterosexually) masculine, dependent on an articulation of masculine prowess realized through gendered assumptions of physical and technical expertise, strength, endurance and intelligence. The portrayal of the earliest astronauts as popular heroes in the US media, and beyond (Bush, for example, pays homage, in 2004, to two of the 'veterans' of the space age, Tom Delay and Senator Bill Nelson), sedimented an image of masculine achievement that, although highly contingent on the militarized aggressivity of Cold War discourse at that time, has proved enduring. Armstrong's famous announcement that the Apollo 11 Moon landing was 'one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind' thus in this instance speaks more specifically than universally, a continuation of the Western history's overarching belief in men's 'natural' ability, indeed prerogative, to conquer for the good of everyone.<br />

NASA, as a total institution, demands that astronauts subscribe to certain rules and discursive dictums. Even though these rules may be linked to critical issues concerning their survival, they are developed within a highly ideological milieu. NASA both exists as part of a broader social domain in which there are enduring beliefs concerning sexuality and also produces particular belief systems about sexuality. In addition, NASA as an institution exerts a great deal of control over what activities can be considered and pursued in the space environment, particularly in the &quot;closed&quot; space of a shuttle. What is witnessed in NASA's management of media attention is an effort to maintain ideological control over definitions of human sexuality; these definitions will precede us into the future . In short, privacy discourses used to divert continuing discussions of sexual desires and practices in space maintain a belief in the private, secret, and off-limits nature of human sexuality.<br />

From at least the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, scenarios of same-sex desire would seem to have had a privileged, though by no means an exclusive, relation in Western culture to scenarios of both genocide and omnicide. That sodomy, the name by which homosexual acts are known even today to the law of half of the United States and to the Supreme Court of all of them, should already be inscribed with the name of a site of mass extermination is the appropriate trace of a double history. In the first place there is a history of the mortal suppression, legal or subjudicial, of gay acts and gay people, through burning, hounding, physical and chemical castration, concentration camps, bashing—the array of sanctioned fatalities that Louis Crompton records under the name of gay genocide, and whose supposed eugenic motive becomes only the more colorable with the emergence of a distinct, naturalized minority identity in the nineteenth century. In the second place, though, there is the inveterate topos of associating gay acts or persons with fatalities vastly broader than their own extent: if it is ambiguous whether every denizen of the obliterated Sodom was a sodomite, clearly not every Roman of the late Empire can have been so, despite Gibbon's connecting the eclipse of the whole people to the habits of a few. Following both Gibbon and the Bible, moreover, with an impetus borrowed from Darwin, one of the few areas of agreement among modern Marxist, Nazi, and liberal capitalist ideologies is that there is a peculiarly close, though never precisely defined, affinity between same-sex desire and some historical condition of moribundity, called &quot;decadence,&quot; to which not individuals or minorities but whole civilizations are subject. Bloodletting on a scale more massive by orders of magnitude than any gay minority presence in the culture is the &quot;cure,&quot; if cure there be, to the mortal illness of decadence. If a fantasy trajectory, utopian in its own terms, toward gay genocide has been endemic in Western culture from its origins, then, it may also have been true that the trajectory toward gay genocide was never clearly distinguishable from a broader, apocalyptic trajectory toward something approaching omnicide. The deadlock of the past century between minoritizing and universalizing understandings of homo/heterosexual definition can only have deepened this fatal bond in the heterosexist imaginaire. In our culture as in Billy Budd, the phobic narrative trajectory toward imagining a time after the homosexual is finally inseparable from that toward imagining a time after the human; in the wake of the homosexual, the wake incessantly produced since first there were homosexuals, every human relation is pulled into its shining representational furrow. Fragments of visions of a time after the homosexual are, of course, currently in dizzying circulation in our culture. One of the many dangerous ways that AIDS discourse seems to ratify and amplify preinscribed homophobic mythologies is in its pseudo-evolutionary presentation of male homosexuality as a stage doomed to extinction (read, a phase the species is going through) on the enormous scale of whole populations. 26 The lineaments of openly genocidal malice behind this fantasy appear only occasionally in the respectable media, though they can be glimpsed even there behind the poker-face mask of our national experiment in laissez-faire medicine. A better, if still deodorized, whiff of that malice comes from the famous pronouncement of Pat Robertson: &quot;AIDS is God's way of weeding his garden.&quot; The saccharine luster this dictum gives to its vision of devastation, and the ruthless prurience with which it misattributes its own agency, cover a more fundamental contradiction: that, to rationalize complacent glee at a spectacle of what is imagined as genocide, a proto-Darwinian process of natural selection is being invoked—in the context of a Christian fundamentalism that is not only antievolutionist but recklessly oriented toward universal apocalypse. A similar phenomenon, also too terrible to be noted as a mere irony, is how evenly our culture's phobia about HIV-positive blood is kept pace with by its rage for keeping that dangerous blood in broad, continuous circulation. This is evidenced in projects for universal testing, and in the needle-sharing implicit in William Buckley's now ineradicable fantasy of tattooing HIV-positive persons. But most immediately and pervasively it is evidenced in the literal bloodbaths that seem to make the point of the AIDS-related resurgence in violent bashings of gays--which, unlike the gun violence otherwise ubiquitous in this culture, are characteristically done with two-by-fours, baseball bats, and fists, in the most literal-minded conceivable form of body-fluid contact. It might be worth making explicit that the use of evolutionary thinking in the current wave of utopian/genocidal fantasy is, whatever else it may be, crazy. Unless one believes, first of all, that same-sex object-choice across history and across cultures is one thing with one cause, and, second, that its one cause is direct transmission through a nonrecessive genetic path--which would be, to put it gently, counter-intuitive--there is no warrant for imagining that gay populations, even of men, in post-AIDS generations will be in the slightest degree diminished. Exactly to the degree that AIDS is a gay disease, it's a tragedy confined to our generation; the long-term demographic depredations of the disease will fall, to the contrary, on groups, many themselves direly endangered, that are reproduced by direct heterosexual transmission. Unlike genocide directed against Jews, Native Americans, Africans, or other groups, then, gay genocide, the once-and-for-all eradication of gay populations, however potent and sustained as a project or fantasy of modern Western culture, is not possible short of the eradication of the whole human species. The impulse of the species toward its own eradication must not either, however, be underestimated. Neither must the profundity with which that omnicidal impulse is entangled with the modern problematic of the homosexual: the double bind of definition between the homosexual, say, as a distinct risk group, and the homosexual as a potential of representation within the universal. 27 As gay community and the solidarity and visibility of gays as a minority population are being consolidated and tempered in the forge of this specularized terror and suffering, how can it fail to be all the more necessary that the avenues of recognition, desire, and thought between minority potentials and<br />

Popular portrayals of American spaceflight regularly propose that the history of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration epitomizes the masculinist organization of American post-WWII modernity. Films such as Philip Kaufman’s The Right Stuff (and earlier book), or Ron Howard’s Apollo 13 (see Llinares, this volume), seemingly correlate the success of NASA, and by extension America and/or humanity, around the fortunes of strong, stoical, active and resourceful men. Meanwhile, women, such as the astronauts’ wives, seemingly feature as rather passive, marginalized and abjected. Manly bodies are shown here capable of ‘risk taking’, ‘frontier exploration’, ‘technical decision making’, ‘competition’ and ‘attention to detail’, all qualities which Connell (1995) suggested typified ‘hegemonic’ masculinities and legitimated patriarchies. Popular examples of NASA’s articulation of masculinist social power are complemented by various scholarly accounts explaining how NASA has historically subjugated women (Ackmann, 2004; Kevles, 2003; Moule and Shayler, 2003; Penley, 1997; Weitekamp, 2004). This chapter takes the underlying claim found within such studies – NASA articulated a gendered binary – as its starting point. Rather than foregrounding the stories of women in NASA as a revisionist counterpoint, as many of these studies have, I will go further and critically assess the disorganization of underlying binary oppositions which often frames explanations of the relationship between NASA and gender. Focusing on the activities of NASA, particularly during the Apollo era, I draw upon Butler’s (1990, 2004) work on the performed aspects of gender and identity, to question whether and how NASA as an organization is complicit with the rehearsal of gendered identities through polarized binaries that align ‘masculine’/‘feminine’ with ‘male’/‘female’? Butler’s work provides a particularly apposite starting point to address this question, as will now be elaborated prior to the empirical discussion. Gender as performance In contrast to a diverse group of feminist theorists, including Simone de Beauvoir, Kate Millett, Marilyn Frye or Barbara Duden, Butler rejects the idea that feminist epistemology and politics should or can differentiate a priori between identities, experiences, values or behaviours based on sexual difference (see Butler, 2004: 210–213). 2 Her critique of the universalism associated with feminist theory echoes some other scholars, including Julia Kristeva, Helene Cixous and Luce Irigaray. Butler (1990), however, goes further than multiplying the category ‘Woman’, and questions how gender/sexual differences are performed thorough a ‘heterosexual matrix’: ‘The heterosexualization of desire requires and institutes the production of discrete and asymmetrical oppositions between “feminine” and “masculine” where these are understood as excessive attributes of “male” and “female”. ’ (p. 24). She continues: ‘. . . one is one’s gender to the extent that one is not the other gender, a formulation that presupposes and enforces the restriction of gender within the binary pair’ (p. 30). Consequently, if gender is produced through binary oppositions then, for Butler, the ‘us’/‘them’ of ‘masculine’/‘feminine’ becomes unintelligible outside of these discursive practices and desires. As Butler (1990) puts it, ‘There is no gender identity behind the expression of gender, that identity is performatively constituted by the very “expressions” that are said to be its results’ (p. 41). Seven astronauts and their wives (see Figures 1 and 2). 4 Here the physical contrasts between the astronauts and their wives (clothing, hair-length, jewelry and make-up) are aligned with discursive binaries between men and women as public/personal actors. For example, the men are described as part of an ‘epochal mission’, seemingly conjuring up images of extensive heroism, while the focus on the wives’ ‘inner thoughts and worries’ returns us to ostensibly more ‘feminine’ interests. 5 Similar gendered contrasts are articulated in the The Right Stuff film adaptation of Tom Wolfe’s same-titled novel. In one scene, for example, the wives of prospective astronaut test-pilots sit indoors describing Importantly, Butler explains we should not abandon interest in the normative expressions of male/female binaries per se, rather we must be careful to view such ‘choices’ as repeated stylized acts regulated by regimes of truth (or discourses) and operationalized within institutions from the welfare state, modern medicine and perhaps also spaceflight, not part of any natural order of things (compare with Holmes, 2007; Parker, 2002). ‘To conflate the definition of gender with its normative expression is inadvertently to reconsolidate the power of the norm to constrain the definition of gender’ (Butler, 2004: 42). And so, while ‘Gender is the mechanism by which notions of masculine and feminine are produced and naturalized . . . gender may very well be the apparatus by which such terms are deconstructed and denaturalized’ (Butler, 2004: 42). Crucially for Butler, the contingency and transformability of gendering binaries becomes most evident in those situations when we feel unsure of the authenticity of a gender act, hence ‘Gender Trouble’ (Butler, 1990). Butler’s work has been of particular relevance to studies of transgender and homosexual cultures that accentuate the phantasmic construction of gender, by separating gender and biological sex, and thus challenging dominant regimes of truth around gender (see Parker, 2002: 152). Yet Butler (2004) argues that all gendered identities can be witnessed as phantasmic, because these ‘abstract norms’ always ‘exceed the lives they make – and break’ (p. 56). Butler’s passion for the mutability of authentic/fictional gender acts bleeds into her broader political strategy (Parker, 2002) as she seeks to concurrently describe and challenge the disciplining of modern beings through powerful regimes of truth and afford us more creativity to become (Butler, 2004: 175). Her celebration of transgression is, however, more than simply a multiplication of gendered identities; indeed as she explains, via Foucault’s understanding of power, transgression from a norm can equally help refine the disciplinary techniques by which any norm is produced (Butler, 2004: 52). There are resonances here with Law’s (2002) concept of fractional coherence that illustrates how postmodern reverence for multiplicity to resist modernist singularity – the modus operandi of much work on gender – often unhelpfully simplifies the nuanced practices through which gendered subjects are de/constructed. Arguably, the American space programme, especially during and before the Apollo-era, perhaps presents a rather strange association with Butler’s thesis – ostensibly it is permeated with repetitive gender acts where ‘authentically’ masculine men are opposed to feminine women, and has become somewhat of a leitmotif for the gendering of American modernity (Penley, 1997; Weitekamp, 2004). In many respects, however, such labelling only fuels the intellectual and political exigency for a more nuanced interrogation of some of the historical gendering practices surrounding space flight. Butler’s approach provides a useful frame in which a historical, largely text-based, analysis of gender can mitigate a tendency to assume a priori the coherence of essentialist gender roles. My decision to focus here primarily upon encounters between women and NASA develops Butler’s (1990) position that the category ‘woman’ articulates a conceptual fracturing of subjectivity – a fluid becoming not a fixed being (Grosz, 1994): women, as Butler (2004: 204–229) describes, are historically both inside and outside a politics based on group-recognition and representation. 3 Encounters between women and NASA can simultaneously expose and transform normative gender practices, disclosing the phantasmagoric de/construction of femininities and masculinities. Having introduced this performative approach, I will now turn towards three genderings within and surrounding NASA: (i) astronauts’ wives, (ii) women working within NASA and (iii) female astronauts.<br />

Lawrence D. Kritzman,prof of French and Comparative Lit @ Dartmouth, “Practicing Criticism”, Foucault: Politics, Philosophy, Culture, 1988. pgs 154-156<br />
FOUCAULT: First I’ll answer the point about “that criticism leads to nothing. ” There are hundreds and thousands of people who have worked for the emergence of a number of problems that are now on the agenda. To say that this work produced nothing is quite wrong. Do you think that twenty years ago people were considering the problems of the relationship between mental illness and psychological normality, the problem of prison, the problem of medical power, the problem of the relationship between the sexes, and so on, as they are doing today?Furthermore, there are no reforms as such. Reforms are not produced in the air, independently of those who carry them out. One cannot not take account of those who will have the job carrying out this transformation. And, then, above al, I believe that an opposition can be made between critique and transformation, “ideal” critique and “real” transformation. A critique is not a matter of saying that things are not right as they are. It Is a matter of pointing out on what kinds of assumptions, what kinds of familier, unchallenged, unconsidered modes of thought the practices that we accept rest. We must free ourselves from the sacrilization of the social as the only reality and stop regarding as superfluous something so essential in human life and in human relations as thought. Thought exists independently of systems and structures of discourse. It is something that is often hidden, but which always animates everyday behavior. There is always a little thought even in the most stupid institutions, there is always thought even in silent habits. Criticism is a matter of flushing out that thought and trying to change it: to show things are not as self-evident as one believed, to see that what is accepted as self-evident will no longer be accepted as such. Practicing criticism is a matter of making facile gestures difficult. In these circumstances, criticism (and radical criticism) is absolutely indispensable for any transformation. A transformation that remains within the same mode of thought, a transformation that is only a way of adjusting the same thought more closely to the reality of things can merely be a superficial transformation. On the other hand, as soon as one can no longer think things as one formerly thought them, transformation becomes both very urgent, very difficult, and quite possible. It is not therefore a question of there being a time for criticism and a time for transformation, nor people who do the criticism and others who do the transforming, those who are enclosed in an inaccessible radicalism and those who are forced to make the necessary concessions to reality. In fact I think the work of deep transformation can only be carried out in a free atmosphere, one constantly agitated by a permanent criticism. D. E. : But do you think the intellectual must have a programmatic role in this transformation? FOUCAULT: A reform is never only the result of a process in which there is conflict, confrontation, struggle, resistance…To say to oneself at the outset: what reform will I be able to carry out? That is not, I believe, an aim for the intellectual to pursue. His role, since he works specifically in the realm of thought, is to see how far the liberation of thought can make those transformations urgent enough for people to want to carry them out and difficult enough to carry out for them to be profoundly rooted in reality. It is a question of making conflicts more visible, of making them more essential than mere confrontations of interests or institutional immobility. Out of these conflicts, these confrontations, a new power relation must emerge, whose first, temporary expression will be a reform. If at the base there has not been the work of thought upon itself and if, in fact, modes of thought, that is to say modes of action, have not been altered, whatever the project for reform, we know that it will be swamped, digested by modes of behavior and institutions that will always be the same.<br />

While Foucault's genealogy of biopower is neither normative nor normatively neutral — to be either would result in being absorbed by normalizing power in the way that an analysis of power as repressive is absorbed — this does not mean that the analysis is not liberating. In revealing the way biopower operates in our practice, genealogy liberates not by releasing an autonomous self from repression nor through progress toward the achievement of the self as a goal. Instead it opens up the limit — that is, it prevents the closure of normalizing power, freeing us to create ourselves in our autonomy. ^ For Foucault. maturity is our permanent self-creation and liberation is the Nietzschean realization that everything is possible. This sense of maturity as our self-creation — which connects Foucault to Baudelaire's notion of the dandy — suggests an understanding of the achievement of our maturity that is not grounded in the humanist notion of man as an autonomous subject. This is apparently the theme of Foucault's last work in the series on sexuality — a project that was reshaped by his interest in the Greek concern with the techniques of self-care and self-mastery. In an interview with Dreyfus and Rabinow about this work, Foucault discussed the similarity between the problem we face in elaborating a basis for conduct and that faced by the Greeks. &quot;Recent liberation movements suffer from the fact that they cannot find any principle on which to base the elaboration of ethics. They need an ethics, but they cannot find any other ethics than an ethics founded on so-called scientific knowledge of what the self is, what desire is, what the unconscious is, and so on. &quot;30 What his work on the Greeks revealed was a response to a similar problem which did not turn on constituting the self as an autonomous subject and did not contribute to totalization and normalization. Though he is clear in the interview that he in no way proposed the Greek concern with mastery of self as an alternative to our current plight, it is also clear that he saw something preferable in it: &quot;I don't think one can find any normalization in, for instance, the Stoic ethics. The reason is, I think, that the principal aim, the principal target of this kind of ethics was an aesthetic one&quot;(230). In a similar way, the permanent critique of ourselves as a limit-attitude and a transgression of the limits opens up our possibility to will to live a beautiful life.<br />

In mankind's long march through time, females have had, until recently, the disadvantage of being the &quot;weaker sex&quot; in various hostile environments. Now with the space age, the tables are turned. Women have unquestionable physical advantages over men as astronauts, particularly for very prolonged space missions (2). This is not an altruistic plea for equal rights for women, but a brief analysis, as I see it, of the facts.<br />
Strength and endurance are no longer criteria for superiority, as in the distant past. The male's protective advantage for survival on Earth, provided by greater bursts of adrenaline for &quot;fight-flight&quot; is no longer a necessity; in space indeed it is a decided disadvantage. The delicate lining of the blood vessels is particularly vulnerable to injury in the young male. How else can one explain the six fold increased incidence of coronary artery disease of males compared to females in the third and fourth decade, or the rarity of cardiovascular death of a premenopausal woman (1)? With weightlessness (microgravity) and limited physical activity on a space mission, there is an invariable loss of vital magnesium because its storage sites in the bone and skeletal muscle are invariably depleted (2,3) no matter how much an astronaut exercises. This loss of magnesium triggers the release of adrenaline which in turn causes a further reduction in the availability of magnesium, resulting in a persistent vicious cycle. Too much or too little exercise will only aggravate this vicious cycle and it can begin with only a 12-day mission, as for example on Apollo 15 (3), or persist for an anticipated duration of two to three years round trip to Mars (2).<br />
This potential vicious cycle can cause spasm of blood vessels, clots, serious heart rhythm disturbances, and because of impairment in the repair process, permanent heart muscle injury (2,3).<br />
Young female astronauts would have a decided advantage over their male counterparts, since young females retain magnesium better than young males (4,5) and, as a result, there is less risk of instigating a space-related vicious cycle. Furthermore, because young females have potentially higher magnesium, not only would their repair mechanism be superior to males, but they would have greater antioxidant protection (2).<br />
Of course estrogens would play a vital role as well, in enhancing these female attributes, through numerous vascular mechanisms, but oral contraceptives must be withheld since their excessive estrogen content might incite clotting (5). We can't have it both ways; males are trapped with inferior genes for space travel, whereas their superior genes for survival long ago served to protect the family units. Our genes have probably changed very little in the past 50,000 years. We could alter them by genetic engineering, decades if not centuries from now. But for the present, we must be willing to adapt, if we are to succeed in the topsy-turvy environment of space.<br />
On long space missions, since there is invariably a potential for a significant magnesium deficiency (2)—with, in turn, the potential for multiple adverse cardiovascular consequences (6)—shouldn't we profit by the gender difference in magnesium retention, in the selection of astronauts?<br />

China no longer needs to import foreign technology and expertise. Moreover, many of the scientists and engineers in China’s space sector believe they make more rapid progress by pursuing a policy of self-reliance without the complications of joint programs. As a result, a significant number within China’s space community actively oppose increased international cooperation or is disinclined to support it. In addition, many in China’s space community resent U. S. policies, such as China’s exclusion from the International Space Station, export controls that have severely restricted China’s ability to participate in the international launch services market, and highly restrictive visa policies for Chinese space professionals. China’s space scientists and engineers are content with the status quo. Any impetus for change will need to come from outside the space sector. Unlike in the past, cooperation with the United States or other countries is no longer valued as a technical or economic necessity. Today, cooperation with other countries in space is likely to take place for political reasons. It will need to be imposed on China’s space sector by the political leadership, and this can only happen if Chinese leaders see cooperation as a high priority.<br />

Many arms-control specialists believe that China’s counterspace programs are driven primarily by its desire to accumulate bargaining chips that could be traded for an eventual ban on space weapons. In reality, however, Beijing’s investments in space denial technology are driven by strategic concerns that have little to do with arms-limitation agreements of any kind. In the near term, China is heavily focused on developing all possible means of defeating the superior U. S. conventional forces it expects to encounter in any war over Taiwan. And over the longer term, China is seeking to prepare for a prospective geopolitical rivalry with the United States. To achieve these goals, China must be able to exercise sufficient control over its land and sea borders to prevent U. S. forces from mounting attacks on the Chinese heartland from them. It must also be able to protect its nuclear deterrent from being neutralized by U. S. theater and national missile defenses. And it must be able to construct a sufficiently secure regional system within which it can shape the political choices of its major neighbors and prevent any local adversaries from challenging it under the cover of American protection. The near-term objective of preventing what Beijing would call Taiwanese secession from the mainland—and defeating any U. S. expeditionary forces that may be committed in support—remains the dominant consideration for China’s military modernization. The resulting capabilities would then become the nucleus for servicing more ambitious geostrategic aims as the country’s economic strength increases over time. For the moment, both objectives converge admirably in that they require Beijing to develop all the capabilities required to prevent superior U. S. forces from being able to enter the relevant theater of operations and, if that goal should prove unsuccessful, deny them the freedom to operate. Whether the theater of action is the limited geographic area around Taiwan or a wider expanse like the western Pacific, the tasks facing the Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) therefore remain the same in the short to medium terms: It must be able to successfully prosecute antiaccess and battle-spacedenial operations against all threatening American military forces. Because China is confronted by America’s formidable military dominance, any effort to defeat the United States through an orthodox force-on-force encounter would be doomed to a sorry ending. Consequently, ever since the dramatic demonstration of American prowess in Operation Desert Storm, Chinese strategists have struggled to find ways of overcoming the conventional might of the United States. Drawing on both China’s indigenous military traditions—which emphasize stealth, deception, and indirect approaches to warfare—and the opportunities offered by emerging technologies—which permit effective asymmetric strategies focused on attacking an adversary’s weaknesses rather than its strengths—the PLA has concentrated on developing those material and nonmaterial capabilities that would make possible “defeating the superior with the inferior. ”<br />

Butler and Scott, p. 14-15<br />
The above sketches in part a Foucaultian reinscription of the subject, an effort to resignify the subject as a site of resignification. As a result, it is not a &quot;bidding farewell&quot; to the subject per se, but, rather, a call to rework that notion outside the terms of an epistemological given. But perhaps Foucault is not really postmodern; after all, his is an analytics of modern power. There is, of course, talk about the death of the subject, but which subject is that? And what is the status of the utterance that announces its passing? What speaks now that the subject is dead? That there is a speaking seems clear, for how else could the utterance be heard? So clearly, the death of that subject is not the end of agency, of speech, or of political debate. There is the refrain that, just now, when women are beginning to assume the place of subiects. postmodem positions come along to announce that the subiect is dead (there is a difference between positions of poststructuralism which claim that the subject never existed, and postmodem positions which claim that the subject once had integrity, but no longer does). Some see this as a conspiracv against women and other disenfranchised mouus who are now only beginning to speak on their own behalf. But what precisely is meant by this, and how do we account for the very strong criticisms of the subject as an instrument of Westem imperialist hegemony theorized by Gloria Anzaidua, Gayatri Spivak and various theorists of postcoloniality? Surely there is a caution offered here, that in the very struggle toward enfranchisement and democratization, we might adopt the very models of domination by which we were oppressed, not realizing that one was that domination works is through the realation and production of subjects. Through what exclusions has the feminist subiect been constructed, and how do those excluded domains return to haunt the &quot;integrity&quot; and &quot;unity&quot; of the feminist &quot;we&quot;? And how is it that the very category, the subiect. the &quot;we. &quot; that is supposed to be presumed for the purpose of solidarity, produces the very factionalization it is supposed to quell? Do women want to become subiects on the model which requires and produces an anterior region of abiection or must feminism become a process which is self-critical about the processes that produce and destabilize identity categories? To take the construction of the subiect as a political problematic is not the same as doing away with the subiect; to deconstruct the subiect is not to negate or throw away the concept: on the contrary, deconstruction implied onlv that we suspend all commitments to that to which the term. &quot;the subiect,&quot; refers, and that we consider the linguistic functions it serves in the consolidation and concealment of authority. To deconstruct is not to negate or to dismiss. but to call into question and, perhaps most importantly, to open up a term, like the subject, to a reusage or redeployment that previously has not been authorized.<br />

 <strong>Only the perm can possibly work – their depiction of capitalism as a monolithic structure, using queer theory to study capitalism is the most effective way to open up space for resistance</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gibson-Graham 99 </span></strong><br />
J. K. Prof @ U Mass Amherst, Queer(y)ing Capitalism in and out of the Classroom,<br />
Recently I attended a conference on globalisation and global regulation which was organised by some left social scientists at a university in the US. One thing I noticed in many of the contributions was the way in which everything was centred on or by capitalism, almost by default. Regulation was seen as focused upon capitalism and ultimately became part of a capitalist formation. Non-capitalist social sites (including the household and the state) were involved in the reproduction of capitalism, perhaps in new forms. Even opposition was situated within capitalism, de® ned and ultimately coopted by it. Over the course of the conference, what was incrementally produced was an image of a unified and univocal social space, the sort of thing that is called a `capitalist society’Ð or in this case a `global capitalist economy’ or just `global capitalism’ . It was clear to me that the researchers at the conference were disinclined to explore disharmony, incoherence and contradiction where capitalism was concerned. Yet all of us found the picture we had generated demoralising and depressing. This brought to mind what queer theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick has called the `Christmas effect’ . To Sedgwick’ s mind what is so depressing about Christmas is the way all the institutions of society come together and speak ª with one voiceº (1993, p. 5): the Christian churches, of course, but also the state (which establishes school and national holidays), commerce, advertising, the media (revving up the Christmas frenzy and barking out the Christmas countdown), social events and domestic activities, ª they all¼ line up with each other so neatly once a year, and the monolith so created is a thing one can come to view with unhappy eyesº (p. 6). Sedgwick points to a similar monolithic formation in the realm of expectations about sexuality where your biological sex, self-perceived gender, personality and appearance, the sex and gender of your sexual object (supposed to be not yourself and not the same as yourself), your sexual practices (including the privileging of certain organs and ori® ces associated with reproduction, or with insertion and reception), your sexual fantasies, and your principal emotional bonds and domestic arrangements are all expected to come together in predictable associations (Sedgwick, 1993, p. 7). Breaking apart these associations is the theoretical job of `queering’ sexuality and its representations. What I am cha® ng against, productively I hope, is a similar Christmas effect in social research and in the classroom, where things tend to line up with each other and speak with one voice (the univocality of a dominant or hegemonic formation). Just as the family is often claimed by heterosexuality (and a heterosexual family is presumed), so society is often claimed by capitalism. Images of a capitalist society are produced, including a capitalist state, a capitalist economy, capitalist reproduction, and subjective identitie s as workers and consumers in a capitalist social space. But Sedgwick’ s questions about Christmas, the family and sexuality suggest the possibility of other kinds of social representations: ªWhat if¼ there were a practice of valuing the ways in which meanings and institutions can be at loose ends with each other? What if the richest junctures weren’ t the ones where everything means the same thing?º (p. 6). More generally, Sedgwick’ s vision calls into question the project of representing societies and economies as hegemonic formations. What if we were to depict social existence at loose ends with itself, in Sedgwick’ s terms, rather than producing social representations in which everything is part of the same complex and, therefore, ultimately ª means the same thingº (e. g. capitalist hegemony)? What might be the advantages of representing a rich and proli® c disarray? I am particularly attuned to these problems and possibilities because I was myself a producer, in my earlier work as a teacher and researcher, of representations of capitalist hegemony. As a member of a large and loosely connected group of political economists who were interested in what had happened to capitalist economies following on the economic crisis of the 1970s, I had engaged in theorising and teaching about the ways in which industrial production, enterprises, forms of consumption, state regulation, business culture, and the realm of ideas and politics all seemed to undergo a change in the 1970s and 1980s from one hegemonic con® guration to another. It did not matter that I was very interested in the differences between industries or that I did not see industrial changeÐ even widespread changeÐ as emanating from or re¯ ecting a macrologic of `the economy’ . I was still representing a world in which economy, polity, culture and subjectivity reinforced each other and wore a capitalist face. Chasing the illusion that I was understanding the world in order to change it, I was running in a well-worn track, and had only to cast a glance over my shoulder to see, as the product of my analysis, `capitalist society’ even more substantial and de® nitive than when I began. In those exciting early days I had yet to take seriously the `performativity’ of social representationsÐ in other words, the ways in which they are implicated in the worlds they ostensibly represent. I was still trying to capture `what was happening out there’ , like the researchers at the conference. Students were drawn to the certainty and urgency of tracing the `emergence of global capitalism’ in particular industrial sectors and regions, and the classroom became a site where the new world order was critically `pinned down’ . At that point I was not thinking about the social representation my students and I were creating as constitutive of the world in which we would have to live. Yet the image of global capitalism that we were producing was actively participating in consolidating a new phase of capitalist hegemony [3]. Through my pedagogy and other forms of communication, I was representing an entity called the `global capitalist economy’ , and that representation was becoming common sense to a generation of students and activists. Over a period of years this became increasingly clear to me and increasingly distressing. My situation resembled that of the many other teachers and social theorists for whom the `object of critique’ has become a perennial and consequential theoretical issue. When theorists depict patriarchy, or racism, or compulsory heterosexuality, or capitalist hegemony they are not only delineating a formation they hope to see destabilised or replaced. They are also generating a representation of the social world and endowing it with performative force. To the extent that this representation becomes influential it may contribute to the hegemony of a `hegemonic formation’ ; and it will undoubtedly in¯ uence students, and other people’ s ideas about the possibilities of difference and change, including the potential for successful political interventions. In the classroom the excitement of `identifying’ global capitalism was increasingly tempered by the seeming futility of any form of resistance to it, and some students became exasperated and disillusioned by the project. A feeling of hopelessness is perhaps the most extreme and at the same time most familiar political sentiment in the face of a massive or monolithic patriarchy, racism, or capitalism. Perhaps it is partly for this reason that many social theorists have taken to theorising a hegemonic formation in the field of discourse (heteronormativity, for instance, or a binary gender hierarchy) while representing the social field as unruly and diverse [4]. A good example can be found in Sedgwick’ s opening chapter to Epistemology of the Closet where she counterposes to a heteronormative discourse of sexuality the `obviousness’ [5] of the great and existing diversity of people’ s relations to sex. In a simila r fashion, bell hooks (1992) sets a dominant phallocentric discourse of black masculinity (and black racial identity) against the diverse social ® eld of black masculinities and gender relations [6]. Like many political economists I had heretofore theorised the US social formation and `the global economy’ as sites of capitalist dominance, a dominance located squarely in the social (or economic) ® eld. But a theoretical and pedagogical option now presented itself, one that could make a powerful difference: to depict economic discourse as hegemonised while rendering the social world as economically differentiated and complex. It is possible, I realised, and potentially productive to understand capitalist hegemony as a (dominant) discourse rather than as a social articulation or structure. Thus, one might represent economic practice as comprising a rich diversity of capitalist and non-capitalist activities and argue that the non-capitalist ones had until now been relatively `invisible’ because the concepts and discourses that could make them `visible’ have themselves been marginalised and suppressed. In this project of discursive destabilisation, the first task is to undermine familiar representations of capitalism as the hegemonic form of economy, as necessarily and naturally dominant. This opens up a space for alternative economic representations, ones in which non-capitalist economic practices are visible and proli® c, and not necessarily subsumed to capitalist dominance. With students it is interesting to explore their own engagement in non-capitalist activities in their households and residential areas, or in student organisations such as cooperatives. On ® eld trips to regions traditionally de® ned in terms of capitalist industrial activities (such as mining or manufacturing) it is instructive to include local speakers from aboriginal economies or the voluntary sector to show how non-capitalist economic activities contribute to regional economic identity. And it is also useful to seek out contemporary illustrations of alternative economic practices that are currently viable. One classroom exercise that I have used successfully involves accessing the Web pages of alternative economic groups such as local economic trading systems (LETS), the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation, and the International Co-operative Alliance. Students often become inspired to research these examples of intentionally different economies in more detail and in the process become more aware of the diversity of economic practices that already exists. Finally, I sometimes offer a service learning course in which students volunteer to work for local cooperative enterprises and other alternative economic organisations. In addition to being exposed to the intimate workings of these organisations, students conduct interviews with members to further their understanding of non-capitalist practices. The ultimate aim is to engage students in producing a discourse of economic difference, in the hope of contributing to a politics of economic innovation. Of course, destabilising images of capitalist dominance is a big project, and I could not do it by myself. Nor could I do it without queer theory, that incredibly dynamic matrix of contemporary theory whose practitioners are not only theorising about queers but who are also making social theory `queer’ . This latter project can be seen to involve not (or not merely) constituting a minority population based on same-sex desire, set in opposition to a heterosexual norm, but calling into question the very idea of norms and normality, calling attention to the violence entailed by normalising impulses, including the impulse to theorise a social site as subsumed to a hegemonic order [7]. What if we were to `queer’ capitalist hegemony and break apart some of its consolidating associations? We could start by reimagining the body of capitalism, that hard and masculine body that penetrates non-capitalism but is not itself susceptible to penetration (this image conveys some of the heterosexism that structures contemporary social theory). One key `coming together’ (a Christmas effect that participates in consolidating a capitalist monolith) is the familia r association of capitalism with commodi® cation and `the market’ . This association, in which all three terms ultimately signify `capitalism’ , constitutes the body of capitalism as dominant and expansive (at least in the space of commodity transactions). But how might we re-envision that body as more open and permeable, as having ori® ces through which non-capitalism might enter? We might argue, as many have done, that many different relations of productionÐ including slavery and independent commodity production and collective or communal relationsÐ are compatible with production for a market. What violence do we do to these when we normalise all commodity production as capitalist commodity production? Surely the market is a mobile and membranous ori® ce into which can be inserted all kinds of non-capitalist commodities, whose queer presences challenge the pre-eminence of capitalism and the discourses of its hegemony. Queering our pedagogy means making differences visible and calling normative impulses and forms of social closure into question. This is something that geographic researchers are increasingly doing with respect to a wide range of social and cultural sites and processes, not excluding the `economic’ , where differences among industries, enterprises, economic subjects, cities and regions, national and world economies are often highlighted and explored. The fact that one sameness their capitalist nature tends to unify all these forms of difference offers a challenge to us as teachers. Can we, with our students, generate different representations of the economic world, ones in which non-capitalist class relations and forms of economy are prevalent and widespread? [8] If we can, what might be the impact of these representations? Might they not help to make anticapitalist activism seem less quixotic and more realistic? Might they contribute to a non-capitalist politics of economic invention? For queer theorists unwilling to accept that it is a `heterosexual’ world in which queers may gain a toehold but will still be ultimately marginal or minoritised, various forms of queerness are everywhere to be found. The domain of the `normal’ retreats to the social and theoretical horizon. Likewise, for economic theorists and teachers who wish to counter the normalising effects of discourses of capitalist hegemony, economic discourse may be hegemonised by representations of capitalist dominance, but the economic world is already queer. ªWe’ re here, we’ re not capitalist, get used to it!º [9]<br />

As Elias argues, 'the global sphere cannot be regarded as a gender-neutral arena, but rather, becomes a site for the production of gender identity' (2004: 30). But 'male dominance within what we define as &quot;the international&quot; is not the only reason for thinking about a gendered global arena', we also need to examine 'the impact of these masculinist assumptions' (ibid. : 31). Space, constructed through a heteronormative, heterosexual, regulatory framework, as a particular frontier to be conquered and colonized, involves particular constructions of gender identity. The result is the creation and perpetuation in US discourse of outer space as an emptiness and void; the conquest of heterosexual man over nature. Discursive hierarchies of technologically superior, conquesting performance are imbued with their everyday power through an implicitly gendered framework for understanding both the earthly and extraterrestrial environments, and it is through gender that US political discourses of outer space have been able to (re)produce outer space as a masculinized, heterosexualized realm. I have argued in this chapter that sex and gender are discursively constituted to render the apparently ungendered discourse(s) of outer space exploration and colonization coherent. Involving a multitude of actors, organizations, state and non-state-based articulations, the US politics of outer space is dominated by a discourse of military, commercial and scientific conquest that draws heavily from essentialist and foundational understandings of and beliefs about nature, civilization, science, progress and consumption. Herein, important performances of gendered identity construct specific, tacitly gendered, rationalizations of exploration and colonization in particular ways, and gender is made intelligible in US outer space discourse in order to preserve essentially heteronormative regulations of identity that allow for the increased militarization of space, while serving neo-liberal, Anglo-American ideals of marketization, privatization, deregulation and flexibilization.<br />

Making a similar nod to spatialized gender roles, Carolyn Huntoon, describes what she saw as the reasons behind the new policy for astronaut selections to the space shuttle: ‘It was going to have more space in it for the crews. It was going to have some of the conveniences of home that previous space capsules had not had. And the laws were changing in our country that women could no longer be discriminated against. The decision was made that we would select qualified women to fly in space’ (2002). Again the domestication of space missions appears to go hand-in-hand with the presence of women in outer space. In both cases, stereotypical gender roles, frequently made through a gendered (mis)reading of American frontier expansion in the 19th century, provided an ill-fitting though seemingly seductive temporal analogy to explain away almost thirty years of institutionally prejudicial accounts of bodily difference and space exploration. This re-telling of a spatial division of labour, as a teleological sequence, where male explorers precede female pioneers, reveals the way prescriptive bodily performances were retrospectively legitimated within a heterosexual matrix, even by women themselves.<br />

In this metaphor public policy analysts are seen to enter into a discourse with leaders, the public and other experts in which, it is argued, language not only depicts reality, but also shapes the issues at hand. Policy discourse is characterized in the form of an argument ‘in which participants present claims and justifications that others review critically’ (MacRae, 1993, p. 311). 1 Before a claim is asserted and justified, there is a consensual process to generate proposals. ‘Part of this process involves the winnowing of policy alternatives considered to deal with a given problem. This is a process of seeking the best proposals, for which claims can later be made, rather, than simply of making claims; it involves systematically considering arguments and counterarguments. ’ (MacRae, 1993, p. 311) Policy reforms can therefore be presented as reasoned arguments rather than experiments that put questions to the test of reality. Such reasoned arguments embody the intention to change social reality itself, and not simply to use it as the source of selection pressure for new policy proposals. But social reality is mediated through language and argumentation (Majone, 1989, p. 1).<br />

Relations between states are, at least in part, constructed upon representations. Representations are interpretative prisms through which decision-makers make sense of a political reality, through which they define and assign a subjective value to the other states and non-state actors of the international system, and through which they determine what are significant international political issues. 2 For instance, officials of a given state will represent other states as 'allies', 'rivals', or simply 'insignificant', thus assigning a subjective value to these states. Such subjective categorizations often derive from representations of these states' domestic politics, which can for instance be perceived as 'unstable*, 'prosperous', or 'ethnically divided'. It must be clear that representations are not objective or truthful depictions of reality; rather they are subjective and political ways of seeing the world, making certain things 'seen' by and significant for an actor while making other things 'unseen' and 'insignificant'. 3 In other words, they are founded on each actor's and group of actors' cognitive, cultural-social, and emotional standpoints. Being fundamentally political, representations are the object of tense struggles and tensions, as some actors or groups of actors can impose on others their own representations of the world, of what they consider to be appropriate political orders, or appropriate economic relations, while others may in turn accept, subvert or contest these representations. Representations of a foreign political reality influence how decision-making actors will act upon that reality. In other words, as subjective and politically infused interpretations of reality, representations constrain and enable the policies that decision-makers will adopt vis-a-vis other states; they limit the courses of action that are politically thinkable and imaginable, making certain policies conceivable while relegating other policies to the realm of the unthinkable. 4 Accordingly, identifying how a state represents another state or non-state actor helps to understand how and why certain foreign policies have been adopted while other policies have been excluded. To take a now famous example, if a transnational organization is represented as a group of 'freedom fighters', such as the multi-national mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s, then military cooperation is conceivable with that organization; if on the other hand the same organization is represented as a 'terrorist network', such as Al-Qaida, then military cooperation as a policy is simply not an option. In sum. the way in which one sees, interprets and imagines the 'other* delineates the course of action one will adopt in order to deal with this 'other'<br />

 <strong>No relationship between US capabilities and peace</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Fettweis 10</span></strong> – Professor of national security affairs @ U. S. Naval War College. [Christopher J. Fettweis, “Threat and Anxiety in US Foreign Policy,” Survival, Volume 52,<br />
Issue 2 April 2010 , pages 59 – 82//informaworld]<br />
<br />
One potential explanation for the growth of global peace can be dismissed fairly quickly: US actions do not seem to have contributed much. The limited evidence suggests that there is little reason to believe in the stabilising power of the US hegemon, and that there is no relation between the relative level of American activism and international stability. During the 1990s, the United States cut back on its defence spending fairly substantially. By 1998, the United States was spending $100 billion less on defence in real terms than it had in 1990, a 25% reduction. 29 To internationalists, defence hawks and other believers in hegemonic stability, this irresponsible 'peace dividend' endangered both national and global security. 'No serious analyst of American military capabilities', argued neo-conservatives William Kristol and Robert Kagan in 1996, 'doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace'. 30 And yet the verdict from the 1990s is fairly plain: the world grew more peaceful while the United States cut its forces. No state seemed to believe that its security was endangered by a less-capable US military, or at least none took any action that would suggest such a belief. No militaries were enhanced to address power vacuums; no security dilemmas drove insecurity or arms races; no regional balancing occurred once the stabilis-ing presence of the US military was diminished. The rest of the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a pressing concern, despite the reduction in US military capabilities. Most of all, the United States was no less safe. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut its military spending under President Bill Clinton, and kept declining as the George W. Bush administration ramped the spending back up. Complex statistical analysis is unnecessary to reach the conclusion that world peace and US military expenditure are unrelated.<br />

<strong>Kagan exaggerates US importance and overlooks critical factors</strong><br />

<br />
Despite his newfound realism, Kagan balks at considering the possibility that the United States and Americans ought to change. He makes no effort to assess whether the Bush administration's recent revival of an expansionist conception of statecraft serves U. S. interests today. Has the doctrine of preventive war enhanced the well-being of the American people? Has the pursuit of President Bush's &quot;freedom agenda&quot; improved the United States' standing in the world? Or have the policies devised in the wake of 9/11 squandered the United States' power and multiplied its problems? Although there is abundant empirical evidence bearing directly on these questions, Kagan evinces almost no interest in such data. He has little time for contemplating the costs of Bush's aggressive policies in the Middle East, even though, according to some estimates, the price of the Iraq war alone may reach into the trillions of dollars. Key indicators of basic economic health -- such as the size of the national debt, the strength of the dollar, the extent of the trade deficit, and the country's ever-increasing dependence on imported oil -- do not figure in his analysis, even though they all have worsened under President Bush. For Kagan, the United States remains indispensable. It &quot;is still the keystone to the arch,&quot; he writes. &quot;Remove it, and the arch collapses. &quot; Here, Kagan the recent convert to realism gives way to Kagan the unrepentant neoconservative, who refuses to acknowledge that the United States' traditional foreign policy of expansionism has long been counterproductive. From the end of the Revolutionary War through the 1950s, expansionism did enhance U. S. power and wealth, and it did make freedom possible for ever larger numbers of Americans. But that correlation came undone in the 1960s. Recent efforts at expansion -- such as President Bush's ill-fated attempt to pacify the Muslim world -- have served only to dissipate U. S. power while weakening the U. S. economy and creating pretexts for the government to curtail individual freedoms at home. Expansionism no longer offers a way out -- and this fact, as much as and perhaps more so than the rise of China or the resurgence of Russia, defines the world that must be reckoned with today. But Kagan, eager to move on, bury the Iraq war, and whitewash the entire post-9/11 era, which he and other neoconservatives have so profoundly misunderstood, cannot or will not acknowledge this new reality.<br />

<strong>Kagan oversimplifies international relations theory and ignores real-world challenges</strong><br />

<br />
Cribbing from the realist tradition, Kagan outlines the contours of the great-power competition he expects will define the twenty-first century, with China, Europe, India, Japan, Russia, and, of course, the United States as key players. In the process, he engages in considerable oversimplification and more than a little hype. To justify Japan's making the cut, for example, Kagan claims that Tokyo today &quot;displays great power ambitions&quot; and even plays a &quot;global military role. &quot; Yet Japan's military spending has actually declined in recent years; the country's top national security priority is not power projection but ballistic missile defense. As a participant in global military affairs, Japan lags well behind Canada. Kagan views a rising China and a resurgent Russia as potential problems: both are authoritarian states whose ambitions could threaten international stability. In response, he calls for the formation of a &quot;league of democracies,&quot; led by the United States and including European states, that would hold &quot;regular meetings and consultations among democratic nations on the issues of the day. &quot; (Headline: &quot;Mars and Venus Announce Plans to Marry!&quot;) That he now advocates creating a talking society shows how far Kagan has traveled since the days when he was touting the benefits of the United States' global hegemony. It is hard to see what this league would accomplish apart from providing sinecures for large numbers of second-tier government officials and civil servants. In all likelihood, it would be a new NATO without the clout or the cohesion of the old. How does violent Islamic radicalism figure in this vision of the twenty-first century? For Kagan, the threat turns out not to be so great after all. Refreshingly devoid of inflammatory references to &quot;Islamofascism&quot; or World War IV, The Return of History does not foresee a new caliphate seizing control of the Muslim world and attempting to impose sharia on the West. Kagan sees the Islamist cause as doomed to fail. He describes political Islam as a &quot;hopeless dream,&quot; believing (correctly, in my view) that &quot;in the struggle between traditionalism and modernity, tradition cannot win. &quot; Thus, for Kagan, mounting an all-out global assault against terrorism no longer ranks as a top priority. Neither does the war in Iraq. In the run-up to the U. S. invasion in 2003, Kagan, writing in The Washington Post, described Iraq as &quot;a historical pivot&quot; and events there as destined to &quot;shape the course of Middle Eastern politics, and therefore world politics, both now and for the remainder of this century. &quot; After five years of fighting, more than 4,000 U. S. deaths, several hundred billion dollars frittered away, and some 140,000 U. S. troops still on the ground, he no longer seems to think so. The Return of History barely mentions Iraq. For Kagan, at least, the longer the war drags on, the less important it becomes. In this, he is like a 1960s hawk writing a book in 1968 who consigns the Vietnam War to a couple of sentences.<br />

I was disappointed to see the phrasing of tonight’s press release, “NASA Releases Images Of Man-Made Crater On Comet.” This was an amazing opportunity for scientists and schoolchildren alike to see the results of a planetary science experiment on a truly cosmic scale, and yet the very title of the release does not encourage students thinking about a future career in science, math or engineering. Indeed, it dissuades them. Well, half of them, anyway. You see, language matters. And when girls read about manned missions to the moon, manned spacecraft, or a man-made crater on a comet, they are far less likely to read on, to read further, and to imagine themselves in the role of one of those lucky scientists and engineers. Which means that as time goes on, fewer push themselves to take and excel in higher math and more sophisticated science classes. Fewer perservere through hard times, tough professors, and touchy teaching assistants. Fewer graduate with STEM degrees, and fewer still compete for the competitive NASA fellowships and the JPL postdocs and the elusive GSFC civil servant positions. Fewer are available at every level, in fact, and then the field is simply unbalanced, with women only ten percent of the population in planetary science at the senior professor level. Which means that almost half our field is missing. Now I know that some see will this as ”only” a question of language, but it really does have implications for the field of planetary science today and the field as it will be forty years from now, when today’s schoolchildren are proposing to lead the flight missions of tomorrow. On the day that proposals for the 2068 mission to Mars are received, will there be an equal distribution of proposals led by men and women? Or will almost half the proposals be missing? Please consider using gender-neutral language in NASA press releases. It matters, and it has long-reaching impact.<br />

Dale, U of Utah, Man Made Language<br />
Each day we construct the world we live in according to these man made rules. We select. pattern and interpret the flux of events in the attempt to make life meaningful and few of us suspect how deeply entrenched, and arbitrary, these rules are. We impose them on the world so that what we see conforms to what we have been led to see. And one of the crucial factors in the construction of this reality is language. Language is our means of classifying and ordering. the world: our means of manipulating reality .In its structure and in its use we bring our world into realization., and if it is inherently inaccurate, then we are mislead. If the rules which underlay our language system, our symbolic order, are invalid, then we are daily deceived. Yet the rules for meaning, which are part of language, are not natural; they were not present in the world and merely awaiting discovery by human beings. On the contrary, they had; to be invented before anything could be discovered, for without them there is no frame of reference, no order, no possibility for systematic interpretation and understanding. Once made, however, these rules have a habit of becoming self-validating and self-perpetuating, regardless of any misapprehension on which they may have initially been based. Although it is not possible to ‘begin at the beginning’ and identify the forces which were at work in the construction of these rules to determine whether or not they were accurate or justified it is possible to analyse the contemporary classification system on our language and to speculate on the origins, and the reasons for these rules | which now play such a vital role in the construction of our world view. One semantic rule which we on see in operation in the language is that of .the male-as-norm. At the outset it may appear to be a relatively innocuous rule for classifying the objects and events of the world, but closer examination exposes it at one of the most pervasive and pernicious rules that has been encoded. While this rule operates we are required to classify the world on the premise that the standard or normal human being is a male one and when there is but one standard, then those who are not of it are allocated to a category of deviation. Hence our fundamental classification scheme is one which divides humanity not into two equal parts (if two is to be the significant number) but into those who are plus male and those who are minus male. At the most basic level of meaning the status of the female is derived from the status of the male and on this has been erected many strata of positive and negative classifications. Outside the way in which we order the world there is no compelling reason to classify people according to their genitalia, and even if there were, there would still be no compelling reason to classify them simply dichotomously, a division 'which we even find frequently inadequate, despite our mental set which helps to construe difference along sexually dimorphous lines. If we did feel obliged to use genitalia as a reference point for the classification of humanity, it would be just as reasonable to classify, for example, according to the degree of protection proved for sexual organs, in which case we would not be confined to a dichotomy but would have a continuum along which people could be placed, with some enjoying better protection than others. But we do divide on the basis of genitalia we do construct only two sexes; we do insist upon a whole range of gender determined behaviours. And we do all this for a purpose. By arranging the objects and events of the world according to these rules we set up the rationale, and the vindication for male supremacy. While at one level we may support or refute the myth of male superiority - it being a matter of political choice - at another level we are unaware of the way in which it structures our behaviour and forms some of the limits of our world. With the crucial underlying rule that the world can be divided into minus male or plus male categories we have seen the construction of the patriarchal order. It is a symbolic order into which we are born and as we become members of society and begin to enter the meanings which the symbols represent, we also begin to structure the world so that those symbols are seen to be applicable: we enter into the meaning of patriarchal order and then we help to give it life.<br />

Debate, unlike athletics, does not require physical skills which might restrict the participation of women. Additionally, debate is academically oriented and women tend to select extracurricular activities , that are more academic in nature than men.3 Based on these assumptions, one would expect proportional representation of the genders in the activity. Why then, are there four times more men in debate than women?4 Several explanations exist that begin to account for the low rate of female participation in debate. Fewer females enter the activity at the outset. Although organizational and procedural tactics used in high school debate may account for low initial rates of participation, a variety of social and structural phenomena, not necessarily caused by the debate community also account for these rates. Ultimately, the disproportionate attrition rate of female debaters results in the male dominated composition of the activity. There are more disincentives for women to participate in debate than for men. While entry rates for women and man may in some cases be roughly equal, the total number of women who participate for four years is significantly lower than the corresponding number of men. This rate of attrition is due to factors that can be explained largely by an examination of the debate community itself. Socially inculcated values contribute to low rates of female entry in high school debate. Gender bias and its relation to debate has been studied by Manchester and Freidly. They conclude, &quot;[m]ales are adhering to sex-role stereotypes and sex-role expectations when they participate in debate because it is perceived as a masculine' activity. Female debate participants experience more gender-related barriers because they are not adhering to sex-role stereotypes and sex-role expectations.<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Patriarchy is the cause of all proliferation, environmental destruction, domestic violence, and war</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Warren &amp; Cady 94</span> (Karen J, Duane L, feminists &amp;authors, Hypatia, “Feminism and Peace: Seeing connections,” pg 16-17, JL)<br />
Much of the current &quot;unmanageability&quot; of contemporary life in patriarchal societies, (d), is then viewed as a consequence of a patriarchal preoccupation with activities, events, and experiences that reflect historically male-gender identified beliefs, values, attitudes, and assumptions. Included among these real-life consequences are precisely those concerns with nuclear proliferation, war, environmental destruction, and violence toward women, which many feminists see as the logical outgrowth of patriarchal thinking. In fact, it is often only through observing these dysfunctional behaviors -- the symptoms of dysfunctionality -- that one can truly see that and how patriarchy serves to maintain and perpetuate them. When patriarchy is understood as a dysfunctional system, this &quot;unmanageability&quot; can be seen for what it is -- as a predictable and thus logical consequence of patriarchy. 11The theme that global environmental crises, war, and violence generally are predictable and logical consequences of sexism and patriarchal culture is pervasive in ecofeminist literature (see Russell 1989 , 2). Ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak, for instance, argues that &quot;a militarism and warfare are continual features of a patriarchal society because they reflect and instill patriarchal values and fulfill needs of such a system. Acknowledging the context of patriarchal conceptualizations that feed militarism is a first step toward reducing their impact and preserving life on Earth&quot; ( Spretnak 1989 , 54). Stated in terms of the foregoing model of patriarchy as a dysfunctional social system, the claims by Spretnak and other feminists take on a clearer meaning: Patriarchal conceptual frameworks legitimate impaired thinking (about women, national and regional conflict, the environment) which is manifested in behaviors which, if continued, will make life on earth difficult, if not impossible. It is a stark message, but it is plausible. Its plausibility ties in understanding the conceptual roots of various woman-nature-peace connections in regional, national, and global contexts.<br />

The masculine self-identity of pilots has often been understood through an eroticized desire for risk and suffering, or what Law (2002) terms ‘Thrills and spills’ (p. 32). Similarly, McCurdy (1993), quotes one Apollo astronaut as saying, ‘Recognition of risk is what made us as good as we were’ (p. 62), while another states ‘But if it [risk of death] was like, one in one hundred, you would do it, you take it ... There were so many ways it could happen’ (p. 63). Across such statements astronauts’ fetishized tolerance of risk as a part of the performance of manliness; risk became part of the astronauts’ identity, contributing to what Tom Wolfe's novel (1979) famously referred to as ‘The Right Stuff’. Yet this attitude towards physical and mental subjugation was not mere blind masochism; it was, also predicated upon a set of techniques concerned with the control of bodies wherein the astronauts were rigorously tested to confirm a high degree of corporeal control and calculation over their own bodies and perform tasks in this hostile environment – to maintain control in a situation despite the discomfort and vulnerability and get the job done. Within all these images of the astronaut there exist mutually shaping essentializing associations between masculinity, corporeality, outer space, risk and high-technology that prefigure the identity construction of ‘The Right Stuff’; becoming increasingly evident when challenged with transgressive Other(s), namely female bodies.6 Such an instance occurred in 1962, when a small group of women successfully passed the some of same physical and psychological tests as the Mercury astronauts, in a privately funded women astronaut study organized by a physiologist called Dr. William Lovelace (see Shayler and Moule, 2003; Weitekamp, 2004). The women now sought NASA's support to become astronauts. ‘Lovelace's Women in Space Project’ (Weitekamp, 2004) or ‘The Mercury 13’ (Ackmann, 2004) de-stabilized many of the iterative bodily performances enacted through NASA that prescribed binary gendered assumptions.7 The desire of these women to become astronauts and their embodied suitability, transgressed the tacitly masculinist spatio-temporal categorization of different bodies under modernity (Massey, 2005: 93). These bodies offered, in Judith Butler's (1990) terms, a sense of hope ‘in the possibility of a failure to repeat, a de-formity, or a parodic repetition that exposes the phantasmatic effect of abiding identity as a politically tenuous construction’ (p. 192). Just as some homosexual bodily performances may present a particular body in an opposing gender role (see Butler, 1990: 167–170), thus exposing the de-stabilized ‘ground’ of both gendered identities, these astronauts tacitly desired to place a female body in a hegemonically masculine guise. Yet equally, as Butler (1990) makes clear, such transgressions, while sometimes transformative, are frequently accompanied by ‘punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them’ (p. 190). For example, in 1962 Dr. Lovelace sought the Navy's permission to expand his use of their facilities to provide further evidence of the women's suitability. The official reply to the Navy was that ‘NASA does not at this time have a requirement for such a program’ (Weitekamp, 2004: 128). This reply was then made known to Dr. Lovelace and the women involved; it effectively cancelled the nascent woman into space project. Here, the twin spectres of technological determinism and instrumentalism (Feenberg, 1999) are used to conjure up a belief in value-neutral, automatic and unilateral technical decision-making. In turn, this meant that the space programme could be constructed as if it were an inevitable temporal sequence, expressing natural gender roles and bodily practices, and devoid of ethno-political import (Shayler and Moule, 2003). The decision was re-examined in a heated Congressional hearing in July 1962, in which the Lovelace Women, led by Geraldine ‘Jerrie’ Cobb, were cross-examined by Congressmen partly in an attempt to illustrate their technical worth objectively, above and beyond their male peers (Shayler and Moule, 2003, p. 149). The women demonstrated the capacity of their bodies to pass the same flight-tests as men, as well as possessing some important advantages, not least their requirements for less food and oxygen – on account of their smaller size (Penley, 1997: 55). Ultimately, however, the women's transgressive bodily desires were blocked through quasi-judicial significations of risk. Namely, a belief asserted by NASA that astronauts had to be jet test pilots, a profession women were already barred from, because only jet test pilots possessed the necessary experience to undertake high-risk flight experiments. This point appeared already undermined by NASA's own demonstration that spacecraft could fly automatically in outer space (Penley, 1997), combined with the rejection of many skilled test pilots by the astronaut selectors, such as Chuck Yeager. NASA's Chief of Manned Space Flight, George Low, then explained to Congress how NASA support for the women-in-space project would set his work back, despite the fact that Lovelace had requested the very limited use of Navy not NASA facilities (Ackmann, 2004: 166). More implicitly, it appears the decision revolved around a belief that women were excluded from becoming jet test pilots (or astronauts) because it was deemed too risky (Weitekamp, 2004: 149). In this case, a masculinized relationship between technology and risk within American modernity proved intractable; accordingly men were able to dictate thresholds of female risk. As Weitekamp (2004) explains, the male construction of female risk prevalent in NASA was two-fold: on the one hand, NASA seemed reluctant to subject women to degrees of risk because ‘the prospect of subjecting a woman to mortal danger betrayed the rigidly defined gendered roles asserted in post-war America’<br />

This shallow vision of gender justice has so permeated even progressive circles, that our very definition of sexism is circumscribed. Too often, sexism is merely seen as a set of cultural behaviors or personal biases; challenging sexism is simply seen as breaking these gender expectations. But sexism is an institutionalized system, with historical, political, and economic dimensions. Just as it was built on white supremacy and capitalism, this country was built on patriarchy—on the sexual subjugation of women whether in war or “peace”, slavery or conquest; on the abuse of our reproductive capacity; the exploitation of both our paid and unpaid labor. Truly taking on an anti-sexist agenda means uprooting institutional patriarchy. To do so we must first, as a society, overcome our fears of addressing feminist issues and views. A deep analysis of how patriarchy operates is typically absent across progressive organizing in the US—whether for affordable housing, demilitarization, immigrant rights, or worker rights. In all of these struggles, women are heavily affected, and moreover, affected disproportionately in gendered ways, as women. Yet too often, organizers working on these issues do not recognize how they are gendered. In the process, they prioritize men’s experiences, and perpetuate sexism. Gender is ghettoized, rather than fully integrated into radical struggles. Appended to the main concerns of other movements, it is at best engaged on a single-issue, not systemic basis.<br />

Talk of a logic of domination is a way of identifying the values embedded in culture's unjust hierarchies, and mapping the effects of such hierarchies, and such logics, is a crucial project for moral philosophv. Ecofeminists have shown that this is true because different forms of exploitation and domination are connected conceptually, but also because gender, race, class, and &quot;nature&quot; comingle in reality-in identities, economies, social institutions, and practices. Analyses of complex and interwoven systems of domination are therefore key to understanding social truths, and nearly any interface of nature and culture. Warren's Ecofeminist Philosophy shows that the clear and persuasive presentation of such analyses was one of the primary projects of twentieth-century ecofeminist philosophy . This project was political as well as philosophical, for to identify the hidden lines of influence and power that shape patterns of injustice and impairment is to point toward strategies for ethical engagement and improvement.<br />

Another example of language that some people think is sexist is man-linked words. These words—such as chairman, salesman, repairman, mailman, and mankind— include man but are supposed to operate generically to include women as well. Man-linked expressions such as manning the phones and manned space flight are also problematic. In addition, the practice of referring to a group of people as guys, as in 'hey, you guys, let's go to the movies,' reinforces sexism in language. Relatively easy alternatives to these exclusion­ary verbal symbols are becoming more commonplace (see Table 4. 2).

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The House Appropriations Committee proposed Wednesday to kill the James Webb Space Telescope, the crown jewel of NASA’s astronomy plans for the next two decades. The telescope, named after a former administrator of NASA, is the successor to the </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Hubble Space Telescope</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, and it was designed to study the first stars and galaxies that emerged in the first hundred million years or so after the Big Bang. It was supposed to be launched in 2014, but NASA said last year that the project would require at least an additional $1.6 billion and several more years to finish, because of mismanagement. The announcement of the telescope’s potential demise came as part of a draft budget for NASA and other agencies, including the Commerce and Justice Departments. In all, the committee proposed lopping $1.6 billion off NASA’s current budget, which is $18.4 billion for 2011. The Obama administration had originally requested $18.7 billion for NASA. Astronomers reacted with immediate dismay, fearing that the death of the Webb telescope could have the same dire impact on American astronomy that killing the Superconducting Supercollider, a giant particle accelerator in Texas, did in 1993 for American physics, sending leadership abroad. Canceling the Webb telescope would “have a profound impact on astrophysics far into the future, threatening U.S. leadership in space science,” said Matt Mountain, director of the</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Space Telescope Science Institute</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in Baltimore, which would run the new telescope. “This is particularly disappointing at a time when the nation is struggling to inspire students to take up science and engineering,” he added. Tod R. Lauer, an astronomer at the </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">National Optical Astronomy Observatory</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in Tucson, echoed his view. “This would be an unmitigated disaster for cosmology,” he said. “After two decades of pushing the Hubble to its limits, which has revolutionized astronomy, the next step would be to pack up and give up. The Hubble is just good enough to see what we’re missing at the start of time.” The Webb telescope, he said, “would bring it home in full living color.”</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This doesn’t make sense because most of the components of the JWST are finished and half of the funds are already spent. Cutting this program would only disappoint global partners.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Under the debt-reduction deal, across-the-board cuts to reduce discretionary spending would mean the cancellation of major scientific projects. In a newly released statement, the APS Executive Board expressed dismay that impending U.S. House action on appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies had identified the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as a prime candidate for termination. APS urges Congress to restore funding for JWST and believes it deserves special attention for the following reasons: Successor to the extraordinarily successful Hubble Space Telescope with similar potential to transform astronomy, JWST is the centerpiece of the future American space astrophysics program. It was the highest-ranked mission in the 2000 National Academy of Sciences' Astronomy Decadal Survey and is a cornerstone of the 2010 Survey. JWST is 100 times more powerful than Hubble and would revolutionize our understanding of the birth of the Universe, reveal much about the first stars and galaxies, and play a crucial role in the quest to find life on distant planets. Seventy-five percent of the JWST hardware is being fabricated or has been delivered, and $3.5 billion (about half of the total cost) has been spent. The Casani repor</span><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">t</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, commissioned by U..S. Sen. Barbara Mikulski (MD), found no technical problems, and NASA and its contractors have corrected management deficiencies that the report identified.JWST would continue Hubble's legacy as one of the greatest inspirations for young people and as a symbol of American leadership in science and space. Cancellation of JWST would eliminate thousands of high-tech jobs, especially in the aerospace industry. The Canadian and the European Space Agencies are contributing around a billion dollars to JWST; cancellation would again call into question our nation's record as a reliable international partner.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">But right now it’s a fiasco, costing at least four times its original estimate and scheduled to launch at least seven years late, threatening to drain funds from other critical space science programs amid ever-shrinking budgets. Those are the findings of a FLORIDA TODAY investigation that reviewed five years of project records, revealing an agency that continues to grossly mismanage major new programs. For instance, the shuttle fleet and International Space Station both came in far behind schedule, weighed down by 45 percent increases from their original price estimates, according to the Government Accountability Office, the financial watchdog arm of Congress. Ditto NASA’s Constellation moon program, which a presidential blue ribbon panel said was on a fiscally “unsustainable trajectory” that doomed it. And, just recently, NASA said the new heavy-lift rocket it wants to send astronauts on future deep-space missions from Kennedy Space Center would cost $9 billion and come in two years behind its mandated 2016 completion date. Now add Webb to the litany, its price rising from $1.6 billion to nearly $7 billion while its launch date moves past 2020. The damage to NASA’s credibility is severe and further reduces confidence in the agency’s ability to meet fiscal and launch targets for its post-shuttle manned spaceflight program.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The James Webb Space Telescope remains central to Nasa's mission, deputy administrator Lori Garver says. The agency chief was responding to moves in the House of Representatives to cull the troubled observatory, which is now $2bn over budget. A House appropriations panel has put forward a bill that would clip Nasa's 2012 budget and end JWST funding. But Garver told BBC News: &quot;James Webb is obviously part of our future that we believe very strongly in.&quot; She said the White House administration and the Nasa management would be working with the House and the Senate to produce a budget that would enable the agency to fulfil its science and exploration objectives. &quot;The process is not over,&quot; she added. Ms Garver was speaking here at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida where Nasa is preparing to launch its last ever shuttle mission. The JWST is supposed to be the next great undertaking in space astronomy. The telescope would have the biggest mirror ever sent into orbit and incorporate detectors capable of seeing the very first galaxies to form in the Universe. But getting it ready for flight has proved to be a major technological challenge. Uncertain timescale One recent assessment suggested JWST's total cost had ballooned from $3.5bn to $5bn, and that continued delays could inflate the final bill well beyond $6bn. In parallel with the price escalation, the probable launch date has slipped deeper and deeper into the decade with some commentators wondering whether JWST might not even be ready to fly this side of 2020. It is against this background that the House Appropriations Committee has drawn up it Fiscal Year 2012 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill. It calls for a $16.8bn budget for Nasa, which is $1.6bn below last year's level and $1.9bn below what US President Barack Obama would like the agency to receive. The panel would terminate funding for JWST if it had its way. But there is a long way to go in this story. The Senate will have its view, and then Congress as a whole will have to come to a determination. Nasa itself is conducting its own internal review of the JWST project. Ms Garver said she was hopeful that everyone could come to an agreement on the telescope's future. &quot;We absolutely do believe that we are working towards a budget that will deliver a James Webb telescope this decade. We are just now completing the bottoms up review of the cost to be able to get a funding profile to do just that.&quot; JWST is not a US-only project; it has significant input from the Europeans and the Canadians. Europe's contribution includes the launcher, an Ariane 5, to get the telescope into orbit, and the provision of two of the observatory's four instruments - MIRI and NIRSPEC. European Space Agency Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain was asked at the recent Paris Air Show about delays to the overall programme. He said Europe would continue working to its timeline and would not be distracted by the arguments over James Webb taking place in the US. &quot;We will be ready for a launch in 2016/17,&quot; he told BBC News. &quot;If the launch has to be later because Nasa doesn't have the financial wherewithal or the technical ability to go ahead in 2016/17 then we can put our instrumentation in storage pending a launch date. But I stress, we are not going to delay the delivery of our contribution because that would actually cost more, so we are going to finish our work as quickly as possible. &quot;Esa is not the bottleneck when it comes to the launch date,&quot; he added.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will launch in 2018 only if NASA receives more funding for the program than the flat budget assumed in the President's FY2012 budget request according to an agency official. JWST is usually described as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, although it will study the universe in a different part of the spectrum (infrared instead of visible) and from a very different location (the L2 Lagrange point instead of Earth orbit). NASA's Rick Howard told the NASA Advisory Council's Science Committee on April 21 that the agency is still looking at how best to &quot;rebaseline&quot; the program to move forward. That effort will be completed in the coming weeks. Howard was designated as JWST Program Director last fall after an independent review faulted the program's &quot;budgeting and program management, not technical performance&quot; as the cause of substantial cost increases. That report said the earliest launch date was 2015 if certain financial resources -- $500 million for each of FY2011 and FY2012 -- were made available. Howard is doing a more detailed assessment and looking more closely at what funds are likely to be provided. Howard stressed that he is still gathering data to feed into the agency's Joint Confidence Level (JCL) independent cost estimating process before any decisions are made. The last three years of the program preparing for launch are &quot;incompressible,&quot; he said. If a launch date prior to 2018 is desired, the schedule could be moved forward only if more money is provided in the immediate future (FY2012 or FY2013). Absent such increases the agency is looking at 2018 as the earliest launch date, which is five years later than the original plan. Achieving the 2018 date also requires more funds in the longer term than what is in NASA's FY2012 projection. That &quot;runout&quot; shows the program flat funded at $375 million per year for the next five years. Howard said if that really turned out to be the budget for the program, launch would be pushed out into the 2020s. Howard said funding adjustments would have to be discussed within the agency and with the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Several committee members emphasized that programs like JWST cannot be accomplished with flat budgets and said they hoped OMB and OSTP realize that. NASA plans to spend $471 million on JWST in this fiscal year (FY2011) and Howard insisted the amount for FY2011 would not be lower than that. As an agency, NASA received $561 million less than the $19 billion it requested for FY2011. The agency is developing an operating plan to show how to plans to spend the approximately $18.5 billion that Congress provided. Howard clearly believes that JWST will not be a place where cuts are made to accommodate the lower appropriation. Meanwhile, JWST hardware is being delivered to NASA. One issue is how to store everything for this unexpectedly lengthy period of time and deal with obsolescence and workforce issues. Howard asked rhetorically how many of the people working on the program would want to stay with it now that the launch date is so many years later than planned. Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), chair of the Senate Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee that funds NASA, is a long time cheerleader for NASA and its space and earth science programs, many of which are managed at Goddard Space Flight Center in her State. She has been an ardent advocate for JWST, but her displeasure at the new cost overruns that emerged last year was made clear when she demanded the independent review that led to the current replanning effort (the &quot;Casani report,&quot; after its chair, John Casani). </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">WASHINGTON — The cost of NASA's replacement for the Hubble Space Telescope is giving new meaning to the word astronomical, growing another $1.5 billion, according to a new internal NASA study released Wednesday. NASA's explanation: We're better rocket scientists than accountants. Management and others didn't notice that key costs for the James Webb Space Telescope weren't included during a major program review in July 2008, officials said. The study says in the best case scenario it will now cost about $6.5 billion to launch and run the powerful, new telescope. And that can happen only if NASA adds an extra $500 million in the next two years over current budget plans. If the agency can't get the extra money from Congress, it will ultimately cost even more and take longer to launch the telescope. Before now, the cost of the telescope had already ballooned from $3.5 billion to $5 billion. NASA officials said they had not done a good job of figuring out the confirmation cost for the massive telescope. The report said the budget in 2008 &quot;understated the real requirements&quot; and managers didn't realize how inadequate it was. &quot;We were missing a certain fraction of what was going on,&quot; NASA associate administrator Chris Scolese said in a late Wednesday afternoon teleconference. The Webb telescope, &quot;we hope is just an aberration,&quot; Scolese said, but suggested there may be other budget-busting projects. He said the agency is now reviewing all its projects, not just to find extra money for Webb but to see if there are similar cases of poor budgeting. The costs aren't because of problems with the technology, design or construction of the instrument. NASA said, technically, it is in good shape. It is designed to look deeper in the universe to the first galaxies. A collaboration with the European Space Agency, the telescope is being built by Northrop Grumman and will be run out of Baltimore, Md., like Hubble. The fault &quot;lies with us, no question about it,&quot; Scolese said.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Managing costs on a year-to-year basis led to deferred work and life cycle cost increases. Inadequate reserves in the period immediately following Confirmation resulted in a nonexecutable Project. Without the reserves needed to fund the exigencies normally experienced in the course of development, the Project simply continued the practice of deferring some of the work planned in the current year to a future year. Due to the inefficiencies created when deferring already planned work, this led to escalating increases in the life cycle cost of JWST and continued erosion of the schedule. Experience shows that deferred work potentially doubles or triples costs, due to the impact of the deferrals on other work. This leads to a cascading effect wherein the cost of delayed activities further reduces the limited real reserves available to the project in later years, creating an escalating spiral for project life cycle cost. As the JWST Project was underfunded from Confirmation, the result has been a substantial impact to life cycle cost and schedule.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The university needs science, but how much does science need the university? The university needs science because some 97.5 percent of the sponsored research funding flows to science faculty members. It needs science because graduate science departments attract the largest share of international students, many of whom come with external funding. It needs science because science is its last bastion of intellectual credibility. It needs science because the most potent rationale for continuing state and federal support is that universities drive technological innovation and jobs, and this claim rests almost exclusively on the contributions of university science faculty. It needs science because science departments are a magnet for many smart undergraduate students who wouldn’t come to seek degrees in other stuff. The university also needs science because most of the important frontiers of human knowledge are in the sciences. If the university wants to take itself seriously as an institution founded on the search for truth, it has to have a serious commitment to the sorts of truths that theoretical and empirical science aim to uncover. Science, on the other hand, could in principle get along without the university. It would be inconvenient for a while, especially for scientists who have built their careers around academic science. But there is nothing inherent in the nature of scientific inquiry that makes it dependent on the university. Science can be pursued in other venues: in government-run facilities such as the National Laboratories; in industry-sponsored facilities such as Bell Labs once was; in private industry; in international ventures such as the International Space Station; and sometimes as a purely personal pursuit. The latter is not to be treated at all dismissively. From Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton to Albert Einstein, breakthroughs have been achieved by individuals working well outside the university establishment and with little institutional backing. Today we have science entrepreneurs such as Craig Venter and Stephen Wolfram who step out of academe to found their own institutes to pursue their inquiries. And scientific publication doesn’t really need the university at all. Important results can be perfectly well vetted and disseminated outside the protocols of higher education, although the journal publishers would keenly regret the loss of income from university libraries and hefty public-dissemination fees. Science may not absolutely need the university but it does get some considerable benefits: systematic teaching and training of new scientists; career paths that allow for long timelines in developing ideas; an orderly system of funding and the social stability that comes from that; well-established and up-to-date facilities in an institution that understands the competitive need to keep them that way; and an infrastructure that typically includes things such as abundant high-speed computing. The university, in other words, is a very convenient place to pursue science. Many scientists like it, not least because they like the opportunities it presents to engage with colleagues in other disciplines, and because quite a few (certainly not all) scientists enjoy teaching. Have I missed anything? Perhaps it could be argued that the university’s role as a teacher and trainer of new scientists is irreplaceable—that science has reached the stage of complexity that no other institution could carry out this work at anything like the efficiency of the university. It is a reasonable argument but I don’t think it is quite right. The liberal-arts college, for example, often does an outstanding job of preparing undergraduates for graduate study in the sciences—and does so with only a relatively modest investment in the basic enterprise of science. If scientific research were to vanish from higher education, higher education could still manage to educate students to a high level of intellectual proficiency in chemistry, physics, biology, astronomy, geology, computer science, engineering, and so on. We might well lose something in that transition. Some active researchers who teach would find the research-less environment unattractive and de-camp, and students might find the absence of active researchers makes learning science a duller undertaking. On the other hand, a lot of college science is already taught by faculty members whose claim to being active researchers is very thin or trivial. So the loss could turn out to be minor. These ruminations are prompted by a couple of convergent thoughts: First<strong>,</strong> the United States seems to be entering a period in which its national commitment to major scientific undertaking is a bit shaky. A few weeks ago the Department of Energy confirmed that for lack of funds ($35-million per year) it is shutting down the Tevatron atom-smasher at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The closure will leave the U.S. without any major high-energy particle accelerator capable of new fundamental physics. The James Webb Space Telescope, intended as a replacement for the Hubble Telescope, is years behind schedule. Its cost overruns have forced other important projects, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, designed to investigate “dark energy,” into long-term abeyance. President Obama cancelled the Constellation program that would have taken Americans back to the Moon. We have no practical replacement for the Space Shuttle program, which is down to two remaining flights. The government hopes the private sector will step in with some vehicle capable of reaching low-earth orbit so that the U.S. isn’t left buying expensive bus tickets on Russian rockets to heft our astronauts into space. In the other direction, the National Science Foundation just turned down additional support for the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory that would occupy the old Homestake gold mine in Lead, South Dakota—a project with potential to help in the search for “dark matter” and proton decay. The U.S. government continues to spend enormous amounts on scientific research but it is hard to avoid the impression that as a nation we have lost some of our real zeal for adventure. To be sure, there will always be more proposals for scientific research than the nation can reasonably pay for. We have to make choices, and a good way to do that is to think about the alternatives. Last year the National Academy of Sciences, for example, issued a </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">report identifying the highest priorities in astronomy and astrophysics</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Its highest priority was the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope—the one that NASA just pushed to the back burner. The cancellation and delay of so many key science initiatives inevitably means disappointment for academic scientists, and in some cases it will mean a good deal more than disappointment. Some research will simply stop, if not altogether at least in the United States.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Launch Date Uncertainty Though its promise is huge, researchers will have to wait a few years to put the telescope to use. JWST, long afflicted by budget overruns and delays, still has no estimated launch date, officials said in January at the American Astronomical Society’s winter meeting in Seattle. Last November, an independent review panel concluded that the telescope, once slated for launch in June 2014, could lift off no sooner than September 2015. But at a town hall-style talk in January, a NASA official stressed that that window is not binding. “There are a lot of steps that have to happen before the agency commits to a launch date,” said Eric Smith, JWST program scientist at NASA headquarters in Washington. “There is no such thing as a launch date for JWST. We’re working on it.” The JWST mission, led by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., is billed as Hubble’s successor. The telescope has huge light-collecting power: Its primary mirror is 6.5 meters wide, or more than twice as big as Hubble’s. While orbiting about 1.6 million kilometers from Earth, JWST will scan the universe in infrared light, helping astronomers study the early days of the universe, the formation of alien star systems and much more, NASA officials have said. Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST will not observe the universe in the visible light range of the light spectrum. NASA had estimated that JWST would launch in June 2014 and cost about $5 billion over its lifetime. But delays and cost overruns have long afflicted the spacecraft, which currently consumes 40 percent of NASA’s astrophysics budget. The independent review panel, convened at the request of U.S. Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) to look into the cause of JWST’s problems, concluded in November that the telescope would cost about $6.5 billion, and that it could launch no earlier than September 2015. The panel found no fault with the telescope’s scientific progress, instead citing longstanding budgeting and management issues. Indeed, JWST continues to move forward with its assembly and testing, officials said. Five of the telescope’s 18 gold-coated flight mirrors are completely finished and tested, for example, and the other 13 should be done by the end of this summer, according to Mark Clampin, JWST observatory project scientist at Goddard. “The bottom line is, we made really good progress in 2010,” Clampin said.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The James Webb Space Telescope is a project of astonishing scientific capability that is the natural successor to the iconic Hubble Space Telescope. With 100X the power of Hubble, yet a comparable cost to launch,it reflects the huge technological steps that the US, and our international partners(Europe and Canada), have made in the last two three decades since Hubble was designed and built. JWST will maintain US leadership in space science and technology.The partnership for JWST with the European Space Agency (ESA), its member states and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) reflects the success of such past partnerships(e.g., Hubble) between NASA and these international agencies. JWST was the top ranked project of all projects, ground and space, in the 2000 US Decadal Survey, and is extensively acknowledged as a cornerstone of the next decade’s astronomical research in the 2010 US Decadal Survey (where it was understood for the report that JWST would become operational this decade). Furthermore, JWST is now the single largest investment by Canada in astronomy and a major investment by Europe, consistent with its very high scientific importance to each of their scientific and political communities. It is crucial for our international partners that JWST progresses expeditiously. Hubble, and the other ongoing Great Observatories (Chandra and Spitzer) have demonstrated the value and cost-effectiveness of broadly-capable space observatories through their wide-ranging and continuing scientific discoveries. Such Great Observatories have been shown to return discoveries very cost-effectively. The Great Observatories have also made a disproportionately large contribution to advancing public science interest and literacy (Hubble again is the pre-eminent example). Furthermore, the breadth of the science programs that such flagship missions can undertake, along with their ability to respond quickly to discoveries from other missions and observatories, makes them a truly unique scientific resource that benefits large numbers of scientists, their students and their postdoctoral researchers. Hubble’s role in the discovery of planets beyond our solar system, of dark energy, and of young galaxies looking back through 96% of time to just 500 Myr after the Big Bang are some of the many examples of forefront science areas that have touched the popular imagination. 2 JWST will play a similar role to Hubble, except that its dramatically higher performance will lead to an even broader range of studies and discoveries even closer to the cutting edge of astrophysical frontiers. The James Webb Space Telescope Advisory Committee (JSTAC) is an international committee of senior members of the scientific community who are experienced with large space projects and their optimal operation. Given the importance and cost of JWST, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Director set up JSTAC with the support and concurrence of NASA, ESA and CSA. The core focus of the JSTAC is to offer advice on maximizing the scientific return from JWST within its 5-year required life (10-yr goal). The JSTAC’s recommendations to the STScI Director are made available to the space agencies and are also made public to the science community (and all interested parties) through the STScI website. The space agencies are also cognizant of the JSTAC’s deliberations and recommendations through their ex-officio agency members. The JSTAC fully endorses the completion of the construction and the launch of JWST not only because it will dramatically increase humanity’s understanding of the cosmos, but also because it will continue Hubble's legacy of inspiring the next generation of scientists. JWST will also demonstrate technologies crucial for future NASA science missions of all sizes. The JSTAC is very concerned that recent funding and management issues during the development process for JWST may place the future of the mission at risk. The JWST Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) report provided a critical assessment of the recent management problems and budget issues in response to a letter from Senator Mikulski to the NASA Administrator. As the ICRP report noted, technical progress on the mission had been excellent but a number of issues have arisen that require additional funding to resolve. The JSTAC recognizes the fiscal challenges facing the US as well as the international partners, but asks for your support and that of OSTP to work with OMB and NASA, and ultimately Congress, to find a cost effective approach to bring this remarkable mission to fruition. The impact of not moving forward expeditiously towards launching JWST as soon as practical would reverberate far beyond the astronomical science community. The cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) had ramifications for US leadership in the physical sciences that is still being felt. The center of gravity of high energy physics moved to Europe. As a project of comparable scale and scientific importance, JWST is crucial to US scientific leadership both in science and through the visibility of its space program. US leadership in space has arisen through NASA’s human spaceflight program and through its stunningly successful and popular science missions. To abandon JWST at this time would not only have a dramatic impact on NASA’s science programs, but would also have a dramatic impact on US leadership in space.JWST, like Hubble, is a flagship program that has public visibility and scientific capabilities far beyond smaller missions. The cost and the risks of flagships are more than compensated for by the scientific and public interest returns. Our international partners are making very substantial investments in JWST, and are key partners for the US effort. The contributions of the European Space Agency (ESA), its member states and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) are central to the success of 3 the project. Europe is providing two scientific instruments, the launch vehicle and operations staff for the project at the STScI. In value, this contribution is equivalent to the total cost of a medium-sized space mission within ESA. The Canadian contribution of the critical fine guidance sensor and a further science instrument is the largest space science project supported to date by the Canadian Space Agency. The CSA also provides operations staff at the STScI. The international contributions have been essential for the development and implementation of the project and their contributions represent a major commitment of their resources towards a project that will do much to raise the visibility of the US and its technological capabilities. JWST is challenging but doable. No other nation could currently undertake a mission of the scale of JWST. JWST distinguishes the US technologically and scientifically, and is a striking example of US leadership in the field of space science. The JSTAC asks for your support in moving JWST forward expeditiously to launch. I would be happy to provide further information or a briefing on the importance of the JWST science mission from the perspective of the JSTAC.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Imagine for a moment that the globe is inhabited by a single individual who roams free across outback plains, through rainforests, across pure white beaches — living off the resources available. Picture the immensity of the world surrounding this one person and ask yourself, what possible impact could this single person have on the planet? Now turn your attention to today’s reality. Almost 7 billion people inhabit the planet and this number increases at an average of a little over one per cent per year. That’s about 2 more mouths to feed every second. Do these 7 billion people have an impact on the planet? Yes. An irreversible impact? Probably. Taken together this huge number of people has managed to change the face of the Earth and threaten the very systems that support them.We are now embarked on a trajectory that, if unchecked, will certainly have detrimental impacts on our way of life and to natural ecosystems. Some of these are irreversible, including the extinction of many species. But returning to that single individual, surely two things are true. A single person could not have caused all of this, nor can a single person solve all the associated problems. The message here is that the human-induced global problems that confront us cannot be solved by any one individual, group, agency or nation.It will take a large collective effort to change the course that we are on; nothing less will suffice. Our planet is facing several mammoth challenges: to its atmosphere, to its resources, to its inhabitants. Wicked problems such as climate change, over-population, disease, and food, water and energy security require concerted efforts and worldwide collaboration to find and implement effective, ethical and sustainable solutions. These are no longer solely scientific and technical matters. Solutions must be viable in the larger context of the global economy, global unrest and global inequality. Common understandings and commitment to action are required between individuals, within communities and across international networks. Science can play a special role in international relations. Its participants share a common language that transcends mother tongue and borders.For centuries scientists have corresponded and collaborated on international scales in order to arrive at a better and common understanding of the natural and human world. Values integral to science such as transparency, vigorous inquiry and informed debate also support effective international relation practices. Furthermore, given the long-established global trade of scientific information and results, many important international links are already in place at a scientific level. These links can lead to coalition-building, trust and cooperation on sensitive scientific issues which, when supportedat a political level, can provide a ‘soft politics’ route to other policy dialogues. That is, if nations are already working together on global science issues, they may be more likely to be open to collaboration on other global issues such as trade and security. Many countries have recognized the value of science diplomacy. In March this year, the US passed a bill to fund a Global Science Program for Security, Competitiveness and Diplomacy. Earlier, President Obama used his speech in Cairo to announce an expanded team of science envoys in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. In April, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband made the case for research as a political bridge. In Australia, there are two science envoy posts, one in Brussels and the other in Washington DC. In my own role as Chief Scientist, I engage with researchers and agency heads of other nations to improve Australia’s scientific relations. For example, my recent trip to the United States included a visit with Professor Daniel Kammen, Clean Energy Envoy of the US State Department, and previous trips have established a connection with Chief Scientists and Scientific Academy Presidents in Britain, China, India, New Zealand, and the United States. Central to these diplomatic efforts, is the establishment and continued nurturing of collaboration. Scientific collaboration operates best as a network of individual researchers supported by corporate and government policy and investment. The keys then are forging links at the ground level and providing clear and consistent bi-national and multi-national policy and funding frameworks to sustain these links. In Australia, we are in a unique position for international collaboration. Our relative geographical isolation and small world fraction has, from the beginning, necessitated self-reliance and native capacity-building on one hand and the need for strong couplings to the bulk of the world’s research overseas on the other hand. This means that we have strong and unique capabilities to bring to the table and also experience in sharing with and learning from others. Our vast continent stretches from the tropical north to temperate and semi-desert areas, and includes the Southern Ocean and Antarctic territories, a remarkable diversity of environments that are fundamental to understanding the diversity of ecosystems and interconnectedness of the Earth system. Medical research, dryland agriculture, climate science, water management, and tropical and marine ecosystems are just some of the areas in which the world relies disproportionately on Australian expertise. Increasingly, Australia is seen as an important player in the Asia-Pacific region and a link between the cultures of the Occident and the Orient, a powerful role in world diplomacy. As one single individual or one single nation, Australians and Australia is neither the sole cause nor the sole solution to global challenges. But by nurturing existing scientific collaborations and building new ones, we can build bridges of trust and cooperation that will allow a freer flow of knowledge and expertise to the benefit of our nation and our partners, benefit that would not accrue from unilateral action. This, coupled with supportive policies, goodwill, and a desire to use the strengths of our nation for the benefit of humanity will place us, as Australians, as leaders in international scientific diplomacy, and multiply our greater diplomatic efforts on the global stage.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">“American Leadership” is a phrase we hear bandied about a lot in political circles in the United States, as well as in many space policy discussions. It has many different meanings, most derived from cultural or political biases, some of them contradictory. The term sometimes arouses antipathy from non-Americans and from advocates of international cooperation. They may find it synonymous with American hubris or hegemony. It is true that American leadership can be used as a nationalistic call to advance American interests at the expense of non-American interests. But more often it may be used as an international call for promoting mutual interests and cooperation. That is certainly true in space, as demonstrated by the International Space Station, Cassini-Huygens, the James Webb Space Telescope, the Europa Jupiter System Mission, Mars 2016/2018 and Earth observing satellites. These are great existing and proposed missions, which engage much of the world and advance the interests of the US and other nations, inspire the public, and promote cooperation among technical and scientific communities worldwide. Yet space exploration and development are often overlooked in foreign relations and geopolitical strategies. Sometimes, the connection between space exploration and foreign relations has even been belittled in the space community. I refer to the NASA administrator’s foray into the Middle East last year, promoting science, math, and technology as a way to reach out to Muslim nations. It is true that he used some unfortunate wording, such as “foremost purpose,” but it was great that the administration wanted the space program to be part of its overarching international efforts to engaging the Muslim community in peaceful pursuits. Apollo and the International Space Station were both accomplishments motivated more by international and geopolitical interests than they were by space enthusiasm. It’s my view that space ventures should be used to advance American engagement in the world. (For example, with China on the space station and Russia in Mars Sample Return.) American leadership in space is much more desired that resented—except when it gets used unilaterally, as in the past Administration’s call for “dominance in cislunar space.” Asian countries (China, Japan, India) are especially interested in lunar landings; Western countries, including the US, much less so. However, cooperating with Asian countries in lunar science and utilization would be both a sign of American leadership and of practical benefit to US national interests. Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin has been a leader advocating such cooperation. At the same time American leadership can be extended by leading spacefaring nations into the solar system with robotic and human expeditions to other worlds. The US can’t do everything alone. Climate monitoring, Earth observation, space weather prediction, and ultimately asteroid deflection are huge and vital global undertakings that require international participation. That is also true with exploration projects sending robots and human to other worlds. American leadership in these areas is welcomed and used by other countries, even as they develop their own national programs. The US government should make more of this and not treat it as an afterthought—or even worse, prohibit American leadership as the House of Representatives is doing this week by banning any China collaboration or cooperation. (The proposed House continuing resolution for fiscal year 2011 prohibits OSTP or NASA funds to be used for anything to do with China.) On a bigger stage I was struck by the demands of the Egyptian protesters over the past few weeks for American leadership and engagement in reforming their country, while at the same time strongly resenting any American interference in their country. This demand for American leadership and opposition to American hegemony may seem inconsistent. It is not: it only emphasizes the need to recognize the difference and use leadership for cooperation and engagement. If we Americans do this in the space program, we will accomplish more in our many Earth, space science, and exploration projects, and we will raise higher the importance of the space program on the national and international political agenda.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">In 2009 global tensions create an atmosphere where nations increasingly test new defensive technology. In 2010 India explodes a satellite out of Low-Earth orbit (LEO) and the USA tests an orbital interceptor. Gazprom invests $1 billion in the development of a nanotechnology research lab. There is also a steady erosion of Outer Space Treaty norms and limits to protect commerce. By 2013 NATO is dissolved, seen as no longer relevant. The EU alliance shifts towards defending its borders. Human spaceflight continues, in an increasingly competitive atmosphere. The USA launches Aries I, with a crew. Generation Y seems more interested in environmental issues than space. By 2014 many nations begin deploying anti-satellite (ASAT) technology. In 2015 China, the USA, India and Russia field rival ASATs in orbit, as LEO orbits are at risk from debris. Commercial interests give up on LEO and eye the Moon, which fuels the race to establish a presence there. An increasingly protectionist USA leaves the World Trade Organization (WTO). In response, China recalls its debts from the USA. Meanwhile, European and Asian growth continues and, in 2018, a Chinese factory begins production of bulk carbon nanotubes. The USA and China race to produce the first space elevator. The civil lunar programs move forward. By 2020 a joint US–EU team land on and ‘reclaim’ the Moon. Lunar bases and the space elevator are established, as resources continue to dwindle on earth. Rival moon bases compete over mining rights and orbital lasers promote a defensive arms race in space. NATO is replaced by a new European Defence Organization (EDO). A coalition emerges, including the USA, the EU and India, in opposition to Russia and China. By 2025 African nations reject the influence of major powers and, thanks to the proliferation of technology, become space powers in their own right. In 2028 major powers withdraw from the Outer Space Treaty. Saudi oil fields are now officially empty, and the lunar colonies' major export is solar power. Military bases on the Moon defend against rival solar farms. A Russian–Chinese coalition attacks the space elevator, which essentially strands the US–EU lunar colonies and seriously impairs energy availability on Earth. The UN breaks down and is dismantled. Treaties are ignored and tensions increase. The earth is highly militarized, and conflict occurs both on earth and in space. The future is tense, dark and uncertain. By 2030 Californian scientists claim to have discovered an alleged artificial signal from outer space. The signal offers the possibility of a new reason for hope. 4.4. Group observations on Scenario A In this scenario technological breakthroughs add to the rule of force rather than providing a means for international cooperation. States come together and drift apart based on their perceived interests. The group acknowledged the importance of “giving teeth” to the Outer Space Treaty and other treaties in order to enhance means of overcoming conflict in the future. However, treaties do erode when states or blocs of states perceive these no longer to serve their interests. Further, norms of the Outer Space Treaty may be eroded through the commercialization of space, rather than by conflict and militarization. The group recognized that cooperation is possible on some, but not all, issues. Following the Chinese recent ASAT test there were efforts to clarify the situation for all parties concerned and prevent repeat occurrences. This suggests in part that the UN breaking down is not realistic, and that there might be greater political will to move in a collaborative direction than the scenario suggests. The competition for resources breaks down liberal order and traps states into a situation where the rule of force is perceived as the only option. In this scenario democracies are not less likely to militarize. Politicians bear the responsibility for the implications of their actions. NASA remains a remnant of the Cold War, while the EU space plan is geared towards a broader array of concerns. The voice of civil society is then squashed. (There is also an option of a scenario where, instead of the EU, China becomes a regional champion, bringing other regional leaders like Brazil under a new transparent framework.) The rule of force is also justified for the protection of investments. An entity such as the US-Soviet Standing Consultative Commission (SCC), which was convened when one side thought there had been a violation by the other, might be helpful. Driving factors come not necessarily from the bottom or the top, but rather from mid-level officials who can promote a discussion on the consequences of space weaponization. It is important to reach out to the non-space community, to help a wider constituency relate to the issues and take greater interest. Getting away from focusing on big, one-off, prestige programs is one way to elicit such an interest. Technological innovation, while important, does not necessarily lead to an advantage for the country of origin. Rapid dissemination of technologies among a certain community can affect the security of the countries of origin. For this reason, if weaponization of space is inevitable, countries should operate as much as possible in a collaborative, transparent fashion. This suggests the utility of a global regime controlling the technology. Cooperative leadership among youth could be developed to help ensure future cooperation. This group underlines the importance of reaching young people today in order to stimulate awareness in the next generation of leaders of the negative spirals that could develop. All parties must be made aware that it is in no one's interest to attack each other's satellites; both sides need the information and need freedom to access space. A non-interference pact could be developed, which might name the kinds of weapons not to be used.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">An unchecked race to militarize space is underway that is “increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war while shortening the time for sanity and diplomacy to come into play to halt crises,” an authority on space warfare says. By 2025, the space capabilities of the leading space powers---the U.S., Russia, India and China---will be roughly equal “due to information sharing in a globalized economy,” says noted space researcher Matt Hoey in an exclusive interview. Hoey is international military space technology forecaster who provides analysis on issues related to technology proliferation and arms control. He is also a former senior research associate at the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies and has contributed to publications such as the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and the Space Review. Through their military and commercial research facilities, the world’s military powers are pursuing development of a reusable, unmanned, hypersonic, space-strike delivery platform that “would permit rapid precision strikes worldwide in 120 minutes or less,” Hoey said. The strike platform could loiter in near-space or in low earth orbit and assault terrestrial targets at incredible speed “with a nuclear or conventional payload and then return to any base in the world on demand,” he explained. While “there will not be a dedicated ‘space war’ in our lifetimes or our children’s,” Hoey said, “we are likely to witness acts of space warfare being committed…in concert with other theatres of combat” on land, sea, and air and cyber space.” Hoey said his research analysis suggests: “Back and forth escalation regarding military space capabilities would fuel each nation’s respective space industries as would commercial space races driven by national pride.” “If these systems are deployed in space we will be tipping the nuclear balance between nations that has ensured the peace for decades,” Hoey continued. “The military space race will serve the defense industry much like the cold war and this is already being witnessed in relation to missile defense systems.” Hoey pointed out the arms control community “is still trying to put the nuclear genie from decades ago back in the bottle” and adds “once this new genie(space war) is out it is not going back in anytime soon, either.” The five treaties governing space “are highly outdated,” Hoey said, notably the milestone “Outer Space Treaty” of 1967. Theoretically, the U.S. is also bound by The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 that declares our “activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.” (Rep. Dennis Kucinich(D-Ohio), in introducing a bill to ban the weaponization of space, charged the Bush administration with breaking with that policy by “putting weapons in outer space to give the U.S. the power to control the world.” Kucinich charged “the Air Force is seeking permission to put both offensive and defensive weapons in space.”) Hoey said the research community is expecting space warfare systems to come from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA) and the Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL). But instead of doing straight military R&amp;D in-house, the Pentagon is funding civilian research that has dual-purpose use capabilities---civilian applications as well as military. Because military space race technologies are the same as those needed to explore the heavens, service the international space station and defend against threats from near earth objects, the civilian-military partnerships “present the most challenging dilemma for the arms control community,” Hoey said. That’s because arms control proponents cannot object to their military applications without also opposing “technologies that benefit mankind.” And he warned this will continue to be the case as long as existing treaties fail to differentiate between commercial and military space technology. Because their overlap is “overwhelming,” Hoey noted, in that “systems that destroy can also create and facilitate discoveries,” it behooves the international arms control community to act before our military and commercial industries become “inextricably integrated with military space systems and unable to extract themselves.” Hoey said the defense community is actively scouting students still enrolled in high school who have demonstrated a talent in aerospace, cryptology and computer security for military research, “in an attempt to compete with emerging science and technology rivals such as China and India.” This would place future generations who dream of discoveries on a fast track towards the defense industry, Hoey said, even if they land jobs in the private sector. As dual-usage progresses, far more space technology roads will lead to careers that contribute to the development space warfare-enabling technologies. Companies engaged in nanotechnology, robotics and Artificial Intelligence are also being wooed by the military with fat checks, Hoey said. “These (space exploration and space warfare) systems are being developed through multi-tiered collaborations that include NASA, the Defense Department, universities, big defense contractors and small space start- ups. “The work force consists of military scientists and engineers, students, scientists, and even foreign nationals” ultimately enabling technology proliferation globally. For an arms control community that is focusing primarily on banning specific space weapons currently in development, nearing deployment, and in some cases already deployed, efforts should also be focused towards lobbying the international community to begin establishing rules of the road that differentiate between peaceful commercial space technologies and destructive military space applications before the lines between the two are irreversibly blurred, Hoey urged. By doing so, “next generation space warfare systems and space security threats can, as a result, be prevented long before they have a chance to further undermine peace in outer space and increase the probability of nuclear war,” he said.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The latest U.S. House of Representatives appropriations bill seeks to cut funding for NASA by $1.6 billion, and in the process eliminate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project. While it is undeniable that the project has had large cost overruns and is behind schedule, it is also very clear that the project will once complete be a tool of enormous worth to the scientific community — and, through them, to the general population — not just in the U.S. but in the entire world. JWST was supposed to be finished by June 2014 and to cost about $5.1 billion. An independent review panel, however, last fall determined it would likely cost $6.5 billion and not be finished until September 2015. This is of course not a good thing, but it’s nothing new. In fact, there was a NASA project that was supposed to launch in 1983, but didn’t make it into space until 1990, and by the time it launched it had cost triple its original budget — about $11 billion in 2011 dollars. In the 21 years since its launch it has cost many billions more in servicing missions. I refer, of course, to the Hubble Space Telescope, whose cost overruns were outlined in a General Accounting Office (now Government Accountability Office) report in 1992 (PDF). Yes, Hubble has cost the U.S. a substantial amount of money, but its contributions to science have been of incalculable worth: the way we look at the universe has changed in ways we could never have predicted before the telescope’s launch. And JWST will be a much, much better telescope than Hubble, and not just because it has the benefit of decades-better technology. Not only will it be in a much higher orbit than Hubble, but it will be substantially larger and thus able to collect considerably more detailed and more distant observations. Scientists have some educated guesses as to what kinds of discoveries JWST could make, but it’s very likely that, as it was with Hubble, manythings it will find are so revolutionary they’re simply beyond our ability to predict. This would not be the first time Congress has struck down a major scientific project in the middle of its production. In 1993 Congress eliminated funding for the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) project because of predicted substantial cost overruns. The SSC would have, had it been completed, been nearly three times the size of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Europe and would have gone online considerably earlier. Who knows where particle physics would be today if the discoveries being made only now with the LHC had been made ten or fifteen years ago? And it’s not just the scientific discoveries made by the final product that are significant: There have been many technological advances made in the process of the telescope’s creation, just as there were when Hubble was constructed. It would be senseless to throw away the $3 billion already spent on JWST and to forego discoveries we can only imagine right now.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Chairman Baird, Ranking Member Ehlers, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to discuss science diplomacy at the U.S. Department of State. The U.S. is recognized globally for its leadership in science and technology. Our scientific strength is both a tool of “soft power” – part of our strategic diplomatic arsenal – and a basis for creating partnerships with countries as they move beyond basic economic and social development. Science diplomacy is a central element of the Secretary’s transformational diplomacy initiative, because science and technology are essential to achieving stability and strengthening failed and fragile states. S&amp;T advances have immediate and enormous influence on national and global economies, and thus on the international relations between societies. Nation states, nongovernmental organizations, and multinational corporations are largely shaped by their expertise in and access to intellectual and physical capital in science, technology, and engineering. Even as S&amp;T advances of our modern era provide opportunities for economic prosperity, some also challenge the relative position of countries in the world order, and influence our social institutions and principles. America must remain at the forefront of this new world by maintaining its technological edge, and leading the way internationally through science diplomacy and engagement. Science by its nature facilitates diplomacy because it strengthens political relationships, embodies powerful ideals, and creates opportunities for all. The global scientific community embraces principles Americans cherish: transparency, meritocracy, accountability, the objective evaluation of evidence, and broad and frequently democratic participation. Science is inherently democratic, respecting evidence and truth above all. Science is also a common global language, able to bridge deep political and religious divides. Scientists share a common language. Scientific interactions serve to keep open lines of communication and cultural understanding. As scientists everywhere have a common evidentiary external reference system, members of ideologically divergent societies can use the common language of science to cooperatively address both domestic and the increasingly transnational and global problems confronting humanity in the 21st century. There is a growing recognition that science and technology will increasingly drive the successful economies of the 21st century. Science and technology provide an immeasurable benefit to the U.S. by bringing scientists and students here, especially from developing countries, where they see democracy in action, make friends in the international scientific community, become familiar with American technology, and contribute to the U.S. and global economy. For example, in 2005, over 50% of physical science and engineering graduate students and postdoctoral researchers trained in the U.S. have been foreign nationals. Moreover, many foreign-born scientists who were educated and have worked in the U.S. eventually progress in their careers to hold influential positions in ministries and institutions both in this country and in their home countries. They also contribute to U.S. scientific and technologic development: According to the National Science Board’s 2008 Science and Engineering Indicators, 47% of full-time doctoral science and engineering faculty in U.S. research institutions were foreign-born. Finally, some types of science – particularly those that address the grand challenges in science and technology – are inherently international in scope and collaborative by necessity. The ITER Project, an international fusion research and development collaboration, is a product of the thaw in superpower relations between Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan. This reactor will harness the power of nuclear fusion as a possible new and viable energy source by bringing a star to earth. ITER serves as a symbol of international scientific cooperation among key scientific leaders in the developed and developing world – Japan, Korea, China, E.U., India, Russia, and United States – representing 70% of the world’s current population.. The recent elimination of funding for FY08 U.S. contributions to the ITER project comes at an inopportune time as the Agreement on the Establishment of the ITER International Fusion Energy Organization for the Joint Implementation of the ITER Project had entered into force only on October 2007. The elimination of the promised U.S. contribution drew our allies to question our commitment and credibility in international cooperative ventures. More problematically, it jeopardizes a platform for reaffirming U.S. relations with key states. It should be noted that even at the height of the cold war, the United States used science diplomacy as a means to maintain communications and avoid misunderstanding between the world’s two nuclear powers – the Soviet Union and the United States. In a complex multi-polar world, relations are more challenging, the threats perhaps greater, and the need for engagement more paramount. Using Science Diplomacy to Achieve National Security Objectives The welfare and stability of countries and regions in many parts of the globe require a concerted effort by the developed world to address the causal factors that render countries fragile and cause states to fail. Countries that are unable to defend their people against starvation, or fail to provide economic opportunity, are susceptible to extremist ideologies, autocratic rule, and abuses of human rights. As well, the world faces common threats, among them climate change, energy and water shortages, public health emergencies, environmental degradation, poverty, food insecurity, and religious extremism. These threats can undermine the national security of the United States, both directly and indirectly. Many are blind to political boundaries, becoming regional or global threats. The United States has no monopoly on knowledge in a globalizing world and the scientific challenges facing humankind are enormous. Addressing these common challenges demands common solutions and necessitates scientific cooperation, common standards, and common goals. We must increasingly harness the power of American ingenuity in science and technology through strong partnerships with the science community in both academia and the private sector, in the U.S. and abroad among our allies, to advance U.S. interests in foreign policy. There are also important challenges to the ability of states to supply their populations with sufficient food. The still-growing human population, rising affluence in emerging economies, and other factors have combined to create unprecedented pressures on global prices of staples such as edible oils and grains. Encouraging and promoting the use of contemporary molecular techniques in crop improvement is an essential goal for US science diplomacy. An essential part of the war on terrorism is a war of ideas. The creation of economic opportunity can do much more to combat the rise of fanaticism than can any weapon. The war of ideas is a war about rationalism as opposed to irrationalism. Science and technology put us firmly on the side of rationalism by providing ideas and opportunities that improve people’s lives. We may use the recognition and the goodwill that science still generates for the United States to achieve our diplomatic and developmental goals. Additionally, the Department continues to use science as a means to reduce the proliferation of the weapons’ of mass destruction and prevent what has been dubbed ‘brain drain’. Through cooperative threat reduction activities, former weapons scientists redirect their skills to participate in peaceful, collaborative international research in a large variety of scientific fields. In addition, new global efforts focus on improving biological, chemical, and nuclear security by promoting and implementing best scientific practices as a means to enhance security, increase global partnerships, and create sustainability.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">I closed my column last week saying, “Like the faded maritime powers of the 16th century, Russia is headed to be in space what Portugal and Holland became on the oceans: forgotten explorers. There is a lesson for the US here: Things can change quickly.” They sure do. Eleven months ago fans of space exploration cheered as President Obama, for the first time since John Kennedy, went on the road to support a program for a new venture of human exploration: “We’ll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for the first time in history. By the mid-2030s, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth. And a landing on Mars will follow.” Then Congress went to work and, today, we have no coherent human space exploration goals, objectives, or program. We instead have a weak jobs program, spending money on a cancelled project and ordering a new rocket-to-nowhere project. In that same speech the president said, “We will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar system” and “We will increase Earth-based observation to improve our understanding of our climate and our world.” In his very next budget submission last month, with still no budget passed by Congress for the current fiscal year, he proposed elimination of robotic precursor missions, a decrease in planetary science funding, and delays of vitally needed Earth science missions (a need which just increased as a result of the loss of Glory). All of the proposed increases that were submitted to Congress last year (and which they failed to act upon) are eliminated. In addition, the budget submission ignored the James Webb Space Telescope and the future Mars program—kicking the can of their consideration down the road. NASA is now not just paralyzed, but its vital signs are weakening. Later today the National Academy of Sciences Planetary Decadal Survey report is being released. The Survey was to evaluate a plethora of planetary exploration riches and decide priorities in order to reap rewards from a new era of exploration. International flagships would be sent to Mars and the Outer Planets while smaller ships were to continue making new discoveries throughout the solar system. Instead, as the report indicates, there will be no plethora of riches; we’ll be lucky to get a collection of rags. The Survey team accepted guidelines and constraints imposed by the agency for both cost and budget and came up with the inevitable result: we can’t continue Mars landers and we can’t have an Outer Planets Flagship. We will not search nearby worlds for signs of extraterrestrial life, and we’ll accept a new era with fewer missions and less science. Human space exploration was torpedoed last year. This year the robots are being fired upon. It is my view that without space exploration—new adventures to new worlds and scientific discovery about our universe—there will be little reason for NASA’s existence and the space agency will wither as its public support diminishes. I am not sure about the European reaction to the diminishing of plans for the joint Mars lander program and Outer Planets Flagship, but I am not optimistic about Europe’s independent ability to take over space exploration. Interfax reported this week that Russia has developed a “space strategy” that includes the exploration and development of the moon, Mars, and beyond. (Was this a reaction to my criticism of last week? I wish I had that power.) Maybe the tide will turn again—for as I said, things change quickly. Right now it seems that America is headed for exploration oblivion.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&quot;When people think of NASA, they think of Mars Exploration Rovers or finding water on the moon, but a big part of our mission is to study earth from space, to advance scientific understanding and meet societal needs,&quot; Irwin said. SERVIR team members gather and process satellite data, combine it with ground observations, analyze results and quickly pass along the resulting information to assist scientists, educators and foreign government leaders. The SERVIR team is currently assisting the rescue effort in Haiti, using NASA and commercial satellite data to create maps of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. The data pinpoints the building-by-building damage caused by last week's massive earthquake. &quot;We are providing a bird's eye view of the heavily damaged areas, and making that information available to the response teams,&quot; Irwin said. In November, Hurricane Ida brought heavy rains that triggered flooding and mudslides in El Salvador, killing almost 200 people, leaving thousands homeless and causing more than $150 million in damage. The NASA satellite images provided by SERVIR mapped the mud flow and assisted officials in understanding the full extent of the hurricane's damage and how it could be avoided in the event of future disasters. That same month, a major algae bloom spread across Lake Atitlan, a picturesque Guatemalan lake surrounded by steep volcanoes and Mayan settlements. NASA's satellite images showed the scope of the contamination and helped mobilize government action to begin dealing with the pollution. In 2006, when severe weather caused flooding and landslides in Panama, the SERVIR team provided rain forecasts and damage projections, which prompted life-saving evacuations. In 2007, the system was utilized to assess the damage and chart six different disasters including forest fires in Belize and flooding in Mexico due to Hurricane Dean. Irwin, a native of Rockville, Md., created the SERVIR program in 2005 and today manages the operation from the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. SERVIR has a supercomputer center in Panama City, Panama, that integrates data from a variety of sources and displays real time mapping. The program recently opened a regional office in Nairobi, Kenya, as well. &quot;My vision is to create a sustained and strengthened capacity of the people in the countries where we work,&quot; Irwin said. Although NASA leads SERVIR, the U.S. Agency for International Development plays a key role in working with the various countries to use the data to bring about positive change. The Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey also offer indirect support to the program. Woody Turner, Irwin's boss at NASA's headquarters in Washington, said his colleague brings &quot;passion and high energy&quot; to the job and an unwavering commitment to help people in Central America and other developing regions of the world. He praises Irwin, a fluent Spanish speaker, for engaging countries around the world and giving them a major role and stake in the entire enterprise. &quot;Government sometimes gets a bad name, but government is made up of people, and there is no better example than Dan Irwin of someone who uses his position in government to help other people and to make a real difference,&quot; Turner said. &quot;Individuals do matter. Even with all of NASA's technical capabilities, this program never would have come together without Dan.&quot; Last year, Irwin had the opportunity to address the leaders of the Central American nations about climate change, showing them satellite data and images of deforestation in the region and illustrating the environmental problems those countries are facing. &quot;When I travel to Central America or Africa and meet with university professors, nonprofit organizations and government agencies, I get incredible feedback on how the NASA data has improved their decision- making, whether it involves deforestation, how natural disasters are affecting their countries or the research and modeling we have provided on air quality,&quot; Irwin said.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">In fact, when compared to all other environmental problems, human caused extinctions are likely to be of far greater concern. Extinction is the permanent destruction of unique life forms and the only irreversible ecological change that humans can cause. No matter what the effort or sincerity of intentions, extinct species can never be replaced. “From the standpoint of permanent despoliation of the planet,” Norman Meyers observes, no other form of environmental degradation “is anywhere so significant as the fallout of species.” Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson is less modest in assessing the relative consequences of human-caused extinctions. To Wilson, the worst thing that will happen to earth is not economic collapse, the depletion of energy supplies or even nuclear war. As frightful as these events might be, Wilson reasons that they can “be repaired within a few generations. The one process ongoing that will take millions of years to correct is the loss of genetic and species diversity by destruction of natural habitats.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Penicillin, one of the most important discoveries in medical history, was found purely by accident. Today, with the furious scramble to treat and cure diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS, drugs are engineered rather than stumbled upon. As important as treatment is to the victims of disease, the ability to track and predict outbreaks can help prevent entire populations from ever succumbing to a given illness. Surprisingly enough, space exploration has resulted in new ways to fight disease at both the drug development and epidemiological levels. For the most part, drugs are not so much &quot;discovered&quot; anymore. They are designed. Scientists can now target a specific protein of a pathogen–be it bacterial or viral– to maximize a drug’s effectiveness while at the same time minimizing possible side effects. This method, known as rational drug design, has one major downside. The exact structure of the target protein must be determined, down to the last molecule. To uncover this molecular structure, scientists use x-ray crystallography. A crystal of the protein is bombarded with x-rays to produce a pattern which, much like a fingerprint, reveals the identity of the protein’s atomic structure. But to get an accurate pattern, the crystal must be as free of imperfections as possible. Growing such crystals can be extremely difficult, even impossible, on Earth because gravity causes the crystals to settle on top of one another resulting in structural flaws. So, how do you grow crystals without gravity getting in the way? This is where NASA has been able to help out. In the microgravity of space, the 3-dimensional structures of crystals can form flawlessly and achieve larger sizes. Protein crystals grown on Space Shuttle missions provide scientists with up to 40% more information than crystals grown on Earth. In fact, NASA missions have led to the discovery of 30 protein structures and several novel drugs that are in various stages of clinical trials. Close to completion is a treatment for T-cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of cancer. Drugs to treat psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis are also on the way. Potential treatments or cures for diseases ranging from influenza to diabetes are being developed based on protein structures. Many of these target protein structures could not have been determined without the help of crystals grown in space. Chagas disease is an increasingly widespread, yet largely ignored, parasitic infection that affects an estimated 18–20 million people in Central and South America. The parasite can remain dormant for years, but once active, it usually attacks the heart muscle of its host. Eventually, the muscle becomes so thin that it bursts from regular blood pressure levels. Chagas deaths are often mistaken as heart attack fatalities. Currently, there is no cure. By the early 1990’s, Costa Rican researchers and their Latin American collaborators had isolated extracts from the native rain forest plants that block key enzymes in the parasite. Still, they needed to know the structure of the target enzyme in order to determine exactly what substance in the plants was interacting with it. All previous attempts to grow crystals of the target enzyme had failed, until a Costa Rican astronaut suggested asking NASA for help. Since 1996, Chagas crystals have been flown on three Shuttle missions, and efforts at finding a cure for Chagas have doubled. Project ChagaSpace is an international cooperative effort with seven countries working full-time to find a much-needed cure. Many diseases, such as lung cancer or heart disease, can develop as the result of genetic predisposition or personal lifestyle choices. Others tend to be spread by external agents, or vectors, such as insects or rodents. Malaria, cholera, hantavirus, and Chagas disease are all examples of vector-borne diseases. The ability to track these vectors and other risk indicators helps public health officials prevent or reduce the impact of potentially devastating disease outbreaks. The remote sensing technologies NASA uses to study other planets and monitor the Earth’s environment are very good at tracking these indicators that are associated with disease outbreaks. Populations of disease-carrying mosquitoes increase as the result of certain weather patterns.Deer ticks–the carriers of Lyme disease–are more prevalent in areas with certain types of vegetation. The insect that carries the Chagas parasite is linked to high levels of deforestation, as well as seasonal warm weather. Satellite imagery can be used to track these indicators in the air, on land, or in the sea. Maps indicating areas of high risk can then be developed. Shifts in high risk areas can easily be tracked with remote sensing data, and preventative measures such as pesticide application can be taken as needed. In an effort to facilitate the use of remote sensing in public health efforts, NASA sponsors the Third World Foundation. The organization trains scientists from developing nations to use the technology in tracking diseases specific to their countries. The space agency makes the technology and data sets available for use by these researchers worldwide. In the future, NASA’s role in disease-related research will continue to grow. The International Space Station will offer a platform for microgravity crystal growth experiments. The agency’s arsenal of Earth-observing technologies is expanding as well. More and higher resolution data will be available to public health organizations and epidemiologists. By putting on the squeeze from above and below, NASA is making a contribution in the fight against disease planet-wide.</span><br />

US efforts to privatize space capabilities have focused on key markets, such as space telecommunications, space transportation and earth observation. However, full privatization of assets such as the Space Shuttle is controversial, given the investment entailed and security concerns (Macauley, 2003). In Europe, the focus on more civil-oriented programs facilitates public–private partnerships and the formation of European multinationals in similar key markets. A breakdown of the consolidated turnover of the European space manufacturing industry in 2002 is illustrative, with Telecommunications, Launching and Earth Observations activities accounting for over €3.5 billion out of a total €4.7 billion, which includes Navigation (€80 million) and scientific activities (Eurospace, 2004). The navigation market was expected to grow rapidly by 2010, based on novel technological uses of navigation and positioning services by automobiles, mobile communication users and commercial airliners (EC, 2002), and other commercial applications. Despite encouraging market projections for navigation markets for example, such industries are subject to numerous market failures. The most prominent market failures are related to early-stage technology and risks associated with future market size, as well as uncertainties in the development of competing and existing publicly developed and owned systems and future security restrictions. Thus, it is unlikely that such a project can be undertaken by industry alone despite the existence of optimistic market projections and returns (see Section 3). For example, in the presence of conflict, such as war between two nations or civil war, where adversaries utilize the signals for military purposes, the stakeholders exercising political pressure for or against regionally jamming the signal could range from the UN and the authorities in the country in question, to financial institutions owning shares in the enterprise. Although ultimately the commercial entity is responsible for obeying the laws and regulations of the licensing country, numerous issues relating to politics and international law are likely to turn potential investors with no public involvement away into ‘safer’ and less strategically significant investments. Multi-public–private partnerships (MP3) spread the financial risk associated with high-technology requirements, while easing investor concerns over politically sensitive security issues and decisions. Moreover, the presence of multiple countries in space projects results in more resilient public commitments, reassuring the private firms.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Much of the preceding discussion has emphasized the historical success of prizes but they have some disadvantages. These include: - no provision for up-front cash flow to defray expenses; - duplication of research effort if many individuals or groups compete; - uncertainty about whether the innovation can succeed; and - delays in the pace of innovation if a lot of time elapses before it is determined that there are no winners. In addition, prizes are unlikely to meet other social objectives that government sponsorship in general, or NASA sponsorship in particular, has traditionally pursued. For example, prizes do not necessarily further these goals that NASA has frequently set forth as success measures in its R&amp;D policy: - increase the number of academic researchers; - increase the number of scientists and engineers; - create jobs. 8 - influence political support by way of job creation; - broaden the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in science and technology; and - prop up a particular supplier or group of suppliers to ensure choice (say, to ensure that a range of capacities is available in space transportation by dividing business among companies that offer different classes of vehicle lift) In addition, there are some disadvantages of government-sponsored prizes compared with privately sponsored prizes: - Government typically cannot commit to funding beyond a fiscal year, thus limiting the timing of the prize competition and cutting short the time that might be required for the technical achievement it awards. - Any uncertainty about whether the prize will actually be awarded due to government budgets or changes in administration will weaken if not eliminate incentives to compete. - Intellectual property rights to the achievement may need to reside with the competitor to induce participation, even though the taxpayer, by financing the prize, could fairly claim rights. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Could this concept be applicable to sending humans to Mars? In 2008, X-Prize founder, Peter Diamandis proposed Mega X-prizes including a human mission to Mars. However, in a recent interview, Diamandis stated that it was unlikely there would be a Mega X-Prize geared to a human mission to Mars. &quot;I don't see a Mars Mega-X PRIZE… An incentive prize works when there's a long-term business model and the prize can drive numerous teams to spend the money to play. A private Mars mission is likely a $5B - $10B endeavor and you won't see multiple teams each raising this level…If we ever re-invented launch technology to reduce the cost by 100-fold, then I think a &quot;humans to Mars prize&quot; would make a lot of sense&quot; (Diamandis 2010). While not likely to reduce launch costs by 100-fold, if SpaceX can deliver on its goal of dramatically reducing launch costs, it may bring a Mars mission down to the level where an X-Prize may be viable. In a September 7, 2010 email interview with the first author (Carberry), Elon Musk said he thought a privately financed mission would only cost $2 billion and that a prize would only have to be $1 billion. He added that it would take &quot;ten years from starting fundraising to landing back on Earth.&quot; If Musk is correct, not only would hundreds of individuals in the United States alone have the means to fund such a prize, but hundreds would also be able to fund teams to compete. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Every state has a different view of how title to property is acquired and how property should be distributed and used once title is created. Moreover, a state cannot act unilaterally to appropriate territory or resources at the international level without violating international peace and security.A charter system or private annexation would violate more than the Outer Space Treaty, it would violate general principles of international law that has a foundation in over seventy years of international jurisprudence. In 1928, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands, decided a territorial dispute between the United States and the Netherlands.29The question was whether the Island of Palmas (Miangas), in its entirety, was part of the territory of the United States or the Netherlands. The Treaty of Paris (1898) ended the Spanish- American War and transferred title for the Island of Palmas to the United States from Spain. However, the Netherlands claimed the island was not maintained by nor a part of Spain, and therefore Spain had no right to transfer title to the United States. The Court found in favor of the Netherlands. While the Court acknowledged Spain’s right to acquire the island because it was deemed terra nullius in the fifteenth century, the Spanish title was deemed inchoate, i.e. it was incomplete.‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡ The Court argued that for a state to maintain initial title from discovery, a state must exercise authority either by planting a flag or having a continual presence on the island. The Court ruled Spain did not exercise authority over the island after making an initial claim after discovery.Therefore, since the Netherland’s had exercised authority over the island since 1677, they had maintained title. The Island of Palmas case established three general principles to territorial acquisition. First, title based on contiguity has no standing in international law. Second, title by state discovery is only an inchoate title. Third, if additional states exercise continuous and actual authority, and the discovering state does not contest additional claims, provided in good faith and publicly announced, then the claim by the state that exercises authority is greater than a title based on mere discovery. It is important to note that states are the primary actors in territorial acquisition. Individuals do not have rights of territorial acquisition at the international level since they cannot independently establish title. Hence, Mr. Hope’s claim to Eros is unjustified, illegal and without merit. Therefore, corporations desiring to acquire any natural object beyond Earth cannot independently establish title because it will require the extension of state sovereignty. Of course, extension of state sovereignty is a violation of the res communis principle and the Outer Space Treaty.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Obama administration’s approach will undo that balance. </span>While it has retained and expanded COTS, in many ways to its credit, its cancellation of Constellation raises the stakes for COTS and <span style="font-size: 11pt;">commercial human spaceflight</span> in general. It <span style="font-size: 11pt;">will no longer be an experiment in promoting innovation with the potential to evolve into something more comprehensive. Instead, it will become the government’s primary means of sending people to space. As such, there will be strong pressure on the government to exercise increased oversight and accountability, undermining, if not eventually eliminating, the very flexibility built into the</span> COTS <span style="font-size: 11pt;">concept</span>. Indeed, this is already happening. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">A Congressional hearing revealed an already extant conflict over responsibilities between the Federal Aviation administration, which has legal responsibility for regulating commercial human spaceflight, and NASA, which is responsible for the safety of its astronauts</span>. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Given the nature of bureaucratic politics, it is quite likely that both agencies will impose different sets of standards</span> on commercial human spaceflight service providers. Those regulatory burdens may well flow down to suborbital service providers as well, since NASA has raised the possibility of using those service providers to enable government research. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">A mature industry</span> with a healthy demand for its services <span style="font-size: 11pt;">may be able to respond to and carry such burdens. The commercial human spaceflight industry, which is still in its infancy, may be stifled by them</span>. Of equal concern, it should be noted that the Congress imposed several non-mission related requirements on Constellation, such as maintaining the workforce and using as much shuttle-heritage hardware as possible. These kinds of requirements do not usually contribute to performance or cost-effectiveness, but serve other legitimate public policy goals. <span style="font-size: 11pt;">There is some indication that leading members of Congress will seek to impose them on the commercial industry if the industry becomes the primary means of carrying Americans to orbit</span>.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">While NASA can refuse to learn from its mistakes and continue to insist on controlling all aspects of space exploration, despite its budgetary constraints, the most mutually beneficial option is to require NASA to rely on private commercial providers. The recertification of the Shuttle would require large increases in or reallocations of NASA's budget and could potentially lead to the same inefficiencies that have plagued NASA throughout its history. Instead, NASA should follow the Committee's suggestion, learn from the success of prize-encouraged innovation, and &quot;strengthen ... incentives to the commercial providers&quot; in their development of suitable services to utilize in its ISS operations. By implementing a potentially government-sponsored prize coupled with guaranteed contracts, NASA would serve its own purposes of shortening &quot;the Gap&quot; and would produce additional incentives for innovation in the private commercial space transportation industry. Likewise, by ensuring that orbiting refueling centers are developed, NASA would incentivize and improve propositions of space transportation</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gangale, et al., believe the greatest problem to commercial space corporations “is the huge capital investment that is required to develop a trans-planetary infrastructure.” While some may believe that “government is the problem,” the reality is that developing a private infrastructure will require the utilization of a great amount of resources. Free-market economics cannot operate in such high cost and high risk environments, nor can private firms be expected to take on such large projects alone.Building partnerships between governments and corporations to develop such infrastructure will enable an economic and legal balance providing sufficient solutions without economically overburdening either the public or private sector. To achieve any profit in outer space an economic incentive must be established. Therefore, it will take the collective will of governments and corporations to find the best strategies to implement a viable commercial market for corporations and sustain human presence in outer space. The international norms promulgated by the ius gentium are not directly a barrier for corporations, but merely an element of the market since it can only be the political will that may reshape the commercial space industry.</span><br />

<strong>Privatization fails Businesses aren’t held accountable</strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Salin 2001</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> (Patrick A, Professor at the Institute of Air and Space Law McGill University, Montreal, Canada, “Privatization and militarization in the space business environment,” Space Policy 17 (2001) 19}26 Online)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Private corporations have a de facto equal status to that of public space agencies. The worrying factor in the development of outer space exploitation is that * so far * there has been little in the way of an effective international responsibility (or liability) for wrongful acts that are committed or that bear consequences in outer space. This is the consequence of the fact that no litigation has ever been pursued on the basis of the 1972 Liability Convention or of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, neither of which has yet been tested in terms of benefit sharing [10]. This means that, for practical purposes, the Liability Convention is unworkable. Large private corporations are on an equal footing with public bodies and behave as if they were enjoying a kind of &amp;national' immunity that is commensurate with the size of their project. A good illustration of that observation was provided in March 1997 with the licensing of Teledesic Corp. by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), after intense diplomatic pressure had been exercised by the US delegation during WARC- 95.8 Contrary to its actions over much smaller projects, the FCC did not check any of Teledesic's technical or financial parameters, nor did it even impose an agenda for a project of the magnitude of close to 1000 satellites, according to its original plan, i.e. more than three times the total number of US civilian satellites that were in outer space at that time. Since then, this project has been scaled down two or three times and we are not even sure that it will ever be launched. So far, the fully licensed Teledesic project is nothing more than a huge &amp;paper satellite' system, while the competing SkyBridge project still awaits FCC authorization in order to be operated over North America as part of its global coverage of the Earth. That shows there is always a national state that backs up a satellite operator * public or private * that is active in Outer Space at a global scale. Here we have a paradox consisting in having &amp;national' regulators that license &amp;global' operators, thanks to technology. This paradox fully explains the difficulties that global operators are facing in their relationship with other national authorities [11]. This is inevitable as long as there is no such thing as a World Space Organization under which global satellite operators must be registered and to which they must be liable. The ITU does not provide such a commitment because it is only a technical organization; we may say that global satellite systems have no accountability towards the international community and, even worse, behave by taking into account the ITU's own weaknesses.9 Reforms have been proposed in order to restructure the ITU organization [12}14]. But others think it is better to keep things as they are, with outer space being exploited almost like a lawless &amp;wild outer space', with minimal supervision, under benevolent home state licensing and passive ITU registration. If this situation remains unchanged, no doubt such private operators will inevitably drag their licensing state to the forefront. Unfortunately, in outer space we won't talk about oil spills, but we may in the future see satellite explosions, or satellites colliding with one another, or we may simply notice malfunctions causing a satellite to cease functioning properly, sometimes without being able to really identify the cause of the malfunction or of the incident [15].10 And what about a nuclear accident in outer space?</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">As the U.S. economy moves through uncertain times, America’s aerospace industry remains a powerful, reliable engine of employment, innovation and export income. Aerospace contributed $81.2 billion in export sales to America’s economy last year. 1 Conservatively, U.S. aerospace sales alone account for three to five percent of our country’s gross domestic product, and every aerospace dollar yields an extra $1.50 to $3 in further economic activity. 2 Aerospace products and services are the bedrock of our nation’s security and competitiveness. We strongly believe that keeping this economic workhorse on track is in America’s best interest. To accomplish this, government policies must support a level playing field abroad, our industrial base and a workforce that is aging and needs an infusion of younger employees. This paper explains what’s at stake and how to ensure that the economic benefits of our industry are bolstered and broadened. A High-Skilled People Business The aerospace and defense industry directly employs 819,000 Americans, located in every state of the union — and supports more than two million jobs in related fields. 3 Our people bring a diverse set of skills and capabilities to their jobs: engineers on the cutting edge of advanced materials, structures and information technology; machinists fabricating complex shapes and structures; and technicians from almost every degree field, testing, applying and integrating the latest technologies.</span><br />

It has been obvious for at least a year that the U.S. government would face an extended period of large deficits, and projections of those deficits haven’t changed much since last summer. Yet the drumbeat of dire fiscal warnings has grown vastly louder. To me — and I’m not alone in this — the sudden outbreak of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">deficit hysteria brings back memories of</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">groupthink</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> that took hold </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">during </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the run-up to the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">Iraq</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> war. Now, as then, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">dubious allegations</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, not backed by hard evidence, are being</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline"> reported as if</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> they have been </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">established </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">beyond a shadow of a doubt. Now, as then, much of the political and media establishments have bought into the notion that we must take drastic action quickly, even though </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">there hasn’t been any new information to justify this</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> sudden urgency. Now, as then, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">those who challenge the prevailing narrative</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, no matter how strong their case and no matter how solid their background, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">are</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> being </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">marginalized</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. And fear-mongering on the deficit may end up doing as much harm as the fear-mongering on weapons of mass destruction. Let’s talk for a moment about budget reality. Contrary to what you often hear, the large deficit the federal government is running right now isn’t the result of runaway spending growth. Instead, well more than half of the deficit was caused by the ongoing economic crisis, which has led to a plunge in tax receipts, required federal bailouts of financial institutions, and been met — appropriately — with temporary measures to stimulate growth and support employment. The point is that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">running big deficits</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> in the face of the worst economic slump since the 1930s </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">is</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> actually </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">the right thing to do</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. If anything, deficits should be bigger than they are because the government should be doing more than it is to create jobs. True, there is a longer-term budget problem. Even a full economic recovery wouldn’t balance the budget, and it probably wouldn’t even reduce the deficit to a permanently sustainable level. So once the economic crisis is past, the U.S. government will have to increase its revenue and control its costs. And in the long run there’s no way to make the budget math work unless something is done about health care costs. But </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">there’s no reason to panic</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> about budget prospects </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">for the next</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> few years, or even for the next </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">decade</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Consider, for example, what the latest budget proposal from the Obama administration says about </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">interest payments on federal debt</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">; according to the projections, a decade from now they’ll have </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">rise</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">n </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">to 3.5 percent </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">of G.D.P. How scary is that? It’s about </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">the same as</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> interest costs </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">under the first</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> President </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">Bush</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. Why, then, all the hysteria? The answer is politics. The main difference between last summer, when we were mostly (and appropriately) taking deficits in stride, and the current sense of panic is that deficit </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">fear-mongering has become</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> a key part of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="DebateUnderline">Republican political strategy</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, doing double duty: it damages President Obama’s image even as it cripples his policy agenda. And if the hypocrisy is breathtaking — politicians who voted for budget-busting tax cuts posing as apostles of fiscal rectitude, politicians demonizing attempts to rein in Medicare costs one day (death panels!), then denouncing excessive government spending the next — well, what else is new? The trouble, however, is that it’s apparently hard for many people to tell the difference between cynical posturing and serious economic argument. And that is having tragic consequences. For the fact is that thanks to deficit hysteria, Washington now has its priorities all wrong: all the talk is about how to shave a few billion dollars off government spending, while there’s hardly any willingness to tackle mass unemployment. Policy is headed in the wrong direction — and millions of Americans will pay the price. </span><br />

<span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Nor can economic crises explain the bloodshed. What may be the most familiar causal chain in modern historiography links the Great Depression to the rise of fascism and the outbreak of World War II. But that simple story leaves too much out. Nazi Germany started the war in Europe only after its economy had recovered. Not all the countries affected by the Great Depression were taken over by fascist regimes, nor did all such regimes start wars of aggression. In fact, no general relationship between economics and conflict is discernible for the century as a whole. Some wars came after periods of growth, others were the causes rather than the consequences of economic catastrophe, and some severe economic crises were not followed by wars.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We understand the need for fiscal restraint, and we agree that government needs to live within its means. Spending cuts, however, need to be smart and strategic. Cuts to government-sponsored scientific research and critical research facilities are counterproductive at a time when we are seeking to facilitate and spark economic growth. Such cuts would only hurt our long-term competitiveness, especially at a time when emerging economies such as China and India are ramping up their investments in scientific research and education. Europe seems poised to take over the US lead in ground-based optical and space-based astronomy. Cuts to research and facilities would also have a severe impact on cutting-edge research that is critical to our future. At DOE, the cuts would affect high energy and nuclear physics, magnetic fusion, heavy-element chemistry, nanotechnology, high-performance computing, advanced materials, and structural biology. Proposed cuts to NSF would have even broader and more far-reaching impacts in many other important scientific disciplines. It is time for America to tackle the largest drivers of our debt and deficit, rather than shortchange our future by cutting funding on our most talented students, essential research, and entrepreneurial potential. The Congress instead should look to the bipartisan Senate process that is considering the recommendations of the fiscal responsibility commission. Only reforms of this magnitude can reverse our budget outlook and enable smarter, more strategic decisions about the non-defense discretionary portion of the budget. We know all of our elected representatives seek the long-term success of our nation and the maintenance of leadership in science and technology. The quality of life our children and grandchildren will inherit depends upon the choices you make.</span><br />

<strong>A Mars Sample Return mission is inevitable - NASA’s cooperation with the ESA will send the Aurora mission to Mars in 2018</strong><br />

<br />
In recent years ESA has increasingly used the name Aurora Exploration Programme, or simply Exploration Programme. Although human spaceflight has remained a long-term goal of the programme, with some basic technology development in this area, the thrust has been on implementation of the ExoMars mission and preparations for an international Mars Sample Return Mission. Due to funding shortages on both sides of the Atlantic, these plans for roboti c exploration of Mars are currently (2009) increasingly made in cooperation with NASA. At a meeting in Plymouth on 2009 June 29-30 ESA and NASA created a Mars Exploration Joint Initiative (MEJI) with the aim of planning collaborative Mars missions for 2016, 2018 and 2020, and leading to the return of samples from Mars in the 2020s[3]. The previous main effort of the Aurora Programme, the ExoMars mission, is not explicitly part of the MEJI collaboration and unlikely to be implemented as originally foreseen, but major parts of its science instruments are likely to be embedded in the MEJI collaboration. However, the Italian Space Agency (ASI), a major financer of the Aurora programme, has voiced scepticism regarding the proposed MEJI collaboration, in particular its lack of independent European demonstration of key capabilities for future planetary exploration[4].<br />

<br />
Cambridge, MA, March 21, 2011 – The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has awarded Aurora Flight Sciences a contract to develop a flight-quality orbiting sample (OS) detection and capture mechanism design based on research data and experience with the Mars Orbiting Sample Retrieval (MOSR) test bed. The contract leverages the state-of-the-art research into sample capture mechanisms, contact dynamics and capture mechanism detection methods and builds on Aurora’s experience with the Synchronized Position, Hold, Engage, and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) currently operating aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The Phase 1 effort will initiate a trade study to evaluate the use of the ISS as a system checkout and deployment platform for a risk-reduction test in LEO of the tracking, rendezvous and capture mechanisms. In support of these risk-reduction tests, Aurora will also examine the navigation and propulsion changes needed to enable SPHERES to operate outside the ISS. These efforts will provide the next steps in the transition of the knowledge and experience gained to date with the MOSR test bed towards a practical capture and containment system for use in Low Earth Orbit demonstration flights and Mars Sample Return objectives envisioned for later this decade.<br />

NASA's sole contender for a Mars Sample Return capsule is &quot;The Catchers Mit&quot; approach. NASA intends to return Mars soil samples in a basketball-sized container that will enter Earth's atmosphere without a parachute and impact a predetermined area in the Utah desert for pickup by awaiting specially trained biohazard troops. This design, officially known as Passive Earth Entry Capsule depends on everything working perfectly as planned. However, as NASA's loss of four Mars probes in 1999 prove -- there are no guarantee's when it comes to planetary exploration, things can and do go wrong.<br />

Several other notable scientists have said that they do not like the idea of a direct Earth-entry approach for MSR. Carl Woese, a Nobel Prize–nominated biophysicist at the University of Illinois, Urbana–Champaign, who discovered the third domain of life called Archaea, says, When the entire biosphere hangs in the balance, it is adventuristic to the extreme to bring Martian life here. Sure, there is a chance it would do no harm; but that is not the point. Unless you can rule out the chance that it might do harm, you should not embark on such a course (54). Chandra Wickramasinghe, professor of astronomy and mathematics at Cardiff University, Wales, is a leading proponent of the panspermia hypothesis, which holds that life on Earth was “seeded” from space, and has studied comets and interplanetary dust since the early 1970s. He said, I feel that there is no question that the examination of Martian soil samples must be conducted in situ on the surface of Mars or in a laboratory orbiting the Moon or the Earth to protect the Earth’s biosphere from any possible back-contamination hazards. We are really quite ignorant of microbial life on our own planet, let alone assuming that we know how microbes from another planet, such as Mars, would react here. The study of astrobiology and its implications is still in its infancy as a science (55). Former Viking biology team member Levin says, “I fear that, even if a safe MSR container could be made and brought to Earth, there is a good probability that some of the sample would escape from the ‘secure’ lab where the container would be opened” (56). Levin also questions the scientific benefit of MSR and says, “How could we get a living sample to survive the 9- or 10-month trip without knowing what any Martian microorganisms present in the sample need in the way of substrates, water, temperature, atmosphere, environmental cycling, etc.? Would we ever know whether it started out alive or dead?” He recommends a 10-phase approach to MSR based on his experience working with the Lunar and Planetary Institute and COSPAR (see box, “Safe methods for MSR”) (56). David A. Paige, associate professor of planetary science at the University of California, Los Angeles, was a co-investigator for the Mars Polar Lander Mars Volatiles and Climate Surveyor experiment. Paige submitted a scientific abstract to the Lunar and Planetary Institute Conference held in July 2000, in which he questioned the current wisdom of a faster, better, cheaper approach to MSR. In his abstract, he wrote (57), One of the most prominent aspects of the failed 1996–2000 exploration architecture plans was to accomplish the goal of sample return at the earliest possible opportunity. . . . For the case of Mars sample return, there has been a strong tendency to equate the analysis of returned samples with “good science”, and while it is undoubtedly true that one could do a lot of good science on returned samples, we are a long way from a situation where sample return is necessary to make further scientific progress towards the overarching goal of understanding whether life ever arose on Mars.<br />

<strong>The impact is the wipe-out of Earth – we have no defenses against potential space microbes</strong><br />

a. Back Contamination. &quot;For the public, the truly hair-raising danger comes from bringing alien material to Earth.&quot; n56 Although the scientific record is devoid of any proven example of backward interplanetary contamination, history does contain useful analogies for the arrival on Earth of extraterrestrial microbes. Intercontinental invasive species provide one parallel. n57 One of Earth's most infamous invasive species was Variola major, the virus n58 responsible for smallpox. n59 When European explorers crossed the Atlantic to reach North America in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, they brought the European cadre of microbial pathogens with them, including Variola major, which had long been common in Europe but was new to North America. n60 Variola major and the other microbes proved devastating. n61 Some scientists believe that smallpox and other illnesses caused by European microbes killed as much as 95% of North America's indigenous human population. n62 What made Variola major so deadly was the absence of local defenses against it. n63 In Europe, where the microbe had evolved alongside its host species for millenia, the hosts had evolved defenses to limit its deadliness. n64 Native Americas, however, had no defenses, and Variola major cut through them like a scythe. n65 [*1363] If a microbe from another planet arrived on Earth, the results could be as devastating to Earth's life forms as Variola major was to Native Americans. n66 If the newly-arrived interplanetary microbe proved parasitic, no life form on Earth would have developed defenses against it. n67 The microbe could then proliferate at the expense of native species-possibly humans or another species on which humans depend. n68 The effects of an extraterrestrial microbe might be even more devastating than Variola major's arrival in the Americas. n69 The almost supernatural potency of Variola major, an intercontinental microbe, was at least limited to the area outside of the region in which the pathogen evolved-i.e., Europe-because putative European hosts to the virus had evolved defenses to it. n70 A parasitic microbe arriving from a foreign planet might not be so restricted. A space-traveling microbe could conceivably wipe out an entire species or group of species, because no organism on the planet would have evolved defenses to the invader. In the words of one scholar, &quot;[w]hat if bizarre forms of pathogens exist on planets like Mars? Are we really prepared to bring them home?&quot; n71 Even if an extraterrestrial microbe did not affect humans directly, its effects could be deleterious to the environment. n72 Some scientists who consider it more likely that a foreign microbe could damage Earth's environment than act as a human pathogen have [*1364] described the specter of widespread environmental damage as the &quot;graver concern.&quot; n73 Again, the historical record of invasive species on Earth furnishes an example. American chestnut trees once dominated North America's eastern forests, shading the earth all along the Appalacians with their broad deciduous canopies. n74 A squirrel, it was said, could travel from Maine to Georgia without touching the ground by hopping from one American chestnut to another. n75 Today, the American chestnut has been &quot;virtually exterminated.&quot; n76 The exterminator was a fungus called &quot;chestnut blight,&quot; an invasive species from Asia against which the huge trees had no defenses. n77 Just as chestnut blight annihilated the American chestnut, an alien microbe could decimate the population of any living thing susceptible to it. Conversely, some scientists suggest that the arrival of alien microbes would be nothing new. n78 Scientists generally accept that when meteors or asteroids strike planets, the tremendous impact force can fling chunks of rock and other debris into outer space. n79 These rocks can travel between planets and plunk down someplace new. n80 Some scientists speculate that the space-traveling rocks could have contained microbial life and may have naturally facilitated the interplanetary travel of microbes. n81 Scientists also generally accept that &quot;solar wind ions&quot;-i.e., winds of charged particles emanating from the sun n82 -could have brought foreign [*1365] material into Earth's atmosphere, although the likelihood of &quot;contamination&quot; from solar winds is low. n83 Despite suspicions that extraterrestrial microbes have previously arrived on Earth, there is a strong scientific consensus that spacefaring nations should take careful precautions to avoid back contamination. n84 Even if an extraterrestrial microbe has previously arrived on Earth without causing damage, a subsequently arriving microbe could produce very different results. The example of Variola major is again illustrative. Although their arrival precipitated the death of most then-living American natives, the European explorers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries who carried Variola major were not the first Europeans to visit the Americas. Historians have revealed that Norse sailors reached and explored coastal areas of northern North America almost 500 years before Christopher Columbus made his famous voyage. n85 Although these early Norse sailors had contact with Native Americans through battle and trade, exposing the natives to European germs, the natives experienced no massive dieoff-in fact, they remained strong enough to expel the Norse from the continent. n86 The death wave that rocked the Americas' native population came several centuries later. n87 Although Native Americans' first exposure to European germs seemed innocuous, a subsequent exposure to European explorers and conquistadors like Columbus and Cortez would kill 95% of the Native American population. n88 Similarly, even if Earth's ecosystems have already been exposed to an extraterrestrial microbe, a second exposure could prove deadly.<br />

<strong>AND - The MSR spacecraft will be powered by RTGs – re-entry accident or crash landing risks the death of millions</strong><br />
<strong>Rodrigue 2</strong> [Christine M. Rodrigue - Professor and Chair Department of Geography California State University, “Emerging Risk Assessment and Management Controversies in the Mars Sample Return”, July 2002, <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/bldrmars.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/bldrmars.html</a></span>, Chetan]<br />
<br />
For a number of years, I have investigated the risk assessment and risk management controversy surrounding NASA's use of plutonium-238 dioxide radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and radioisotope thermal generators (RHUs) (Rodrigue 2001a, 2001b, 2001c). RTGs are used to power spacecraft instruments for such outer solar system missions as the Cassini- Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan and the Galileo mission to Jupiter. RHUs are used to provide heat to keep spacecraft instruments operating in the deep cold of outer solar system space. RTGs and RHUs generate heat through the alpha radiation given off by the Pu-dioxide as it decays (JPL n.d.). In the case of Cassini-Huygens, NASA's decision to utilize a Venus-Venus- Earth-Jupiter gravitational assist trajectory (VVEJGA) increased the controversy. The gravitational assists increase the speed of the spacecraft and substantially shorten the length of the cruise to Saturn, 1.4 billion km from the sun. They work by bringing a spacecraft close to a planet in the direction of the planet's revolution, in order to allow an exchange of angular momentum between them. In assessing the risks posed by Cassini- Huygens, then, attention focussed on the pre-launch handling of the RTGs and RHUs, mishaps during launch, and accidents during the flyby which could cause the spacecraft to break up and explode in the earth's atmosphere. Risk assessment done for NASA concluded that the risks involved were trivial, with extremely small probabilities of accidents releasing Pu into the earth's atmosphere and minor health effects in the event a worst-case accident did take place. All estimates for any of the pre-launch or launch phases fell below one health effect or surplus cancer death over five decades, with a 1% probability of from 0.55-1.50 surplus deaths being exceeded. For the flyby manoeuvre, final estimates of expected health effects were 120, with a 1% probability of 450 surplus deaths being exceeded (NASA 1997: 2.20-2.23). Opponents claimed that NASA and the media were covering up the extent of the risk. They stated an accident could give every person on Earth lung cancer and directly cause the deaths of anywhere from 200,000 to 40 million people (Kaku 1997; Grossman 1997). Using e-mail, listservers, and newsgroups, as well as web pages and articles and editorials in print media, a handful of people orchestrated a large political opposition movement to pressure Congress and the President to cancel the launch and later the Earth gravity- assist manoeuvre. This movement was ultimately able to attract the attention of broadcast media through demonstrations and other dramatic confrontations. They did not ultimately succeed in either canceling the launch or aborting the Earth flyby, they did succeed in making the use of RTGs and RHUs controversial (Golombek 2001). Internet organizing was able to circumvent the many filters and obstacles normally encountered in trying to publicize a cause through conventional print and broadcast media (see, e.g., Bagdikian 1992; Herman and Chomsky 1988; Lee and Solomon 1991). Internet organizing is able to take advantage of chain-mail mathematics, that is, the propagation of a few people's messages through recipients' forward buttons to an exponentially expanding audience. A literal handful of people was able to reach an audience of a size and spatial scope normally only the purview of major media conglomerates. In its capacity of distributing agenda-setting power more widely through society, the Internet is a democratizing influence; it equally well empowers demogoguery. Risk management policy-makers will be hearing from more people more often and trying to discern the extent of the emotions' and arguments' appeal among their constituencies. I am now following another emerging risk assessment and management controversy related to the space program: The Mars Sample Return Lander. The purpose of this mission is to collect samples of Martian soil and rocks for return to Earth for detailed study of their elemental, isotopic, and minerological composition, as well as evidence of past climates and geomorphological processes they may contain. The samples will be studied for signs of life, past or present. Return to Earth is highly sought, given the ambiguity affecting the robotic tests on the 1976 Viking lander (NAS 1996). This mission, if approved, could have its first launch as early as October of 2011 and return to Earth in September of 2014 (JPL 2002a). More probably, it will launch in 2014 and again in 2016 (JPL 2002b; Savage 2000). This mission has already raised three distinct risk assessment and management controversies . The first of these is similar to the Cassini controversy: The mission will almost certainly involve the use of RTGs, because of the need for absolutely reliable power output for months on Mars. Because of this, it can be expected that the same parties that orchestrated the anti-Cassini movement will begin to organize against the MSRL. At least one group is already keeping an eye on the mission, i.e., the Global Network against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space (no date).<br />

2. The Moon has gravity and would make working with extraterrestrial soil samples and any putative<br />
microbes they contain less difficult than working in a microgravity environment of an orbital space station<br />
or shuttle module designed for such a task.<br />
3. The lack of a lunar atmosphere and near vacuum conditions greatly reduces the possibility of contamination<br />
to other areas of a potential scientific lunar outpost.<br />
4. Extraterrestrial microorganims in the lunar planetary quarantine laboratory could be tested against a wide<br />
variety of terrestrial ecosystems in enclosed modules or possibly green houses simulating various Earth<br />
environments. This would be done before any samples could be certified for return to laboratories on Earth.<br />
5. Unlimited size of returned samples. Scientific payoff could be much greater. The 1/3 lunar gravity would<br />
permit almost unlimited payloads from Mars or other solar system body.<br />
6. Experiments on the mutation rates of terrestrial microorganisms in the space radiation environment would<br />
advance studies of life on Earth and the potential for life in the universe.<br />
7. Studies involving theories of microbial transfer in space such as panspermia could be conducted routinely.<br />
8. A well planned lunar planetary quarantine laboratory could be perceived by the public and world scientific<br />

 <strong>Global warming is real and undeniable, isolated incidents of cold spells don’t speak to the trend of climate change</strong><br />
<strong>Jones 10</strong> [Jenny, Administration of Air and Water Resource and Solid Waste Management Programs, “NOAA Offers Extensive Proof of Global Warming”, Civil Engineering (08857024); Sep2010, Vol. 80 Issue 9, p36-36, 1p, Chetan]<br />
<br />
Global warming is undeniable. That’s the message of a report recently released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (noaa) entitled State of the Climate in 2009, which reveals that the world’s average temperature has been steadily increasing in the past three decades, the most recent decade being the hottest ever recorded. The report includes the findings of more than 300 scientists from 48 countries who analyzed data on 37 climate indicators, paying particular attention to 10 markers that they say directly correlate with surface temperature: humidity, air temperature in the lower atmosphere, temperature above the oceans, temperature above land, sea surface temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, sea ice, snow cover, and glaciers. The report documents weather and climate events from around the world in 2009 and offers a historical perspective. In particular, it highlights unusual or anomalous events that happened during the year and throughout the first decade of the 21st century. A transition from La Niña, a condition characterized by temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean lower than normal, to El Niño, which refers to temperatures in the Pacific higher than normal, played a significant role in many extreme and, in some cases, deadly weather events around the globe in 2009. In Brazil, pounding rain in the Amazon basin caused the worst flood in a century, which killed 40 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. Thousands more were left homeless in southeastern South America, which experienced the wettest November in 30 years, and approximately 1,500 properties were damaged in Britain’s Lake District when rain caused record-setting river flows. Southern France and the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula saw a North Atlantic storm with highly powerful winds that knocked down power lines and forced airports and railroads to close, while Australia endured three record-setting heat waves. The high winds accompanying one of those heat waves fanned brush fires that took the lives of more than 170 people. The United States experienced its wettest October in 115 years, and Turkey received the most rainfall in a 48-hour period in 80 years. In the central part of the North Pacific Ocean, including Hawaii, several tropical cyclones struck after more than a decade of relative calm. “Extreme weather events are unavoidable,” the report says. “But a warmer climate means that many of these events will be more frequent and more severe.” And the climate is getting warmer. The average global temperature has been on the rise for the past five decades, but it didn’t reach record levels until the 1980s. Since then, the temperature has risen 1 / 5 of a degree Fahrenheit every decade. While 1 / 5 of a degree from decade to decade may not sound like much, the temperature increase of 1ºF over the past 50 years has been enough to cause glaciers and sea ice to melt, heavy rainfalls to intensify, and heat waves to increase in frequency. “Continued temperature increases will threaten many aspects of our society, including coastal cities and infrastructure, water supply, and agriculture,” the report says. “People have spent thousands of years building [a] society for one climate and now a new [climate] is being created—one that’s warmer and more extreme.” On the basis of preliminary data, 2009 will be the 19th consecutive year in which glaciers have lost mass. The 34 widest glaciers in Greenland that end at the sea lost 101 km² of ice area during the year as a result of below-normal precipitation, and over the decade those glaciers have lost an average of 106 km² of ice area annually. In Alaska, northwestern Canada, Siberia, and northern Europe, permafrost temperatures have shown a general increase in the past several decades. In the Antarctic, evidence reveals that the Antarctic Peninsula is warming at a rate five times that of the global average and that the peninsula experienced significant ice loss in the past decade. Sea ice in the Antarctic was “normal to modestly above normal” for much of 2009, and the austral summer snowmelt throughout the Antarctic was the lowest it has been in 30 years of observation. The limited snowmelt can be attributed to changes in the overlying atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere resulting from stratospheric ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increases. At the other end of the globe, the Arctic’s summer minimum ice extent in 2009 was the lowest recorded since 1979, and the timing of tundra plant “green-up” and senescence showed signs of changing, the high Arctic greening up earlier and the low Arctic staying green well into the fall. “There continued to be widespread evidence of the impact of a general, Arcticwide warming trend in surface air temperatures over land, evident since the mid-1960s,” the report says. As would be expected with a warmer climate, the world’s oceans are heating up. In fact, more than 90 percent of the heat that has led to global warming has gone into the oceans during the past 50 years. While most of this warming has accumulated near the oceans’ surface, warming has been observed as far as 6,000 ft below the surface. The oceans expand as they warm, contributing to the rise in sea level that is also being caused by water from melting glaciers and ice sheets. For the past 15 years, the sea level has risen at a rate of 1 / 8 in. per year. If it continues to rise at this rate, it will pose a serious threat to coastal communities within a few decades. “It’s already affecting some areas, including New Orleans and the surrounding Gulf Coast,” the report says. While the climate is warming, some areas will continue to experience cold spells, but those will occur less frequently and will be less intense. In the winter of 2009–10, for instance, a mass of warm air moved into Canada and pushed the cold air south, resulting in a mild winter in Canada but a frigid and snowy one in the Middle Atlantic states of the United States. “A particular year can [include] record-breaking highs and lows in any given location,” the report says. “But, as a whole, global climate continues to warm, following a 30-year trend.<br />

A recent article about the role of global magnetic fields in the loss of planetary volatiles caught my attention. The article addresses planetary climate issues as they relate to Earth, Mars and Venus, but what struck me was this statement: We don’t have a direct record of the sun’s history, but astronomers can study other stars that are similar to our sun at an earlier age. But in fact, we do have an excellent historical record of the Sun’s history – preserved on our nearby Moon. The Sun constantly emits streams of high-energy particles, consisting mostly of hydrogen atoms and ions (protons). This stream, called the solar wind, has been monitored and studied since satellites were first launched. High-energy solar wind flows around the protective bubble of Earth’s global magnetic field and into interplanetary space. Some of these charged particles become trapped between magnetic lines of force, creating spectacular displays of aurora, known as the “northern lights.” The Moon does not have a global magnetic field, so its surface is directly exposed to the solar wind. These charged particles and neutral atoms impinge directly upon the surface, where some of its atoms are retained on the grains, thus creating a recoverable record of matter from the Sun. The antiquity of the lunar surface means a preserved solar record extending back at least several billion years – the average age of the surface units of the Moon. We have measured solar wind gas implanted onto the dust grains of the Moon using the Apollo samples and have a good indication that this record contains some significant information. One curious and obscure relation in the solar wind record recovered from the Moon suggests that the ratio of some isotopes of nitrogen (specifically, the 15N/14N ratio) has increased over the last couple of billion years. This increase is not predicted in current models of stellar evolution; the current interpretation is that it reflects the addition of a meteoritic component, but changes in the solar output have not been ruled out. So the Sun may be evolving and changing in ways we do not fully understand. The Sun literally is responsible for our existence – without it, life on Earth would not be possible. Media coverage of climate change tends to ignore the critical fact that the primary driver of climate on Earth and all terrestrial planets is the Sun. Before we can understand how and why climate changes on Earth (and it has repeatedly throughout geological history), we must understand what historic role the Sun has played in this complex exchange. At any given time, only the uppermost few millimeters of the Moon’s regolith is exposed to the Sun. Because the regolith is continually excavated, buried, mixed and turned over by the bombardment of meteorites, we have a very complex record to decipher. Such a chaotic, random process would seem poised to destroy exactly the very information we need to access and study, similar to the destruction of scientific clues about past climatic conditions on our geologically dynamic Earth. But our nearest neighbor has provided a process that preserves the solar record in ancient regoliths, whereby the solar record is isolated and sequestered for very long periods of time. The dark maria of the Moon is made up of a myriad of individual lava flows, erupted sporadically but continuously, since 3.9 billion years ago, possibly to as recently as less than 1 billion years ago. These fresh surfaces are readily exposed to the solar wind, which implants its atoms onto the dust grains. From the moment the lava flow cools, this fresh surface is slowly ground up and broken apart by meteorite impact (regolith formation). Then, as new lava flows are extruded, they cover the pre-existing surface regolith, forever sealing it off, along with its preserved solar record, from active surface processes. Thus, thousands of individual lava flows in the maria have buried and preserved millions of ancient regolith deposits, all potentially available for study, allowing us to see not only the output of the current Sun, but the solar wind record of some ancient Sun as well. Thus, the dusty regolith of the Moon acts like a tape recorder, detailing the output of the Sun throughout time. How might we find and access these ancient regoliths and read the preserved solar record? These deposits are accessible wherever there is an exposed section of bedrock in the lunar maria. On the Moon, such exposure occurs within the walls of craters, sinuous rilles and other structural depressions. Not only did we photograph such exposures during the Apollo missions, we may already have sampled a “fossil regolith” from a unit that is more than 3.84 billion years old. Finding and sampling more of these buried units will allow us to reconstruct the output and history of the Sun over the course of at least the last 4 billion years. Here is yet another reason to return to the Moon: to understand the history of our Sun, the primary driver of climate and life on Earth. It is ironic that many people who are most ardent in their concern about Earth’s changing climate disparage lunar return because “we’ve been there.” By dismissing the Moon, they are missing one of the most important chapters necessary in understanding the grand story of the past, present and probable future of the Earth and the Solar System. That chapter – holding vital answers necessary for an informed debate about our constantly changing climate – patiently waits for us on the Moon.<br />
<br />
<strong>AND – the Moon is the perfect laboratory for isolating the solar effect on terrestrial warming – predicting future climate change necessitiates an understanding of solar radiation</strong><br />
<strong>Huang and Pollack 10</strong> [Shaopeng and Henry N. - Department of Geological Sciences, University of Michigan, “The Moon - A Witness to the Anthropogenic Effect of Global Warming on Earth”, July 23rd, 2010, <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.geo.lsa.umich.edu/~shaopeng/msgc01-poster.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.geo.lsa.umich.edu/~shaopeng/msgc01-poster.pdf</a></span>, Chetan]<br />
<br />
It is widely believed that the recent global warming is driven by both natural forcing such as fluctuation in solar radiation and anthropogenic forcing such as the increase of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to industrialization. Of fundamental importance to our ability to predict future climate change is to separate the contributions of these two factors. However, the difficulty in separating the two lies in the fact that there is no direct way of isolating their climate impacts based on observations on Earth. Supported in part by the Michigan Space Grant Consortium, we investigate the feasibility of isolating solar effect of global warming on Earth via reconstruction of a lunar surface temperature history based on regolith temperatures. Between 1880 and 1999 the global-mean temperature at the surface of Earth warmed by more than 0.5 ºC (Jones et al., Rev. Geophys. 1999, 37:173-199). During the same period, the amount of carbon dioxide measured in Earth's atmosphere increased by about 30 percent, as a consequence of our ever- increasing use of fossil fuels and deforestation (Crowley, Science 2000, 298: 270-277). Meanwhile, solar activity has exhibited an increasing trend, along with an 11-year periodical fluctuation (Lean, Res. Lett. 2000, 27: 2425-2428). Apparently, both greenhouse gases and solar activity have effects on Earth's climate. Shown in the diagram above are normalized data series of global temperature anomaly, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and solar irradiance over the period from 1880 to 1998. Each data series is normalized by its own range (temperature anomaly: –0.595 to +0.638 K, carbon dioxide concentration: 267 to 384 ppm, solar irradiance: 1364.4354 to 1366.735 W m-2 ) over the period. The Moon is an ideal laboratory to focus on the solar radiation. There is no complication of human activities in the climate system of the Moon. Temperature at the Moon’s surface is determined by the radiation it receives from the Sun. As the nearby satellite of Earth, the change of the mean temperature on the Moon’s surface is a faithful reflection of the solar radiation imposed on Earth’s climate system. However, there is no meteorological record of the Moon that can be compared to that of Earth. Our understanding of temperature change of our own planet prior to the existence of direct instrumental records relies on temperature proxies such as tree-rings, pollen, corals, isotopic ratios of atmosphere as preserved in ice cores or sediments, and borehole temperatures. Because of the absence of life and atmosphere, all the conventional proxies, except subsurface temperatures, do not exist on the Moon. Subsurface temperature is the only known index that can be used for a reconstruction of a temperature history on the Moon; subsurface temperature is an archive of climate change. Temperatures beneath the surface of the Moon, as well as Earth, comprise two principal components: a steady-state component related to the flow of heat outward from its deeper interior, and a downward-propagating transient component related to the perturbations from changes at the ground surface. If the surface temperature is steady, the subsurface temperature (T) is a linear function of depth (D). However, if the surface temperature is not steady but changes with time, the subsurface temperature will depart from the linear distribution. A progressive cooling at the surface will increase the temperature gradient at shallow depth, while a progressive warming will result in a lesser gradient or even a negative gradient at shallow depths. If the surface temperature oscillates with time, oscillations in the subsurface temperature profile will follow. The change of surface temperature in the past is, therefore, recorded as the current distribution of subsurface temperature versus depth.<br />

<strong>Second, a climate observatory on the Moon gives us the observation angle to compare solar and terrestrial radiation</strong><br />
<strong>Huang 8</strong> [Shaopeng - Department of Geological Sciences, University of Michigan, “Surface temperatures at the nearside of the Moon as a record of the radiation budget of Earth’s climate system”, Advances in Space Research Volume 41, Issue 11, 2008, Pages 1853-1860, Chetan]<br />
<br />
Understanding the balance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing energy from Earth is of fundamental importance to our ability to predict future climate. Ground-based observation of this radiation budget is obstructed by the atmosphere. Over the past three decades, several satellite missions have been launched for obtaining measurements from space. Satellite data have improved our understanding of the climate system of Earth. However, the interpretation of the satellite measurements is difficult and sometimes controversial due to the lack of long term continuous monitoring from a stable platform. As the sole natural satellite of Earth, the Moon is an enduring platform without complications from atmosphere, hydrosphere, or biosphere. Because the Moon keeps the same hemisphere towards Earth, solar radiation and terrestrial radiation are naturally separated during daytime and nighttime on the nearside of the Moon. The distance from Earth and the synchronic rotation make it possible for an observatory on the nearside of the Moon to have a disk-wide observation angle and a focus on the sunlit side radiation of Earth. Therefore, lunar records of the radiation budget of Earth are complementary to ground-based and man-made satellite records. The accidentally obtained Apollo 15 lunar surface temperature time series reveal distinct characteristics in the lunar daytime and nighttime surface temperatures. Superimposed on the diurnal and seasonal variations was an inter-annual daytime cooling trend over the observation period. In contrast, there was an upward trend in the lunar nighttime temperature which supposedly is controlled by the radiation from Earth. Although the data analysis of this study is preliminary, both the simple radiation model calculation and the long-term lunar surface temperature time series from the Apollo 15 landing site show that signals of the radiation budget of the Earth’s climate system is detectable on the Moon. Global climate change on Earth is among the most profound scientific, social, economical, and political challenges of our time. This study shows that the Moon is a plausible platform for monitoring the terrestrial climate system, and lunar surface temperature data comprise information on the radiation budget of Earth. The author calls for international effort to develop a network of temperature and radiation observatories on the Moon for the study of terrestrial climate change.<br />

<strong>These views of the Earth are critical to useful climate models</strong><br />

<br />
Critical differences exist between scientists who observe weather and climate and those who attempt to model nature’s complexities. Those who observe the natural, economic, and sociological aspects of climate change see no evidence indicating that human activities have influenced global climate. Actual observations show that climate varies in response to natural forces and that human burning of fossil fuels has had negligible if any effect over the last 100 years. The modelers, on the other hand, believe complex mathematics and broad assumptions can forecast the future of climate, Earth’s most complex system. Models do not yet match observations; however, continuous space-based observation, including, stable, integrating, whole globe views from the Moon, can provide the basis for ultimate creation of useful global climate models. These observations more immediately can provide data for near term anticipation of actions necessary to mitigate the effects of climate change, whether warming or cooling.<br />

<strong>AND - Cap and trade legislation is inevitable – changing attitudes toward climate change</strong><br />

<br />
The bill was defeated after 48 senators voted in favour and 36 against, leaving the bill 12 votes short of the 60 required to ensure it progressed. A further six Senators wrote letters indicating they would have voted in favour, had they been available. Despite the defeat, supporters of the legislation hailed the move as a huge step forward in attempts to curb US emissions. Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer, who helped shepherd the bill, said that the vote underlined changing US attitudes to global warming, noting that when climate change legislation was last voted on in 2005 it got only 38 votes. She added that supporters of the bill would now begin work on a &quot;roadmap&quot; for the next president that could see an amended version of the legislation adopted as early as next year. Under the legislation, carbon emissions from 87 per cent of US power stations, oil refineries and other carbon intensive operations would have been included in a cap-and-trade scheme designed to cut US emissions by around 67 per cent by 2050. Critics of the bill, including President Bush who said he would veto the legislation, argued that it would damage the US economy. But supporters of the bill, including the Ceres coalition institutional investors and a group of leading US energy firms, claimed the package of measures would help create jobs and provide the legislative framework for building a low carbon economy. Environmentalists hailed the vote as a &quot;turning point&quot; in the US debate on global warming. Lexi Shultz, deputy director of the Climate Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the bill had gained such momentum that legislation capping emissions was now &quot; inevitable&quot;. &quot;More senators than ever before supported moving forward on climate solutions, including senators who voiced opposition to global warming bills in the past,&quot; she said. &quot;Americans are demanding global warming solutions. It's a shame they will have to wait another year. But our country will have another global warming debate in 2009 with a new Congress and president. Putting a cap on global warming pollution is inevitable.&quot;<br />

<strong>However, an incomplete understanding of warming, lack of assessment data and accurate models are hurting its chances</strong><br />

<br />
Climate change is a global problem. A global response is necessary, using existing or new vehicles for cooperation. While there is broad consensus that national interests are threatened by climate change, turning this consensus into meaningful action will be difficult. Negotiation takes place in the context of competing national economic interests. The countries most vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate, mostly developing countries, do not have the capacity to cope with these changes and look to developed countries for assistance. Our understanding of how to mitigate and adapt to climate change is still at an early stage. Remedies have been identified, but their effectiveness has yet to be measured. Finally, the data necessary for assessing the effect of these efforts and the mechanisms for sharing that data are partial and incomplete, designed to inform science and not policy. There is still a great deal we do not know about the local and global effects of climate change. Several recent studies identified gaps and weaknesses in climate science activities. One of the main conclusions of this research is that climate science to date has been geared toward fulfilling needs within the scientific community rather than meeting the needs of decisionmakers who must determine how to adapt and respond to a changing climate. Managing climate-related risks requires accurate, robust, sustained, and wide-ranging climate information. Sustained and continuous observations are needed for researchers to evaluate and test climate model accuracy and to identify causes of particular elements of climate change. The international community must address four key uncertainties and gaps in climate research if we are to significantly improve our confidence in climate change prediction and understanding: Incomplete global data sets for analysis and modeling uncertainties restrict the types of studies that can be performed. ■ The lack of observational data restricts the types of climate change that can be analyzed. ■ Multi-decadal changes in daily temperature range are not well understood. ■ Confidence in attributing some climate change phenomena to anthropogenic (man-made) influences is limited. These gaps and uncertainties are directly related to the availability of adequate Earth observations. Earth observation provides the evidence necessary for informed decisionmaking. It supports the monitoring and verification of emission reductions. A comprehensive and global perspective in climate monitoring is needed to understand the interconnectivity of Earth’s terrestrial, atmospheric, and oceanic systems. Understanding the climate problem requires accurate, robust, sustained, and wide-ranging climate information. Masses of data are already collected for atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial phenomena. 3 These data are shared among the research community through various international data centers, but the informational needs of policymakers are different from those of researchers. The primary requirements for policy are timely and consistent access to data for assessing actions and reducing uncertainty. The data (and improved models to use that data) that policymakers will need fall into several categories: ■ Trend data that track the shrinking of the polar ice caps or forests, the presence of gases in the upper environment, or changes in ocean temperature or currents. Depending on the adequacy of predictive models, these data would allow assessment of the rate and nature of climate change. ■ Regional data that enable the identification of specific regional problems to allow for tailored solutions or aid programs. The need for cross border collection complicates the gathering of these regional data. ■ Effects assessment data that would reduce uncertainty and allow policymakers to determine whether mitigation or adaptation policies implemented to address climate change are having any effect. ■ Compliance data to monitor progress in support of an agreement. One of the lessons of the recent climate negotiations in Copenhagen is that ensuring compliance with any future agreement to limit emissions will be politically sensitive for some countries and beyond the technical or financial means of many others. ■ Planning data that provide consistent and timely information that insurance companies, farmers, urban planners, major corporations, and others will need to reduce uncertainty. These data would allow local planners, governments, businesses, and private sector consumers like the insurance industry to assess the likelihood of certain impacts and conduct cost-benefit analysis of different response options (see appendix A for a more detailed discussion of such options). On the international level, this type of regional information is necessary for determining which areas of the world will be most affected and should receive a higher priority for aid, financing, technology, and capacity building. Monitoring and verifying of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is of particular importance. Reaching an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is complicated because of the inherent scientific uncertainty and incomplete understanding of the carbon cycle and warming of the Earth. Recent scientific advancements, however, allow us to conclude with a high level of certainty that climate change and global warming are unequivocal and that the primary driver is carbon dioxide produced by burning of fossil fuels and, to a lesser degree, by deforestation; Currently, identifying trends in GHG emissions relies on weaving together data collected from existing ground-based networks and space-borne instruments, using a process called “trace-transport inversion.” As the United States and other nations consider whether to adopt cap-and-trade policies, they will need a coordinated and efficient system for collecting and distributing data to support carbon markets and to promote transparency and accountability through accessible public information. Better climate information has helped us move beyond the question of whether action to manage climate change is warranted to what types of actions and polices are needed. Information is key to an effective approach to climate change. At a national and international level, many countries are preoccupied with how to ensure that decisionmakers and user communities have access to the types of information that will make the climate efforts successful. This includes coordinated systems for Earth observation, enhanced modeling capabilities, an organizational structure that allows science to be more responsive to relevant policy questions or functions, and places where information can be gathered and made accessible to broad-based user communities. Meeting the needs of climate policy requires a transformation in how climate research is incorporated into public policymaking. 4 “Operationalizing” information systems—investing in the Earth observation systems necessary for producing the right data over the right time and space horizons, coordinating data collection, interpreting and sharing to maximize the data’s benefits, focusing on the human and social science effects of climate change, improving modeling capabilities, and making this information accessible and relevant for a wide range of users—is a necessary step in designing effective U.S. climate policy. It also represents an opportunity for America to demonstrate global leadership and contribute to building global capacity to understand and more effectively respond to the climate<br />
<br />
<strong>Cap and trade is by and large the most effective way to cap emissions and solve warming</strong><br />
<strong>Pew 9</strong> [The Pew Center on Global Climate Change is a non-profit, non-partisan, independent organization dedicated to providing credible information, straight answers, and innovative solutions in the effort to address global climate change. “Climate Change 101 Cap and Trade”, January 2009, <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pewclimate.org/docUploads/Climate101-CapTrade-Jan09.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pewclimate.org/docUploads/Climate101-CapTrade-Jan09.pdf</a></span>, Chetan]<br />
<br />
Cap-and-trade programs offer significant advantages over traditional regulatory policies, particularly in the effort to address climate change. Unlike traditional regulation, cap and trade constrains emissions but lets market forces set a price on greenhouse gas emissions and helps minimize the cost of making substantial reductions in those emissions. Rather than mandating a specific technology, the flexibility afforded by emissions trading markets helps identify where emission reductions can be achieved most cost-effectively. Cap and trade stimulates the development of new technological solutions that can enable much deeper cuts at lower cost in the future—technologies that regulators simply cannot anticipate. Furthermore, emissions trading programs can be designed to cover a wide variety of emissions sources and sectors and serve as the core of an economy-wide GHG reduction program.<br />

Slowly, painfully, we are developing a new policy framework that we hope will enable our society to cope with a changing climate. But currently we do not have in place the necessary “knowledge infrastructure” to make this new system work. As we develop new policies, we are confronted with critical questions of capacity and responsibility for this endeavor. The scientific community has done a great deal to study the nature and pace of global climate change and increase our understanding of these global phenomena—both in terms of what we know and what we do not know. Now, as policymakers, businesses, the international community, and households consider ways to reduce emissions in the hope of avoiding the most severe effects of a changing climate, build more resilient infrastructure and systems to withstand the unavoidable impacts of climate change, and plan for dealing with climate-related disasters, our ability to provide decisionmakers with the information that they need must grow and improve. Among many complex issues, we need to understand climate-related trends as they apply to state and local communities; we must decide how to monitor emissions and check results against agreed-upon reductions and expected outcomes; we must address how to better model the economic effects of emissions reductions plans and a changing natural environment in ways that will help us understand the impact of new climate policies. We need to establish methods of assessing the relative costs and benefits of more aggressive action that will allow us to prioritize actions to take for climate change, and, of course, we need to continuously improve on understanding how and why the Earth’s climate is changing so as to build greater certainty into policy efforts. This is a daunting task for government, which must manage information on an unprecedented scale. Federal agencies will have to translate vast quantities of scientific data into knowledge that can guide policymakers and administrators. Currently, the federal government is generating enormous amounts of data and analysis on the Earth’s climate, on ocean temperatures and currents, on jet streams and Arctic ice melt. Over time, our ability to monitor emissions and understand important feedbacks, including societal adjustments to the policies in place as well as a changing climate, will need to improve and expand. The government does have an excellent starting point with the work of the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the Earth observation functions supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NOAA has made tremendous efforts, working with foreign partners to create the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS). This network seeks to provide global, real-time data in an open, collaborative, and transparent way. But the implementation of GEOSS has not progressed much beyond developing a blueprint for the system.1 To establish a new policy framework for addressing these challenges, the federal government must ask and answer the question: Where do we attain knowledge, process it, and make policy on such an enormous scale? The United States has the opportunity to build the knowledge platform we will need to help inform the hard decisions that lie ahead. The 2008 CSIS report, CSIS Commission on Smart Power: A Smarter, More Secure America, called for the United States to find ways for “investing in the global good.” The report highlighted five critical areas for engagement, including technology and innovation. It singled out climate change as an issue that required American leadership to help establish global consensus and develop innovative solutions to manage a new and complex global challenge. Climate change is a global challenge, but it is also an opportunity for the United States to build its global leadership. Now is the time for the current administration to build up the knowledge infrastructure for climate change. It will clearly take a team effort to coordinate resources, streamline decisionmaking, and disseminate information, perhaps as part of a new National Climate Service, to start now to build this critical knowledge infrastructure. Without the knowledge this infrastructure would establish and a realistic process to manage it, we will be sailing in uncharted waters with rumored and uncertain landmarks.<br />

<strong>Warming is the most likely scenario for extinction</strong><br />

<br />
Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as prosperity) of a nonviolent nature, which, though far in the future, demands urgent action. It is the threat of global warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals from 1993 to 2003 doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes Elizabeth Kolbert, “it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” From the founding of the first cities some 6,000 years ago until the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere remained relatively constant at about 280 parts per million (ppm). At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how serous the effects will be. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, we are already experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in more violent storms, spread of disease, mass die offs of plants and animals, species extinction, and threatened inundation of low-lying countries like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. At worst, says physics professor Marty Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to burn everything up; we’re going to heat the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then everything will collapse.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possibly end life on this planet. Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter at least as serious and considerably better supported scientifically. Over the long run it puts dangers form terrorism and traditional military challenges to shame. It is a threat not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.<br />

DIRECT architecture advantages The DIRECT Advanced Upper Stage (AUS) will use a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne J-2X vacuum-optimized engines for the ascent and Earth departure phases of the mission. In the DIRECT the AUS will be launched first and may have to orbit for extended durations until the crew rendezvous, an architecture design requiring the use of an Integrated Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ICES) EDS, combined with an active cooling system to reduce boil-off to 0.01 % per day. The AUS, once the crew have completed the rendezvous, will serve as the EDS and represents the stage enabling the DIRECT architecture to match the ESAS design. The DIRECT fulfills the ESAS recommendations of utilizing two launches to place all lunar mission components in orbit but, whereas the ESAS requires one small Ares I for crew and one large Ares V for cargo, the DIRECT uses one reconfigurable vehicle, an approach solving many development problems. For example, building two different LVs requires two separate development programs, two operations support programs, and two manufacturing infrastructures, but with the DIRECT approach- utilizing existing Shuttle hardware and infrastructure, there are no such requirements, thereby saving money and time. Mission timetable Because DIRECT utilizes so much existing hardware and requires so little development of new systems, it will be able to commence the first crewed flights of Orion as early as 2012, and manned lunar exploration as soon as 2017, more than three years ahead of NASA's current architecture. This timeline significantly closes the gap between the retirement of the Space Shuttle, planned for 2010, and NASA's first manned flight of Orion which has now slipped to at least September 2015 and may slip still further to April 2016. However, this is not the whole story as it is likely architecture. This will result in the first Ares I Orion flight being even further delayed.<br />

Lunar missions will inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. Apollo-era expeditions encouraged imagination in our youth, fueled American ingenuity and inspired a generation of scientists and engineers. Unfortunately, the apparent lack of public interest in today’s NASA indicates that they do not understand or are not inspired by the current path we are taking. To that end, two of the NLSI’s central missions involve inspiring young people and training the next generation of lunar scientists. From promoting STEM research in undergraduate institutions to supporting graduate student lunar research, it is our mission to reinvigorate and capture the public’s interest in science and exploration. Several ongoing programs to help attain this goal revolve around lunar science, including the NLSI Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, the NASA Academy summer group project on biology and lunar regolith simulant, strong support of the International Year of Astronomy, the Lunar Regolith Challenge (part of the Centennial Challenges program), the Summer Lunar Interns program, comprehensive websites and lesson plan development for teachers, and many more. Exploring our nearest astronomical neighbor inspires the world, and programs such as the LCROSS campaign to observe the spacecraft impact on the lunar South Pole engage amateur astronomers globally. NASA has a critical role in helping inspire another generation through the excitement of our return to the Moon, and NLSI is working with institutions around the world in a vigorous approach toward bringing this excitement to fruition. As noted in the National Academies report “Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future (2007),” “History is the story of people mobilizing intellectual and practical talents to meet demanding challenges... After the launch of Sputnik in 1957, we accepted the challenge of the space race, landed 12 Americans on the moon, and fortified our science and technology capacity.” Just as it did in the 1960s, a renewed focus on lunar science and exploration can inspire all of us and mobilize the nation’s talent to meet the new challenges of the 21 st century.<br />

The United States has begun to lose its status as a scientific and technological leader, and the only way we can hope to compete in the 21st century global economy is if we invest in research and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education. It is vital that we not lose sight of that, even in these tough budget times. As we work to pass an FY 2011 appropriations bill and a budget resolution for FY 2012, I urge my colleagues to remember that our long term economic growth and competitiveness are dependent upon the investments in research and education that we make today. Many high-tech companies cite the availability of a skilled STEM workforce as the number one reason for determining where they locate their facilities. More and more U.S. companies are moving abroad because they can’t find the highly skilled workforce they need here at home. According to 2008 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the professional IT workforce was projected to add a little under a million new jobs between 2008 and 2018. This represents more than twice the rate of the overall workforce growth between 2008 and 2018. If we want those jobs to stay in the U.S., and in Texas, we must continue to invest in STEM education for our future workforce. Our best STEM students have no trouble competing with their international peers, but we cannot rely on just the top five percent. On average, our K-12 students continue to lag far behind their international peers in math and science aptitude. Earlier this year, the National Assessment Governing Board released the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science scores. The assessment found that less than half of our nation’s students are demonstrating solid academic performance and proficiency in science. Equally troubling are the significant achievement gaps at every level between White and minority students. The NAEP revealed that, on a zero to 300 scale, Black fourth-graders and eighth-graders scored an average of 36 points lower than their White counterparts and Black 12th-graders scored an average of 34 points lower than their White counterparts.<br />

<br />
In the afternoon session the talks became focused on more explicitly biological issues. The first talk after lunch was by Danny Glavin (NASA Goddard Spaceflight Centre), who developed the case for biological contamination studies of lunar landing sites. Such studies are particularly important in the context of future human missions to Mars. Is it possible for humans to visit a body and not contaminate it with our organic material? How well will we be able to control contamination once humans are present? The answers to such questions may be learned on the Moon, both by studying the fate of microorganisms carried to the Moon on earlier crashed and soft-landed space probes (many of which have now been on the surface for almost half a century), and by performing active biological experiments. Although the survival of bacteria on surface seems unlikely, the question of survival in permanently shadowed regions, below the surface, or within spacecraft hardware remains to be determined. It will be especially important to assess the degree to which biological contamination extends from sites of human activity on hostile planetary surfaces. This applies not just to microorganisms, whose survival may be unlikely, but to bacterial spores (which are known to be highly resistant to the space environment), and non-living (but biologically derived) organic molecules. Assessing the rate at which the latter may migrate from sites of human activity will be especially important when it comes to searching for biomarkers on Mars. Because the internationally agreed planetary protection protocols are weak for the Moon (COSPAR Category I), experiments along these lines are possible there in a way that will not be possible on Mars: the Moon is the obvious test bed for these studies.<br />

Global Warming And Global Food Security<br />
How many times have we read, in the last 50 years, that this or that environmental apocalypse is going to starve the world? I got my doctorate on the wings of one; at that time it was called “global cooling,” after a 1974 CIA report leaked to the Timessaid that rapidly cooling planetary temperatures could usher in an era of heightened global instability caused by food shortages. In my lifetime there have been a large number of predicted nutritional apocalypses, caused by overpopulation, lack of biological diversity in our food supply, genetic engineering run amok, acid rain, too little ozone, too much ozone and, finally, global warming. If there were futures on the end of the world, I’d go short. The wrong bet won’t matter anyway.<br />

Although the elevated concentrations of atmospheric C02 that raise temper­ature can also raise crop yields, the detrimental effect of higher temperatures on yields overrides the C02 fertilization effect for the major crops. In a study of local ecosystem sustainability, Mohan Wali and his colleagues at Ohio State University noted that as tempera­ture rises, photosynthetic activity in plants increases until the temperature reaches 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit). The rate of photosynthesis then plateaus until the temperature hits 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), whereupon it begins to decline, until at 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), photosynthesis ceases entirely '? The most vulnerable part of a plant's life cycle is the polli­nation period. Of the world's three food staples-rice, wheat, and corn-corn is particularly vulnerable. In order for corn to reproduce, pollen must fall from the tassel to the strands of silk that emerge from the end of each ear of corn. Each of these silk strands is attached to a kernel site on the cob. If the kernel is to develop, a grain of pollen must fall on the silk strand and then journey to the kernel site. When temperatures are uncommonly high, the silk strands quickly dry out and turn brown, unable to play their role in the fertilization process. The effects of temperature on rice pollination have been studied in detail in the Philippines. Scientists there report that the pollination of rice falls from 100 percent at 34 degrees Cel­sius to near zero at 40 degrees Celsius, leading to crop failure.IR ''<br />

This only underscores the Administration's proposal relies on utilizing unproven private businesses as the means to transport our astronauts to the International Space Station. It also should be noted, many of the companies which are expected to bid for these contracts are start-ups. These new start-ups do not have any experience in carrying humans, or even cargo, into space. In addition, even under these corporations' most optimistic near-term proposals, their systems will not be able to travel beyond low-Earth orbit. Some have argued, in this difficult fiscal environment, Project Constellation is simply too expensive and should fall victim to the budget ax. Again, this is not the case. The Administration's proposed plan actually increases NASA's budget by more than $6 billion over the next five fiscal years. In addition, cancelling the Ares system, and the plans associated with it, will cost the taxpayer an addition $2.5 billion because of contractual obligations. On top of these costs, since private businesses have never previously developed a low-Earth orbit system to transport humans to the International Space Station or a heavy-lift system to explore deeper into the cosmos, one can naturally hypothesize lengthy delays and expensive cost overruns for this novel venture. It is also not hard to imagine when the inevitable delays and cost overruns occur that these private enterprises will turn to the government with requests for additional funds.<br />

US efforts to privatize space capabilities have focused on key markets, such as space telecommunications, space transportation and earth observation. However, full privatization of assets such as the Space Shuttle is controversial, given the investment entailed and security concerns (Macauley, 2003). In Europe, the focus on more civil-oriented programs facilitates public–private partnerships and the formation of European multinationals in similar key markets. A breakdown of the consolidated turnover of the European space manufacturing industry in 2002 is illustrative, with Telecommunications, Launching and Earth Observations activities accounting for over €3.5 billion out of a total €4.7 billion, which includes Navigation (€80 million) and scientific activities (Eurospace, 2004). The navigation market was expected to grow rapidly by 2010, based on novel technological uses of navigation and positioning services by automobiles, mobile communication users and commercial airliners (EC, 2002), and other commercial applications. Despite encouraging market projections for navigation markets for example, such industries are subject to numerous market failures. The most prominent market failures are related to early-stage technology and risks associated with future market size, as well as uncertainties in the development of competing and existing publicly developed and owned systems and future security restrictions. Thus, it is unlikely that such a project can be undertaken by industry alone despite the existence of optimistic market projections and returns (see Section 3). For example, in the presence of conflict, such as war between two nations or civil war, where adversaries utilize the signals for military purposes, the stakeholders exercising political pressure for or against regionally jamming the signal could range from the UN and the authorities in the country in question, to financial institutions owning shares in the enterprise. Although ultimately the commercial entity is responsible for obeying the laws and regulations of the licensing country, numerous issues relating to politics and international law are likely to turn potential investors with no public involvement away into ‘safer’ and less strategically significant investments. Multi-public–private partnerships (MP3) spread the financial risk associated with high-technology requirements, while easing investor concerns over politically sensitive security issues and decisions. Moreover, the presence of multiple countries in space projects results in more resilient public commitments, reassuring the private firms.<br />

The Obama administration’s approach will undo that balance. While it has retained and expanded COTS, in many ways to its credit, its cancellation of Constellation raises the stakes for COTS and commercial human spaceflight in general. It will no longer be an experiment in promoting innovation with the potential to evolve into something more comprehensive. Instead, it will become the government’s primary means of sending people to space. As such, there will be strong pressure on the government to exercise increased oversight and accountability, undermining, if not eventually eliminating, the very flexibility built into the COTS concept. Indeed, this is already happening. A Congressional hearing revealed an already extant conflict over responsibilities between the Federal Aviation administration, which has legal responsibility for regulating commercial human spaceflight, and NASA, which is responsible for the safety of its astronauts. Given the nature of bureaucratic politics, it is quite likely that both agencies will impose different sets of standards on commercial human spaceflight service providers. Those regulatory burdens may well flow down to suborbital service providers as well, since NASA has raised the possibility of using those service providers to enable government research. A mature industry with a healthy demand for its services may be able to respond to and carry such burdens. The commercial human spaceflight industry, which is still in its infancy, may be stifled by them. Of equal concern, it should be noted that the Congress imposed several non-mission related requirements on Constellation, such as maintaining the workforce and using as much shuttle-heritage hardware as possible. These kinds of requirements do not usually contribute to performance or cost-effectiveness, but serve other legitimate public policy goals. There is some indication that leading members of Congress will seek to impose them on the commercial industry if the industry becomes the primary means of carrying Americans to orbit.<br />

While NASA can refuse to learn from its mistakes and continue to insist on controlling all aspects of space exploration, despite its budgetary constraints, the most mutually beneficial option is to require NASA to rely on private commercial providers. The recertification of the Shuttle would require large increases in or reallocations of NASA's budget and could potentially lead to the same inefficiencies that have plagued NASA throughout its history. Instead, NASA should follow the Committee's suggestion, learn from the success of prize-encouraged innovation, and &quot;strengthen ... incentives to the commercial providers&quot; in their development of suitable services to utilize in its ISS operations. By implementing a potentially government-sponsored prize coupled with guaranteed contracts, NASA would serve its own purposes of shortening &quot;the Gap&quot; and would produce additional incentives for innovation in the private commercial space transportation industry. Likewise, by ensuring that orbiting refueling centers are developed, NASA would incentivize and improve propositions of space transportation<br />

Further, Dinerman points out that private efforts into space have failed again and again. He refers to dozens of private start-ups that never got off the ground, let alone into space. Dinerman points to Lockheed Martin's X-33 design, which was supposed to replace the space shuttle in 1996. The design never succeeded and ultimately cost the government $912 million and Lockheed Martin $357 million. Amazon.com Chief Executive Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin set up the DC-X program in the early 1990s. Its suborbital test vehicle was initially successful but was destroyed in a landing accident.

Private corporations have a de facto equal status to that of public space agencies. The worrying factor in the development of outer space exploitation is that * so far * there has been little in the way of an effective international responsibility (or liability) for wrongful acts that are committed or that bear consequences in outer space. This is the consequence of the fact that no litigation has ever been pursued on the basis of the 1972 Liability Convention or of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, neither of which has yet been tested in terms of benefit sharing [10]. This means that, for practical purposes, the Liability Convention is unworkable. Large private corporations are on an equal footing with public bodies and behave as if they were enjoying a kind of &amp;national' immunity that is commensurate with the size of their project. A good illustration of that observation was provided in March 1997 with the licensing of Teledesic Corp. by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), after intense diplomatic pressure had been exercised by the US delegation during WARC- 95.8 Contrary to its actions over much smaller projects, the FCC did not check any of Teledesic's technical or financial parameters, nor did it even impose an agenda for a project of the magnitude of close to 1000 satellites, according to its original plan, i.e. more than three times the total number of US civilian satellites that were in outer space at that time. Since then, this project has been scaled down two or three times and we are not even sure that it will ever be launched. So far, the fully licensed Teledesic project is nothing more than a huge &amp;paper satellite' system, while the competing SkyBridge project still awaits FCC authorization in order to be operated over North America as part of its global coverage of the Earth. That shows there is always a national state that backs up a satellite operator * public or private * that is active in Outer Space at a global scale. Here we have a paradox consisting in having &amp;national' regulators that license &amp;global' operators, thanks to technology. This paradox fully explains the difficulties that global operators are facing in their relationship with other national authorities [11]. This is inevitable as long as there is no such thing as a World Space Organization under which global satellite operators must be registered and to which they must be liable. The ITU does not provide such a commitment because it is only a technical organization; we may say that global satellite systems have no accountability towards the international community and, even worse, behave by taking into account the ITU's own weaknesses.9 Reforms have been proposed in order to restructure the ITU organization [12}14]. But others think it is better to keep things as they are, with outer space being exploited almost like a lawless &amp;wild outer space', with minimal supervision, under benevolent home state licensing and passive ITU registration. If this situation remains unchanged, no doubt such private operators will inevitably drag their licensing state to the forefront. Unfortunately, in outer space we won't talk about oil spills, but we may in the future see satellite explosions, or satellites colliding with one another, or we may simply notice malfunctions causing a satellite to cease functioning properly, sometimes without being able to really identify the cause of the malfunction or of the incident [15].10 And what about a nuclear accident in outer space?<br />

At its peak, the Apollo program directly and indirectly provided jobs for over 375,000 Americans. This was accomplished using less than 4% of the federal budget. Given the scientific advancements and specialization that has occurred since then, a similar program today would likely employ many more workers, with job openings ranging from construction to physics. This would go a long way in making a dent in the nation’s current unemployment rate, and the open ended nature of the current proposal ensures that it will have a sustained positive impact on the economy. In addition, a program of this size and scale will invariably produce technological innovations that have the potential to transform everyday life. Previous NASA developments have included the invention of the integrated circuit and fuel cells.<br />

As the U.S. economy moves through uncertain times, America’s aerospace industry remains a powerful, reliable engine of employment, innovation and export income. Aerospace contributed $81.2 billion in export sales to America’s economy last year. 1 Conservatively, U.S. aerospace sales alone account for three to five percent of our country’s gross domestic product, and every aerospace dollar yields an extra $1.50 to $3 in further economic activity. 2 Aerospace products and services are the bedrock of our nation’s security and competitiveness. We strongly believe that keeping this economic workhorse on track is in America’s best interest. To accomplish this, government policies must support a level playing field abroad, our industrial base and a workforce that is aging and needs an infusion of younger employees. This paper explains what’s at stake and how to ensure that the economic benefits of our industry are bolstered and broadened. A High-Skilled People Business The aerospace and defense industry directly employs 819,000 Americans, located in every state of the union — and supports more than two million jobs in related fields. 3 Our people bring a diverse set of skills and capabilities to their jobs: engineers on the cutting edge of advanced materials, structures and information technology; machinists fabricating complex shapes and structures; and technicians from almost every degree field, testing, applying and integrating the latest technologies.<br />

These days it’s hard to pick up a newspaper or turn on a news program without encountering stern warnings about the federal budget deficit. The deficit threatens economic recovery, we’re told; it puts American economic stability at risk; it will undermine our influence in the world. These claims generally aren’t stated as opinions, as views held by some analysts but disputed by others. Instead, they’re reported as if they were facts, plain and simple. Yet they aren’t facts. Many economists take a much calmer view of budget deficits than anything you’ll see on TV. Nor do investors seem unduly concerned: U.S. government bonds continue to find ready buyers, even at historically low interest rates. The long-run budget outlook is problematic, but short-term deficits aren’t — and even the long-term outlook is much less frightening than the public is being led to believe. So why the sudden ubiquity of deficit scare stories? It isn’t being driven by any actual news. It has been obvious for at least a year that the U.S. government would face an extended period of large deficits, and projections of those deficits haven’t changed much since last summer. Yet the drumbeat of dire fiscal warnings has grown vastly louder. To me — and I’m not alone in this — the sudden outbreak of deficit hysteria brings back memories of the groupthink that took hold during the run-up to the Iraq war. Now, as then, dubious allegations, not backed by hard evidence, are being reported as if they have been established beyond a shadow of a doubt. Now, as then, much of the political and media establishments have bought into the notion that we must take drastic action quickly, even though there hasn’t been any new information to justify this sudden urgency. Now, as then, those who challenge the prevailing narrative, no matter how strong their case and no matter how solid their background, are being marginalized. And fear-mongering on the deficit may end up doing as much harm as the fear-mongering on weapons of mass destruction. Let’s talk for a moment about budget reality. Contrary to what you often hear, the large deficit the federal government is running right now isn’t the result of runaway spending growth. Instead, well more than half of the deficit was caused by the ongoing economic crisis, which has led to a plunge in tax receipts, required federal bailouts of financial institutions, and been met — appropriately — with temporary measures to stimulate growth and support employment. The point is that running big deficits in the face of the worst economic slump since the 1930s is actually the right thing to do. If anything, deficits should be bigger than they are because the government should be doing more than it is to create jobs. True, there is a longer-term budget problem. Even a full economic recovery wouldn’t balance the budget, and it probably wouldn’t even reduce the deficit to a permanently sustainable level. So once the economic crisis is past, the U.S. government will have to increase its revenue and control its costs. And in the long run there’s no way to make the budget math work unless something is done about health care costs. But there’s no reason to panic about budget prospects for the next few years, or even for the next decade. Consider, for example, what the latest budget proposal from the Obama administration says about interest payments on federal debt; according to the projections, a decade from now they’ll have risen to 3.5 percent of G.D.P. How scary is that? It’s about the same as interest costs under the first President Bush. Why, then, all the hysteria? The answer is politics. The main difference between last summer, when we were mostly (and appropriately) taking deficits in stride, and the current sense of panic is that deficit fear-mongering has become a key part of Republican political strategy, doing double duty: it damages President Obama’s image even as it cripples his policy agenda. And if the hypocrisy is breathtaking — politicians who voted for budget-busting tax cuts posing as apostles of fiscal rectitude, politicians demonizing attempts to rein in Medicare costs one day (death panels!), then denouncing excessive government spending the next — well, what else is new? The trouble, however, is that it’s apparently hard for many people to tell the difference between cynical posturing and serious economic argument. And that is having tragic consequences. For the fact is that thanks to deficit hysteria, Washington now has its priorities all wrong: all the talk is about how to shave a few billion dollars off government spending, while there’s hardly any willingness to tackle mass unemployment. Policy is headed in the wrong direction — and millions of Americans will pay the price.<br />

But immediately the philosopher loses this well-intentioned simplicity. Why? Ironically, he himself indicates the reason for this, in an apologue on Heraclitus who used to take shelter in a baker's oven. 'Emm gar kai entautha theous* — 'here, too, the gods are present,* said Heraclitus to visitors who were astonished to see him warming his poor carcass like an ordinary mortal (Heidegger, 1977b, p. 233). 'Auch bier namlich wesen Gotter an.' But Heidegger is taken in as much as those naive visitors, since he and his epigones do not expect to find Being except along the Black Forest Holzwege. Being cannot reside in ordinary beings. Every¬where, there is desert. The gods cannot reside in technology — that pure Enframing (Zimmerman, 1990) of being [Ge-Stelf], that ineluctable fate [Geschick], that supreme danger [Gefahr]. They are not to be sought in science, either, since science has no other essence but that of technology (Heidegger, 1977b). They are absent from politics, sociology, psychol¬ogy, anthropology, history - which is the history of Being, and counts its epochs in millennia. The gods cannot reside in economics — that pure calculation forever mired in beings and worry. They are not to be found in philosophy, either, or in ontology, both of which lost sight of their destiny 2,500 years ago. Thus Heidegger treats the modern world as the visitors treat Heraclitus: with contempt. And yet — 'here too the gods are present*: in a hydroelectric plant on the banks of the Rhine, in subatomic particles, in Adidas shoes as well as in the old wooden clogs hollowed out by hand, in agribusiness as well as in timeworn landscapes, in shopkeepers* calculations as well as in Holderlin's heartrending verse. But why do those philosophers no longer recognize them? Because they believe what the modern Constitution says about itself! This paradox should no longer astonish us. The moderns indeed declare that technology is nothing but pure instrumental mastery, science pure Enframing and pure Stamping [Das Ge-Stell], that econo¬mics is pure calculation, capitalism pure reproduction, the subject pure consciousness. Purity everywhere! They claim this, but we must be careful not to take them at their word, since what they are asserting is only half of the modern world, the work of purification that distils what the work of hybridization supplies. Who has forgotten Being? No one, no one ever has, otherwise Nature would be truly available as a pure 'stock*. Look around you: scientific objects are circulating simultaneously as subjects objects and discourse. Networks are full of Being. As for machines, they are laden with subjects and collectives. How could a being lose its difference, its incompleteness, its mark, its trace of Being? This is never in anyone's power; otherwise we should have to imagine that we have truly been modern, we should be taken in by the upper half of the modern Constitution. Has someone, however, actually forgotten Being? Yes: anyone who really thinks that Being has really been forgotten. As Levi-Strauss says, 'the barbarian is first and foremost the man who believes in barbarism.' (Levi-Strauss, [1952] 1987, p. 12). Those who have failed to undertake empirical studies of sciences, technologies, law, politics, economics, religion or fiction have lost the traces of Being that are distributed everywhere among beings. If, scorning empiricism, you opt out of the exact sciences, then the human sciences, then traditional philosophy, then the sciences of language, and you hunker down in your forest - then you will indeed feel a tragic loss. But what is missing is you yourself, not the world! Heidegger's epigones have converted that glaring weakness into a strength. 'We don't know anything empirical, but that doesn't matter, since your world is empty of Being. We are keeping the little flame of Being safe from everything, and you, who have all the rest, have nothing.' On the contrary: we have everything, since we have Being, and beings, and we have never lost track of the difference between Being and beings. We are carrying out the impossible project undertaken by Heidegger, who believed what the modern Constitution said about itself without understanding that what is at issue there is only half of a larger mechanism which has never abandoned the old anthropological matrix. No one can forget Being, since there has never been a modern world, or, by the same token, metaphysics. We have always remained pre-Socratic, pre-Cartesian, pre-Kantian, pre-Nietzschean. No radical revolution can separate us from these pasts, so there is no need for reactionary counter¬revolutions to lead us back to what has never been abandoned. Yes, Heraclitus is a surer guide than Heidegger: 'Einai gar kai entautha theous?<br />

From the standpoint of an ethics of subjection there is even something unnecessary or superfluous about the void of suffering in the subject bearers of evil. For Levinas, the return to being from the ethical encounter with the face and its infinite depths is fraught with the danger the subject will reduce the other to a &quot;like-me,&quot; totalizing and violating the space of absolute alterity. As Chalier puts it, &quot;Levinas conceives of the moral subject's awakening, or the emergence of the human in being, as a response to that pre-originary subjection which is not a happenstance of being.&quot; But if there really is something inaccessible about suffering itself, about the 'other' side of what is manifestly finite, subjected, and damaged, then to a certain extent it is irrelevant to ethics, as irrelevant as the judgment of moral progress in the subject-agent. Let me take the parent-child relation again as an example. Suppose the child to exhibit the symptoms of an illness. Are not the proper &quot;ethical&quot; questions for the parent to ask questions of measure and mathematical multiples: How high is the fever? How long has it lasted? How far is the hospital? Can she get out of bed? Has this happened before? These are the questions of the doctor, the rescue squads and the police. They are questions about being, about detail, causes and effects. Ethically our response to the needs of must be reduced to a positivity simply because we have access to nothing but the symptoms, which are like mine. Our primary moral responsibility is to treat the symptoms that show up in being, not the radically other with whom I cannot identify. Say we observe someone whose hands have been chopped off with a machete. How would we characterize this? Would it not be slightly absurd to say, &quot;He had his limbs severed and he suffered,&quot; as though the cruel amputation were not horror enough. Think of the idiocy in the common platitude: &quot;She died of cancer, but thank God, she did not suffer&quot;, as though the devastating annihilation of the human by a tumor were not evil itself. For ethics, then, the only suffering that matters are the visible effects of the onslaught of the world. All other suffering is excessive and inaccessible. Therefore, it is in being, indeed in the midst of the most elemental facts about ourselves and other people, that we ethically encounter others by responding to their needs and helping them as best we can It is precisely by identifying being and not pretending that we know any thing about suffering, other than it is a hollow in the midst of being, that we can act responsibly. What worries me about Levinas is that by going beyond being to what he regards as the ethics of absolute alterity, he risks allowing the sheer, almost banal facticity of suffering to be swallowed in the infinite depths of transcendence. Indeed, it seems to me that Levinas too often over emphasizes the importance of the emergence of the subject and the inner good in the ethical encounter, as though the point of meeting the suffering human being was to come to an awareness of the good within oneself and not to heal and repair. I agree with Chalier's observation that Levinas's &quot;analyses adopt the point of view of the moral subject, not that of a person who might be the object of its solicitude.&quot; Ethics has limits; there are situations like the Holocaust where to speak of a moral responsibility to heal and repair seems pathetic. But an ethics that would be oriented to the vulnerabilities of the subjected (which are others, of course, but also myself) needs to address the mutilation, dismemberment, the chronology of torture, the numbers incarcerated, the look of the bodies, the narratives, the blood counts, the mines knives, machetes, and poisons. Evil really is all that. When the mind does its work, it plunges into being, into mathematical multiples and starts counting the cells, the graveyards, and bullet wounds. Rational practical deliberation is always about the facts that encircle the void inaccessible to deliberation and practical reason.<br />

As this chapter has noted, Levinas’s emphasis on “the reality of persecuted people in the daily history of the world” informs his critique of Heidegger. Levinas’s critique of Heideggerian ontology identifies how the ontological, anti-humanistic, and pagan cast of the latter’s thought is inherently totalizing. This can be viewed as the first of Levinas’s two principal objections to fundamental ontology. The second major objection, which I have ignored until now, relates to its political consequences. In sum, fundamental ontology necessarily leads to tyranny: “Even though it opposes the technological passion issued forth from the forgetting of Being hidden by the existent, Heideggerian ontology, which subordinates the relationship with the Other to the relationship with Being in general, remains under obedience to the anonymous and leads inevitably to another power, to imperialist domination, to tyranny.” 62 Viewed from the perspective of Levinas’ critique of the Occidental ontological tradition, such a conclusion is to be expected. For Levinas, Heideggerian Being represents merely the latest arche utilized by Western ontologists to eliminate the alterity of the Other and promote the freedom of the self. As the political manifestation of the totalization of the Other that ontology perpetrates in the realm of thought, tyranny represents the diluted essence of ontological politics. Much as ontological thought facilitates the domination of the other person by the autonomous ego, so too does it enable the state to totalize its “Other”– its subjects – in a comparatively comprehensive manner: “For the philosophical tradition the conflicts between the same and the other are resolved by whereby the other is reduced to the same – or, concretely, by the community of the state where by anonymous power, though it be intelligible, the I rediscovers war in the tyrannic oppression it undergoes from the totality.” 63 In this light, the tyrannical rule of the modern state extends into the political realm the violent, thematizing tendencies that characterize ontology generally. Nor is this conclusion shocking in light of the anti-humanistic cast of Heidegger’s thought. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, anti-humanistic thinkers often posited grandiose schemes designed to put an end to the alienation supposedly engendered by subjective humanism. Much like earlier theoretical anti-humanists such as Marx and Nietzsche, Heidegger accuses past humanisms of contributing to modern estrangement by overlooking a pivotal aspect of the human condition. 64 A key difference between Heidegger and his anti-humanistic forebears lies in the fact that, for him, it is metaphysical inquiry into the Being of beings that engenders modern alienation rather than philosophical idealism or slave-morality. Nonetheless, the comparison remains instructive: like Marx, Heidegger anticipates a future historical epoch in which man will finally recover his original ontological unity free from the obfuscating effect of past philosophical distortions. And like Marx and Nietzsche, Heidegger provides an ample supply of metaphysical pathos that unwittingly complements the violent political objectives of totalitarian political movements. In this sense, Heidegger’s rectorship merely repeats the Marxist tragedy as farce.<br />

A controversial U.S. bill aimed at forcing China to raise the value of the yuan has cleared the Senate but it looks likely to be shelved in the House of Representatives. House Speaker John Boehner has made it clear he wants nothing to do with the legislation that has already raised heckles in Beijing. And for now he seems to be in control despite loud protests including from within his own party. Boehner, the most powerful Republican in Congress, denounced the bill again on Wednesday, a day after it passed the Senate, saying it posed a &quot;very severe risk&quot; of starting a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Democratic supporters of the bill are trying to turn up pressure on Boehner to allow a vote on the legislation. Top Democrats have said it is needed to curb China's &quot;cheating&quot; currency policy which already amounts to a trade war. They also see the bill as a good way to show voters they share their concerns about high unemployment a year before congressional and presidential elections. The Republican party, which usually rallies in support of freer trade, is divided on the matter. Presidential front-runner Mitt Romney has repeatedly said he would take China to task for its currency system if elected. But so far those Republican lawmakers hoping to pressure Boehner into a U-turn appear to be too few to force him to allow a vote to take place. If he ever does have to reverse position, the legislation would probably pass: 225 House lawmakers have signed up as co-sponsors, including 61 Republicans. That would send it to the desk of President Barack Obama, putting him on the spot to veto legislation which he has suggested may breach world trade rules but which his Democratic Party overwhelmingly supports. That prospect still looks remote. No Republican lawmaker's name is on a so-called &quot;discharge petition&quot; -- a rarely successful congressional procedure -- that Democrats are trying to use to force Boehner to put the measure to a vote. The only Republican who did recently sign up -- House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers -- took his signature back just a day later. &quot;It was an oversight on our end that was fixed,&quot; a spokeswoman for Rogers said. That left 176 Democratic signatures on the petition, a long way short of the 218 needed to force the House leadership to allow a vote on the bill. Other tactics may yet be tried. An attempt by Democrats on Wednesday to append the China currency bill to a free trade agreement with Colombia failed. &quot;On whether he (Boehner) can keep it from coming up, as a procedural matter, yes, as long as he can keep Republicans from signing the discharge petition, which thus far he has been able to do,&quot; said Bill Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which opposes the China currency legislation. &quot;Even so, I suspect pressure for action will build up,&quot; Reinsch added. APPLYING PRESSURE The most likely place to apply pressure would be in the House Ways and Means Committee where Republicans could decide to produce their own legislation on the subject, he said. Such a move could defuse the current House push and keep any real action on China on the back-burner because new legislation would probably differ from the existing version and would have to go back to the Senate. But so far, the head of the committee, Republican Dave Camp, has signaled no rush to start discussions of the existing bill. Camp said on Wednesday he would hold a hearing on a range of Chinese trade issues, including currency but also intellectual property rights, this month. Some of the pressure for the China legislation in the House is coming from Republican lawmakers backed by the conservative force of the Tea Party, such as Representative Allen West. It is unclear how many other lawmakers with Tea Party sympathies agree. A Pew Research Center report last week said Tea Party Republicans were much more supportive of taking a harder line with China in economic policy than other Republicans or Democrats. Chris Chocola, president of the conservative Club for Growth which sees the punitive tariffs proposed by the currency bill as an unwanted new tax for Americans, said he did not think China was a rallying cry for Tea Party activists. That meant it was unlikely they would press Boehner on China with the same intensity as they did in July and August to make more spending cuts in talks with the White House on the U.S. debt ceiling.<br />

The Democratic-controlled Senate on Tuesday voted 63-35 to pass the bill, which would allow the United States to slap duties on goods from countries with undervalued currencies. But the measure has been held up in the Republican-run House of Representatives, where Speaker John Boehner opposes the measure and has branded it &quot;dangerous.&quot; Boehner, the most powerful Republican in Congress, could make sure the bill never comes up for a vote. A similar measure cleared that chamber last year 348-79, when it was controlled by Democrats<br />

<br />
For all the rhetoric about cutting government spending, NASA’s space mission remains sacred in Congress. A handful of powerful lawmakers are so eager to see an American on the moon — or even Mars — that they effectively mandated NASA to spend “not less than” $3 billion for a new rocket project and space capsule in the 2011 budget bill signed by the president last week. NASA has repeatedly raised concerns about the timeframe for building a smaller rocket — but the new law expresses Congress’s will for the space agency to make a massive “heavy-lift” rocket that can haul 130 metric tons, like the ones from the days of the Apollo. Congressional approval of the plan — all while $38 billion is being cut elsewhere in the federal government — reflects not only the power of key lawmakers from NASA-friendly states, but the enduring influence of major contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing in those states. For instance, a series of stop-gap spending laws had kept money flowing to the man-to-moon Constellation program because Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) initially tucked a provision into a 2010 budget bill — even though President Barack Obama and Congress agreed last fall to end that Bush-era initiative. An internal NASA audit pegged the cost of that move at $215 million over five months. While some praise Congress for pushing the United States to remain a world leader in space science, critics say the national space program is effectively run by lawmakers protecting jobs in their home states. “Manned spaceflight is prohibitively expensive, especially considering our budgetary woes,” said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group. “At one point, the administration was trying to lead NASA out of that, but congressional politics protecting parochial interests have forced the agency to waste money in the recent short-term continuing resolutions and are forcing a specific approach down NASA’s throat in the yearlong spending bill.” The latest $3 billion will likely be awarded to the same major companies that had contracts under the Bush-era Constellation program, most notably Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Alliant Techsystems — firms with extensive operations in Alabama, Maryland, Texas and Utah. As a whole, NASA is facing its own budget crunch, with its $18.5 billion budget recently trimmed by about $275 million. A top space expert, Scott Pace of The George Washington University, testified last month that NASA spent at least $21 billion over the past two decades for various programs, including manned space flight, that were later canceled. But Congress has no desire to let the agency slow down its work to return to the moon and beyond, even if that potentially could take decades to accomplish. Lawmakers from those states say their push is not parochial — that it’s rooted in the national interest to ensure the U.S. remains the base for an industry that supports thousands of highly skilled jobs. Moreover, they say it makes sense to give money to contractors with proven track records in this technical field, especially ones who have already begun work on the next generation of rockets. “Dismissing [the 130-ton rocket], or the capsule work, as constituent concerns misses the point that these are unique, national capabilities necessary to remain a leader in space exploration,” said Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.). “The Chinese are building a 130-ton rocket to go to the moon. We are dependent on the Russians for access to the International Space Station. The greatest nation on Earth, the one who stunned the world and inspired a generation by sending a man to walk on the moon, cannot afford to be eclipsed by Russia or China.” One of Obama’s central promises in his February 2010 budget was to end the Constellation program, which called for sending humans back to the moon for the first time since 1972, transitioning instead to private companies that could carry astronauts to the International Space Station. Under heavy criticism from Congress, Obama later insisted he wasn’t abandoning the manned space mission. Last October, he signed the NASA authorization law in which Congress laid out its vision for future space travel, including the initial development of a smaller rocket that could enter the Earth’s lower orbit, before upgrading to the massive heavy-lift rocket to go to the moon and beyond. But some lawmakers whose states rely on the industry have grown increasingly concerned that NASA no longer was on the same page.<br />

<strong>MSR = Mars Sample Return</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Concerns regarding MSR Respondents were asked to quantify their degree of concern associated with a range of potential issues identiﬁed by NASA as possibly being associated with MSR [7]. Fig. 1C shows the differences in proportions of schoolchildren compared to adults in nominating that they were quite or very concerned about potential risks involved in the mission. Schoolchildren were most concerned about possible health effects due to contamination of Earth and were least concerned about contamination of Mars. Adults were most concerned about ecological disruption caused by contamination of Earth and were least concerned with the use of nuclear materials. Chi-square analysis demonstrated that adults were signiﬁcantly more likely than schoolchildren to be quite or very concerned about contamination of Mars during a MSR mission (18.9% vs. 6.1%; p &lt; 0.05). By contrast, schoolchildren were signiﬁcantly more likely than adults to be quite or very concerned about possible health (34.8% vs. 16.3%; p &lt; 0.05) and ecological (32.2% vs. 23%; p &lt; 0.05) effects due to contamination of Earth as well as the use of nuclear materials in a mission (21.7% vs. 6.8%; p &lt; 0.05). 3.5. Trust in NASA The MSR mission will be a collective effort from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and other international partners. However, given the global recognition of NASA it is reasonable to assume that they will provide the public face of any endeavour. Therefore, respondents were asked about their degree of trust in NASA across six mission dimensions (Fig. 1D). The general order of what dimensions of the mission NASA were trusted with the most was consistent between the two groups, however chi-square analysis showed that schoolchildren had signiﬁcantly higher conﬁdence in NASA to protect Mars than did adults (39.7% vs. 27.0%; p = 0.05) and similarly to protect Earth (56.9% vs. 48.7%; p = 0.000).</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Widespread support should give the president leeway and weaken resistance to his policies. Thus, public support gives a president, at best, leverage, but not control. On the other hand, when the president lacks popular support, this strengthens the resolve of those inclined to oppose him and narrows the range in which he receives the benefit of the doubt. The president’s options are reduced, his opportunities diminished, and his room for maneuver checked; he loses crucial “leeway.”</strong><br />

Moreover, there is a continuously evolving and reciprocal relationship between presidential boldness and achievement. In the same way that nothing breeds success like success, nothing sets the president up for achieving his or her next goal better than succeeding dramatically on the last go around. This is absolutely a matter of perception, and you can see it best in the way that Congress and especially the Washington press corps fawn over bold and intimidating presidents like Reagan and George W. Bush. The political teams surrounding these presidents understood the psychology of power all too well. They knew that by simultaneously creating a steamroller effect and feigning a clubby atmosphere for Congress and the press, they could leave such hapless hangers-on with only one remaining way to pretend to preserve their dignities. By jumping on board the freight train, they could be given the illusion of being next to power, of being part of the winning team. And so, with virtually the sole exception of the now retired Helen Thomas, this is precisely what they did.<br />

For the time being, Dordain says, ESA will focus on “who is going to finance what,” although he admits that certain key questions—including whether member states will continue to fund the ISS on the existing pro rata basis—remain to be answered. Dordain insists that measures related to launcher support, the ISS extension and EDRS must be undertaken without affecting a spending freeze put in place for 2010-11 to fend off a possible funding crisis among some ESA members. The 2011 budget, approved in December, calls for a 6.6% increase in spending, to €4 billion, but most of the rise stems from a carryover from 2010 (AW&amp;ST July 26, 2010, p. 21). The freeze will be partially compensated by the addition this month of Romania and Israel as new members and associate members, respectively, which will boost available funding, and an effort aimed at cutting overhead costs to 15% of overall expenditures, from 18-20% now. Also under discussion are debt mechanisms that could reduce the burden of the hardest-hit nations such as Portugal, Greece and Ireland, although Dordain notes that a loan arrangement approved last year by Spain was ultimately not needed. The 2011 agenda will be further complicated by a decision, linked to the budget freeze, to delay until 2012 the agency’s next ministerial summit, where major program and funding guidelines are usually determined. This means the ESA council meeting in March will have to decide the basic financing framework for launchers and the ISS extension, along with budget allocations for 2011-12, even if other details are left until later. However, virtually all of the costs for each can be covered at present spending levels, the ESA chief says.<br />

The objective of the Aurora Program is to become a space leader in the future and to formulate and implement a “long-term plan for the robotic and human exploration of solar system bodies holding promise for traces of life.” Additionally, the purpose of the program is to explore the universe and solar system, stimulate new technology, and inspire the youth of Europe to take an interest in science and technology. International cooperation is a goal of the Aurora Program, as well; not only will the program rely on European nations, but it will also collaborate with Canada and the U.S. To that end, NASA has become an important partner to the ESA in terms of its Aurora Program, funding instrumentation for the ExoMars mission. As stated on ESA’s Aurora website, “the Aurora Programme can be seen as a road map for human exploration, from which a large number of scientific as well technology spin-offs will emerge, driven by the goal of exploration.” Such information would be invaluable to not only ESA, but to NASA and the rest of the world, as well. With appropriate funding and cooperation, the U.S. and ESA (and possibly Russia, Canada, or Japan) could collaborate on the largest human expedition ever and land mankind on another planet. Missions to Mars allow for ample international cooperation. Such a large undertaking could only be possible with contributions from many nations. To that end, the IMEWG was established in 1993 and continues to meet twice a year. The charter of IMWEG includes the following goals: “produce and maintain an international strategy for the exploration of Mars, provide a forum for the co-ordination of Mars exploration missions, and examine the possibilities for the next steps beyond the currently defined missions.” The aforementioned Mars Express program falls under IMWEG collaboration. In 2004, arrangements were made between NASA and ESA “to use each other’s orbiters as back-up for each other in relaying data and other communications from the landers to Earth.” Additionally, ESA intends “to use NASA’s Deep Space Network for communications with Earth during parts of the mission.<br />

Although manned drilling is deal for apparatus emplacement on the Moon, temperature probes can be planned into the lunar regolith from a space-shuttle as they were planned into the sea bottom sediments from a ship for the purpose of marine heat flow measurement. Of the 24,000 heat flow measurements on Earth (Pollack et al., Rev. Geophysics 1993, 31: 267-280), about 8,000 were determined with a technique that allows the temperature probe drop to the sea bottom at a high speed and lets it penetrate into the marine sediments with its own momentum without drilling. This technique can be modified to plant temperature probes into lunar regolith layer from a space shuttle without extensive drilling on the moon. The perspective lunar regolith temperature probe should be equipped with an array of sensors. Regolith temperature should be continuously monitored over a and the data automatically transmitted to Earth, as it had been done in the ALSEP in earlier 1970s. The measured regolith temperatures can serve not only the study of the surface temperature history of the moon, but also the study of other thermal aspects of the Moon as a planetary body. Reconstructing a surface temperature history from subsurface temperature is a proven concept. The geothermal approach to reconstruction of a climate history of Earth can be applied to reconstructing a surface temperature history of the Moon. Measuring lunar subsurface temperature through a probe penetrating into the lunar regolith was a successful experiment. The existing technique of penetrating the marine sediments for temperature measurement can be modified to deploy lunar regolith temperature probes without requiring manned drilling on the Moon. In principle, isolating the solar climatic effect through measuring and analyzing lunar regolith temperature bears great potential in determining the anthropogenic effect on Earth’s climate system. But there are many details that need to be carefully studied. We are in the process of reanalyzing the hourly regolith temperature series received from Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 probes over a three-year period. We are preparing to pursue funding opportunities to carry this study into a greater depth, toward the goal of calling the Moon as a witness in the debate on the anthropogenic effect of global warming on Earth.<br />

Space development in Korea has several characteristics. First, space development activities are initiated by a scientific research institute, KARI, and a university, KAIST SaTRec, for peaceful purposes. Most development projects have been proposed by research institutes, not government decision makers. Second, most satellite missions are multipurpose. Since space development has not been initiated by the top levels of government, funding has to be sought by research institutes and MOST. In order to get enough funds, missions must be able to meet various requirements of related ministries. At the same time, each space development project has to justify its feasibility in terms of an economic cost–benefit analysis. Third, Korean space activities have been focused on hardware—development of satellites and launch vehicles—rather than on the development of a full vision and the missions that would accompany this. The national space development plan reflects these characteristics, even though it contains some mention of space science and manned missions to the ISS through the international cooperation program.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Only the Counterplan solves aerospace, prolif and terror while avoiding the disads. Throwing money at the problem is useless – it doesn’t overcome European competition.</span></strong><br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Hold Europe Accountable First, we should hold Europe accountable for its market-distorting actions. We need to demand that Europe works with the U.S. to build real competition across all sectors of the aerospace industry. We have several options before us. One way to hold Europe accountable is to look seriously at a trade case that would challenge Europe's failure to adhere to its treaty obligations. Boeing and Airbus may be the two combatants in a trade case, but we have to recognize that the future of aerospace is larger than a trade case or a Boeing dispute with Airbus. A trade case is not my preferred course. It's really the &quot;nuclear option&quot; because it would ultimately hurt both sides. We may soon have no choice but to blow up the status quo in large commercial aircraft and global aerospace trade. The bottom line is this, the status quo is intolerable. The deck is now so stacked against the United States aerospace industry and its future, that the U.S. side may have less to lose in a drawn out trade fight between the U.S. and Europe. We do have other options short of a trade case. I can tell you that since my speech on the Senate Floor two months ago I've had several conversations with Ambassador Bob Zoellick, the United States Trade Representative. I've also spoken with Commerce Secretary Don Evans as well. I'm very pleased with the attention that Ambassador Zoellick has given to aerospace. He understands the challenges before our country if we are serious about an aerospace future for America's workers. We'll see how far the Administration is willing to go, but thus far, I give them high marks for their recent involvement and I'll keep working with them. I can tell you that there are discussions taking place at the highest levels of our government, and having worked on this challenge for many years I'm more encouraged than ever that people are taking it seriously and that we're close to making progress. There clearly is one step that we should take: It's time to signal our intention to withdraw from the outdated 1992 US-EU Bilateral Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. That agreement has long since run it's course, and today I am ready to call on the Administration to formally notify the EU of our intention to withdraw from the agreement. Once we serve notice, we will have one year to see if the Europeans are serious about creating a level playing field. 2. Don't Reward EADS and Airbus My second recommendation is that the United States should not reward EADS and Airbus for their market-distorting, job-killing behavior. Airbus wants U.S. policymakers and the public to buy its campaign that it is a good U.S. citizen. It's false, and they're trying to mask the real harm that they pose to America workers. And, most offensively, Airbus is working to undermine both the Air Force and the Boeing Company to kill the tanker program so that it may ultimately outsource tanker manufacturing to Europe. If we reward their underhanded methods, then American taxpayers will be paying Europe to help finish off our aerospace industry. 3. Evaluate Buy America Laws Another option before us involves more of a carrot that a stick. As you know, our country has &quot;Buy America&quot; laws that require significant amounts of U.S. content in the goods and services purchased by our government including the Department of Defense. Lately however, with the support of Airbus lobbyists and some in Congress, those provisions are now under attack. The Defense Authorization bill that passed the Senate has language in it to weaken our Buy America Laws. That bill will soon go to conference. Today I sent a letter to the Chairmen of both the Senate and the House Armed Services Committee with a few suggestions about how to proceed on Buy America. I don't think we should rewrite these laws unless we have a clear idea of how it will affect our country. So I propose that we make no changes for this coming fiscal year, but that we commission an independent study to inform Congress on what changes would be responsible. This study should examine the current state of competition in global aerospace – everything from the issues I've raised today to technology transfer, terrorism and weapons proliferation, and the impact of changes on our domestic aerospace industry. The study should also address issues like market distorting practices, subsidies and government ownership. We have a responsibility to American taxpayers to use their resources wisely. That applies here as well. If we are to allow European firms to access significant defense contracts at the expense of U.S. firms and workers, we have to wisely ask our European allies to meet some of the same good government standards adhered to by U.S. firms. So, I will also recommend to the Defense conferees that this study includes good corporate governance issues like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to name a few. Our goal should be to compile a set of criteria for foreign countries and companies to meet in order to get greater access to America's defense dollars. U.S. policymakers have an obligation to make sure European firms play by the same laws and regulations that U.S. companies must abide by in order to work with the Department of Defense. My own view is that free trade, particularly among our allies, can be beneficial to the global aerospace market, to the commercial, defense and space markets which are all linked. But before we move forward, we have to ask some tough questions, establish the rules of the road, and demand adherence to international norms and to U.S. law. My proposal offers a &quot;third-way&quot; that avoids protectionism while ensuring that our aerospace industry is part of a fair competition. So far, the debate has been between advocates of free trade who don't understand the aerospace market, and protectionists who would keep our markets closed without hesitation. I think my proposal will give us a middle ground that promotes both trade and competition and American jobs. It's also a carrot that could accomplish more than a trade reward. We could use greater access to defense contracting among our allies and trading partners as an incentive to create a global market for aerospace products that spurs real competition, drives aerospace forward with new technologies, companies and jobs, recognizes legitimate national security needs, and protects taxpayers. 4. Adopt the Commission's Recommendations Finally, we should act boldly to embrace many of the recommendations from the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry. The Administration is acting on a number of fronts. Congress must do more as well. As a first step, Congress should create a Joint Committee on Aerospace. A dedicated group of House and Senate members, with a targeted agenda, can help the Administration and the country recommit itself to the next century of global aerospace leadership. Today, I am introducing legislation to create a Senate Select Committee on Aerospace. My bill will establish a bipartisan select committee with 11 members tasked to conduct a thorough review of the current and future competitiveness of the United States Aerospace industry, study issues like global competition, workforce development, technological challenges and the appropriate federal role in this industry, and, issue a report and recommendations to the Congress in order to promote U.S. aerospace interests. The Senate Select Committee on Aerospace that I propose today will help Congress recognize that our future is very much tied to aerospace, commercial aerospace in particular.</span><br />

<strong>Thayer’s argues public support and relative power are key to sustainability- <u>both</u> are declining in the squo</strong><br />
<strong>Layne,</strong> 0<strong>9</strong> Professor, and Robert M. Gates Chair in Intelligence and National Security at the George Bush School of Government and Public Service (Christopher, “The Waning of U. S. Hegemony—Myth or Reality”, International Security, Vol. 34, No. 1, Summer 2009)<br />
<br />
For an overview of trends that could affect international politics over the next two decades, a good starting point is the National Intelligence Council’s (NIC’s) Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World. 15Global Trends 2025 is not light reading, but it is significantly more insightful and intellectually courageous than typical government reports. Its key geopolitical conclusion is that the U. S. -dominated unipolar world will give way to multipolarity during the next two decades spurred by two causal mechanisms: the emergence of new great powers (and potentially important regional powers); and economic, financial, and domestic political constraints that may erode U. S. capabilities. China, India, and possibly Russia are emerging great powers. 16 As Global Trends 2025 points out, the rise of China and India to great power status will restore each to “the positions they held two centuries ago when China produced approximately 30 percent and India 15 percent of the world’s wealth” (p. 7). Their ascent is being propelled by “the global shift in relative wealth and economic power” from North America and the Euro-Atlantic world to Asia—a shift “without precedent in modern history” (ibid. ). By 2025, China figures to have the world’s second-largest economy (measured by gross domestic product [GDP]) and will be a first-rank military power (p. 30). India, buoyed by its strong economic growth rate, will “strive for a multipolar system with New Delhi as one of the poles” (ibid. ). Although both states could encounter speed bumps that might slow—or even derail—their ascents to great power status, the NIC believes that the “chances are good that China and India will continue to rise” (p. 29). 17 [End Page 152] Because of uncertainties about economics, energy prices, domestic governance issues, and especially demography, Russia’s great power trajectory is more problematic than China’s or India’s (pp. 31–32). 18 Between 2009 and 2025, Russia’s population is forecast to drop from 141 million to below 130 million, affecting the availability of manpower for both the military and the labor pools (pp. 23–24, 30). If Russia overcomes its demographic challenge and continues its revival as a great power, however, the NIC believes it “will be a leading force in opposition to U. S. global dominance” (p. 32). Because its great power status is closely tied to its ability to control both the energy resources and pipelines of Central Asia and the Caucasus, Russia will also seek to reestablish its sphere of influence in the “near abroad” (pp. 32, 82). According to the NIC, in addition to relative decline, the United States will confront other constraints on its international role. U. S. military supremacy will no longer be as dominant as it has been since the Cold War’s end (p. 93). The United States’ soft power may diminish as its liberal model of political and economic development is challenged by authoritarian/statist alternatives (pp. 3, 8–9, 13–14). At home, economic and political constraints may undermine U. S. hegemony. Global Trends 2025 was published just before the full scope of the global financial and economic crisis became apparent. Nevertheless, the NIC did have an inkling of the meltdown’s potential long-term implications for U. S. power. In particular, Global Trends predicts that over the next two decades, the dollar’s role as the international economy’s preeminent reserve currency will erode. Although at the time this issue went to press, the dollar remained strong and will continue to be the reserve currency for some time to come, China’s spring 2009 call to replace the dollar with a new reserve currency signals that the NIC’s long-term worries may be justified. 19 [End Page 153] As the NIC observes, the financial privileges conferred on the United States by the dollar’s unchallenged reserve currency status have underpinned the preeminent role of the United States in international politics since the end of World War II. Thus, “the dollar’s decline may force the United States into difficult tradeoffs between achieving ambitious foreign policy goals and the high domestic costs of supporting those objectives” (pp. 12, 94, 97). Moreover, the growing dependence of the United States on foreign capital inflows “may curtail U. S. freedom of action in unanticipated ways” (p. 97). The NIC concludes that America’s “interest and willingness to play a leadership role may be more constrained as the economic, military, and opportunity costs of being the world’s leader are reassessed by American voters” (p. 93). Ultimately, although the United States will probably be primus inter pares in a multipolar international system twenty years from now, it will have less power—and foreign policy options—than it has been accustomed to having since 1945 (ibid. ).<br />

<br />
Paul Kennedy was probably right: the US will go the way of all great powers — down. The individual dramas of the past decade — the September 2001 terrorist attacks, prolonged wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis — have delivered the world a message: US primacy is in decline. This does not necessarily mean that the US is in systemic decline, but it encompasses a trend that appears to be negative and perhaps alarming. Although the US still possesses incomparable military prowess and its economy remains the world’s largest, the once seemingly indomitable chasm that separated America from anyone else is narrowing. Thus, the global distribution of power is shifting, and the inevitable result will be a world that is less peaceful, liberal and prosperous, burdened by a dearth of effective conflict regulation. Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Most in Washington still embraces the notion that America is, and forever will be, the world’s indispensable nation. Some scholars, however, questioned the logic of hegemonic stability theory from the very beginning. A number continue to do so today. They advance arguments diametrically at odds with the primacist consensus. Trade routes need not be policed by a single dominant power; the international economy is complex and resilient. Supply disruptions are likely to be temporary, and the costs of mitigating their effects should be borne by those who stand to lose — or gain — the most. Islamic extremists are scary, but hardly comparable to the threat posed by a globe-straddling Soviet Union armed with thousands of nuclear weapons. It is frankly absurd that we spend more today to fight Osama bin Laden and his tiny band of murderous thugs than we spent to face down Joseph Stalin and Chairman Mao. Many factors have contributed to the dramatic decline in the number of wars between nation-states; it is unrealistic to expect that a new spasm of global conflict would erupt if the United States were to modestly refocus its efforts, draw down its military power, and call on other countries to play a larger role in their own defense, and in the security of their respective regions. But while there are credible alternatives to the United States serving in its current dual role as world policeman / armed social worker, the foreign policy establishment in Washington has no interest in exploring them. The people here have grown accustomed to living at the center of the earth, and indeed, of the universe. The tangible benefits of all this military spending flow disproportionately to this tiny corner of the United States while the schlubs in fly-over country pick up the tab.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Heg is unsustainable – rising powers, overstretch and loss of economic power </span><br />
Layne 11 [Christopher Layne is the Associate Professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University and Research Fellow with the Center on Peace and Liberty at The Independent Institute. “The unipolar exit: beyond the Pax Americana”, Cambridge Review of International Affairs, 24:2, 149-164, Chetan]<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">In this article I challenge Brooks and Wohlforth. I show that the unipolar era already is visibly drawing to a close. Three main drivers explain the impending end of the Pax Americana. First, the rise of new great powers—especially China—is transforming the international system from unipolarity to multipolarity. Second, the United States is becoming the poster child for strategic over-extension, or as Paul Kennedy (1987) dubbed it, imperial overstretch. Third, the United States’ relative economic power is declining. In particular, mounting US fiscal problems and the dollar’s increasingly problematic role as the international financial system’s reserve currency are undermining US hegemony. To comprehend why the Pax Americana is ending we need to understand the linkages among these trends, and how each has feedback effects on the others. After examining how these trends undermine the Brooks and Wohlforth argument for unipolar stability and the durability of US hegemony, I conclude by arguing that over the next two decades the Pax Americana’s end presages dramatic changes in international politics—the outlines of which already are visible. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Primacy doesn’t solve and Obama inevitably pushes a new multilateral paradigm that solves the reasons Heg is good</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hachigian 10</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> [<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4184:http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/01/american_primacy.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/01/american_primacy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/01/american_primacy.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4184 -->, co-author of The Next American Century: How the U.S. Can Thrive as Other Powers Rise and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress., “The False Promise of Primacy”] </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">One unquestionable success of the Obama administration so far has been to turn the page on the failed Bush foreign policy framework. Not so, says Robert Kagan, who reveals a perverse nostalgia for the previous paradigm in recent writings. To understand why, you have to remember that American foreign policy leaders during the Bush administration clung to the false promise of primacy, the belief that the lynchpin of American security was for it to remain more powerful than all other countries by a huge, fixed margin. Mona Sutphen and I described why this was a misguided strategy in our </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">2008 book</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, The Next American Century: How the U.S. Can Thrive As Other Powers Rise, but the proof is in the pudding. And in the end, the primacy strategy didn’t deliver. Primacy tempted our leaders into a reckless war in Iraq; it did not prevent North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons; it did nothing to slow China’s influence, as was its implicit goal; and it wrecked, with Moscow’s help, our relationship with Russia. A fixation on primacy paradoxically managed to undermine the influence and authority America did have. Nevertheless, the fact that the Bush administration embraced the notion of primacy was a comfort to the remaining Cold Warriors. President Barack Obama’s approach is different, to say the least. His political allies and his detractors can agree that Obama sees foreign policy not in terms of asserting America’s unparalleled might, but of seeking common cause, including with other major powers. On the one-year mark of his presidency, the contours of the new paradigm are fairly clear: Lead the world in addressing shared challenges Treat other governments and peoples, friends and foes, with respect Forge strategic collaborations with big, pivotal powers and demand responsibility from them on global challenges Reinvigorate and repair existing alliances Reengage with international institutions and rules, pushing for increased accountability Make basic political and economic rights available to more people, knowing that democratic government is the best way to achieve this goal As for primacy, Obama dismissed that as a strategy goal in his inaugural address when he observed, “Our power alone cannot protect us.” Later, in Moscow, Obama elaborated on his view of great power relations, saying, “a great power does not show strength by dominating or demonizing other countries…[G]iven our interdependence, any world order that tries to elevate one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail. The pursuit of power is no longer a zero-sum game—progress must be shared.” Robert Kagan now </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">accuses President Obama</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> of reorienting American foreign policy away from its WWII and Cold War roots, focusing on how “to adjust” to the decline in American primacy instead of trying to reverse it. He portrays administration officials as naïve ideologues, buttering up autocracies and forsaking our democratic allies. Kagan’s analyses fail to discuss two major developments that demand a new approach—the increased potency of transnational threats and the new salience of domestic policy in America’s world standing. Kagan writes as if the Obama administration is engaging with re-emerging powers to prove an ideological point that great power strife is a relic of history. Yet no staffer that I have ever spoken with would suggest that these relationships are beyond rivalry. More importantly, Kagan does not reveal the Obama administration’s reasons for pursuing strategic collaborations with China, Russia, India, and other pivotal powers. In fact, these partnerships are necessary to protect Americans from common threats in terrorists, global warming, economic crises, nuclear proliferation, and pandemics such as swine flu—the forces of disorder that can and do affect Americans right here at home. Kagan barely mentions these threats, but to keep its own people safe, America needs Russia to secure its loose nuclear materials so terrorists cant get it, China—the world’s largest emitter—to cut down on its carbon, India to help track extremists, and all of them to contain pandemics. How can we get these big, proud countries to take these steps? Aggressive diplomacy. Transnational threats also explain why the Obama administration is taking international institutions seriously. It’s not because the president is looking to attend more international meetings; it’s because international rules and institutions play a vital coordinating role when threats cross borders. The WHO led the battle against swine flu last year just as the IMF bailed out a slew of countries headed toward financial ruin. Fortunately, international architecture and traditional alliances are not mutually exclusive, as Kagan would imply. It’s still early days, but the Obama approach is paying dividends. China has agreed to limit its carbon intensity. And, for the first time last year, China not only voted for tough U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang—it also enforced them, in contrast to </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Kagan’s assertion</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> that the administration has failed to gain “any meaningful Chinese help in North Korea.” Russia has allowed the United States to transport supplies through its territory into Afghanistan. The Global initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, co-chaired by the United States and Russia, is up and running again. A successor to the START treaty to reduce our arsenal of nuclear weapons is not yet complete, but it’s on the way. And these nations and others agreed during the darkest days of the financial crisis to coordinate their macroeconomic moves. Iran remains a challenge, but Beijing and Moscow did recently join in a harsh rebuke that the International Atomic Energy Agency issued. Of course, we continue to have differences with these pivotal powers, including on human rights and democracy. Kagan is simply wrong to suggest that administration officials have failed to “continue to press Russia and China for reform.” They have, just not in a grandstanding, provocative way that ends up being counterproductive. Here, for example, is what President Obama said in Moscow: The arc of history shows us that governments which serve their own people survive and thrive; governments which serve only their own power do not. Governments that represent the will of their people are far less likely to descend into failed states, to terrorize their citizens, or to wage war on others. Governments that promote the rule of law, subject their actions to oversight, and allow for independent institutions are more dependable trading partners. And in our own history, democracies have been America’s most enduring allies, including those we once waged war with in Europe and Asia—nations that today live with great security and prosperity. And here is what he said in Beijing a few months later: Finally, as I did yesterday in Shanghai, I spoke to President Hu about America's bedrock beliefs that all men and women possess certain fundamental human rights. We do not believe these principles are unique to America, but rather they are universal rights and that they should be available to all peoples, to all ethnic and religious minorities. And our two countries agreed to continue to move this discussion forward in a human rights dialogue that is scheduled for early next year. Where does Kagan get the idea that Obama is not a champion for liberal democracy? The difference is that the Obama staffers have no illusions about how hard it is to impose a liberal transformation from the outside. Every country has to forge its own future. America can help, but we can’t call the shots. Kagan also accuses administration officials of squandering American primacy. “Instead of attempting to perpetuate American primacy,” he writes, “they are seeking to manage what they regard as America’s unavoidable decline relative to other great powers.” The truth is that America’s relative decline is, in fact, unavoidable in the short term. That’s just a matter of definition when China’s economy is growing at 8 percent or 10 percent, India’s at 6 percent, and ours not at all. It won’t always be this way, but it is now. Rather than pretending otherwise, the administration is facing and addressing this uncomfortable fact. Because while it is true that our toughest global challenges require cooperation, American power is a vital ingredient to securing the best possible future for Americans. Kagan declines to mention domestic policy, yet rebuilding American strength is, at the end of the day, a task for us here at home. Behind every great power is a great economy. We can try to perpetuate our power and influence all we like, but if our economy doesn’t begin to grow steadily again in the years to come, all our scrimping will be for naught—we simply will not be able to afford the tools for an expansive foreign policy, not to mention rising living standards for future Americans. Growing American strength is not about rhetoric; it involves tough political choices. Getting politicians to prioritize long-term success over short-term gain is never easy. The unifying theme of President Obama’s domestic agenda is retooling America so it can prosper in the global economy. That is what the health care debate, investments in basic science, green technologies, and public education are all about., not to mention the banking rules designed to prevent another bubble/bust cycle. All of these investments would be a lot easier if the last administration hadn’t committed a trillion dollars to a needless war. Talk about squandering primacy. America will bounce back. And it will continue to be an indispensible nation, not because of our unassailable power, but because of our ideas, our flexibility, and our leadership – the strengths that in fact enabled our still vast military superiority. Fortunately, Barack Obama has proven to be a leader that reads America’s virtues broadly, and enlists others in their promise. Perhaps it is simply too inclusive a world-view for those that miss the clarity of a bipolar ideological contest. But as Obama has pointed out, such clarity is a luxury we can no longer afford. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The unipolar moment is over – globalization has eroded all benefits of American hegemony and the EU and China are becoming the centers of geopolitics – only settling for a multipolar world can solve their impacts.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The new multicolor map of influence — a Venn diagram of overlapping American, Chinese and European influence — is a very fuzzy read. No more “They’re with us” or “He’s our S.O.B.” Mubarak, Musharraf, Malaysia’s Mahathir and a host of other second-world leaders have set a new standard for manipulative prowess: all tell the U.S. they are its friend while busily courting all sides. What is more, many second-world countries are confident enough to form anti-imperial belts of their own, building trade, technology and diplomatic axes across the (second) world from Brazil to Libya to Iran to Russia. Indeed, Russia has stealthily moved into position to construct Iran’s Bushehr nuclear reactor, putting it firmly in the Chinese camp on the Iran issue, while also offering nuclear reactors to Libya and arms to Venezuela and Indonesia. Second-world countries also increasingly use sovereign-wealth funds (often financed by oil) worth trillions of dollars to throw their weight around, even bullying first-world corporations and markets. The United Arab Emirates (particularly as represented by their capital, Abu Dhabi), Saudi Arabia and Russia are rapidly climbing the ranks of foreign-exchange holders and are hardly holding back in trying to buy up large shares of Western banks (which have suddenly become bargains) and oil companies. Singapore’s sovereign-wealth fund has taken a similar path. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia plans an international investment fund that will dwarf Abu Dhabi’s. From Switzerland to Citigroup, a reaction is forming to limit the shares such nontransparent sovereign-wealth funds can control, showing just how quickly the second world is rising in the global power game. To understand the second world, you have to start to think like a second-world country. What I have seen in these and dozens of other countries is that globalization is not synonymous with Americanization; in fact, nothing has brought about the erosion of American primacy faster than globalization.While European nations redistribute wealth to secure or maintain first-world living standards, on the battlefield of globalization second-world countries’ state-backed firms either outhustle or snap up American companies, leaving their workers to fend for themselves. The second world’s first priority is not to become America but to succeed by any means necessary. The Non-American World Karl Marx and Max Weber both chastised Far Eastern cultures for being despotic, agrarian and feudal, lacking the ingredients for organizational success. Oswald Spengler saw it differently, arguing that mankind both lives and thinks in unique cultural systems, with Western ideals neither transferable nor relevant. Today the Asian landscape still features ancient civilizations but also by far the most people and, by certain measures, the most money of any region in the world. With or without America, Asia is shaping the world’s destiny — and exposing the flaws of the grand narrative of Western civilization in the process. The rise of China in the East and of the European Union within the West has fundamentally altered a globe that recently appeared to have only an American gravity — pro or anti. As Europe’s and China’s spirits rise with every move into new domains of influence, America’s spirit is weakened. The E.U. may uphold the principles of the United Nations that America once dominated, but how much longer will it do so as its own social standards rise far above this lowest common denominator? And why should China or other Asian countries become “responsible stakeholders,” in former Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick’s words, in an American-led international order when they had no seat at the table when the rules were drafted? Even as America stumbles back toward multilateralism, others are walking away from the American game and playing by their own rules. The self-deluding universalism of the American imperium — that the world inherently needs a single leader and that American liberal ideology must be accepted as the basis of global order— has paradoxically resulted in America quickly becoming an ever-lonelier superpower. Just as there is a geopolitical marketplace, there is a marketplace of models of success for the second world to emulate, not least the Chinese model of economic growth without political liberalization (itself an affront to Western modernization theory). As the historian Arnold Toynbee observed half a century ago, Western imperialism united the globe, but it did not assure that the West would dominate forever — materially or morally. Despite the “mirage of immortality” that afflicts global empires, the only reliable rule of history is its cycles of imperial rise and decline, and as Toynbee also pithily noted, the only direction to go from the apogee of power is down. The web of globalization now has three spiders. What makes America unique in this seemingly value-free contest is not its liberal democratic ideals — which Europe may now represent better than America does — but rather its geography. America is isolated, while Europe and China occupy two ends of the great Eurasian landmass that is the perennial center of gravity of geopolitics. When America dominated NATO and led a rigid Pacific alliance system with Japan, South Korea, Australia and Thailand, it successfully managed the Herculean task of running the world from one side of it. Now its very presence in Eurasia is tenuous; it has been shunned by the E.U. and Turkey, is unwelcome in much of the Middle East and has lost much of East Asia’s confidence. “Accidental empire” or not, America must quickly accept and adjust to this reality. Maintaining America’s empire can only get costlier in both blood and treasure. It isn’t worth it, and history promises the effort will fail. It already has. Would the world not be more stable if America could be reaccepted as its organizing principle and leader? It’s very much too late to be asking, because the answer is unfolding before our eyes. Neither China nor the E.U. will replace the U.S. as the world’s sole leader; rather all three will constantly struggle to gain influence on their own and balance one another. Europe will promote its supranational integration model as a path to resolving Mideast disputes and organizing Africa, while China will push a Beijing consensus based on respect for sovereignty and mutual economic benefit. America must make itself irresistible to stay in the game. I believe that a complex, multicultural landscape filled with transnational challenges from terrorism to global warming is completely unmanageable by a single authority, whether the United States or the United Nations. Globalization resists centralization of almost any kind. Instead, what we see gradually happening in climate-change negotiations (as in Bali in December) — and need to see more of in the areas of preventing nuclear proliferation and rebuilding failed states — is a far greater sense of a division of labor among the Big Three, a concrete burden-sharing among them by which they are judged not by their rhetoric but the responsibilities they fulfill. The arbitrarily composed Security Council is not the place to hash out such a division of labor. Neither are any of the other multilateral bodies bogged down with weighted voting and cacophonously irrelevant voices. The big issues are for the Big Three to sort out among themselves.</span><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">The United States has a hegemony problem because it wields hegemonic power. To reduce the fear of U.S. power, the United States must accept some reduction in its relative hard power by adopting a multipolar—and essentially unilateral—offshore balancing strategy that accommodates the rise of new great powers. 130It also must rein in the scope of its extravagant ambitions to shape the international system in accordance with its Wilsonian ideology. The United States does not need to be an extraregional hegemon to be secure. Its quest for hegemony is driven instead by an ideational, deterritorialized conception of security divorced from the traditional metrics of great power grand strategy: the distribution of power in the international system and geography. 131 Thus, to reduce others' concerns about its power, the United States must practice self-restraint(which is different from choosing to be constrained by others by adopting a multilateral approach to grand strategy).An Americathat has the wisdom and prudence to contain itself is less likely to be feared than one that begs the rest of the world to stop it before it expands hegemonically again. If the United States fails to adopt an offshore balancing strategy based on multipolarity and military and ideological self-restraint, it probably will, at some point, have to fight to uphold its primacy, which is a potentially dangerous strategy. Maintaining U.S. hegemony is a game that no longer is worth the candle, especially given that U.S. primacy may already be in the early stages of erosion. Paradoxically, attempting to sustain U.S. primacy may well hasten its end by stimulating more intensive efforts to balance against the United States, thus causing the United States to become imperially overstretched and involving it in unnecessary wars that will reduce its power. Rather than risking these outcomes, the United States should begin to retrench strategically and capitalize on the advantages accruing to insular great powers in multipolar systems. Unilateral offshore balancing, indeed, is America's next grand strategy.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Terrorism: When Over There Becomes Over Here 9/11 was not a random act of violence visited upon the United States. The United States was the target of al Qaeda’s terrorist strikes because that group harbored specific political grievances against the United States. If we step back for a moment from our horror and revulsion at the events of September 11, we can see that the attack was in keeping with the Clausewitzian paradigm of war: force was used against the United States by its adversaries to advance their political objectives. As Michael Scheurer, who headed the CIA analytical team monitoring Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, put it, “In the context of ideas bin Laden shares with his brethren, the military actions of al Qaeda and its allies are acts of war, not terrorism...meant to advance bin Laden’s clear, focused, limited, and widely popular foreign policy goals 50Terrorism, Bruce Hoffman says, is “about power: the pursuit of power, the acquisition of power, and use of power to achieve political change.”5’ As Clausewitz himself observed, “war is not an act of senseless passion but is controlled by its political object.”52 Terrorism really is a form of asymmetric warfare waged against the United States by groups that lack the military wherewithal to slug it out with the United States toe-to-toe. 9/11 was a violent counterreaction to America’s geopolitical—and cultural—primacy. As Richard K. Betts presciently observed in a 1998 Foreign Affairs article, “It is hardly likely that Middle Eastern radicals would be hatching schemes like the destruction of the World Trade Center if the United States had not been identified so long as the mainstay of Israel, the shah of Iran, and conservative Arab regimes and the source of a cultural assault on Islam.” U.S. primacy fuels terrorist groups like al Qaeda and fans Islamic fundamentalism, which is a form of ”blowback” against America’s preponderance and its world role.54 As long as the United States uses its global primacy [end page 69] to impose its imperial sway on regions like the Persian Gulf, it will be the target of politically motivated terrorist groups like at Qaeda.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The potential consequences of the unchecked spread of nuclear knowledge and material to terrorist groups that seek to cause mass destruction in the United States are truly horrifying. A terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon would be devastating in terms of immediate human and economic losses. 49 Moreover, there would be immense political pressure in the United States to discover the perpetrators and retaliate with nuclear weapons, massively increasing the number of casualties and potentially triggering a full-scale nuclear conflict. 50 In addition to the threat posed by terrorists, leakage of nuclear knowledge and material from Russia will reduce the barriers that states with nuclear ambitions face and may trigger widespread proliferation of nuclear weapons. 51 This proliferation will increase the risk of nuclear attacks against the United States[*1440] or its allies by hostile states, 52 as well as increase the likelihood that regional conflicts will draw in the United States and escalate to the use of nuclear weapons. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The world is paying a heavy price for the instability created by the combination of globalization and unipolarity, and the United States is bearing most of the burden. Consider the case of nuclear proliferation. There’s effectively a market out there for proliferation, with its own supply (states willing to share nuclear technology) and demand (states that badly want a nuclear weapon). The overlap of unipolarity with globalization ratchets up both the supply and demand, to the detriment of U.S. national security. It has become fashionable, in the wake of the Iraq war, to comment on the limits of conventional military force. But much of this analysis is overblown. The United States may not be able to stabilize and rebuild Iraq. But that doesn’t matter much from the perspective of a government that thinks the Pentagon has it in its sights. In Tehran, Pyongyang, and many other capitals, including Beijing, the bottom line is simple: The U.S. military could, with conventional force, end those regimes tomorrow if it chose to do so. No country in the world can dream of challenging U.S. conventional military power. But they can certainly hope to deter America from using it. And the best deterrent yet invented is the threat of nuclear retaliation. Before 1989, states that felt threatened by the United States could turn to the Soviet Union’s nuclear umbrella for protection. Now, they turn to people like A.Q. Khan. Having your own nuclear weapon used to be a luxury. Today, it is fast becoming a necessity.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Escalation of violence isalso basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchangesof violent acts can escalate to levels unimaginedby the participants before hand. Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible. In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possiblewith the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild Westof the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear ‘six-shooters’ on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The strategy of empire could prove counterproductive in other ways as well. For starters, Washington’s self-assumed responsibility to keep order could be exploited by all sorts of states wanting to advance their own goals. Taiwan could declare its independence with the expectation that the United States would protect it from China’s reaction; Pakistan could exploit its new strategic importance by successfully challenging India on Kashmir; rebel groups everywhere could intentionally provoke crackdowns—like the Kosovo Liberation Army did in southern Serbia in 1999—with the presumption that the United States would step in and internationalize their cause; and Arab countries, knowing that the Bush administration needs their support for any invasion of Iraq, are withholding it, unless the United States can show progress in its efforts to mediate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</span><br />

How would things be different in a multipolar world? For starters, great powers could split the job of policing proliferation, and even collaborate on some particularly hard cases. It’s often forgotten now that, during the Cold War, the only state with a tougher nonproliferation policy than the United States was the Soviet Union. Not a single country that had a formal alliance with Moscow ever became a nuclear power. The Eastern bloc was full of countries with advanced technological capabilities in every area except one—nuclear weapons. Moscow simply wouldn’t permit it. But today we see the uneven and inadequate level of effort that non-superpowers devote to stopping proliferation. The Europeans dangle carrots at Iran, but they are unwilling to consider serious sticks. The Chinese refuse to admit that there is a problem. And the Russians are aiding Iran’s nuclear ambitions. When push comes to shove, nonproliferation today is almost entirely America’s burden. Extend the Preble evidence – trade routes are safe and the economy is resilient, there’s no reason for a super power to ensure peace in the world. It’s unrealistic to expect a wave of global conflict if the US were to draw down its power.<br />

Looking for a sign of when the multipolar moment suddenly seemed real? You could do worse than mark the day when Brazil and Turkey -- two of the world's most avidly internationalist emerging powers -- joined together this May to announce they had stepped in to broker a nuclear-fuel swap deal with Iran that potentially -- though sadly not actually -- paved the way toward a peaceful solution to the standoff. Turkey and Brazil aren't superpowers, nor are they permanent U.N. Security Council members. But just as U.S. President Barack Obama came into office preaching a renewed focus on multilateralism, rising powers are reminding us that respect for hierarchy is no longer on anyone's agenda. What a difference a couple of decades makes. A little over 20 years ago, then U.S. President George H.W. Bush -- who had just witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall and saw the Soviet Union disintegrating before his very eyes -- stood at the granite podium of the U.N. General Assembly in New York and proclaimed a &quot;new world order,&quot; a U.S.-dominated international system &quot;where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle.&quot; Two decades later, the &quot;new new world order&quot; we are in fact living looks almost nothing like what Bush -- and most Americans -- imagined or hoped. The United States still has the world's most powerful military, of course, but its utility is diminishing as the capacity to deter and resist spreads. Just look at Iraq and Afghanistan. Military might and political influence no longer necessarily go together, and too much of the former can even undermine the latter. More fundamentally, the world has quickly become multipolar, with the European Union a larger economic player than the United States while China rises quickly on all measures of hard and soft power. Obama couldn't give the &quot;New World Order&quot; speech today; he'd have to negotiate it first with his peers in Brussels and Beijing. And as for democracy: Meet authoritarian state capitalism, a new entry into our lexicon that underscores the non-Western options every state can pursue today. Nobody's talking about the Washington Consensus anymore -- instead the Beijing Consensus, the Mumbai Consensus, and even something only half-jokingly called the Canuck Consensus are competing for the hearts and minds of global elites. Rather than a world of alliances, it's a world of multi-alignment. Globalization means never having to choose sides. Look at the Persian Gulf states. They make big-ticket arms deals with Washington, buying weapons to recycle their petrodollars and deter Iran; sign huge trade agreements with China, where ever more of their oil flows; and negotiate currency arrangements with the European Union. If there is any doubt as to the general lack of foresight that governs international relations today, just consider how America has ceased certain joint weapons production with Israel as punishment for Israel's selling sensitive technology to China, which in turn sells missile technologies to Iran, whose leadership wishes to eradicate Israel from the map. Everyone is playing everyone else in what seem like endless single-iteration prisoner's dilemma games. Bush Sr. chose to give the speech at the United Nations for a reason: America was the preeminent power, but he was a multilateralist. Paralyzed during the Cold War, the United Nations now had a chance toplay the central role as arbiter of global governance for which it was envisioned. But rather than personify multilateralism itself, the United Nations is proving to be at best just one manifestation of it. Free-standing functional agencies like the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund -- which has only become more important in the wake of the financial crisis -- are our only effective global bodies, and they are solely economic in nature. But the G-20 has hardly lived up to its billing as the new &quot;steering committee for the world.&quot; Before the most recent Seoul summit, world leaders described U.S. proposals for harmonizing current account surpluses and deficits as &quot;clueless.&quot; The Security Council has long ceased to be legitimate or effective, with little prospect for reform in sight. As we learned so painfully this year, the United Nations can't forge a global climate deal and can't make the world meet the Millennium Development Goals. For every issue there are now several specialized agencies, like the World Food Program and Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, that mostly secure their own funding contributions and are evolving at their own pace. The closest thing we have to multilateral governance happens on a regional level, and it is far more promising, whether the deeply entrenched and supranational European Union, the rejuvenated Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or the nascent African Union. Each is building a regional order tailored to its members' priorities and level of development. On Sudan and Somalia, it's Uganda leading the new diplomatic and peacekeeping push. For Palestine, the Arab League is considering a peacekeeping force. And on Iran, Turkey is now in the lead. The world of 1990 was expected to remain fundamentally international. Yet instead its very structure has changed as globalization has empowered legions of transnational nonstate actors from corporations to NGOs to religious groups. As a result, today's world features overlapping and competing claims to authority and legitimacy. The Gates Foundation gives away more money each year than any European country. Villagers in Nigeria expect Shell to deliver the goods, not their government. And Oxfam shapes the British development agency's priorities more than the reverse. Neither the United States nor the United Nations can put the genie back in the bottle. With each passing year, deal-making at Davos and the Clinton Global Initiative become more important than the glacial advance of empty declarations at international summits. These and other venues are the places where the &quot;new new world order&quot; is being built. And it's happening from the bottom up rather than the top down.<br />

Elements of an apocalyptic frame could be said to exist in most of the articles we read, though all elements were not present in each article. Nonetheless, apocalyptic framing should give us pause, for it threatens to hinder progress in forming a political will to change the carbon-based energy economy (and thus mitigate the consequences of global warming). To announce the coming of the apocalypse creates despair as people feel they cannot stop such an event, but can only hope that they are among the chosen few to be saved (if they believe in the immanence of the end). Apocalyptic framing also creates denial, as when people fail to exit the movie theater because they have heard fire yelled once too often. There may also be a sense of denial in terms of the effectiveness of solutions: Why make changes to our lifestyle, if the world is going to end [end page 22] quickly and our actions don’t make a difference anyway? If the end is, indeed, the total destruction of earth, won’t our efforts to make change now be in vain? As Brummett suggests of pre-millennial apocalyptic rhetoric (which assumes that the world will be destroyed after a judgment day), the cosmically mandated telos of catastrophe overshadows any efforts to change the trajectory of the narrative. The only place for human agency within such rhetoric is the capacity to agree with prophesies, against the polarized opposition of non-believers. By agreeing with the prophesies, “believers” feel a sense of control over the situation because they are “right,” not necessarily because they are taking collective and personal steps to resolve the issue.<br />

While the dangers of climate change are real, I argue that there are even greater dangers in representing it as the most urgent problem we face. Framing climate change in such a manner deserves to be challenged for two reasons: it encourages the restriction of proposed solutions to the technical realm, by powerfully insinuating that the needed approaches are those that directly address the problem; and it detracts attention from the planet's ecological predicament as a whole, by virtue of claiming the limelight for the one issue that trumps all others. Identifying climate change as the biggest threat to civilization, and ushering it into center stage as the highest priority problem, has bolstered the proliferation of technical proposals that address the specific challenge. The race is on for figuring out what technologies, or portfolio thereof, will solve &quot;the problem. &quot; Whether the call is for reviving nuclear power, boosting the installation of wind turbines, using a variety of renewable energy sources, increasing the efficiency of fossil-fuel use, developing carbon-sequestering technologies, or placing mirrors in space to deflect the sun's rays, the narrow character of such proposals is evident: confront the problem of greenhouse gas emissions by technologically phasing them out, superseding them, capturing them, or mitigating their heating effects. In his The Revenge of Gaia, for example, Lovelock briefly mentions the need to face climate change by &quot;changing our whole style of living. &quot;16 [end page 33] But the thrust of this work, what readers and policy-makers come away with, is his repeated and strident call for investing in nuclear energy as, in his words, &quot;the one lifeline we can use immediately. &quot;17 In the policy realm, the first step toward the technological fix for global warming is often identified with implementing the Kyoto protocol. Biologist Tim Flannery agitates for the treaty, comparing the need for its successful endorsement to that of the Montreal protocol that phased out the ozone-depleting CFCs. &quot;The Montreal protocol,&quot; he submits, &quot;marks a signal moment in human societal development, representing the first ever victory by humanity over a global pollution problem. &quot;18 He hopes for a similar victory for the global climate-change problem. Yet the deepening realization of the threat of climate change, virtually in the wake of stratospheric ozone depletion, also suggests that dealing with global problems treaty-by-treaty is no solution to the planet's predicament. Just as the risks of unanticipated ozone depletion have been followed by the dangers of a long underappreciated climate crisis, so it would be naïve not to anticipate another (perhaps even entirely unforeseeable) catastrophe arising after the (hoped-for) resolution of the above two. Furthermore, if greenhouse gases were restricted successfully by means of technological shifts and innovations, the root cause of the ecological crisis as a whole would remain unaddressed. The destructive patterns of production, trade, extraction, land-use, waste proliferation, and consumption, coupled with population growth, would go unchallenged, continuing to run down the integrity, beauty, and biological richness of the Earth. Industrial-consumer civilization has entrenched a form of life that admits virtually no limits to its expansiveness within, and perceived entitlement to, the entire planet. 19 But questioning this civilization is by [end page 34] and large sidestepped in climate-change discourse, with its single-minded quest for a global-warming techno-fix. 20 Instead of confronting the forms of social organization that are causing the climate crisis—among numerous other catastrophes—climate-change literature often focuses on how global warming is endangering the culprit, and agonizes over what technological means can save it from impending tipping points. 21 The dominant frame of climate change funnels cognitive and pragmatic work toward specifically addressing global warming, while muting a host of equally monumental issues. Climate change looms so huge [end page 35] on the environmental and political agenda today that it has contributed to downplaying other facets of the ecological crisis: mass extinction of species, the devastation of the oceans by industrial fishing, continued old-growth deforestation, topsoil losses and desertification, endocrine disruption, incessant development, and so on, are made to appear secondary and more forgiving by comparison with &quot;dangerous anthropogenic interference&quot; with the climate system. In what follows, I will focus specifically on how climate-change discourse encourages the continued marginalization of the biodiversity crisis—a crisis that has been soberly described as a holocaust,22 and which despite decades of scientific and environmentalist pleas remains a virtual non-topic in society, the mass media, and humanistic and other academic literatures. Several works on climate change (though by no means all) extensively examine the consequences of global warming for biodiversity,23 but rarely is it mentioned that biodepletion predates dangerous greenhouse-gas buildup by decades, centuries, or longer, and will not be stopped by a technological resolution of global warming. dClimate change is poised to exacerbate species and ecosystem losses—indeed, is doing so already. But while technologically preempting the worst of climate change may temporarily avert some of those losses, such a resolution of the climate quandary will not put an end to—will barely address—the ongoing destruction of life on Earth.<br />

A discourse-analytic approach is appropriate in that discourses are powerful forces within policy debates. Discourses can be thought of as “specific ensembles of ideas, concepts and categorization that are produced, reproduced and transformed in a particular set of practices and through which meaning is given to physical and social realities”<br />

<br />
The White House has announced plans to host a conference in Florida on April 15 during which President Obama will unveil his vision for the U. S. space program. If recent moves by the administration are any indication, this new vision will significantly curtail public funding for space activity. The president is working hard to spin the upcoming change as a transition rather than a cut, and perhaps for good reason: He is unlikely to find a receptive audience in Florida, long a recipient of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s largess. But while the swing-state politics of the Sunshine State may compel Obama to tread carefully, we as the general public should recognize this new policy for what it is: a dramatic reduction in human space exploration. We should also support Obama for his fiscal discipline in cutting what has been a horrendous waste of our society’s resources. With apologies to Dwight Eisenhower, the cost of one modern space shuttle is this: one and a half million lives lost for wont of anti-malarial bed nets. It is electricity to power a U. S. city of two million people for a year. It is nine-hundred billion gallons of fresh drinking water produced by desalination. We pay for a single shuttle launch with fifty million bushels of wheat. We house a handful of men in space with a year’s worth of housing for more than ten million U. S. citizens. NASA is not just spending money. It is spending the sweat of our laborers, the genius of our scientists, the hopes of our children. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the clouds of this space-industrial complex, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron. Proponents claim that on its route to the stars, NASA has completed research that has benefited the rest of mankind. It is true, NASA research has led to many discoveries: Besides its many advances in satellites and computing, NASA can also claim credit for a host of more mundane things — quartz timing crystals, bar-code scanners, smoke detectors, cordless screwdrivers, and velcro. But let us not deceive ourselves into thinking that all of NASA’s budget can be recompensed by the occasional spin-offs from its R&amp;D program. Let us not buy into the delusion that all of the low-hanging fruit that NASA has picked over the years would have gone undiscovered forever, or that we would never have achieved satellites without luxuries such as the Apollo missions. Not only is it the case that research is a small component of NASA’s activities, but it should also be self-evident that had NASA’s budget been applied directly to the betterment of humanity, the direct gains of that spending would have outweighed the tangential gains from the occasional cross-utilization of space technology here on earth. Think about it this way: MIT, from a mixture of tuition, government funding, and endowment payouts, spends $2. 5 billion to keep itself running. NASA costs more than $17 billion. Over the past four decades, instead of NASA, we could have had at least six additional MIT’s. Consider all of the research that our single MIT has produced during that period, all of the students taught and leadership provided. For all the gains that NASA has made, its opportunity costs are far greater. Something does not need to be a 100 percent complete and total waste in order to call it wasteful. Even the most hard-hearted of critics must admit that the organization has chalked up many victories in the fight to improve the world. But humanity deserves more than just the scraps of NASA’s occasional research. Humanity deserves better than the continuation of an ill-advised space race with a geopolitical enemy that disappeared nearly two decades ago. Humanity deserves our full and undivided attention — no more playing golf on the moon or entertaining fanciful notions of putting men on Mars. Feeding and clothing people might not be as sexy as space exploration, but in the broader picture it is a just and nobler goal. Mr. Levinger argues that NASA is small potatoes, a mere drop in the bucket compared to, say, spending on the military. But just because NASA is a small waste, or a waste among many, does not mean it isn’t waste, or that it should be ignored. Nothing should be given a free pass. For every dollar spent, we should consider the human cost. That sounds melodramatic, but it is hard not to sound melodramatic when a billion people live on less than a dollar per day. When you have to make choices between food, water, and shelter, considering the human cost of a dollar isn’t melodramatic — it’s routine. Mr. Levinger may not see a direct connection between our society spending resources in one area, and going without in another, but to those who understand the functioning of the free market, the connection is clear. An engineer who works for NASA developing zero-g fluid pumps is not an engineer developing water pumps for rural Africa. A tax dollar taken to purchase a bolt is a dollar not given through charity to buy food for a hungry child. The slightest of upticks in the price of aluminum for a shuttle wing shifts millions of dollars of investment across the world. The fungibility is not perfect, and Mr. Levinger is right to point this out. But a NASA dollar does not come directly out of the world’s budget for candy and cosmetics either. The more poetic among us say that NASA has given millions hope, that it is a symbol of the ingenuity and ambition of the human race. Mr. Levinger himself thinks of it as “heroic. ” I disagree. Why should it be the case that investing in space travel is more inspiring than spending that money on the poorest of our fellow man? Doesn’t such an obsession with space imply not that we are an ambitious race, but instead that we doubt the goodness of human nature? Doesn’t it suggest that we are so convinced of our inevitable self-destruction that we would rather fling ourselves into the hostile unknown than risk submitting ourselves to the cruelties of our fellow man? Where others see an adventurer’s spirit, I see existential worry and cowardly desperation. Every thruster that is made, every spaceship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. Rather than gambling on the stars, why not inspire our children by investing in ourselves, by committing to the belief that human life on Earth is sustainable, by devoting new resources to overcome the problems that we face? The cold war is over. The political one-upmanship that NASA was founded upon is a thing of the past. It is time to recognize that mankind has higher priorities than planting flags on planets.<br />

<br />
Towards the notion of biopolitics in Arendt’s thought What does it mean to characterize the present equation of politics and violence in terms of biopolitics? And how can this non-Arendtian notion make sense within Arendt’s work? Let us begin with the first question. My contention is that the distinguishing mark of the political from the turn of the nineteen century to the present day is the following paradox: the elevation of life to the status of the supreme good combined with the multiplication of instances in which life is degraded to the utmost. I believe, therefore, that the constitutive element of the political in the present is the reduction of citizenship to the level of “bare life”, as Agamben understands it. Human life is thus politicised, divided between life included and protected by the political and economic community and life excluded and unprotected, exposed to degradation and death 10) As to the second question – how the notion of biopolitics may fit into Arendt’s work: we find an answer encapsulated in Arendt’s thesis regarding the “unnatural growth of the natural,” a peculiar formula meant to capture the main historical transformations of the modern age. This notion comprehends a range of different historical phenomena stemming from the Industrial Revolution, such as: the spread of the capitalist form of production; the widening of the realm of human ‘life processes’ (that is, labouring and consuming), to the point that life itself becomes the supreme good and the furtherance of these processes (which centre on the private interests of animal laborans) the most important object of politics; the requirement of the continuous production and consumption of goods in ever increasing abundance, so that nature is reduced to a stock of natural resources – a stock abused to the point where its self-reproducing character is endangered; the promotion of labouring activity to the status of the most important human activity and the concomitant understanding of human beings primarily as animal laborans, a living being whose needs are satisfied by the cycle of labouring and consuming. In this process the public sphere is transformed into a social one, that is, a market for economic exchanges based on a cycle of ceaseless production and consumption. From the nineteenth century onwards, then, the political realm has been overrun by individual, social and economic interests, which today we see massed in the form of international corporations, coercive international trade regimes, financial globalisation and free-market ideologies. This results from politics becoming the activity of managing the production and reproduction ofanimal laborans’ life and happiness. To put it in Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt’s terms, the industrial and financial powers of the present produce not only commodities, but also subjectivities, needs, social relations, bodies and minds, since they actually produce the producers. Politically, perhaps the most salient consequence of this historical process is that we do not know if there is even any space left for the establishment of new and radical political alternatives, since all state policies – above all in underdeveloped countries – are always subject to the decidedly unstable flows of international financial investments, stock-exchange fluctuations and global financial institutions such as the World Bank. The changes associated with the development of global capitalism imply many losses, if we follow Arendt: the loss of the political as a space of freedom, replaced by requirements of economic necessity; free and spontaneous action replaced by predictable, conformist behaviour;11)he subordination of public and shared interests to those of private lobbies and other hidden pressure groups, freed from public vigilance by the withering of the public realm; the submission of all political opinion to the supposedly inexorable laws of market economics; the substitution of violence for the power won through persuasion; the weakening of the citizen’s ability to consent and to dissent, our ability to act in concert replaced at best by the solitary experience of voting; the reduction of the political arena to disputes among bureaucratic and oligarchic party machines; with a compliant media depicting those who do not accept their game-rules as ‘anarchists,’ ‘rioters,’ even ‘terrorists. ’ The ‘citizen’ consumes in the democratic-supermarket: choose from a strictly limited variety of political brands, with no option to question the political options on offer. (And what would the question be when all political parties declare that their aim is to protect citizens’ interests and quality of life?) As Agamben argues, to question the limitations of our political system has become more and more difficult since politics has been declared as the task of caring for and administering bare life. In this situation, traditional political distinctions (right-left, liberalism-totalitarianism, private-public) have lost their intelligibility, since all political categories are subordinated to the demands of bare life. Since “capitalism has become one with reality,” we are condemned, in Marina Garcés’s words, ‘to make choices in an elective space in which there are no options. Everything is possible, but we can do nothing. ’12). Even the practices and discourses of the so-called anti-globalisation movements – “another globalisation is possible” and the like – are largely unable to create real alternatives to the economic realities they are intent on confronting. These historic transformations have not only brought more violence to the core of the political but have also redefined its character by giving rise to biopolitical violence. As stated, what characterizes biopolitics is a dynamic of both protecting and abandoning life through its inclusion and exclusion from the political and economic community. In Arendtian terms, the biopolitical danger is best described as the risk of converting animal laborans into Agamben’s homo sacer, the human being who can be put to death by anyone and whose killing does not imply any crime whatsoever 13). When politics is conceived of as biopolitics, as the task of increasing the life and happiness of the nationalanimal laborans, the nation-state becomes ever more violent and murderous. If we link Arendt’s thesis from The Human Condition to those of The Origins of Totalitarianism, we can see the Nazi and Stalinist extermination camps as the most refined experiments in annihilating the “bare life” of animal laborans (although these are by no means the only instances in which the modern state has devoted itself to human slaughter). Arendt is not concerned only with the process of the extermination itself, but also the historical situation in which large-scale exterminations were made possible – above all, the emergence of ‘uprooted’ and ‘superfluous’ modern masses, what we might describe as animal laborans balanced on the knife-edge of ‘bare life. ’ Compare her words in ‘Ideology and Terror’ (1953), which became the conclusion of later editions of The Origins of Totalitarianism: Isolation is that impasse into which men are driven when the political sphere of their lives… is destroyed… Isolated man who lost his place in the political realm of action is deserted by the world of things as well, if he is no longer recognized as homo faber but treated as an animal laborans whose necessary ‘metabolism with nature’ is of concern to no one. Isolation then become loneliness… Loneliness, the common ground for terror, the essence of totalitarian government, and for ideology or logicality, the preparation of its executioners and victims, is closely connected with uprootedness and superfluousness which have been the curse of modern masses since the beginning of the industrial revolution and have become acute with the rise of imperialism at the end of the last century and the break-down of political institutions and social traditions in our own time. To be uprooted means to have no place in the world, recognized and guaranteed by others; to be superfluous means not to belong to the world at all 14). The conversion of homo faber, the human being as creator of durable objects and institutions, into animal laborans and, later on, into homo sacer, can be traced in Arendt’s account of nineteenth century imperialism. As argued in the second volume of The Origins of Totalitarianism, European colonialism combined racism and bureaucracy to perpetrate the “most terrible massacres in recent history, the Boers’ extermination of Hottentot tribes, the wild murdering by Carl Peters in German Southeast Africa, the decimation of the peaceful Congo population – from 20 to 40 million reduced to 8 million people; and finally, perhaps worst of all, it resulted in the triumphant introduction of such means of pacification into ordinary, respectable foreign policies. ” 15) This simultaneous protection and destruction of life was also at the core of the two World Wars, as well as in many other more local conflicts, during which whole populations have become stateless or deprived of a public realm. In spite of all their political differences, the United States of Roosevelt, the Soviet Russia of Stalin, the Nazi Germany of Hitler and the Fascist Italy of Mussolini were all conceived of as states devoted to the needs of the national animal laborans. According to Agamben, since our contemporary politics recognizes no other value than life, Nazism and fascism, that is, regimes which have taken bare life as their supreme political criterion are bound to remain standing temptations 16). Finally, it is obvious that this same logic of promoting and annihilating life persists both in post-industrial and in underdeveloped countries, inasmuch as economic growth depends on the increase of unemployment and on many forms of political exclusion. When politics is reduced to the tasks of administering, preserving and promoting the life and happiness of animal laborans it ceases to matter that those objectives require increasingly violent acts, both in national and international arenas. Therefore, we should not be surprised that the legality of state violence has become a secondary aspect in political discussions, since what really matters is to protect and stimulate the life of the national (or, as the case may be, Western) animal laborans. In order to maintain sacrosanct ideals of increased mass production and mass consumerism, developed countries ignore the finite character of natural reserves and refuse to sign International Protocols regarding natural resource conservation or pollution reduction, thereby jeopardising future humanity. They also launch preventive attacks and wars, disregard basic human rights, for instance in extra-legal detention camps such as Guantánamo,27) and multiply refugee camps. Some countries have even imprisoned whole populations, physically isolating them from other communities, in a new form of social, political and economic apartheid. In short, states permit themselves to impose physical and structural violence against individuals and regimes (‘rogue states’ 18) ) that supposedly interfere with the security and growth of their national ‘life process. ’ If, according to Arendt, the common world consists of an institutional in-between meant to outlast both human natality and mortality, in modern mass societies we find the progressive abolition of the institutional artifice that separates and protects our world from the forces of nature 19). This explains the contemporary feeling of disorientation and unhappiness, likewise the political impossibility we find in combining stability and novelty 20). In the context of a “waste economy, in which things must be almost as quickly devoured and discarded as they have appeared in the world, if the process itself is not to come to a sudden catastrophic end,” 21) it is not only possible, but also necessary, that people themselves become raw material to be consumed, discarded, annihilated. In other words, when Arendt announces the “grave danger that eventually no object of the world will be safe from consumption and annihilation through consumption,” 22) we should also remember that human annihilation, once elevated to the status of an ‘end-in-itself’ in totalitarian regimes, still continues to occur – albeit in different degrees and by different methods, in contemporary ‘holes of oblivion’ such as miserably poor Third World neighbourhoods 23) and penitentiaries, underpaid and slave labour camps, in the name of protecting the vital interests of animal laborans. To talk about a process of human consumption is not to speak metaphorically but literally. Heidegger had realized this in his notes written during the late thirties, later published under the title of Overcoming Metaphysics. He claimed that the difference between war and peace had already been blurred in a society in which “metaphysical man, the animal rationale, gets fixed as the labouring animal,” so that “labour is now reaching the metaphysical rank of the unconditional objectification of everything present. ” 24) Heidegger argued that once the world becomes fully determined by the “circularity of consumption for the sake of consumption” it is at the brink of becoming an ‘unworld’ (Unwelt), since ‘man, who no longer conceals his character of being the most important raw material, is also drawn into the process. Man is “the most important raw material” because he remains the subject of all consumption. ’ 25) After the Second World War and the release of detailed information concerning the death factories Heidegger took his critique even further, acknowledging that to understand man as both subject and object of the consumption process would still not comprehend the process of deliberate mass extermination. He saw this, instead, in terms of the conversion of man into no more than an “item of the reserve fund for the fabrication of corpses” (Bestandestücke eines Bestandes der Fabrikation von Leichen). According to Heidegger, what happened in the extermination camps was that death became meaningless, and the existential importance of our anxiety in the face of death was lost; instead, people were robbed of the essential possibility of dying, so that they merely “passed away” in the process of being “inconspicuously liquidated” (unauffällig liquidiert). 26) The human being as animal laborans (Arendt), as homo sacer (Agamben), as an ‘item of the reserve fund’ (Heidegger) – all describe the same process of dehumanisation whereby humankind is reduced to the bare fact of being alive, with no further qualifications. As argued by Agamben, when it becomes impossible to differentiate between biós and zóe, that is, when bare life is transformed into a qualified or specific ‘form of life,’ we face the emergence of a biopolitical epoch 27). When states promote the animalisation of man by policies that aim at both protecting and destroying human life, we can interpret this in terms of the widespread presence of the homo sacer in our world: “If it is true that the figure proposed by our age is that of an unsacrificeable life that has nevertheless become capable of being killed to an unprecedented degree, then the bare life of homo sacer concerns us in a special way… If today there is no longer any one clear figure of the sacred man, it is perhaps because we are all virtually homines sacri. ” 28) Investigating changes in the way power was conceived of and exercised at the turn of the nineteenth century, Foucault realized that when life turned out to be a constitutive political element, managed, calculated, and normalized by means of biopolitics, political strategies soon became murderous. Paradoxically, when the Sovereign’s prerogative ceased to be simply that of imposing violent death, and became a matter of promoting the growth of life, wars became more and more bloody, mass killing more frequent. Political conflicts now aimed at preserving and intensifying the life of the winners, so that enmity ceased to be political and came to be seen biologically: it is not enough to defeat the enemy; it must be exterminated as a danger to the health of the race, people or community. Thus Foucault on the formation of the modern biopolitical paradigm at the end of the nineteenth century: …death that was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure, maintain or develop its life. Yet wars were never as bloody as they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things being equal, never before did regimes visit such holocausts on their own populations. But this formidable power of death… now presents itself as the counterpart of a power that exerts a positive influence on life that endeavours to administer, optimise, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations. Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they are waged on behalf of the existence of everyone; entire populations are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in the name of life necessity: massacres have become vital. It is as managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race, that so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars, causing so many men to be killed. And through a turn that closes the circle, as the technology of wars have caused them to tend increasingly toward all-out destruction, the decision that initiates them and the one that terminates them are in fact increasingly informed by the naked question of survival. The atomic situation is now at the end of point of this process: the power to expose a whole population to death is the underside of the power to guarantee an individual’s continued existence. The principle underlying the tactics of battle – that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on living – has become the principle that defines the strategy of states. But the existence in question is no longer the juridical existence of sovereignty; at stake is the biological existence of a population. If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population. 29) Expressed in terms of biopolitics, the death of the other does not imply only my own security and safety; inasmuch as the death of the other is the ‘death of the bad race, of the inferior race (or the degenerate, or the abnormal)’ it has to be understood as ‘something that will make life in general healthier; healthier and purer. ’30) In On Violence, Arendt argued a similar thesis concerning the violent character of racist and naturalist conceptions of politics: “Nothing could be theoretically more dangerous than the tradition of organic thought in political matters”; if power and violence are interpreted in terms of biological metaphors this can only produce more violence, especially where race is involved. Racism as an ideological system of thought is inherently violent, indeed murderous, because it attacks natural ‘biological’ data that, as such, cannot be changed by any power or persuasion, so that when conflicts become radicalised all that can be done is to ‘exterminate’ the other 31). Biopolitical violence is the result of a naturalized conception of the political, found both in totalitarianism and the quasi-totalitarian elements of modern mass democracies. For Arendt, all forms of naturalising the political threaten the political artifice of egalitarianism, without which no defence and validation of human freedom and dignity are possible. Arendt’s analysis of the terrible experience of refugees, of those interned in different kinds of concentration camps, of those left with no home and all those who have lost a secure place in the world, showed her that nature – and, of course, human nature – cannot ground and secure any rights or, indeed, any democratic politics. This revealed the paradox inherent in a naturalistic understanding of the Rights of Man, since once those rights ceased to be recognized and enforced by a political community, their inalienable character simply vanished, leaving unprotected the very human beings that most needed them: “The Rights of Man, supposedly inalienable, proved to be unenforceable… whenever people appeared who were no longer citizens of a sovereign state. ” 32) The loss of the Rights of Man qua rights of the citizen did not itself deprive a human being of his/her life, liberty, property, freedom of expression or freedom to pursue his happiness. The real predicament for people in these circumstances is that they “no longer belong to any community whatsoever. Their plight is not that they are not equal before the law, but that no law exists for them. ” 33) In other words, nationalistic and racialised biopolitics has produced a huge mass of people denied what Arendt termed the “right to have rights,” that is, the “right to belong to some kind of organized community”: “Man, it turns out, can lose all so-called Rights of Man without losing his essential quality as man, his human dignity. Only the loss of a polity itself expels him from humanity. ” 34) The “abstract nakedness” of merely being a human being is no substitute for the artificial character of the pacts freely entered into by active citizens. By analysing the dynamic of the extermination camps, Arendt understood that humanity is an attribute that goes categorically beyond the notion of the human being as a mere natural living being: “man’s ‘nature’ is only ‘human’ insofar as it opens up to man the possibility of becoming something highly unnatural, that is, a man. ” 35) In other words, humanity, politically speaking, does not reside in the natural fact of being alive; politically, humanity depends on artificial legal and political institutions to protect it. The Arendtian rejection of understanding the human being as a living being in the singular, as well as her postulation of human plurality as the condition of all genuine politics, depend on her thesis that politics has to do with the formation of a common world in the course of people’s acting and exchanging opinions. Politics depends on the human faculty of opinion, our capacities to agree and disagree, so that what is mysteriously given to us by nature ceases to be politically decisive. For Arendt, equality is not a natural given, but a political construction oriented by the ‘principle of justice’. It is the result of agreement to grant one another equal rights, based on the assumption that equality can be forged by those who act and exchange opinions among themselves and thus change the world in which they live. 36) According to Arendt, there can be no politics worthy of the name unless everyone is included in the political and economic community of a definite state. Without being recognised and protected as a citizen, no human being can discover his/her own place in the world. Agamben’s thesis goes even further than Arendt’s. He finds that modern biopolitics is contained in the Declaration of the Rights of Man, inasmuch as these rights constitute the very inscription of naked life into the political-juridical order. According to Agamben, in the 1789 Declaration natural bare life is both the foundational source and the carrier of the rights of man, since a man’s bare life – or, more precisely, the very fact of being born in a certain territory – is the element that effects the transition from the ancien régime’s principle of divine sovereignty to modern sovereignty concentrated in the nation state: It is not possible to understand the ‘national’ and biopolitical development and vocation of the modern state in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries if one forgets that what lies at its basis is not man as a free and conscious political subject but, above all, man’s bare life, the simple birth that as such is, in the passage from subject to citizen, invested with the principle of sovereignty. 37) Conclusion To conclude this text, I would like to underline how much Arendt’s principal reflections on totalitarianism still remain relevant nowadays, especially when we remember the feeble character of actually existing democracies. Rephrased in terms of biopolitics, the core of Arendt’s diagnosis of the present is that whenever politics has mostly to do with the maintenance and increase of the vital metabolism of affluent nation states, animal laborans is necessarily degraded still further: to the status of homo sacer, bare and unprotected life that can be delivered to oblivion and death. Our ‘common sense’ understanding of politics as the administrative promotion of abundance and the happiness of the human being as animal laborans is in fact correlated with economic and political exclusion, racialised prejudice, violence and even genocide against the naked life of homo sacer. Arendt thus sheds light on our current dilemmas, providing us theoretical elements for a critical diagnosis of the present as well as for opening new possibilities for collective action in the world. Arendt was a master of chiaroscuro political thinking, never blind to always open possibilities of radically renovating the political, nor, by brutal contrast, to the intrinsic connection between political exclusion and violence under a biopolitical paradigm. If we wish to remain with Arendt and the hope of a politics of freedom and equality, then we must reflect on and pursue new spaces and forms of political association, action and discussion, wherever and whenever they may subvert the tedious multiplication of the same in our administered, covertly and overtly violent present. Arendt proposed no political utopias, but she remained convinced that our political dilemmas have no necessary outcome, that history has not and will not come to a tragic end. Neither a pessimist nor an optimist, she wanted only to understand the world in which she lived in and to stimulate our thinking and acting in the present. It is always possible that radically new political constellations will come into our world, and responsibility for them will always be ours. If we wish to remain faithful to the spirit of Arendt’s political thinking, then we must think and act politically without constraining our thinking and acting in terms of some pre-defined understanding of what politics ‘is’ or ‘should’ be. In other words, I believe that the political challenge of the present is to multiply the forms, possibilities and spaces in which we can act politically. These may be strategic actions destined to further the agendas of political parties concerned with social justice. They can also be discrete, subversive actions favoured by small groups at the margins of the bureaucratised party machines, promoting political interventions free of particular strategic intentions, since their goal is to invite radical politicisation of existence. Finally, there are also actions in which ethical openness towards otherness becomes political: small and rather inconspicuous actions of acknowledging and welcoming, of extending hospitality and solidarity towards others.<br />

Acceptance of such a universal core criterion of basic justice does not preclude particular societies from subjecting their national institu­tions to a stronger criterion of justice that involves a more specific measure or human flourishing. Such a national measure might, for instance, ascribe to citizens additional basic needs. such as: to have certain legal (constitutional) rights, not to be too severely disadvant­aged through social inequalities, to be adequately compensated for genetic handicaps and bad luck, or to receive a subsidy for the dis­charge or important religious duties. But such additional basic needs would everywhere be understood as secondary to the universal human needs recognized by the globally shared conception of human rights. The preeminent requirement on all coercive institutional schemes is that they afford each human being secure access to minimally adequate shares of basic freedoms and participation, of food, drink, clothing, shelter, education, and health care. Achieving the formula­tion, global acceptance, and realization of this requirement is the preeminent moral task of our age.<br />

The most hopeful epitaph for Project Apollo might be: This was the last gasp of a technologically addicted, public-relations-minded society, the last escapade engineered by an industrial-military coalition seeking conquests in outer space, while avoiding swelling needs on earth. And what a gasp it was! Never before had so many taxpayers spent so many billions, and so many thousands of talented technologists and scientists labored so hard on a civilian project that yielded so little. Apollo's irrationality stands second only to one—our inclination to get involved in far-off wars, at even greater cost and distraction from our domestic problems. Both tendencies are part of our difficulty in turning toward self-reform as the ages of exploiting nature and dealing in other people's lands come to an inevitable end. Little wonder the moon was billed as our last potential colony. The astronauts set out to investigate the moon, but their journeys told us more about ourselves than about that arid pile of orbiting rocks. They told us that in the decade in which poverty, social injustice, pollution, mental illness, subquality housing, inadequate education and crime went untreated, we invested more new public resources and scarce research-and-development manpower, staggering amounts of our muscle and mind, in a combination of a technological superstunt and a geological excavation. Project Apollo reveals both the how and why of decisions which set the course of the nation. The commitment to put Americans on the moon was made by President John F. Kennedy during a few days in late April and mid-May of 1961 following brief staff reviews of the social, economic and international implications of the project. And a good part of the review available was opposed to the emphasis on expensive, probably unnecessary, manned flights. Among those questioning such a venture was a task force headed by Jerome B. Wiesner and the outgoing President's Scientific Advisory Committee. We do not reflect long before we jump, often disregarding our experts' advice. The underlying motives for the go-ahead included the public-relations notion that the prospect of a moon voyage would provide a new topic for a nation despondent over the failure of the Cuban invasion; that Apollo would demonstrate to the world that we could match recent Soviet technological feats (the Russians had just put Yuri Gagarin in space); and that the giant project would help revitalize a recessed economy. Arguments in favor of other domestic projects were pushed aside, then and since on the ground that they would not &quot;sell&quot; as well as lunar flights. Mundane, un-photogenic, dispersed activities, such as the collection of garbage in thousands of streets, arrests of muggers on myriad corners, and the reading and writing habits of kids all over America, it was said, do not compare to the Apollo spectaculars on TV. Once the space coalition was formed, every value dear to man was emblazoned on its banners. Only now we begin to see how absurd most of that razzle-dazzle was. Generals argued that the moon was essential to national security as a &quot;high ground,&quot; for observation and fire purposes, disregarding those who pointed out that our reconnaissance satellites would soon be able to gather more detailed information about &quot;the enemy&quot; than we know what to do with, and that it would be rather silly for the Russians to shoot missiles at us from the moon, when they could fire them from much nearer bases. The promise of economic &quot;spin-offs&quot; from the lunar gear into other areas was touted by NASA, and indeed there were some. If you burn 27-odd billion dollars, you generate some heat, but pitiful little it was. It turned out that most outer space products, fuels and alioids, geared to extreme temperatures, vacuums, acceleration and weightlessness, have no use in our earthly schools, hospitals and bedrooms. Finally, we were informed Apollo would provide a peaceful outlet for the world's superpower contest, unite the nation, and enrich the human spirit. But at the cost of keeping one of NASA's missiles from catching a cold, Nixon achieved more for peace through his Ping-Pong diplomacy with Mainland China and in SALT talks, than a decade of space jumps. The nation surely was divided more over these years than in the proceeding decade, among other things <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://c.er/" rel="nofollow">over</a></span> the objectives of the space race, which polls show about half of America never came to accept. The notion that this spectator sport, which reaches the people of the world seated before their TV sets, would humanize them, is so simplistic it rebuts itself. The space coalition is still drawing more per year for its space antics than many domestic missions (most recently, it got us commuted to buying Skylabs). The space budget should be cut bellow the half-billion mark, focused on near space and economical, non-manned efforts (weather control, communication satellites). Every school child, citizen and inchoate politician should be required to study what Apollo taught us. Then we can cease chasing moons in the quest for a new America.<br />

 <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The aff’s portrayal of China as a knowable object and a threat to the United States legitimates otherizing power politics which transforms our conceptions of China into a social reality</span></strong><br />
Pan, 2004 [Lecturer in International Relations, School of International and Political Studies at Deakin University (Chengxin, “The &quot;China Threat&quot; in American Self-Imagination”, Alternatives 29 (2004), 305-331, Galileo) Chetan<br />
<br />
China and its relationship with the United States has long been a fascinating subject of study in the mainstream U. S. international relations community. This is reflected, for example, in the current heated debates over whether China is primarily a strategic threat to or a market bonanza for the United States and whether containment or engagement is the best way to deal with it. * While U. S. China scholars argue fiercely over &quot;what China precisely is,&quot; their debates have been underpinned by some common ground, especially in terms of a positivist epistemology. Firstly, they believe that China is ultimately a knowable object, whose reality can be, and ought to be, empirically revealed by scientific means. For example, after expressing his dissatisfaction with often conflicting Western perceptions of China, David M. Lampton, former president of the National Committee on U. S. -China Relations, suggests that &quot;it is time to step back and look at where China is today, where it might be going, and what consequences that direction will hold for the rest of the world. &quot;2 Like many other China scholars, Lampton views his object of study as essentially &quot;something we can stand back from and observe with clinical detachment. &quot;^ Secondly, associated with the first assumption, it is commonly believed that China scholars merely serve as &quot;disinterested observers&quot; and that their studies of China are neutral, passive descriptions of reality. And thirdly, in pondering whether China poses a threat or offers an opportunity to the United States, they rarely raise the question of &quot;what the United States is. &quot; That is, the meaning of the United States is believed to be certain and beyond doubt. I do not dismiss altogether the conventional ways of debating China. It is not the purpose of this article to venture my own &quot;observation&quot; of &quot;where China is today,&quot; nor to join the &quot;containment&quot; versus &quot;engagement&quot; debate per se. Rather, I want to contribute to a novel dimension of the China debate by questioning the seemingly unproblematic assumptions shared by most China scholars in the mainstream IR community in the United States. To perform this task, I will focus attention on a particularly significant component of the China debate; namely, the &quot;China threat&quot; literature. More specifically, I want to argue that U. S. conceptions of China as a threatening other are always intrinsically linked to how U. S. policymakers/mainstream China specialists see themselves (as representatives of the indispensable, security-conscious nation, for example). As such, they are not value-free, objective descriptions of an independent, preexisting Chinese reality out there, but are better understood as a kind of normative, meaning-giving practice that often legitimates power politics in U. S. -China relations and helps transform the &quot;China threat&quot; into social reality. In other words, it is self-fulfilling in practice, and is always part of the &quot;China threat&quot; problem it purports merely to describe. In doing so, I seek to bring to the fore two interconnected themes of self/other constructions and of theory as practice inherent in the &quot;China threat&quot; literature—themes that have been overridden and rendered largely invisible by those common positivist assumptions. These themes are of course nothing new nor peculiar to the &quot;China threat&quot; literature. They have been identified elsewhere by critics of some conventional fields of study such as ethnography, anthropology, oriental studies, political science, and international relations. * Yet, so far, the China field in the West in general and the U. S. &quot;China threat&quot; literature in particular have shown remarkable resistance to systematic critical refiection on both their normative status as discursive practice and their enormous practical implications for international politics. ^ It is in this context that this article seeks to make a contribution.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Representations form the foundation of our relationship with China – the symbols and images advanced by the 1ac are more influential than official, state to state interactions</span></strong><br />
<strong>Liss, 2003</strong> MA Student in Asian Studies at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University (Alexander, “Images of China in the American Print Media: a survey from 2000 to 2002”, Journal of Contemporary China, May2003, Vol. 12 Issue 35, p299, 20p)<br />
<br />
The relationship between the United States and China works on many levels and involves many actors. The phrase ‘Sino–US relations’ usually brings to mind an image of interaction between the governments of each country. Yet, if we merely examine the diplomacy between the two countries, then we are left with an incomplete picture of the forces that affect how the nations engage each other. A key element to consider is the relationship between the two societies. Popular opinion and popular perceptions of each culture in the eyes of the other are far more subtle elements to consider, yet they are no less important than the official acts of government, and indeed, may even be more so. Analyzing these cultural perceptions is a complex task. Neither the culture that is perceived nor the one that does the observing is a static, unchanging entity. Looking at American perceptions of China is a difficult task that requires considerable leeway in our definitions of ‘America’ as well as of ‘China’. Therefore, we must look through a broad medium, such as newspapers, if we are to observe how China is portrayed to the average American. Newspapers reach tens of millions of Americans every day. They are widely considered a trusted and credible source of information concerning topics that may be touched upon only briefly on television or radio. Some of the biggest ones in the US have national distribution, and a wide and deep impact on the minds of their readers that cannot be underestimated. It only stands to reason that the way in which these major newspapers portray a certain topic, or a certain country (like China), can have a profound effect on the forces that shape interaction between two societies and the international relations between two countries.<br />

Super committee compromise now<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">When the compromise on extending the debt limit was struck and enacted into Public Law 112-25 in early August, both President Barack Obama and the Republican congressional leadership stated that the law's painful fallback budget cuts would probably not be triggered. They asserted that their very existence would motivate lawmakers (through the newly established congressional joint committee, better known as the super committee) to compromise on a thoughtful, policy-oriented deficit- and debt-reducing alternative to meet the law's required second round of cuts. The theory was that the $1.2 trillion in automatic cuts to popular programs such as the military and Medicare outlined in the law's fallback “sequester” provision would be so damaging that all sides would produce a budget compromise to avoid the need for such cuts. Now, reflecting on the implications of likely alternatives, many health care stakeholders are concluding that the automatic cuts would be the lesser of the possible evils. How can that be?</span><br />

Launch costs are insane – it costs $10,000 to put a pound of anything in space<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">But after 1969, the Soviets dropped out of the race to the moon and, like a cancer, the land war in Asia began to devour the budget. The wind gradually came out of the sails of the space program; the Nielsen ratings for each moon landing began to fall. The last manned mission to the moon was Apollo 17, in 1972. As Isaac Asimov once commented, we scored a touchdown, then took our football and went home. After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head. And to put a pound of anything on the moon costs about 10 times as much. (To reach Mars, imagine your body made of diamonds.) We are 50 years into the space age, and yet space travel is just as expensive as it always was. We can debate endlessly over what went wrong; there is probably no one correct answer. But a few observations can be made. The space shuttle, the workhorse of the space program, proved to be somewhat of a disappointment, with large cost overruns and long delays. It was bloated and probably did not need to have seven astronauts on board. (The Soviet copy of the space shuttle, a near-clone called the Buran, actually flew into outer space fully automated, without any astronauts whatsoever.) An alternative to the space shuttle was the original space plane of the Eisenhower era. It was to be small and compact, but provide easy access to space on a moment's notice, instead of the long months to prepare each shuttle launch. It was to take off and land like a plane, but soar into outer space like a rocket. President Ronald Reagan called one version of it the &quot;Orient Express.&quot; (Ironically, now there will be a hiatus as the space shuttle is mothballed next year. Instead of fast and cheap access to space, for five years we will have no access to space at all. We'll have to beg the Europeans and Russians to piggy-back off their rockets.) One of the primary missions of NASA should have been to drive down the cost of space travel. Instead of spending half a billion dollars on each shuttle mission, it should have diverted some of the funds to make research and development a primary focus. New materials, new fuels and innovative concepts, which would make space exploration less expensive, should have been prioritized. (Today, some of that entrepreneurial spirit still lives in the commercial sector, as it tries to nourish a fledgling space tourism industry.) The space station costs upward of $100 billion, yet its critics call it a &quot;station to nowhere.&quot; It has no clearly defined scientific purpose. Once, President George H.W. Bush's science adviser was asked about the benefits of doing experiments in weightlessness and microgravity. His response was, &quot;Microgravity is of microimportance.&quot; Its supporters have justified the space station as a terminal for the space shuttle. But the space shuttle has been justified as a vehicle to reach the space station, which is a completely circular and illogical argument. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">WASHINGTON – U.S. President Barack Obama's call for $447 billion in tax cuts and new spending to revive the flagging economy puts extra pressure on a recently constituted congressional committee just as it starts work on reducing the nation's deficit, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. As lawmakers headed out from the president's joint address to Congress, in which he called for expanding a payroll tax cut and spending on transportation projects, they described a new weight on their shoulders. &quot;It obviously makes our work more difficult,&quot; said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, a member of the deficit-reduction panel. &quot;He has just added to the debt tonight with additional ideas.&quot; Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., a member of the supercommittee, told reporters that &quot;it adds to our challenge.&quot; Obama also layered on a potential new challenge when he said that on Sept. 19, he would release a &quot;more ambitious&quot; plan that would cover the cost of his jobs plan and also &quot;stabilize our debt in the long term.&quot; Coming less than two months after Obama tried to reach a deal with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years, Obama appeared to be suggesting that he was still pushing for a &quot;grand bargain&quot; that goes beyond the $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions mandated by the new debt law. In particular, Obama called for changing entitlement programs such as Medicare, whose program covering hospital stays will be exhausted in 2024, according to the latest projections from the program's trustees. </span><br />

Sequestration kills hegemony and the economy through the aerospace industry<br />
DONNA CASSATA, 08/14/11, “Super Committee Members See 'Doomsday' Defense Cuts Loom Large”, Political Editor for Associated Press, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4194:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/14/super-committee-members-defense-cuts_n_926425.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/14/super-committee-members-defense-cuts_n_926425.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/14/super-committee-members-defense-cuts_n_926425.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4194 -->, [Ofir]<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">WASHINGTON — For the dozen lawmakers tasked with producing a deficit-cutting plan, the threatened &quot;doomsday&quot; defense cuts hit close to home. The six Republicans and six Democrats represent states where the biggest military contractors – Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics Corp., Raytheon Co. and Boeing Co. – build missiles, aircraft, jet fighters and tanks while employing tens of thousands of workers. The potential for $500 billion more in defense cuts could force the Pentagon to cancel or scale back multibillion-dollar weapons programs. That could translate into significant layoffs in a fragile economy, generate millions less in tax revenues for local governments and upend lucrative company contracts with foreign nations. The cuts could hammer Everett, Wash., where some of the 30,000 Boeing employees are working on giant airborne refueling tankers for the Air Force, or Amarillo, Texas, where 1,100 Bell Helicopter Textron workers assemble the fuselage, wings, engines and transmissions for the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft. Billions in defense cuts would be a blow to the hundreds working on upgrades to the Abrams tank for General Dynamics in Lima, Ohio, or the employees of BAE Systems in Pennsylvania. For committee members such as Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., the threat of Pentagon cuts is an incentive to come up with $1.5 trillion in savings over a decade. Failure would have brutal implications for hundreds of thousands workers back home and raise the potential of </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">political peril for the committee's 12. &quot;I think we all have very good reasons to try to prevent&quot; the automatic cuts, Toomey told reporters last week when pressed about the impact on Pennsylvania's defense industry. &quot;That is not the optimal outcome here, the much better outcome would be a successful product from this committee.&quot; The panel has until Thanksgiving to come up with recommendations. If they deadlock or if Congress rejects their proposal, $1.2 trillion in automatic, across-the-board cuts kick in. Up to $500 billion would hit the Pentagon. Those cuts, starting in 2013, would be in addition to the $350 billion, 10-year reduction already dictated by the debt-limit bill approved by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama this month. Not surprisingly, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has described the automatic cuts as the &quot;doomsday mechanism.&quot; He's warned that the prospect of nearly $1 trillion in reductions over a decade would seriously undermine the military's ability to protect the United States. For the Pentagon, &quot;we're talking about cuts of such magnitude that everything is reduced to some degree,&quot; said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute, a think tank. &quot;At that rate, you're eliminating the next generation of weapons.&quot; Committee members will face competing pressures as they try to produce a deficit-reducing plan. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a possible successor to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton if Obama wins a second term, Sen. John Kerry is certain to be protective of the budget for the State Department. Yet the Massachusetts Democrat, who recently said he would seek a sixth term in 2014, represents a state that was fifth in the nation with $8.37 billion in defense contracts this year, behind Virginia, California, Texas and Connecticut, according to data on the federal government's website USAspending.gov. In Tewksbury and Andover, Mass., deep defense cuts could have serious ramifications for thousands of Raytheon employees working on the Patriot, the air and missile defense system. It was heralded for its effectiveness during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and is now sold to close to a dozen nations, including South Korea, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates. Whatever decisions Kerry and the committee make will affect Massachusetts-based Raytheon, which was fourth in defense contracts this year at $7.3 billion, behind Lockheed Martin, Boeing and General Dynamics. Raytheon also has operations in Arizona, home to another committee member, Republican Sen. Jon Kyl. &quot;While some will argue there is peril in serving on this committee, we believe there is far greater peril in leaving these issues unaddressed,&quot; Kerry said in a joint statement with Murray and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., after they were selected by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. In February, Murray celebrated when the Air Force ended a decade-long saga of delays and missteps and awarded one of the biggest defense contracts ever, a $35 billion deal to build nearly 200 air refueling tankers, to Boeing, a mainstay in her home state. Boeing was fourth on the list of donors to Murray from 2007-2012, with its political action committee, individual employees and family members contributing $102,610. Michigan is home to two committee members, Republican Reps. Dave Camp and Fred Upton, and General Dynamics work on the Abrams tank. The state is struggling with a 10.5 percent unemployment rate, which is above the national average. Already facing the prospect of $350 billion in defense cuts over 10 years, the Pentagon could look to scale back some projects, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the stealthy aircraft that has been plagued by cost overruns and delays. Lockheed Martin, in conjunction with Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems, is building 2,400 of the next generation fighter jet for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, as well as working with eight foreign countries. But the cost of the program has jumped from $233 billion to $385 billion; some estimates suggest that it could top out at $1 trillion over 50 years. Questioned about the defense cuts, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen recently said that &quot;programs that can't meet schedule, that can't meet cost ... requirements are very much in jeopardy and will be very much under scrutiny.&quot; The Joint Strike Fighter is being built in Fort Worth, Texas, and Palmdale and El Segundo, Calif. Those are the states of committee members Reps. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, and Xavier Becerra, D-Calif. Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems also have operations in Pennsylvania. The Pentagon could decide to scrap the program or scale it back while upgrading the existing F-15 and F-18 aircraft, a troubling prospect for lawmakers from the states that benefit from F-35 production. In the military world, however, reducing the number could make it more costly. &quot;The problem when you cut back in numbers is you increase the number for one, you increase the cost for one,&quot; said Laicie Olson, a senior policy analyst with Council for a Livable World and the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. &quot;Sometimes it's almost better to buy more.&quot; Boeing, in a statement, said it has been &quot;anticipating flattening defense budgets for some time.&quot; Company spokesman Daniel C. Beck said that while Boeing is trying to improve production and efficiency, it's moving into new markets such as cybersecurity and energy management. </span><br />

<strong>Cuts will happen -- the super committee proves</strong><br />
<strong>Jennings 11</strong> – Christopher C. Jennings, September 15, 2011, “Fallback Cuts or Super-Committee Concoction — Choosing Health Care's Policy Poison”, Deputy Assistant to the President for Health Policy Development in the White House Domestic Policy Council , <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4195:http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1109865 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1109865" rel="nofollow">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1109865</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4195 -->, [Ofir]<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">When the compromise on extending the debt limit was struck and enacted into Public Law 112-25 in early August, both President Barack Obama and the Republican congressional leadership stated that the law's painful fallback budget cuts would probably not be triggered. They asserted that their very existence would motivate lawmakers (through the newly established congressional joint committee, better known as the super committee) to compromise on a thoughtful, policy-oriented deficit- and debt-reducing alternative to meet the law's required second round of cuts. The theory was that the $1.2 trillion in automatic cuts to popular programs such as the military and Medicare outlined in the law's fallback “sequester” provision would be so damaging that all sides would produce a budget compromise to avoid the need for such cuts. Now, reflecting on the implications of likely alternatives, many health care stakeholders are concluding that the automatic cuts would be the lesser of the possible evils. How can that be?</span><br />

<strong>Launch costs are insane – it costs $10,000 to put a pound of anything in space</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">But after 1969, the Soviets dropped out of the race to the moon and, like a cancer, the land war in Asia began to devour the budget. The wind gradually came out of the sails of the space program; the Nielsen ratings for each moon landing began to fall. The last manned mission to the moon was Apollo 17, in 1972. As Isaac Asimov once commented, we scored a touchdown, then took our football and went home. After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head. And to put a pound of anything on the moon costs about 10 times as much. (To reach Mars, imagine your body made of diamonds.) We are 50 years into the space age, and yet space travel is just as expensive as it always was. We can debate endlessly over what went wrong; there is probably no one correct answer. But a few observations can be made. The space shuttle, the workhorse of the space program, proved to be somewhat of a disappointment, with large cost overruns and long delays. It was bloated and probably did not need to have seven astronauts on board. (The Soviet copy of the space shuttle, a near-clone called the Buran, actually flew into outer space fully automated, without any astronauts whatsoever.) An alternative to the space shuttle was the original space plane of the Eisenhower era. It was to be small and compact, but provide easy access to space on a moment's notice, instead of the long months to prepare each shuttle launch. It was to take off and land like a plane, but soar into outer space like a rocket. President Ronald Reagan called one version of it the &quot;Orient Express.&quot; (Ironically, now there will be a hiatus as the space shuttle is mothballed next year. Instead of fast and cheap access to space, for five years we will have no access to space at all. We'll have to beg the Europeans and Russians to piggy-back off their rockets.) One of the primary missions of NASA should have been to drive down the cost of space travel. Instead of spending half a billion dollars on each shuttle mission, it should have diverted some of the funds to make research and development a primary focus. New materials, new fuels and innovative concepts, which would make space exploration less expensive, should have been prioritized. (Today, some of that entrepreneurial spirit still lives in the commercial sector, as it tries to nourish a fledgling space tourism industry.) The space station costs upward of $100 billion, yet its critics call it a &quot;station to nowhere.&quot; It has no clearly defined scientific purpose. Once, President George H.W. Bush's science adviser was asked about the benefits of doing experiments in weightlessness and microgravity. His response was, &quot;Microgravity is of microimportance.&quot; Its supporters have justified the space station as a terminal for the space shuttle. But the space shuttle has been justified as a vehicle to reach the space station, which is a completely circular and illogical argument. </span><br />

<strong>That leads to economic collapse – inflation and investor confidence</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">While it is obvious that this market uncertainty is almost exclusively related to the national debt, the Treasury Department chalked it up to a flawed analysis and a 2 trillion dollar error. It appears that the new debt deal has scared investors and convinced the S&amp;P that we cannot pay our bills. They're quite right. In an ideal world, this crisis might provide our elected officials enough evidence to realize that current policy is not working, but these are the same people who voted for TARP, the bank bailouts, the auto bailouts, and the stimulus bill. It should be no surprise that they assumed the debt deal would solve all of our problems. This is the kind of incompetence that Washington has seen from both parties for many years, and anyone who claims that the two parties are different should take a look at public policy for the last decade. The fix to this problem is no secret. Economists from the Austrian school and supporters of the free market know exactly what needs to be done, but no one is listening to them. Congress needs to make real cuts to spending, and not just cuts to proposed increases. Those are not real cuts, and yet we keep getting told that this deal will help reduce the debt. We may have avoided a default, but we are well on our way to an even bigger problem; a collapse of the dollar. Ben Bernanke and the rest of those at the Fed believe that keeping interest rates low is the best medicine for this ailing economy, but it is actually the poison making us grow weaker and weaker. When interest rates are below natural market value people make decisions that they wouldn't make normally, and when the crash comes it'll be too late. Printing money out of thin air will also do nothing but devalue the dollar and place an unseen tax on the American people who don't have the advantage of being bailed out by the federal government. If the dollar crashes, hyper inflation will set in and money will no longer even be worth the paper it is printed on. Assuming the United States wishes to avoid what happened to Germany in 1923, elected officials will have to look long and hard at fiscal policy and the role of the Federal Reserve when it comes to monetary policy. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Frequently, the crisis has weakened the power of the merchants, industrialists, financiers, and professionals who want to develop a liberal capitalist society integrated into the world. Crisis can also strengthen the hand of religious extremists, populist radicals, or authoritarian traditionalists who are determined to resist liberal capitalist society for a variety of reasons. Meanwhile, the companies and banks based in these societies are often less established and more vulnerable to the consequences of a financial crisis than more established firms in wealthier societies. As a result, developing countries and countries where capitalism has relatively recent and shallow roots tend to suffer greater economic and political damage when crisis strikes--as, inevitably, it does. And, consequently, financial crises often reinforce rather than challenge the global distribution of power and wealth. This may be happening yet again. None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. Bad economic times can breed wars. Europe was a pretty peaceful place in 1928, but the Depression poisoned German public opinion and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. If the current crisis turns into a depression, what rough beasts might start slouching toward Moscow, Karachi, Beijing, or New Delhi to be born? The United States may not, yet, decline, but, if we can't get the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Another indication that President Barack Obama's 2012 NASA funding request was in trouble occurred when at a hearing of the House Appropriations commerce, justice, science subcommittee on May 3. White House science czar John Holdren came under some sharp questioning by Rep. Frank Wolf chairman of the subcommittee. The questioning revolved around the belief by Wolf that the administration is short changing the development of a heavy lift launcher and the Orion spacecraft that congress views as vital for the long term human exploration of space. The priorities of the administration include subsidies to commercial space firms, Earth science, and technology development. Wolf also questioned why NASA has not gotten a request for an increase of funding, even though some other science oriented agencies have gotten such requests. According to the account of the hearings on Space News, Wolf did not find Holdren's answers to be satisfactory. That suggests that there will be a renewed clash between the congress and the White House on space policy. The clash is not limited to funding and of space policy priorities. Space News also reports that the following day, on May 4, Holdren told members of the subcommittee that cooperation with China is seen as critical for prospects for long term space exploration, such as to Mars. This, mildly speaking, was not welcome news to members of the subcommittee. The problem is that China is currently ruled by a tyrannical regime that violates the human rights of its own people and is engaged in an imperial drive toward super power status at the expense of the United States. Congress has, in fact, passed a law prohibiting most forms of space and science cooperation with the People's Republic of China. The distrust Congress holds toward the administration where it comes to space policy is palatable. Members of Congress have expressed the view that NASA is slow walking the heavy lift launcher. Many are also pretty sure that the White House is trying to circumnavigate the law and is trying to find ways to cooperate with China despite the law. All of this points to the very real possibility that congress will use the power of the purse to restrict White House space policy options and to impose its own will on the future direction of NASA and space exploration. That this clash is happening at all is a direct result of a series of political blunders made by the administration dating back to the cancellation of the Constellation space exploration program and a lack of leadership on the part of the president. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The names are all out there: These 12 members of Congress, six Democrats and six Republicans, are now in charge of saving America from fiscal ruin. Created under the recently passed debt-limit deal, this so-called &quot;super committee&quot; will look for at least $1.5 trillion in deficit-reduction measures over 10 years. They'll have until November 23 to draft a proposal, which will see an up-or down vote in Congress within a month after that. If the committee deadlocks -- if the Republicans and Democrats split on party lines, and no proposal is ever actually proposed -- then $1.2 trillion in automatic, across-the-board cuts will be triggered. It's a solution no one will really like, but the tough politics of spending cuts and possible tax increases could make that outcome more likely than not. Following the partisan majorities in Congress, the committee will be co-chaired by the top Senate Democrat, Patty Murray (Wash.), and the top House Republican, Jeb Hensarling (Texas). </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you were in charge of the space program, what would you do? How would you do it? What ideas make you perk up and say, “that is what would make the world go wow!” There is clear and substantial evidence that in our current economic situation, NASA is about priority number 21,839 on the list of things to do in congress. Yes, there are hearings and opinion pieces written about what they would do if they could help NASA. But what can NASA do? What can you do? Perception, sadly, is reality. Carefully analyzed, any objective observer can see that something is incredibly wrong with NASA. At this moment, it really does not matter what things are going so wrong for NASA, but why? What: NASA lost billions developing two new rockets. Why: &lt;insert your answer here&gt; Ole Glory Answer 1: NASA was not given enough money to complete Constellation. Really, 11.1 billion is not enough to build a vehicle and rocket for human space flight (HSF)? Answer 2: Government bureaucracy and mission creep killed the rocket. Additional levels of oversight, documentation, and requirements ultimately sank CxP. The answer lies somewhere between number one and number two, with one caveat. If we critically look at NASA and the chain of command along with the lines of communication, it is easy to see nothing gets done quickly.Compare and contrast NASA to any private sector space company. You will find that NASA simply is archaic. There is no flexibility. There is no ability to adapt. There are many GS-14s trying to ensure their existence inside NASA is vital. This costs you and I, the taxpayer, money. NASA rockets are designed in Huntsville Alabama. NASA software is designed and tested in Houston. NASA hardware is designed in Huntsville Alabama but may be built in Michoud Lousiana or Houston or Colorado (it depends). In short, you always need to go somewhere else to get something done. That wastes time and money. Moreover, operating centers has additional sunk costs. In a recent congressional hearing the honorable Marcia L.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The U.S.’s new double A+ rating “could go down more in a time frame of six months to 24 months,” to double-A, depending on government action to cut the deficit, John Chambers, managing director and chairman of Standard &amp; Poor’s sovereign ratings committee tells FOX Business senior vice president and anchor Neil Cavuto in an interview on FOX News Saturday. That means the U.S. government effectively has until at least February to find additional cuts to meet S&amp;P's demand for at least $4 trillion in total deficit reductions over the next decade. The debt ceiling deal cuts $917 billion over the next decade and at least $1.5 trillion from a new bipartisan super committee in Congress by November. For the first time in history, Standard &amp; Poor’s downgraded the U.S.’s vaunted Triple-A rating to double A+ after the market’s close on Friday night, a rating it has held at S&amp;P since 1941. The rating was dropped to double-A+, S&amp;P says, because of its deepening concern that Washington, D.C. cannot get a grip on the nation's finances in the mid – to long-term, as well as fears that the economy could weaken, and that interest rates could spike higher, causing interest costs on the debt to rise. S&amp;P also cited a weakening federal revenue picture as part of its reasons behind its downgrade. The threat of another drop by at minimum February 2012 throws a wrench into any possible plans by the Administration to revive job growth via more federal stimulus spending, as a re-election year approaches and the economy has hit stall speed at average annual GDP growth trending at 2% for 2011. The U.S. jobless rate dropped to 9.1% from 9.2%, new data released on Friday show. An estimated 193,000 workers dropped out of the workforce, driving the rate lower. The White House has been mulling a plan for an infrastructure bank, which would create jobs to rebuild the nation’s highways and bridges, among other ideas. Chambers declined comment on reports that the Administration had pressured S&amp;P to not execute a downgrade. “The Administration has always conducted itself with the utmost professionalism,” Chambers told Cavuto in the interview. When asked about Congressional reaction, Chambers said: “The only pushback we got were negative emails from people I don't know.” S&amp;P in recent weeks put the U.S. on a fast-track for a downgrade, upping the odds to 50-50 from a one in three chance it had reiterated last spring. Chambers cited &quot;acrimonious&quot; D.C. debt fights that were worse than the company had expected as “detrimental” to the rating in a conference call with clients last week. And although downgrades usually come from external shocks to an economy, the U.S.'s downgrade is &quot;a self-inflicted&quot; problem, S&amp;P’s Chambers has said. When asked why it downgraded, S&amp;P’s Chambers told Cavuto in an interview on FOX News Saturday morning that “political gridlock in Washington, D.C. makes us think it would be difficult for elected officials to put the deficit on a sustainable path.” Chambers also confirmed a controversial decision by S&amp;P to include “debt at the state and local level,” which he says, along with federal debt, has been “on an upward path.” Including state and local debt in its decision to downgrade is controversial, because state and local officials have the authority to cut spending or raise taxes on their own to restore fiscal health. And Chambers confirmed that $4 trillion in cuts over ten years was a sticking point. The U.S. Congress recently agreed to $917 billion in deficit reductions. S&amp;P's new double-A threat puts pressure on the new 12-member bipartisan committee to slash the 10-year deficit by another $1.5 trillion come November. If they fail, if Congress rejects or the President vetoes, spending would be cut an automatic $1.2 trillion, including 2% reductions to Medicare providers. But those planned reductions would not be enough for S&amp;P. It wants at least $1.6 trillion more in cuts, beyond what the bipartisan commission has been ordered to come up according to the new deal. The downgrade caught Wall Street by surprise, and rattled investors after a week that saw the Dow Jones Industrial average post its biggest loss in two years. The Dow dropped 512.76, erasing the year's gains. It is now in correction mode. The move also stunned top government and Wall Street executives. Top-level officials at the U.S. Treasury Dept., the New York Federal Reserve and at primary dealers on Wall Street, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Pimco, &quot;did not believe a downgrade was imminent,&quot; according to minutes of a routine meeting on August 3d. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">What are the consequences of further downgrades? The most direct one could be higher interest rates, as investors insist on a risk premium. Even a 0.1 percent increase in interest rates would mean an additional $130 billion in government spending on interest over the next 10 years that we would have to offset in hiring taxes or fewer investments to meet the same debt goal. A 0.7% increase in interest rates would be enough to erase all of the gains from the recent debt deal. In addition, higher interest rates could reverberate throughout the market, impacting everything from mortgages to small business loans - and ultimately leading to something economists call &quot;crowd out,&quot; where fewer dollars go into growth-driving investments. The biggest concern, though, should be that these rating downgrades could advance the day of a fiscal crisis. At some point, if we don't make some changes, investors will lose confidence in our nation's ability to make good on its debt. When that occurs, it is possible we could experience a global economic crisis akin to the financial crisis of 2009, except with no one available to bail out the U.S. government. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen and the euro Thursday on signs of strength at U.S. factories and in the broader economy. A stream of discouraging headlines about the European debt crisis pummeled the euro. Manufacturing grew in the Philadelphia region grew for the first time in three months, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said. The bank's index of regional manufacturing jumped to 8.7 this month from -17.5 in September. It was the best reading in six months and signaled that factories are recovering from a slow summer. A separate gauge of future economic activity crept upward, signaling modest growth in coming months. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators rose 0.2 percent, easing fears of another recession. A strong U.S. economy helps the dollar by boosting U.S. investments. Traders buy dollars to invest in stocks and corporate bonds. The dollar rose to 76.88 yen at 12:01 p.m. Eastern time from 76.78 late Wednesday. It had fallen overnight against the yen, euro and other currencies, but started to recover around 6 a.m. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This in turn poses the central challenge of the dollar for US economic policy. Fears of further falls in the exchange rate could lead to a flight from dollar assets (by Americans as well as foreigners). The consequent sharp depreciation of the dollar could force the Federal Reserve to raise policy rates to fight the incipient rise in inflationary pressures; the higher interest rates would of course also help attract the essential financing for our continuing large external deficits. The monetary authorities already face an acute policy dilemma, as the economy remains both sluggish and susceptible to inflationary pressure, but a sharp dollar fall (or even acute fears thereof) would make it much worse. This problem will be yet even more severe if the economy weakens further and financial fragility again intensifies, in which case the Federal Reserve's likely desire to ease further could be severely constrained by the risk of a dollar collapse.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke laid out a dire scenario on Friday of what could happen to the U.S. economy if the government cannot develop a plan to bring down the budget deficit in the years ahead, even as he said that the economic recovery appears to be gaining momentum. Bernanke began his testimony before the Senate Budget Committee just an hour after the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate fell to 9.4 percent in December - its lowest level since May 2009 - from the previous month's 9.8 percent. The surprising decrease was tempered by news from employers that showed weaker-than-expected job growth. Still, the sharp drop in unemployment revealed a growing confidence in the nation's economic outlook. &quot;We have seen increased evidence that a self-sustaining recovery in consumer and business spending may be taking hold,&quot; Bernanke said, according to prepared testimony. &quot;Overall, the pace of economic recovery seems likely to be moderately stronger in 2011 than it was in 2010.&quot; But Bernanke also offered his strongest warning yet over the nation's high deficit. If the United States does not set a fiscal course that is more sustainable, &quot;the economic and financial effects would be severe,&quot; he said. If federal debt were to rise at the pace assumed in a plausible scenario analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office - such as extending most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts as spending rises at a steady rate - &quot;diminishing confidence on the part of investors that deficits will be brought under control would likely lead to sharply rising interest rates on government debt and, potentially, to broader financial turmoil,&quot; Bernanke said. He added that the high borrowing rate would limit private investment and push up the nation's foreign debt, hurting U.S. incomes and standards of living. &quot;Prompt adoption&quot; of a plan to bring deficits down in future years could improve the economic outlook today, Bernanke argued, by helping keep interest rates low and increasing business confidence. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">President Obama won’t use the “stimulus” label to describe his nearly half-trillion-dollar jobs bill, but that refusal can’t hide the fact that he has no idea how economies recover from recessions. “Stimulus” is a tainted label because his $800 billion bill in 2009 was a failure. His economic team promised that passing that bill would keep unemployment from exceeding 8 percent. The bill passed, and unemployment climbed to more than 9 percent and has stayed there ever since. With election day only 14 months off, one can readily see Obama’s desperation for a job program. The administration insists things would have been worse without the stimulus bill, but no good theory supports that assertion. Here’s the key: “Stimulus” implies that something enters the economy from outside, like a defibrillator applying an electrical shock to the heart. But any money the government appears to inject into the economy was already in the economy and therefore was just moved around. If the government cuts taxes but keeps spending, no net addition of resources is made. Its borrowing and its new taxes have to come from somewhere. As George Mason University economist Russ Roberts says, government’s stimulus of an economy is equivalent to taking water from the deep end of a pool and pouring it into the shallow end. Did the first stimulus create or save 3.5 million jobs, as the administration claims? It depends on what you mean by “create,” &amp;#147save,” and “jobs.” It is certainly true that the federal government gave money to the states and localities, and some of that money was used to pay teachers, police officers, and firefighters. However, saying the money “saved” those jobs implies they really would have really vanished without federal money. In some cases, state and local politicians may have been engaging in fear-mongering. It’s happened before. But even if they weren’t, the claim assumes that if federal money hadn’t materialized, those politicians wouldn’t have found other things to cut in order to keep paying the teachers, police, and firefighters — the bloated administrative bureaucracies, for instance. We’ll never know because they were relieved of the necessity — the mother of invention — of making the “tough choices” they always say they are elected to make. What about other jobs? Two recent studies by Garett Jones and Daniel Rothschild of the Mercatus Center demonstrate that most of the jobs were filled by hiring people away from jobs they already held. “[Hiring] people from unemployment was more the exception than the rule in our interviews,” the authors write. Some will claim that that is fine because the vacated jobs were available to the unemployed. But that implies highly skilled people were sitting around waiting for those jobs, and that is not the case. Moreover, the companies that lost employees had to incur high search and training costs to refill the jobs. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> NASA has sent Congress a report stating that it cannot meet the requirements that it produce a heavy-lift rocket by the current 2016 deadline – or under the current allocated budget. In the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, NASA was directed to develop a heavy-lift rocket in preparation to flights to an asteroid and possibly Mars. NASA said it cannot produce this new rocket despite the fact that the agency would be using so-called “legacy” hardware – components that have been employed in the shuttle program for the past 30 years. NASA would also utilize modern versions of engines used on the massive Saturn V rocket. Now, approximately three months after the act was signed into law, NASA is telling Congress that they can’t build the vehicles that will succeed the shuttle. At least, NASA said, not in the time allotted or for the amount allocated to them. The agency expressed these inadequacies in a 22-page report that was submitted to Congress. In the report, NASA said it “recognizes it has a responsibility to be clear with the Congress and the American taxpayers about our true estimated costs and schedules for developing the SLS and MPCV, and we intend to do so.” “Currently, our SLS (Space Launch System) studies have shown that while cost is not a major discriminator among the design options studied, none of the design options studied thus far appeared to be affordable in our present fiscal condition.” Senators Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-Texas) who helped to draft and pass the NASA Authorization Act said that none of the rationale posted within the report provided justification for NASA not to meet its requirements. Congress has been hoping to shore up any potential failings of the emerging commercial space market by having NASA design, in parallel, a heavy-lift rocket. That way, if these firms don’t produce, the nation has a ‘backup’ in place. NASA has essentially admitted that it cannot accomplish the task set in front of it. Congress might decide to take funds from other areas of the space agency’s budget to fill in the projected shortfall. There have been some suggestions that these funds may come from those intended for Kennedy Space Center (KSC). KSC has already been sent reeling from massive layoffs which are set to continue until the end of the shuttle program. There is no established program set to follow the space shuttle program. Many have tried to compare the gap between shuttle and whatever is to follow to the gap between Apollo and shuttle. But this is a false analogy. At the end of Apollo the next program was established (the space shuttle was approved during the Apollo 16 mission). As the twilight of the shuttle era nears – there no longer is any established program. Under the Vision for Space Exploration, the succeeding program was called Constellation and consisted of a Apollo-like capsule, man-rated rocket the Ares-I (based off a single shuttle solid rocket booster) and a unmanned heavy-lift booster – the Ares-V. While Congress may have signed the directive to produce the new heavy-lift booster into law – they haven’t done as much to pay for it. NASA was supposed to receive $11 billion over the course of the next three years to build both the rocket as well as the Orion spacecraft. Congress is now working to find ways to cut federal spending and NASA could find itself receiving far less than promised. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It often starts like this. There's a series of natural disasters. Or 9-11. Or war. And Congress decides it needs to approve an additional spending bill to fund a critical area of the federal government in mid-year. Lawmakers fillet the federal budget into 12 sections, each one receiving an annual spending measure. But over the past 11 years, Congress has approved 16 extra spending bills, known as &quot;supplementals,&quot; totaling nearly $1 trillion. $20 billion just after September 11th. $79 billion in 2003 for the war in Iraq. $10.5 billion in 2005 to respond to Hurricane Katrina. And in each case, some lawmakers make a compelling case for tacking on additional spending. It's essential for the troops. The people of New Orleans are desperate. And on Tuesday afternoon, the process started again. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL) chairs the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. That panel controls the purse strings for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Twisters ravaged parts of Aderholt's district and other sections of Alabama just a few weeks ago. Then came floods, up and down the Mississippi River. The federal government even blew up a major levee in Missouri to alleviate upstream flooding. And then a monster tornado sacked Joplin, MO, Sunday night. &quot;It's going to be close,&quot; said Aderholt, when asked if FEMA had enough money to make it through September 30, the end of the government's fiscal year. On Tuesday, the House Appropriations Committee &quot;marked-up&quot; or wrote the final version of a measure to fund Homeland Security programs and FEMA. No one has tallied the cost of the storms in Alabama. There's no price tag on the flooding. And it's way too early to ring up the damages in Missouri. But Aderholt and others wanted to make sure FEMA had enough money for now. So during the markup session, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle injected $1 billion into FEMA's budget. Aderholt and others believe that on top of the $1 billion, they'll also have to craft an entirely separate supplemental spending bill to pay for the natural disasters. And perhaps those yet to come. &quot;Hurricane season is just days away,&quot; warned Aderholt ominously. Not a single lawmaker expressed reservation and the Appropriations Committee adopted Aderholt's request by voice vote. There's a reason why no one objected. This year, it's flooding and tornadoes in the South and Midwest. But come summertime, it could be hurricanes in Florida and North Carolina. Or earthquakes in California. Wildfires in the west. Fiscal hawks are loathe to vote against such emergency measures. First, they want to help those in need. And second, they know their district or state could be next. Now here's where it gets interesting. In tight budget times, lawmakers are intent to find &quot;pay-fors&quot; to cover the additional costs of the natural disasters. In the case of the $1 billion for FEMA, the Appropriations Committee transferred unused funds from an Energy Department &quot;green vehicle&quot; program. Still, this money is not for NEXT fiscal year. It's for THIS fiscal year. The fiscal year for which Congress and President Obama just finished doing battle. The fiscal year where Republicans successfully pared $61 billion out of the budget. An alternative interpretation, but inaccurate interpretation of Tuesday's $1 billion FEMA infusion means the budget deal dwindled to just $60 billion. That's they way it would appear on a balance sheet if you're scoring at home. But if you're scoring in Congress, it doesn't work that way. Congress considers FEMA's $1 billion as an emergency. By definition, all emergency money is &quot;off-budget.&quot; It's real dollars and cents going out the door. But Congress doesn't count it against the bottom line. It's kind of like a pitcher's Earned Run Average (ERA) in baseball. If a pitcher yields a run, it counts on the scoreboard. However, if someone committed an error that allowed that run to score, it's not marked against the pitcher's ERA. Regardless, the run crossed the plate and shows up on the scoreboard. Spending is spending. And a budgetary gimmick like this is precisely what so incensed the electorate last fall. Now there's a question of forging a supplemental spending bill once all of the disasters are paid for. Aderholt has talked about the need for an additional spending bill to cover FEMA. And he's not the only one. &quot;$1 billion isn't going to do it,&quot; conceded Rep. David Price (D-NC), the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. &quot;We are going to need the administration to offer a supplemental request.&quot; House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) knows how sensitive this is. &quot;If there is support for a supplemental, it would be accompanied by support for having pay-fors to that supplemental,&quot; said Cantor on Monday. Note that Cantor said &quot;if there is support for a supplemental.&quot; Locating that support could be a problem. Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (R-MO) is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and represents the district right next to where the tornadoes hit Sunday. Emerson conceded it may be hard to court conservatives whose districts aren't experiencing a natural disaster. &quot;We can try and be responsible, but people need money,&quot; Emerson said. &quot;While I think it's important we do everything to offset (the additional FEMA spending), I don't think we can find all that money.&quot; When it's a challenge to cobble together votes for a supplemental spending bill, lawmakers often turn to a time-honored tradition on Capitol Hill. They begin to decorate the supplemental with all sorts of baubles and ornaments to attract the support of reluctant lawmakers. But times have changed in Washington. And most conservatives are unwilling to go that route. &quot;These bills become Christmas trees,&quot; said Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA). &quot;You end up having a bunch of items that having nothing to do with the bill.&quot; Rep. Jeff Landry (R-LA) is a freshman who represents Cajun country and the mouth of the Mississippi River. Some of the most serious flooding has washed over parts of Landry's southern Louisiana district. Landry knows what's essential to recover from the floods.</span><br />

Congressional Democrats say all the fuss about who will win the Republican presidential nomination is moot, claiming President Obama will defeat any of the GOP front-runners. The Hill asked two dozen House and Senate Democrats if they would prefer Rick Perry, Mitt Romney or Herman Cain to face Obama in the 2012 general election.

Polls and pundits are all saying the same thing: Mitt Romney is in pole position to win the Republican nomination. But below the surface there are deep problems with his candidacy that could spoil Republican hopes of taking back the White House. Wild swings of enthusiasm from Republican voters for any number of candidates from Rick Perry to Herman Cain are the result of a Republican electorate that has yet to find a candidate that matches its Tea Party tilt to the right. Yet pragmatists in the party – as well as elements of the establishment – are coalescing around Romney as the “inevitable candidate.”There are good reasons for this. Romney has won every debate and is much more controlled and presidential than everyone currently in the running except Newt Gingrich. Together with a tightly managed campaign and fundraising prowess, Romney seems like the perfect candidate. All of this has contributed to Romney’s remarkably consistent polling and the widely accepted belief that he is the best Republican to defeat President Obama in 2012. But selecting a nominee on the basis of who will win the general election can come at the expense of party enthusiasm – a dangerous bargain -- as Democrats learned with Senator John Kerry in 2004. During Howard Dean's campaign, we were able to establish Dean as the party’s most progressive candidate. His anti-war, anti-Bush messages resonated with many in the party who felt abandoned by a Democratic establishment in Washington that went along with the Bush administration on the Iraq War. There were a lot of reasons for Dean’s decline, but one big reason is because voters wanted the candidate that they felt was most likely to beat Bush. To them, that candidate was John Kerry. It was a curious choice. As an early supporter of the war, many in the party thought Kerry was wrong on the major issue of the election. In fact, a poll taken at the 2004 Democratic National Convention found that delegates and Kerry had vastly different positions on the Iraq War: “Eighty percent of [delegates] polled said they opposed the decision to go to war against Iraq at the time it began, and 95 percent say they now oppose the war. A majority of 63 percent want U.S. troops out within two years; only one in four say the United States should stay as long as it takes to achieve administration goals.” Today, Republicans face a similar situation with Romney. Poll after poll suggests that he’s the most likely GOP candidate to beat Obama in 2012, but the health care program he signed into law as governor of Massachusetts and his confusing stance on abortion are examples of issues that may force many Republican voters to question whether or not he really &quot;gets&quot; it. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found that 40% of Republicans said they would vote for him &quot;with some reservations.” Another poll by Public Policy Polling discovered that 69% of Romney’s supporters said they “might end up supporting someone else” in the primary. You don't need polling to understand this problem though -- it's an open discussion in GOP circles. &quot;His record in the past on health care and gay rights, obviously, are the opposite of where most Republicans are,&quot; said Peter King, the standard bearer of the conservative House Republicans. Suppose Romney captures the nomination, what effect could this problem have in the general election? Matt Kibbe, president of the Tea Party aligned FreedomWorks, went so far as to suggest that the right wing of the party might &quot;just stay home and throw up [their] hands and say: 'OK, I’ve been disenfranchised. I’m not interested in this election.'&quot; There is a precedent for this, too. In September 2004, despite four years of pent up frustration with the Bush administration, Democrats had a 23 percent “enthusiasm gap” going into the final stretch of the general election: “Nearly two in three likely voters who support President Bush -- 65 percent -- said they were &quot;very enthusiastic&quot; about their candidate while 42 percent of Sen. John F. Kerry's supporters express similarly high levels of enthusiasm for their choice.” This gap makes it clear that Kerry was the candidate Democrats thought they needed in 2004, but not the one they wanted. We can’t be sure how significant this distinction was, but there's no doubt it had a negative impact on Democrats’ chances to defeat Bush in 2004. Enthusiasm, after all, isn't a subjective term. It's why supporters wait in line to vote, it's why volunteers knock on doors in the dead of winter, and it’s why people donate money to campaigns. Swing and independent voters are crucial to winning general elections, but the foundation of every presidential victory is built on getting the faithful in your own political party excited enough to vote for you and take action to help your campaign. That's something that's difficult to do that when there are fundamental differences on key issues between the candidate and the rest of the party. Ultimately, I think pragmatic and establishment Republicans will win out and Romney will capture the nomination. And who knows, the right wing could decide in November 2012 that their desire to beat Obama outweighs their disagreements with Romney. -- Although Democrats made a similar choice in 2004, they had no time to debate it. Kerry surged to wins in Iowa and New Hampshire after months of staying in the middle of the pack. With Romney clearly holding one of the top two spots in both New Hampshire and Iowa today, Republicans have the next two months to decide whether he’s the man they truly want. In the meantime, I’m sure his challengers will be more than happy to provide examples of why he isn’t their man.<br />

“It will be very difficult for President Obama to be re-elected,” he said. “These independent voters . . . are not ready to blame him for making things worse. They do, however, recognize that he hasn’t made things better. “They see it more as sins of omission, that he took his eye off the ball and hasn’t focused on the economy. They see it as a failure of leadership in many ways. “It’s a real danger sign for any president when some of your past voters think that you’re in over your head.” Voters in the focus groups mainly still give Obama a positive job approval rating but believe he spent too much of his first two years in office concentrating on healthcare instead of jobs and the economy, Gillespie said. But Gillespie warned Republicans that efforts to repeal Obamacare also will be seen as a distraction unless the party couches it the right way. “There’s a need for Republicans to educate voters that there’s a direct connection between the enactment of the Obama healthcare bill with its punitive mandates, and the job-killing impact of that. “If we repeal Obamacare, we will help unleash job creation in the economy. But we need to make that connection more clear to independent voters,” he said. Independents are very concerned about government spending, Gillespie said. “They are not in favor of any blank check when it comes to raising the debt ceiling. They want to see reforms made and spending cuts made before any increase in the debt ceiling, they don’t want to see business as usual,” he said. “They see it as a huge disconnect between Washington, D.C., and their daily lives. When I run up against the limit on my credit card, I don’t just get to say I’ll increase the limit by $2,000, I have to cut back on my spending and change my habits. “In Washington, they don’t seem to have those kind of rules and it’s very frustrating to these voters.”<br />

By BRADLEY KLAPPER, Associated Press –<br />
WASHINGTON (AP) — It's open season on China in the Republican race for the presidential nomination, and Mitt Romney is leading the charge. Newt Gingrich and some other candidates are on his heels, painting China as the bogeyman responsible for America's economic ills. Former Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman is the lone holdout, warning against actions that might prompt a trade war. In a race focused primarily on jobs, taxes and debt, China is emerging as an increasingly prominent foreign policy topic — largely because it is by extension an issue of economics. The debate centers on legitimate gripes over the Asian power's currency value, huge U.S. debt holdings and pirating of American technology. But those issues are often being melded into an all-encompassing populist argument that China is stealing jobs from the United States. &quot;Day one, I will issue an executive order identifying China as a currency manipulator,&quot; Romney said during in last week's debate, outlining his presidential vision. &quot;People who've looked at this in the past have been played like a fiddle by the Chinese. And the Chinese are smiling all the way to the bank, taking our currency and taking our jobs and taking a lot of our future. And I'm not willing to let that happen.&quot; The economics aren't as simple as good and evil in a relationship between the world's largest exporter and importer who between them traded goods worth more than $450 billion last year. Yet the sharp tone has been an effective campaign tool with Americans increasingly perturbed by China's rapidly expanding manufacturing production and pursuit of the U.S. position as the world's biggest economy. U.S.-China relations are imbalanced, even if exports in both directions are rising. The Asian power sells four times as many goods to the U.S. as the United States sends in return to China. But currency policy is only part of the explanation. Chinese workers earn far less money than Americans, allowing local and American companies that moved manufacturing operations to the country to sell goods on the global market at lower prices. Chinese citizens are less likely to buy as many U.S.-made goods because on average they are far poorer than Americans. Those nuances have at times been brushed aside, with talk on China focused more on finger-pointing than serious discussion over ending Washington's overreliance on Beijing for purchasing American debt or supplying the economy with cheap consumer goods. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Weimin, speaking to reporters in Beijing on Monday, said the two countries' trade and economic cooperation benefited both sides. &quot;The attitude of seeking scapegoats and putting the blame on other countries, to mislead the general public, is irresponsible,&quot; Liu said in a regular briefing when asked to comment on Romney's attacks on China's currency policies. Some of the fear of China has spilled over into the question of military might. In an interview with Georgia's Marietta Daily Journal, Gingrich warned earlier this year that if China owns &quot;trillions of dollars of our debt, and they have a superior manufacturing system and a superior military, then our range of independence will be within the framework the Chinese tolerate.&quot; For now, U.S. military supremacy in the Pacific is unchallenged. While some lawmakers watched warily as China unveiled its first aircraft carrier in August, the U.S. has 11 such vessels in operation. And the reality is that even as the value of the yuan against the dollar has irked Republican and Democratic lawmakers for the last decade, politicians have found it much easier to campaign on the issue than force the communist government to float its currency. President Barack Obama, like George W. Bush before him, has opted for negotiation with Beijing rather than conflict as the best way to gain concessions. Romney's approach lumps together complaints about Chinese economic policy which aren't necessarily connected. He has said labeling China a currency manipulator would enable Washington to go after Beijing &quot;in places where they're stealing our intellectual property,&quot; but it's unclear how currency and counterfeiting would be linked. Overly aggressive tactics might be counterproductive for U.S. economic recovery. &quot;I don't subscribe to the Don Trump school or the Mitt Romney school of international trade,&quot; Huntsman, the Obama administration's former ambassador to China, said in Tuesday's GOP debate. &quot;I don't want to find ourselves in a trade war. With respect to China, if you start slapping penalties on them ... you're going to get the same thing in return.&quot; A tit-for-tat trade war would help no one. The United States accelerated the Great Depression in the 1930s by setting sharply higher tariffs on hundreds of foreign goods, sparking international retaliation and the devastation of international commerce. Economists fear a similar wave of protectionism today could plunge the world back into recession. Coming at the problem from the same direction as Romney, the Senate this week passed a bill to impose higher taxes on imports on China if the government fails to allow the yuan to rise in value faster. The bill is unlikely to pass the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders oppose it. And, as Huntsman noted, the Chinese could easily retaliate with penalties against American goods aided by the Federal Reserve's pumping of hundreds of billions of dollars into the U.S. economy. The Obama and Bush administrations have approached China more carefully, targeting with higher import taxes those Chinese goods they felt were selling at artificially low prices while negotiating with Beijing for a fairer currency exchange rate. Despite limited success, they've avoided a blanket punishment of all Chinese goods and any breakdown in relations that would surely make it harder for American products to reach China's booming internal market. &quot;For the first and the second-largest economies in the world, we have no choice: We have to find common ground,&quot; Huntsman argued, in a rare voice of support from a GOP candidate for any current administration policy. A trade war &quot;disadvantages our small businesses,&quot; he said. &quot;It disadvantages our exporters. It disadvantages our agricultural producers.&quot;<br />

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- China and the United States are the world's two largest economies and arguably each other's most important trading partners. And now, it seems the two countries find themselveson the brink of a trade war. The U.S. Senate, in a rare show of bipartisan agreement, passed a bill Tuesday that would slap steep taxes known as tariffs on imports from nations with undervalued currencies. It is a provision aimed squarely at China's yuan, and it prompted harsh attacks from Chinese officials. &quot;Should the proposed legislation be made into law, the result would be a trade war and that would be a lose-lose situation for both sides,&quot; said Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai. &quot;It would be detrimental to the development of economic ties and might have an adverse impact on bilateral relations.&quot;<br />

China's development needs a peaceful international environment, particularly in its periphery. We will continue to play a constructive role in global and regional affairs and sincerely look forward to amicable coexistence and friendly cooperation with all other countries, the United States included. We will continue to push for good-neighborliness, friendship and partnership and dedicate ourselves to peace, stability and prosperity in the region. Thus China's development will also mean stronger prospect of peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. China and the US should, and can, work together for peace, stability and prosperity in the region. Given the highly complementary nature of the two economies, China's reform, opening up and rising economic size have opened broad horizon for sustained China-US trade and economic cooperation. By deepening our commercial partnership, which has already delivered tangible benefits to the two peoples, we can do still more and also make greater contribution to global economic stability and prosperity.Terrorism, cross-boundary crime, proliferation of advanced weapons, and spread of deadly diseases pose a common threat to mankind. China and the US have extensive shared stake and common responsibility for meeting these challenges, maintaining world peace and security and addressing other major issues bearing on human survival and development. China is ready to keep up its coordination and cooperation in these areas with the US and the rest of the international community. During his visit to the US nearly 25 years ago, Deng Xiaoping said, &quot;The interests of our two peoples and those of world peace require that we view our relations from the overall international situation and a long-term strategic perspective.&quot; Thirteen years ago when China-US relations were at their lowest ebb, Mr. Deng said, &quot;In the final analysis, China-US relations have got to get better.&quot; We are optimistic about the tomorrow of China-US relations. We have every reason to believe that so long as the two countries view and handle the relationship with a strategic perspective, adhere to the guiding principles of the three joint communiqués and firmly grasp the common interests of the two countries, we will see even greater accomplishments in China-US relations.<br />

Healthcare reform is worth defending, and the president had better do it fast. Why? Because it's in jeopardy. The Republican victory in November was achieved in part by a commitment to repeal &quot;Obamacare.&quot; The administration was confident the litigation by the state attorneys general was frivolous. But in December the Virginia attorney general succeeded in getting a federal judge to rule it unconstitutional for the government to compel Americans to buy health insurance. If the Supreme Court concurs, universal coverage and cost control will be severely jeopardized. Republicans have already introduced a bill in the House to repeal the law. If that is not successful, they threaten to &quot;starve&quot; it by not appropriating start-up costs. In addition to the loss of the House, Democrats suffered major setbacks in the states, with Republicans now controlling twenty-nine governorships. Eighteen state legislatures converted from Democratic to Republican. These developments are critical in the implementation of the reform, since the law assumes cooperation by state governments. Those states dominated by the GOP may begin to thwart implementation. § Marked 19:01 § What caused the erosion in support for this historic legislation only months after passage? Exit interviews November 2 showed a slight majority of voters in favor, but 58 percent of senior voters wanted it repealed. First, Democrats were unwilling to defend and promote the law in the campaign. Second, and more important, Republicans shrewdly demonized the legislation as &quot;socialized&quot; medicine and an unconstitutional government takeover of healthcare. Presidents Roosevelt and Johnson faced similar opposition to Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965. But they educated the public about the programs and the need for higher taxes to operate them. Even though there were national elections before implementation, both laws easily survived without change. The Obama administration, national Democrats and advocates of reform have retreated from this monumental law. They have hardly mentioned it since the midterm elections. It appears the strategy has been to hunker down and quietly move implementation forward for the next four years, when full coverage of 32 million Americans will take effect. That approach is foolish and dangerous. It's foolish because educating Americans about healthcare is easier than politicians think. In 1968 I started, and ran, one of the first community health centers in the country. Many Republicans and physicians branded it socialized medicine. We were concerned about continued federal-state support. However, with extensive education and demonstrable results, the Republicans under President George W. Bush doubled funding. Now the Obama plan doubles the number of Americans who will be served by community health centers, to 40 million. I have fought these battles for a long time—as a physician, as a two-term mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, as a county executive and as a candidate for the US Senate. I know which fights we can win, even in red states. And I know that a campaign focused on what this administration has already done to preserve and expand Medicare, along with universal health coverage for all Americans, is a winner. I also know that in this politically volatile moment, it's dangerous to avoid the fight. The question is not, Can the Obama administration win this battle? It must win it if it is to have a second term. If the Republicans want to repeal healthcare reform, they will have to win the presidency.<br />

It was the first minutes of Monday's Republican debate. Michele Bachmann pledged more than to simply &quot;not rest until I repeal Obamacare.&quot; Her subsequent words betrayed the higher stakes ahead: &quot;This is the symbol and the signature issue of President Obama, during his entire tenure.&quot; Obama's signature legislation is indeed on the line. As is his tenure. His legacy. This vision of liberal governance. It could all still, after so much, fall apart. There are myriad potential scenarios. The Supreme Court overturns the health care law (or at least its individual mandate). Republicans win a Senate majority in 2012. Obama is defeated. These scenarios set the stage for (potentially) lethal blows to Obama's definitive legislation. One legislative tactic, called reconciliation, empowers Republicans to take down critical components of the law with only a simple majority in the Senate -- though that move is far easier written than done. Definite predictions are a professional hazard this far out. As top-shelf congressional scholar Tom Mann, of the Brookings Institution, put it, &quot;I honestly don't know what will happen.&quot; But? &quot;But listen, I think the 2012 election is hugely consequential,&quot; Mann continued. &quot;If Republicans took control of the White House, as well as the Senate, even being a few votes short of cloture, I'm convinced they would succeed in repealing most or all&quot; of the health care law. However it's done, if it is done, much of Obama's legacy would also be undone. Obama and the Democratic leadership made decisions in 2009 that will reverberate politically for decades. Democratic philosophy -- active-state liberalism, government as a means to promote the common good -- was fully invested in the choices of Obama's first year, a point this writer has admittedly belabored. Democrats made immense legislative sacrifices to win their prize. Those sacrifices could be for naught. The new New Deal that never came to pass. Recall that rare chance. A president had the political capital to cobble a bill large enough to substantially impact the economy. But the average American worker was never bailed out. We cannot know what might have been. What if Obama had focused his first year on the great issue of this time, as FDR did in his time? Obama won the health care overhaul, which was never popular. He could have certainly won a major jobs bill, which was always popular. Would that have granted Obama momentum for more? A financial bill that actually ended &quot;too big to fail&quot;? Other Democratic ambitions -- some measure of legislation on climate change or immigration? Obama sought the great liberal dream instead -- universal health care. The White House seemingly did not grasp the gamble. Obama was wrongly said to have remade our politics, whereas his majority was born with the September 2008 crash and in time, fell as that fact was forgotten. The distance between mandate and actions grew. His coalition predictably fissured with that distance, as he learned demographics are not destiny. Even the everyman concern for health care costs went largely unaddressed. Independents predictably left Obama his first summer in office. The economy was recovering but health care consumed DC. Bailout for the big guy. Health care for the little guy. The middleman was forgotten. Independents never returned. Yet at least, from Democrats' perspective, they had something historic to show for all they sacrificed. And if the law holds, 32 million more Americans will have health insurance. Not small sacrifices. But no small feat. That historic consolation could, however, be undone. As for conservatives, on this matter history is synonymous with notoriety. Newt Gingrich was once a supporter of a mandate. At Monday's debate, even he agreed that opposing the individual mandate should be a litmus test in the GOP primary. That individual mandate is the keystone of the law. Without it, reform surely fails. Last year, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged that Republicans wouldn't be able to repeal health care -- if they can -- until at least 2013. This spring, Gingrich predicted that the legislation &quot;will be repealed ... probably by March or April 2013.&quot; § Marked 19:01 § He added that even with Obama in office, the president &quot;can block them from repeal; I don't think he can coerce them into funding.&quot; Gingrich has always been a no-shot presidential candidate. Yet the former House speaker certainly knows the machinations of Congress. Should Republicans control Congress, Democrats' vulnerability is real. &quot;Republicans could refuse to fund aspects of its implementation,&quot; Mann said of this scenario. &quot;Fail to confirm nominees to get the job done. Put other pressure on the regulatory front. They can really weaken it and make it extremely difficult to really move forward with everything from the effectiveness research to the changes in the basis of payment. Yeah, they can make it really tough.&quot; Mann's caveat, however, is worth keeping in mind. Those who know Congress best agree that &quot;nobody really knows,&quot; as fellow Brookings congressional expert Sarah Binder said. &quot;Neither extreme is likely. It's unlikely that the health care law remains in its original condition, as Democrats want it to be, or that it's entirely repealed,&quot; noted Binder, also a professor at George Washington University. What if the GOP does not control both the executive and legislative branches? &quot;Republicans will have a tough time defunding health care,&quot; she said. But imagine the GOP controls Congress and the White House. Yet they still lack a Senate super majority. Is reconciliation the way Republicans rescind the law? &quot;My hunch, it's probably the only way.&quot; Reconciliation allows the majority party to neutralize a filibuster if the measure involves budgetary matters. Democrats utilized reconciliation to pass part of the final health care law, but Republicans have historically used the procedure most, including on measures such as welfare reform. They will not hesitate to utilize the tactic once more. But a yellow light flashes here too. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined that rescinding the health care law increases the federal deficit by about $230 billion over the next decade. Any potential reconciliation bill must compensate for that gap, and then some. But with the power, Republicans will likely have the political will to find a way. These legislative war games could prove moot. The Supreme Court might hold the law, or critical portions, unconstitutional. In the past, court mavens said that outcome was unlikely. It's now unclear how the court might rule, as Slate's Dahlia Lithwick has smartly explained. It could consider the law next year. But it's really an electoral matter outside the court. Democrats have 23 Senate seats up for re-election in 2012. Republicans have 10. Republicans could plausibly hold the House and win a Senate majority in 2012. Thus, the GOP's best chance to overhaul the overhaul is likely to be in 2013. Why? Recall all those foolish predictions that health care would become suddenly popular after passage. They ignored the timeline. People don't appreciate what they do not yet have. The converse should, however, inform GOP strategy. People do not miss what they never had. In 2014, those 32 million Americans who lack coverage will begin to gain it. Politicians cannot easily cut entitlements once, well, people feel entitled to them. They are called third rails for a reason. Congress has never repealed landmark social welfare legislation within years of passage. But previous major social legislation also enjoyed some significant measure of bipartisan support. The hyper-partisan nature of health care's passage explains its vulnerability. This vulnerability only matters if the GOP has a historic victory in 2012. That potential victory also means that Democrats must consider all that could still be lost. In this age of austerity, their vision of health care reform is on the line. And so is the Democratic vision itself. Democrats had hoped to take their medicine up front, in the midterms. The worst was surely behind them -- they paid a great electoral cost in 2010. The benefits were surely ahead of them. Or so they thought. Last year, as the president signed the bill into law, you could almost feel the collective Democratic relief. Obama lifted the last pen off the desk. And simply said, &quot;We are done.&quot; We'll see.<br />

But with the US presently engaged in a &quot;war on terror,&quot; in which not only soldiers but also civilians are targets, a healthy fighting force is no longer enough to ensure national security; the time has come for this country to take up reforms that promote the health of all Americans. Reassuringly, this is not a novel proposal. Reflecting upon statements made in 1944 by American medical historian Henry E. Sigerist, MD, concerning the power of external security threats to stimulate reform, a recent editorial in the American Journal of Public Health suggested that, &quot;[t]his incendiary moment may be just the time for rekindling reform&quot; [2]. Similarly, emergency physician and medical ethicist C. Griffin Trotter, MD, PhD, recently declared: &quot;National security, I submit, is the new banner for health care reform&quot; [3]. Consider the threat of bioterrorism: the potential use of biological weapons against this country raises the specter of a unique kind of war in which battles will be fought not against soldiers and artillery but against epidemics. Without significant reform to ensure access to health care for all Americans, the US will be unable to fight such battles effectively. Why Access? Using infectious diseases as weapons, bioterrorism threatens to weaken the civilian workforce and, hence, a nation's ability to go about its daily business. § Marked 19:02 § Moreover, in the case of diseases that are transmissible person to person, each infected individual becomes a human weapon, infecting others, who then infect others, and so on, tying up medical responders and overwhelming medical resources. A nation's greatest defense against bioterrorism, both in preparation for and in response to an attack, is a population in which an introduced biological agent cannot get a foothold, ie, healthy people with easy access to health care.<br />

Imagine if the first people infected in a smallpox attack had no health insurance and delayed seeking care for their flu-like symptoms. The odds are high. Pick a number from one to six. Would you bet your life on a roll of the dice? Would you play Russian Roulette with one bullet in a six-chamber gun? One in six Americans under age 65 has no health insurance. The uninsured are more likely to delay seeking medical care, go to work sick for fear of losing their jobs, seek care at overcrowded emergency rooms and clinics, and be poorly diagnosed and treated. The longer smallpox--or another contagious disease--goes undiagnosed, the more it will spread, with the insured and uninsured infecting each other. Healthcare is literally a matter of life and death. Yet, more than 41 million Americans have no health insurance of any kind, public or private. The uninsured rate was 14.6 percent in 2001--up 13 percent since 1987. The rate is on the rise with increased healthcare costs, unemployment and cutbacks in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). One in four people with household incomes less than $25,000 is uninsured. One in six full-time workers is uninsured, including half the full-time workers with incomes below the official poverty line. The share of workers covered by employment health plans drops from 81 percent in the top fifth of wage earners to 68 percent in the middle fifth to 33 percent in the lowest fifth, according to the Economic Policy Institute. As reports by the American College of Physicians, Kaiser Family Foundation and many others have shown, lack of health insurance is associated with lack of preventive care and substandard treatment inside and outside the hospital. The uninsured are at much higher risk for chronic disease and § Marked 19:02 § disability, and have a 25 percent greater chance of dying (adjusting for physical, economic and behavioral factors). To make matters worse, a health crisis is often an economic crisis. &quot;Medical bills are a factor in nearly half of all personal bankruptcy filings,&quot; reports the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine. The U.S. is No. 1 in healthcare spending per capita, but No. 34--tied with Malaysia--when it comes to child mortality rates under age five. The U.S. is No. 1 in healthcare spending, but the only major industrialized nation not to provide some form of universal coverage. We squander billions of dollars in the red tape of myriad healthcare eligibility regulations, forms and procedures, and second-guessing of doctors by insurance gatekeepers trained in cost cutting, not medicine. Americans go to Canada for cheaper prices on prescription drugs made by U.S. pharmaceutical companies with U.S. taxpayer subsidies. While millions go without healthcare, top health company executives rake in the dough. A report by Families USA found that the highest-paid health plan executives in ten companies received average compensation of $11.7 million in 2000, not counting unexercised stock options worth tens of millions more. The saying, &quot;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,&quot; couldn't be truer when it comes to healthcare. Yet, we provide universal coverage for seniors through Medicare, but not for children. We have economic disincentives for timely diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Universal healthcare is a humane and cost-effective solution to the growing healthcare crisis. Universal coverage won't come easy, but neither did Social Security or Medicare, which now serves one in seven Americans. Many proposals for universal healthcare build on the foundation of &quot;Medicare for All,&quot; albeit an improved Medicare adequately serving seniors and younger people alike. Healthcare is as essential to equal opportunity as public education and as essential to public safety as police and fire protection. If your neighbor's house were burning, would you want 911 operators to ask for their fire insurance card number before sending--or not sending--fire trucks? Healthcare ranked second behind terrorism and national security as the most critical issue for the nation in the 2002 Health Confidence Survey released by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The government thinks the smallpox threat is serious enough to start inoculating military and medical personnel with a highly risky vaccine. It's time to stop delaying universal healthcare, which will save lives everyday while boosting our readiness for any bioterror attack.<br />

Ultimately the world's military, medical, and business establishments will have to work together to an unprecedented degree if the international community is to succeed in containing the threat of biological weapons. Although human pathogens are often lumped with nuclear explosives and lethal chemicals as potential weapons of mass destruction, there is an obvious, fundamentally important difference: Pathogens are alive, weapons are not. Nuclear and chemical weapons do not reproduce themselves and do not independently engage in adaptive behavior; pathogens do both of these things. That deceptively simple observation has immense implications. The use of a manufactured weapon is a singular event. Most of the damage occurs immediately. The aftereffects, whatever they may be, decay rapidly over time and distance in a reasonably predictable manner. Even before a nuclear warhead is detonated, for instance, it is possible to estimate the extent of the subsequent damage and the likely level of radioactive fallout. Such predictability is an essential component for tactical military planning. The use of a pathogen, by contrast, is an extended process whose scope and timing cannot be precisely controlled. For most potential biological agents, the predominant drawback Biological Weapons is that they would not act swiftly or decisively enough to be an effective weapon. But for a few pathogens ones most likely to have a decisive effect and therefore the ones most likely to be contemplated for deliberately hostile use-the risk runs in the other direction. A lethal pathogen that could efficiently spread from one victim to another would be capable of initiating an intensifying cascade of disease that might ultimately threaten the entire world population. The 1918 influenza epidemic demonstrated the potential for a global contagion of this sort but not necessarily its outer limit.<br />

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a “nuclear winter,” resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is ove r§ Marked 19:03 § . With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE. Ironically, the Bush administration has just changed the U.S. nuclear doctrine to allow nuclear retaliation against threats upon allies by conventional weapons. The past doctrine allowed such use only as a last resort when our nation’s survival was at stake. Will the new policy also allow easier use of US bioweapons? How slippery is this slope?<br />

Less than four months from now, the mid-term elections will determine if the Democrats lose control of the Senate and their ability to set the national agenda. The November balloting will also lay the foundation for President Obama’s next two years in office – and his re-election campaign. Any number of scenarios could undermine Obama in 2012. If (God forbid) a 9/11-style attack hits the United States that summer, or, say, the economy goes into a deep tailspin, then Obama will become the first one-term president since George H.W. Bush. In Obama’s wake, the Republican Piranha who’ve been circling the White House since 2008 (Palin, Romney, et al.) will feast on the Democrats’ political carcass. Here are three scenarios: <strong>President Whitman: After narrowly beating Jerry Brown for the California governorship in 2010, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman gets drafted for the 2012 presidential campaign and reluctantly accepts – then steamrolls her way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Whitman’s appeal – the first woman Republican to head the ticket; her success in Silicon Valley; her (anti-Palinesque) ability to speak coherently about the economy, foreign affairs, and her vision for America – makes her the surprising choice for independents and conservative liberals who helped springboard Obama in 2008. Whitman’s running mate, Newt Gingrich, secures her standing among Conservatives, especially in the South, and – like Joe Biden in 2008 with Obama – he reassures a potentially jittery public that his ticket has the necessary experience.</strong> War in Iran: The Republicans’ ascension marks the return of chickenhawk diplomacy. Instead of the Obama administration’s reasoned approach to Iran, the new administration relies on § Marked 19:03 § all-or-nothing antagonism, leading to the third Gulf War in two decades. What ensues are thousands of new military deaths, a dangerously destabilized Middle East, and an oil crisis that shocks Western economies for years. As in Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. tries to shepherd in a friendlier government, but now all three countries – connected geographically, religiously and historically – become the world’s leading front for insurgency against the United States.<br />

The Cosmos: Capitalism’s New “Outside” Instead of indulging in over-optimistic and fantastic visions, we should take a longer, harder, and more critical look at what is happening and what is likely to happen. We can then begin taking a more measured view of space humanization, and start developing more progressive alternatives. At this point, we must return to the deeper, underlying processes which are at the heart of the capitalist economy and society, and which are generating this demand for expansion into outer space. Although the humanization of the cosmos is clearly a new and exotic development, the social relationships and mechanisms underlying space-humanization are very familiar. In the early twentieth century, Rosa Luxemburg argued that an “outside” to capitalism is important for two main reasons. First, it is needed as a means of creating massive numbers of new customers who would buy the goods made in the capitalist countries. 7 As outlined earlier, space technology has extended and deepened this process, allowing an increasing number of people to become integral to the further expansion of global capitalism. Luxemburg’s second reason for imperial expansion is the search for cheap supplies of labor and raw materials. Clearly, space fiction fantasies about aliens aside, expansion into the cosmos offers no benefits to capital in the form of fresh sources of labor power. 8 But expansion into the cosmos does offer prospects for exploiting new materials such as those in asteroids, the moon, and perhaps other cosmic entities such as Mars. Neil Smith’s characterization of capital’s relations to nature is useful at this point. The reproduction of material life is wholly dependent on the production and reproduction of surplus value. To this end, capital stalks the Earth in search of material resources; nature becomes a universal means of production in the sense that it not only provides the subjects, objects and instruments of production, but is also in its totality an appendage to the production process…no part of the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere, the oceans, the geological substratum or the biological superstratum are immune from transformation by capital. 9 Capital is now also “stalking” outer space in the search for new resources and raw materials. Nature on a cosmic scale now seems likely to be incorporated into production processes, these being located mainly on earth. Since Luxemburg wrote, an increasing number of political economists have argued that the importance of a capitalist “outside” is not so much that of creating a new pool of customers or of finding new resources. 10 Rather, an outside is needed as a zone into which surplus capital can be invested. Economic and social crisis stems less from the problem of finding new consumers, and more from that of finding, making, and exploiting zones of profitability for surplus capital. Developing “outsides” in this way is also a product of recurring crises, particularly those of declining economic profitability. These crises are followed by attempted “fixes” in distinct geographic regions. The word “fix” is used here both literally and figuratively. On the one hand, capital is being physically invested in new regions. On the other hand, the attempt is to fix capitalism’s crises. Regarding the latter, however, there are, of course, no absolute guarantees that such fixes will really correct an essentially unstable social and economic system. At best, they are short-term solutions. The kind of theory mentioned above also has clear implications for the humanization of the cosmos. Projects for the colonization of outer space should be seen as the attempt to make new types of “spatial fix,” again in response to economic, social, and environmental crises on earth.<br />
Outer space will be “globalized,” i. e. , appended to Earth, with new parts of the cosmos being invested in by competing nations and companies. Military power will inevitably be made an integral part of this process, governments protecting the zones for which they are responsible. Some influential commentators argue that the current problem for capitalism is that there is now no “outside. ”11 Capitalism is everywhere. Similarly, resistance to capitalism is either everywhere or nowhere. But, as suggested above, the humanization of the cosmos seriously questions these assertions. New “spatial fixes”- are due to be opened up in the cosmos, capitalism’s emergent outside. At first, these will include artificial fixes such as satellites, space stations, and space hotels. But during the next twenty years or so, existing outsides, such as the moon and Mars, will begin attracting investments. The stage would then be set for wars in outer space between nations and companies attempting to make their own cosmic “fixes. ”<br />

Outer spatial fixes: for war or peace? These fixes could easily become the basis for a new global war, one in which a militarized outer space would be an important part. This is because there is a potential and actual contradiction between regional ‘fixes’ such as those attempted by China, India and Japan and the demands for capital to find new sources of accumulation. A regional fix is often made ‘autarchic’: a zone that, on account of active state intervention, allows limited trade with the outside world. As Harvey (2006) suggests, this may not be a problem so long as there are sufficient resources of capital and labour in the region in question for local capital to continue accu- mulation. But, if this is not the case, capital will inevitably move elsewhere. In the process, however, it confronts other capitalist enterprises over access to labour and resources. Nationally based private enterprises therefore finish up competing for shrinking opportunities for accumulation and this indeed is a recipe for potent ial armed conflict. As the next chapter discusses in more detail, China, Japan and India are amongst the countries now attempting to secure military presences in outer space. If Harvey’s theory is correct, these are means of protecting regional interests by ensuring that capital in these regions will have ready access to resources and labour beyond their own limits. Regional investments in outer space could thereby form an important form of future wars over resources, hostilities which could even include confrontations with the military might of the United States. Initially these conflicts might be land-based with satellites engaged in surveillance and the guid- ing of Earth-based weapons, but later they could easily be of a ‘star wars’ type with hostilities taking place in outer space. As Harvey points out, war can be seen as the ultimate and most catastrophic form of ‘devaluation’: one in which whole societies are obliterated and the prospects for a new round of investment and accumulation may be started.<br />

It is time to try to describe, at first abstractly and later concretely, a strategy for destroying capitalism. This strategy, at its most basic, calls for pulling time, energy, and resources out of capitalist civilization and putting them into building a new civilization. The image then is one of emptying out capitalist structures, hollowing them out, by draining wealth, power, and meaning out of them until there is nothing left but shells. This is definitely an aggressive strategy. It requires great militancy, and constitutes an attack on the existing order. The strategy clearly recognizes that capitalism is the enemy and must be destroyed, but it is not a frontal attack aimed at overthrowing the system, but an inside attack aimed at gutting it, while simultaneously replacing it with something better, something we want. Thus capitalist structures (corporations, governments, banks, schools, etc. ) are not seized so much as simply abandoned. Capitalist relations are not fought so much as they are simply rejected. We stop participating in activities that support (finance, condone) the capitalist world and start participating in activities that build a new world while simultaneously undermining the old. We create a new pattern of social relations alongside capitalist relations and then we continually build and strengthen our new pattern while doing every thing we can to weaken capitalist relations. In this way our new democratic, non-hierarchical, non-commodified relations can eventually overwhelm the capitalist relations and force them out of existence. This is how it has to be done. This is a plausible, realistic strategy. To think that we could create a whole new world of decent social arrangements overnight, in the midst of a crisis, during a so-called revolution, or during the collapse of capitalism, is foolhardy. Our new social world must grow within the old, and in opposition to it, until it is strong enough to dismantle and abolish capitalist relations. Such a revolution will never happen automatically, blindly, determinably, because of the inexorable, materialist laws of history. It will happen, and only happen, because we want it to, and because we know what we’re doing and know how we want to live, and know what obstacles have to be overcome before we can live that way, and know how to distinguish between our social patterns and theirs. But we must not think that the capitalist world can simply be ignored, in a live and let live attitude, while we try to build new lives elsewhere. (There is no elsewhere. ) There is at least one thing, wage-slavery, that we can’t simply stop participating in (but even here there are ways we can chip away at it). Capitalism must be explicitly refused and replaced by something else. This constitutes War, but it is not a war in the traditional sense of armies and tanks, but a war fought on a daily basis, on the level of everyday life, by millions of people. It is a war nevertheless because the accumulators of capital will use coercion, brutality, and murder, as they have always done in the past, to try to block any rejection of the system. They have always had to force compliance; they will not hesitate to continue doing so. Nevertheless, there are many concrete ways that individuals, groups, and neighborhoods can gut capitalism, which I will enumerate shortly. We must always keep in mind how we became slaves; then we can see more clearly how we can cease being slaves. We were forced into wage-slavery because the ruling class slowly, systematically, and brutally destroyed our ability to live autonomously. By driving us off the land, changing the property laws, destroying community rights, destroying our tools, imposing taxes, destroying our local markets, and so forth, we were forced onto the labor market in order to survive, our only remaining option being to sell, for a wage, our ability to work. It’s quite clear then how we can overthrow slavery. We must reverse this process. We must begin to reacquire the ability to live without working for a wage or buying the products made by wage-slaves (that is, we must get free from the labor market and the way of living based on it), and embed ourselves instead in cooperative labor and cooperatively produced goods. Another clarification is needed. This strategy does not call for reforming capitalism, for changing capitalism into something else. It calls for replacing capitalism, totally, with a new civilization. This is an important distinction, because capitalism has proved impervious to reforms, as a system. We can sometimes in some places win certain concessions from it (usually only temporary ones) and win some (usually short-lived) improvements in our lives as its victims, but we cannot reform it piecemeal, as a system. Thus our strategy of gutting and eventually destroying capitalism requires at a minimum a totalizing image, an awareness that we are attacking an entire way of life and replacing it with another, and not merely reforming one way of life into something else. Many people may not be accustomed to thinking about entire systems and social orders, but everyone knows what a lifestyle is, or a way of life, and that is the way we should approach it. The thing is this: in order for capitalism to be destroyed millions and millions of people must be dissatisfied with their way of life. They must want something else and see certain existing things as obstacles to getting what they want. It is not useful to think of this as a new ideology. It is not merely a belief-system that is needed, like a religion, or like Marxism, or Anarchism. Rather it is a new prevailing vision, a dominant desire, an overriding need. What must exist is a pressing desire to live a certain way, and not to live another way. If this pressing desire were a desire to live free, to be autonomous, to live in democratically controlled communities, to participate in the self-regulating activities of a mature people, then capitalism could be destroyed. Otherwise we are doomed to perpetual slavery and possibly even to extinction.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Studies in multiple fields prove that complex societies will inevitably collapse due to diminishing returns from innovation—infinite growth is literally impossible and attempts to innovate the way out of the crisis guarantee a collapse in the future. Only a partitioned collapse of human civilization can allow us to renew into less complex societies and avoid catastrophe.</span><br />

<br />
DOOMSDAY. The end of civilisation. Literature and film abound with tales of plague, famine and wars which ravage the planet, leaving a few survivors scratching out a primitive existence amid the ruins. Every civilisation in history has collapsed, after all. Why should ours be any different? Doomsday scenarios typically feature a knockout blow: a massive asteroid, all-out nuclear war or a catastrophic pandemic . Yet there is another chilling possibility: what if the very nature of civilisation means that ours, like all the others, is destined to collapse sooner or later? A few researchers have been making such claims for years. Disturbingly, recent insights from fields such as complexity theory suggest that they are right. It appears that once a society develops beyond a certain level of complexity it becomes increasingly fragile. Eventually, it reaches a point at which even a relatively minor disturbance can bring everything crashing down. Some say we have already reached this point, and that it is time to start thinking about how we might manage collapse. Others insist it is not yet too late, and that we can - we must - act now to keep disaster at bay. History is not on our side. Think of Sumeria, of ancient Egypt and of the Maya. In his 2005 best-seller , Jared Diamond of the University of California, Los Angeles, blamed environmental mismanagement for the fall of the Mayan civilisation and others, and warned that we might be heading the same way unless we choose to stop destroying our environmental support systems. Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington DC agrees. He has that governments must pay more attention to vital environmental resources. &quot;It's not about saving the planet. It's about saving civilisation,&quot; he says. Others think our problems run deeper. From the moment our ancestors started to settle down and build cities, we have had to find solutions to the problems that success brings. &quot;For the past 10,000 years, problem solving has produced increasing complexity in human societies,&quot; says Joseph Tainter, an archaeologist at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, and author of the 1988 book The Collapse of Complex Societies . If crops fail because rain is patchy, build irrigation canals. When they silt up, organise dredging crews. When the bigger crop yields lead to a bigger population, build more canals. When there are too many for ad hoc repairs, install a management bureaucracy, and tax people to pay for it. When they complain, invent tax inspectors and a system to record the sums paid. That much the Sumerians knew. Diminishing returns There is, however, a price to be paid. Every extra layer of organisation imposes a cost in terms of energy, the common currency of all human efforts, from building canals to educating scribes. And increasing complexity, Tainter realised, produces diminishing returns. The extra food produced by each extra hour of labour - or joule of energy invested per farmed hectare - diminishes as that investment mounts. We see the same thing today in a declining number of patents per dollar invested in research as that research investment mounts. This law of diminishing returns appears everywhere, Tainter says. To keep growing, societies must keep solving problems as they arise. Yet each problem solved means more complexity. Success generates a larger population, more kinds of specialists, more resources to manage, more information to juggle - and, ultimately, less bang for your buck. Eventually, says Tainter, the point is reached when all the energy and resources available to a society are required just to maintain its existing level of complexity. Then when the climate changes or barbarians invade, overstretched institutions break down and civil order collapses. What emerges is a less complex society, which is organised on a smaller scale or has been taken over by another group. Tainter sees diminishing returns as the underlying reason for the collapse of all ancient civilisations, from the early Chinese dynasties to the Greek city state of Mycenae. These civilisations relied on the solar energy that could be harvested from food, fodder and wood, and from wind. When this had been stretched to its limit, things fell apart. Western industrial civilisation has become bigger and more complex than any before it by exploiting new sources of energy, notably coal and oil, but these are limited. There are increasing signs of diminishing returns: the energy required to get is mounting and although global is still increasing, constant innovation is needed to cope with environmental degradation and evolving - the yield boosts per unit of investment in innovation are shrinking. &quot;Since problems are inevitable,&quot; Tainter warns, &quot;this process is in part ineluctable.&quot; Is Tainter right? An analysis of complex systems has led Yaneer Bar-Yam, head of the New England Complex Systems Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to the same conclusion that Tainter reached from studying history. Social organisations become steadily more complex as they are required to deal both with environmental problems and with challenges from neighbouring societies that are also becoming more complex, Bar-Yam says. This eventually leads to a fundamental shift in the way the society is organised. &quot;To run a hierarchy, managers cannot be less complex than the system they are managing,&quot; Bar-Yamsays. As complexity increases, societies add ever more layers of management but, ultimately in a hierarchy, one individual has to try and get their head around the whole thing, and this starts to become impossible. At that point, hierarchies give way to networks in which decision-making is distributed. We are at this point. This shift to decentralised networks has led to a widespread belief that modern society is more resilient than the old hierarchical systems. &quot;I don't foresee a collapse in society because of increased complexity,&quot; says futurologist and industry consultant Ray Hammond. &quot;Our strength is in our highly distributed decision making.&quot; This, he says, makes modern western societies more resilient than those like the old Soviet Union, in which decision making was centralised. Things are not that simple, says Thomas Homer-Dixon, a political scientist at the University of Toronto, Canada, and author of the 2006 book The Upside of Down . &quot;Initially, increasing connectedness and diversity helps: if one village has a crop failure, it can get food from another village that didn't The very nature of civilisation may make its demise inevitable, says Debora MacKenzie New Scientist April 5, 2008 As connections increase, though, networked systems become increasingly tightly coupled. This means the impacts of failures can propagate: the more closely those two villages come to depend on each other, the more both will suffer if either has a problem. &quot;Complexity leads to higher vulnerability in some ways,&quot; says Bar-Yam. &quot;This is not widely understood.&quot; The reason is that as networks become ever tighter, they start to transmit shocks rather than absorb them. &quot;The intricate networks that tightly connect us together - and move people, materials, information, money and energy - amplify and transmit any shock,&quot; says Homer-Dixon. &quot;A financial crisis, a terrorist attack or a disease outbreak has almost instant destabilising effects, from one side of the world to the other.&quot; For instance, in 2003 large areas of North America and Europe suffered when apparently insignificant nodes of their respective electricity grids failed. And this year China suffered a similar blackout after heavy snow hit power lines. Tightly coupled networks like these create the potential for propagating failure across many critical industries, says Charles Perrow of Yale University, a leading authority on industrial accidents and disasters. Credit crunch Perrow says interconnectedness in the global production system has now reached the point where &quot;a breakdown anywhere increasingly means a breakdown everywhere&quot;. This is especially true of the world's financial systems, where the coupling is very tight. &quot;Now we have a debt crisis with the biggest player, the US. The consequences could be enormous.&quot; &quot;A networked society behaves like a multicellular organism,&quot; says Bar-Yam, &quot;random damage is like lopping a chunk off a sheep.&quot; Whether or not the sheep survives depends on which chunk is lost. And while we are pretty sure which chunks a sheep needs, it isn't clear - it may not even be predictable - which chunks of our densely networked civilisation are critical, until it's too late. &quot;When we do the analysis, almost any part is critical if you lose enough of it,&quot; says Bar-Yam. &quot;Now that we can ask questions of such systems in more sophisticated ways, we are discovering that they can be very vulnerable. That means civilisation is very vulnerable.&quot; So what can we do? &quot;The key issue is really whether we respond successfully in the face of the new vulnerabilities we have,&quot; Bar-Yam says. That means making sure our &quot;global sheep&quot; does not get injured in the first place - something that may be hard to guarantee as the climate shifts and the world's fuel and mineral resources dwindle. Scientists in other fields are also warning that complex systems are prone to collapse. Similar ideas have emerged from the study of natural cycles in ecosystems, based on the work of ecologist Buzz Holling, now at the University of Florida, Gainesville. Some ecosystems become steadily more complex over time: as a patch of new forest grows and matures, specialist species may replace more generalist species, biomass builds up and the trees, beetles and bacteria form an increasingly rigid and ever more tightly coupled system. &quot;It becomes an extremely efficient system for remaining constant in the face of the normal range of conditions,&quot; says Homer-Dixon. But unusual conditions - an insect outbreak, fire or drought - can trigger dramatic changes as the impact cascades through the system. The end result may be the collapse of the old ecosystem and its replacement by a newer, simpler one. Globalisation is resulting in the same tight coupling and fine-tuning of our systems to a narrow range of conditions, he says. Redundancy is being systematically eliminated as companies maximise profits. Some products are produced by only one factory worldwide. Financially, it makes sense, as mass production maximises efficiency. Unfortunately, it also minimises resilience. &quot;We need to be more selective about increasing the connectivity and speed of our critical systems,&quot; says Homer-Dixon. &quot;Sometimes the costs outweigh the benefits.&quot; Is there an alternative? Could we heed these warnings and start carefully climbing back down the complexity ladder? Tainter knows of only one civilisation that managed to decline but not fall. &quot;After the Byzantine empire lost most of its territory to the Arabs, they simplified their entire society. Cities mostly disappeared, literacy and numeracy declined, their economy became less monetised, and they switched from professional army to peasant militia.&quot; Pulling off the same trick will be harder for our more advanced society. Nevertheless, Homer-Dixon thinks we should be taking action now. &quot;First, we need to encourage distributed and decentralised production of vital goods like energy and food,&quot; he says. &quot;Second, we need to remember that slack isn't always waste. A manufacturing company with a large inventory may lose some money on warehousing, but it can keep running even if its suppliers are temporarily out of action.&quot; The electricity industry in the US has already started identifying hubs in the grid with no redundancy available and is putting some back in, Homer-Dixon points out. Governments could encourage other sectors to follow suit. The trouble is that in a world of fierce competition, private companies will always increase efficiency unless governments subsidise inefficiency in the public interest. Homer-Dixon doubts we can stave off collapse completely. He points to what he calls &quot;tectonic&quot; stresses that will shove our rigid, tightly coupled system outside the range of conditions it is becoming ever more finely tuned to. These include population growth, the growing divide between the world's rich and poor, financial instability, weapons proliferation, disappearing forests and fisheries, and climate change. In imposing new complex solutions we will run into the problem of diminishing returns - just as we are running out of cheap and plentiful energy. &quot;This is the fundamental challenge humankind faces. We need to allow for the healthy breakdown in natural function in our societies in a way that doesn't produce catastrophic collapse, but instead leads to healthy renewal,&quot; Homer-Dixon says. This is what happens in forests, which are a patchy mix of old growth and newer areas created by disease or fire. If the ecosystem in one patch collapses, it is recolonised and renewed by younger forest elsewhere. We must allow partial breakdown here and there, followed by renewal, he says, rather than trying so hard to avert breakdown by increasing complexity that any resulting crisis is actually worse. Lester Brown thinks we are fast running out of time. &quot;The world can no longer afford to waste a day. We need a Great Mobilisation, as we had in wartime,&quot; he says. &quot;There has been tremendous progress in just the past few years. For the first time, I am starting to see how an alternative economy might emerge. But it's now a race between tipping points - which will come first, a switch to sustainable technology, or collapse?&quot; Tainter is not convinced that even new technology will save civilisation in the long run. &quot;I sometimes think of this as a 'faith-based' approach to the future,&quot; he says. Even a society reinvigorated by cheap new energy sources will eventually face the problem of diminishing returns once more. Innovation itself might be subject to diminishing returns, or perhaps absolute limits. Studies of the way by Luis Bettencourt of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, support this idea. His team's work suggests that an ever-faster rate of innovation is required to keep cities growing and prevent stagnation or collapse, and in the long run this cannot be sustainable.<br />

<br />
Nor can economic crises explain the bloodshed. What may be the most familiar causal chain in modern historiography links the Great Depression to the rise of fascism and the outbreak of World War II. But that simple story leaves too much out. Nazi Germany started the war in Europe only after its economy had recovered. Not all the countries affected by the Great Depression were taken over by fascist regimes, nor did all such regimes start wars of aggression. In fact, no general relationship between economics and conflict is discernible for the century as a whole. Some wars came after periods of growth, others were the causes rather than the consequences of economic catastrophe, and some severe economic crises were not followed by wars.<br />

The camp was a means to demonstrate our extreme frustration with failure of our government, and the rest of the G20 governments to address the real cause of climate change – our economic system. This system is dependent on infinite growth, on the production and consumption of more and more stuff, forever and ever. As seductive as this economic system might be for those in a position of privilege, this system is unsustainable in the long term. We cannot have infinite growth while reliant on a planet with finite resources. This economic model is unsustainable and will collapse; and while financial collapse is painful, ecological collapse is terminal.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Timeframe and Magnitude – Scarcity as a result of the affluence lifestyle results in inevitable extinction, these types of wars are empirically the most probable and happen and escalate faster than other kinds of wars</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Waltraud </span>Q <strong>Morales</strong>, Professor of Comparative and International Studies, University of Central Florida, <strong>2002</strong>, in On the Edge of Scarcity, Dobkowski and Wallimann, eds, pp. 122-123.<br />
<br />
Scarcity has proved to be the curse of both the cold war and the post—cold war generations for the majority of the world’s developing nations. Indeed, with the beginning of the twenty-first century, intrastate conflict has supplanted interstate conflict as the pattern of warfare.’ Much of this violence within states has been aggravated by economic deprivation and scarcity. Theories of revolution and instability have long emphasized the important role of economic scarcity as a prime facilitator of violence. Economic conditions of deprivation, inequality, and underdevelopment exacerbated the tribal, ethnic, racial, and nationalist divisions that chatacterized much of the conflict of the twentieth century. Nation-states around the world have experienced severe social fragmentation, giving new meaning to the term balkanization. For example, the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia has led to intrastate conflict in Bosnia and Kosovo, and fears of a similar outbreak in Macedonia. Tribal violence and postcolonial power struggles continue to ravage Somalia. In Haiti, a postrevolutionary society struggles to establish democracy and economic viability. In the aftermath of intrastate conflicts, these countries seek to achieve a form of equitable and sustainable development that will break the brutal cycle of poverty, group rivalry, and violence. Why are the states of the twenty-first century seemingly more vulnerable to internal disintegration and internal violence? Increased relative economic scarcity and deprivation clearly have been part of the answer. In societies from the former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, to the former colonial regions of Rwanda, Liberia, the Congo, Zimbabwe, Liberia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Indonesia, East Timor, El Salvador, and Guatemala, to name but a few, increased pressure on scarce resources and the struggle to achieve sustainable development with justice and equity have contributed to bloody revolutions and civil wars. Scarcity, although downplayed by some theories of violence, has been a primary and secondarv explanation for increased civil unrest. Moreover, whether relative or absolute, scarcity has activated the process of internal “balkanization” and social disintegration. Both “objective” and “subjective” increases in socioeconomic competition for scarce state resources have been essential preconditions of intrastate violence. Scarcity, especially when aggravated by inequality, has intensified the “us” versus “them” polarizations in most developing societies. Therefore, this overview suggests that the socioeconomic scarcity that in large part unsustainable development has created and perpetuated is an important explanation of global wars, ethnic violence, and civil unrest within and among states. Recently, The importance of resource scarcity and socioeconomic deprivation has been obscured by an emphasis on the cultural, ethnic, and nationality factors as causes of violence. Additionally, the fixation with the technological and military-hardware dimensions of national security has ignored the fact that resource deprivation is closely linked to the global struggle for sustainable development. What is really at issue is the collective survival of mankind in an era of ever increasing scarcity and inequality, and it is this global struggle that has been mirrored in localized, intrastate conflict. A review of four cases of intrastate conflict in Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, and Haiti demonstrates that “no country is an island.”‘ In the final recokoning, resource deprivation and depletion among the world’s poorest nations are integrally linked to global sustainability and human security.<br />

The global market for rocket launches may require more stringent regulation in order to prevent significant damage to Earth’s stratospheric ozone layer in the decades to come, according to a new study by researchers in California and Colorado. Future ozone losses from unregulated rocket launches will eventually exceed ozone losses due to chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which stimulated the 1987 Montreal Protocol banning ozone-depleting chemicals, said Martin Ross, chief study author from The Aerospace Corporation in Los Angeles. The study, which includes the University of Colorado at Boulder and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, provides a market analysis for estimating future ozone layer depletion based on the expected growth of the space industry and known impacts of rocket launches. The paper by Ross, Manfred Peinemann of The Aerospace Corporation, CU-Boulder’s Darin Toohey and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s Patrick Ross appeared online in March in the journal Astropolitics. “If left unregulated, rocket launches by the year 2050 could result in more ozone destruction than was ever realized by CFCs. ”—Darin Toohey Solid rocket motors (SRMs) and liquid rocket engines (LREs) deplete the global ozone layer in various capacities. Highly reactive trace-gas molecules known as radicals dominate stratospheric ozone destruction, and a single radical in the stratosphere can destroy up to 10,000 ozone molecules before being deactivated and removed from the stratosphere. Microscopic particles, including soot and aluminum oxide particles emitted by rocket engines, provide chemically active surface areas that increase the rate such radicals leak from their reservoirs and contribute to ozone destruction. In addition, every type of rocket engine causes some ozone loss, and rocket combustion products are the only human sources of ozone-destroying compounds injected directly into the middle and upper stratosphere where the ozone layer resides. The authors estimated global ozone depletion from rockets as a function of payload launch rate and relative mix of SRM and LRE rocket emissions. Currently, global rocket launches deplete the ozone layer ~0. 03%, an insignificant fraction of the depletion caused by other ozone depletion substances (ODSs). However, they note, as the space industry grows and ODSs fade from the stratosphere, ozone depletion from rockets could become significant.<br />

The ozone layer is essential for human life. It is able to absorb much harmful ultraviolet radiation, preventing penetration to the earths surface. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is defined as radiation with wavelengths between 290-320 nanometers, which are harmful to life because this radiation can enter cells and destroy the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of many life forms on planet earth. In a sense, the ozone layer can be thought of as a UV filter or our planets built in sunscreen (Geocities. com, 1998). Without the ozone layer, UV radiation would not be filtered as it reached the surface of the earth. If this happened, cancer would break out and all of the living civilizations, and all species on earth would be in jeopardy (Geocities. com, 1998). Thus, the ozone layer essentially allows life, as we know it, to exist<br />

Making acid rain The residue from ground testing of solid rockets and waste burning of their fuel reacts with water to form acid rain and acid fog. In the dry foothills above San Jose, California, the Chemical Systems Division of United Technologies Corporation (UTQ) burns toxic solid rocket fuel in open pits, while citizens living nearby arc not allowed to bum household garbage or even yard cuttings. The Bay Area Air Quality Board, as well as agencies permitting solid-rocker-fuel burning in other parts of California, Colorado, Utah, and Mississippi, allows the practice because there is no proven, safe alternative. Rocket-fuel pollution is footloose: when activists and officials stopped some UTC fuel burning in San Jose, the company started burning it openly at the Sierra Army Depot, in Herlong, California, north of Lake Tahoe. Even if production of new rockets and fuel stops, the cold-war missile buildup may come back to haunt, and poison. The INF treaty with the Soviet Union actually specified that the United States destroy Pershing II solid rocket motors through open burning or explosive demobrion, which was carried out in the Pueblo Army Depot in Colorado and the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in Texas. The army's Redstone Arsenal, in Huntsville, Alabama, has developed an experimental method to recycle rather than burn off toxic elements of rocket fuel, but to make it practical would require a good deal more support from army and government hinders. Meanwhile, along the wetlands of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, a group called Citizens for a Healthy Environment is distributing skull-and-crossbones bumper stickers as part of its campaign to block NASA's Advanced Solid Rocket Motor program. NASA plans lo test the new rockets at the Stennis Space Center, near Bay St. Louis. Stennis has conducted tests of liquid-fueled rockets since the mid-1960s, but the higher levels of pollution from solid rockets have people worried about health risks as well as damage to the wetlands. NASA initially plans four 2. 25-minute tests of the new motors each year, which are expected to release about 1. 7 million pounds of aluminum oxide, 123,000 pounds of chlorine, and more than a million pounds of hydrogen chloride at the site annually. When the hydrogen chloride mixes with water, it will form up to 3. 2 million pounds of hydrochloric acid each year. NASA proposes to protect the environment by deflecting the exhaust plume upward to dilute its impact, and by testing only under optimum weather conditions.<br />

You can see from Madison’s words that the structure of the United States government very carefully included federally-derived powers. Madison specifies them as fundamental components. At its origin, the national government was dependent on the states, and not vice-versa. When the states shifted their positions, the central government, which rested on top of them, had to move along with them. Understand, this was not a case where the national government was supposed to shift along with the states – there was literally no other possibility. An analogy would be the surface of the ocean moving up and down as a wave passes. The national government rode on top of the federal arrangement – when and where it moved, the national government automatically followed – like the surface of the ocean moving with a wave. There was nothing else it could do or be. Madison did this on purpose. It was the central controlling and protecting mechanism of his design. Here is what Thomas Jefferson had to say about the original federal structure of government in the US: Thomas Jefferson – Letter to William Johnson 1823 The Capital and leading object of the Constitution was to leave with the States all the authorities which respected their own citizens only, and to transfer to the United States those which respected citizens of foreign or other States; to make us several (separate) as to ourselves but one as to all others. Jefferson, as usual, understood the essence of the arrangement: Separate among ourselves, but as one toward the rest of the world – the outsiders who only saw the surface of the wave, not the waters underneath. Jefferson (who was certainly not alone in this) saw the centralizing movement of power from the states to the capital as the great threat to the American experiment of liberty: Thomas Jefferson – Letter to Nathaniel Macon, 1821 Our government is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction. That is: by consolidation first, and then corruption, its necessary consequence.<br />

Small state federalism is a big part of what keeps the peace in countries like the United States and Switzerland. It is a big part of the reason why we do not have a Bosnia or a Northern Ireland or a Basque country or a Chechnya or a Corsica or a Quebec problem. American federalism in the end is not a trivial matter or a quaint historical anachronism. American-style federalism is a thriving and vital institutional arrangement - partly planned by the Framers, partly the accident of history - and it prevents violence and war. It prevents religious warfare, it prevents secessionist warfare, and it prevents racial warfare. It is part of the reason why democratic majoritarianism in the United States has not produced violence or secession for 130 years, unlike the situation for example, in England, France, Germany, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Cyprus, or Spain. There is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that is more important or that has done more to promote peace, prosperity, and freedom than the federal structure of that great document. There is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that should absorb more completely the attention of the U.S. Supreme Court.<br />

<br />
Under the National Environmental Protection Act of 1969, federal agencies [*297] must undertake an environmental assessment to identify the potential environmental consequences of any &quot;major federal action.&quot; Most proposed major federal actions require an agency to conduct an environmental assessment n87 at an early planning stage. n88 If the environmental assessment results in a &quot;finding of a significant impact,&quot; which means that the action has the potential to significantly affect the environment, the relevant federal agency must produce an environmental impact statement (&quot;EIS&quot;). n89 These EISs include detailed information on the environmental impacts of the proposed action, the alternatives to the proposed action, and any available mitigation measures. In addition, in analyzing project alternatives, agencies must consider the purpose of the project and then what might constitute reasonable alternatives given the project's purpose. n90 The NEPA urges agencies to &quot;use all practicable means&quot; to &quot;restore and enhance&quot; the environment and &quot;avoid or minimize any possible adverse effects of their actions upon the quality of the human environment.&quot; n91 In addition to generating environmental review for agency actions, the NEPA also includes a dictate for legislative environmental impact statements. n92 Not all legislation is subject to this requirement; only those bills or legislative proposals &quot;developed by or with the significant cooperation and support of a Federal agency&quot; must comply. n93 Otherwise, Congress, the judiciary, and the president are exempted from the NEPA's requirements. n94 The NEPA's purpose is to yield better agency decisions. n95 The drafters intended the NEPA to be an action-forcing statute--agencies must justify any deviations to the public. n96 In order to accomplish its purpose, the Council on Environmental Quality directs agencies to focus &quot;on the issues that are truly significant to the action in question, rather than amass[] needless detail.&quot; n97 Thus, the NEPA seeks to provide high-quality information that includes &quot;accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public scrutiny.&quot; n98 In order to achieve this mission, the NEPA directs agencies to: write in plain language, n99 follow a clear format for EISs, n100 and emphasize the [*298] portions useful to decision-makers and the public. n101 Draft EISs must discuss &quot;all major points of view on the environmental impacts of the alternatives including the proposed action,&quot; including those alternatives &quot;not within the jurisdiction of the lead agency&quot; and &quot;the alternative of no action.&quot; n102 The discussion of environmental impacts must include both direct and indirect effects as well as means to mitigate adverse environmental impacts. n103 Most importantly, agencies must issue a record of decision before taking any action that has an adverse environmental impact or that would limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. n104<br />

<br />
If significant impacts on the environment are indicated, the agency then issues a &quot;notice of intent&quot; and determines the proper scope of impacts to be considered and the level of action alternatives that are to be explored. n16 This process is important because it determines not only the &quot;breadth&quot; of environmental impacts, but also the presumed extent and reach of the project and its connections with other actions. An environmental impact statement must provide sufficient information for a decision maker to consider the environmental impacts of a project; it must also examine alternatives to the action. n17 At this stage, public hearings or opportunities to comment in writing are usually held to include public input into the &quot;scoping document.&quot; n18<br />

<br />
NEPA serves a critical policymaking function. It requires federal agencies that submit recommendations or reports on legislative proposals to prepare [*202] an environmental impact statement (EIS) before the enactment of any &quot;legislation and all other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment . . . .&quot; n5 However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has submitted recommendations to Congress on successive Farm Bills and implemented the legislation for nearly forty years with only scattered, segmented gestures at NEPA compliance. At the same time, the scope and ecological impact of the Farm Bills have swelled in recent decades, making the need for NEPA analysis increasingly urgent. Initiated to assist recovery from the agricultural depression following World War I and the Dust Bowl that followed, the Farm Bills have gradually taken on the nature of an entitlement that the Congressional Budget Office estimates will cost $ 289 billion from 2008 through 2012. n6 Policymakers and taxpayers from across the ideological spectrum have questioned whether this is a worthwhile use of such enormous governmental resources. n7 Subjecting the Farm Bill to the EIS process will provide part of that answer.<br />

We just ran an ableist word profile on the word “crazy,” written by the lovely guest poster RMJ, who discussed how the term is used in a variety of contexts and situations. This follow up is sparked by what I’ve seen as a recent resurgence here in the United States in use of the term in a political context, to describe or characterize an individual with a particular set of political views. Every time I see it, it grates on me, and I thought it was worth a focused discussion here at FWD. Before I begin, I should make clear that I personally identify as “crazy” sometimes. Not always, but when the depression gets overwhelming and I can tell my thoughts are getting tangled, or especially when I’m in the grips of a manic episode. (More accurately, I identify as a “crazy bitch,” but that’s neither here nor there.) I’ve also been consistently described by others as “crazy,” in contexts ranging from affectionate to outright hostile and dismissive. So when I see this term tossed around in the media, it feels personal to me. And it’s been tossed around a whole lot lately, largely by traditionally liberal or progressive media outlets. I first started seeing it show up at Talking Points Memo, Josh Marshall’s blog that combines “breaking news, investigative reporting and smart analysis.” Marshall doesn’t mention it on the site, but it also contains a big heaping spoonful of ableism with that political analysis. Here are some recent examples: Crazy Aunt, Unleashed – about Sarah Palin Mainstreaming the Crazy – lamenting the Right’s reaction to Obama speaking to schoolchildren about health reform, and implying that the fringe “crazy” element of the party had infected the mainstream Meet the Crazy Caucus – a listing of Republican congresspeople who espouse “crazy” views and are implied to have a caucus, equivalent to existing formalized congressional caucus groups Postcards From the Crazy – about Frank Gaffney Crazy Arizona – about the recent immigration law and other racial laws passed in the state Crazy 101 – about the Texas revisions to history textbooks This is just a sampling of the posts with headlines including the term “crazy” and is not at all comprehensive. Even within this sample, we can see that the term is used to describe viewpoints with which TPM does not agree (like revising history textbooks or arguing, like Gaffney, that the Pentagon logo indicates a secret plan to subject the United States to Shariah law) and thinks are biased, bigoted, racist, or otherwise offensive (such as the protests about Obama speaking to schoolchildren or the racial laws in Arizona). None of the posts, though, engage or critique those viewpoints or speakers in a substantive way – simply describing them as “crazy” is seen as self-evident and no further discussion is needed to demonstrate these views or people should be excluded from reasonable political discussion. There’s been an even more recent explosion of use of the term to describe Rand Paul and Paul’s views, after he won a Republican congressional primary in Kentucky.1 Paul favors the free market and freedom of private business, to the extent that he seems to believe that anti-discrimination laws are an unreasonable restriction on businesses. Now I am no fan of Mr. Paul – and wrote about my problems with him previously on FWD – but that doesn’t mean I approve of political cartoons like this: A political cartoon portrays Rand Paul as the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland. Added to the original Tenniel illustration are a 'Don't Tread on Me' flag, a Rand Paul button, and an I Heart BP button. To my mind, characterizing Rand as “mad” or “crazy” and not saying anything further is a lazy way to dismiss him and his ideology without actually having to engage with it. There is a lot to say about Rand’s ideas: how prioritizing private business over human rights preserves existing institutional structures that will continue to perpetuate racism, sexism, ableism, and other oppression if not checked by a larger force like the government; how the line between private and public realms is a lot fuzzier and less distinct than Paul implies it to be; that the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and BP’s seemingly inadequate safety protections and near complete inability to effectively respond are strong indications that business will prioritize profits over public goods like environmental safety; how an attitude of business before anything else will influence Rand’s views on everything from the minimum wage to immigration policy to climate control to internet neutrality. Those are all important discussions to have, discussions where we can’t assume that everyone in the audience will come down on the same side, but calling him “crazy” or “mad” and leaving it at that elides all of those complicated issues. Even more strongly, it implies that those discussions are not even worth having because it is so evident that the views or person being dismissed are wrong and absurd and laughable. In Newsweek, Conor Friesdorf made an interesting observation about the policies and people who are dismissed as “crazy”: Forced to name the “craziest” policy favored by American politicians, I’d say the multibillion-dollar war on drugs, which no one thinks is winnable. Asked about the most “extreme,” I’d cite the invasion of Iraq, a war of choice that has cost many billions of dollars and countless innocent lives. The “kookiest” policy is arguably farm subsidies for corn, sugar, and tobacco—products that people ought to consume less, not more. These are contentious judgments. I hardly expect the news media to denigrate the policies I’ve named, nor do I expect their Republican and Democratic supporters to be labeled crazy, kooky, or extreme. These disparaging descriptors are never applied to America’s policy establishment, even when it is proved ruinously wrong, whereas politicians who don’t fit the mainstream Democratic or Republican mode, such as libertarians, are mocked almost reflexively in these terms, if they are covered at all. What I conclude from that is that the media doesn’t consistently use “crazy” and other ableist terms to refer to absurd policies or those that lack rational support, but instead reserves those terms for people outside of mainstream politics. Which in turn implies that the term is used primarily to further marginalize and dismiss people who don’t fit expectations of what a politician is or what are common or popular political arguments. To me, this is even more evidence that the implicit subtext of terming a person or policy “crazy” is “shut up and go away, or start blending in better.” Which, again, is exactly the message leveled at people with mental illness when they’re called “crazy” or “loony” or “unhinged” or any number of synonyms. This selective usage is even more reason the term “crazy” shouldn’t be used in the political context – partly because it’s a lazy out for commentators who refuse to engage with the actual policy issues or political ideas being proposed on a substantive level, and partly because it fiercely underlines and reinforces marginalization and dismissal of people with mental illness. It reminds me that when people call me “crazy,” what they really mean is “stop existing in my consciousness – either disappear or become normal.” To see progressive writers and organizations rely on the marginalization of people with mental illness to score easy points against unpopular politicians is upsetting not only because of their perpetuation of ableism, but also because it puts me in the extremely uncomfortable position of defending people like Palin and Paul against this kind of criticism.<br />

<br />
If you are feeling a little bit of resistance, here, I'd ask you to think about it. If perhaps what I am saying feels like a burden -- too much to take on? a restriction on your carefree speech? -- perhaps that feeling can also serve as an indicator of how pervasive and thus important the issue is. As a community, we've accepted that commonly used words can be slurs, and as a rule, we avoid them, hopefully in the name of principle, but sometimes only in the name of civility. Do you go around using derivatives of the b*ch word? If you do, I bet you check which community you are in.... Same thing for the N word. These days, depending on your age, you might say something is retarded or spastic, but you probably never say that it's gay. I'd like to suggest that society as a whole has not paid the same kind of attention to disabled people's concerns about language. By not paying attention to the literal value, the very real substantive, physical, psychological, sensory, and emotional experiences that come with these linguistic moves, we have created a negative rhetorical climate. In this world, it is too easy for feminists and people of colour to base their claims on argumentative strategies that depend, as their signature moves, on marginalizing the experience of disabled people and on disparaging their appearance and bodies. Much of the blogosphere discourse of the previous weeks has studied the relationships between race, (white) feminism and feminists, andWOCbloggers. To me, the intellectual takeaway has been an emerging understanding of how, in conversation, notions of appropriation, citation, ironization, and metaphorization can be deployed as strategies of legitimation and exclusion. And, as a result, I question how &quot;oppressed, minoritized&quot; groups differentiate themselves from other groups in order to seek justice and claim authority. Must we always define ourselves in opposition and distance to a minoritized and oppressed group that can be perceived as even more unsavory than the one from which one currently speaks? As I watched the discussion about who among the feminist and WOC bloggers has power and authority and how that is achieved, I began to recognise a new power dynamic both on the internet and in the world at large. Feminism takes on misogyny. The WOC have been engaging feminism. But from my point of view, a wide variety of powerful feminist and anti-racist discourse is predicated on negative disability stereotyping. There's a kind of hierarchy here: the lack of awareness about disability, disability culture and identity, and our civil rights movement has resulted in a kind of domino effect where disability images are the metaphor of last resort: the bottom, the worst. Disability language has about it a kind of untouchable quality -- as if the horror and weakness of a disabled body were the one true, reliable thing, a touchstone to which we can turn when we know we can't use misogynistic or racist language. When we engage in these kinds of argumentative strategies, we exclude a whole population of people whose histories are intricately bound up with ours. When we deploy these kinds of strategies to underscore the value of our own existence in the world, we reaffirm and strengthen the systems of oppression that motivated us to speak out in the first place.<br />

In a related move, critics of political correctness, despite their power and majority within universities and their pages and pages of media attention, insist that their voices have been &quot;silenced.&quot;229 The anatomy of oppression as silenc¬ing and the project of claiming voice as an act of liberation originated in and continues to animate feminist, anti-racist and lesbian and gay scholarship.230 The metaphor comprehends both the manufactured invisibility of subordinated peo¬ples from cultural and political history manifest, for instance, in William F. Buckley's assertion that &quot;from Homer to the nineteenth century no great book has emerged from any non-European source,&quot;231 and the literal silence of those who know the dangers of talking back in the context of unequal power. Striving to be seen and not heard; seeming sullen, servile, deferential, obsequious or stu¬pid; failing to report harassment or rape — all these are spirit-destroying options visiting contempt on subordinated classes, but they may be less self-destructive than being lynched, gassed, battered, bashed or electroshocked, or merely fired, demoted, denied tenure, failed or expelled.<br />
In labelling the silenced the silencers, anti-PC literature simultaneously creates a false symmetry between powerholders and those they disempower and a hierarchy of injury elevating the interests of the powerful above those of the disempowered. By insisting that calling someone a racist is as intimidating, chilling of speech and harmful to education as being racist, racism becomes an idea whose articulation becomes dissent.<br />

Anti-PC literature and its extraordinary proliferation make sense only if you start from the premise that systemic inequality is a myth propagated by its victims and/or that the privileged should be unaccountable for the harms they do and from which they benefit.<br />
If, as I do, you start from the premise that the systemic sexual, racial and economic inequalities which structure Canadian and American society have been empirically documented, you have to marvel at this portrait of powerholders as egos so frail that they will silently yield power rather than risk being called racist or sexist, even with justification. I think of pervasive violence against women and children, of slavery and its aftermath, of the residential schools and system of adoption that nearly exterminated First Nations cultures and the lack of jobs, adequate shelter and running water that threatens survivors, of the growing numbers of the working poor, unemployed and homeless and food banks in a decade of tax reform benefiting the rich, of gay bashing and les¬bian custody battles. I also think of the under-representation of white women, people of colour and out lesbians and gay men on police forces, in higher edu¬cation, in government, in corporate decision-making. I think of Bonnie Robi-chaud, Anita Hill, Rodney King, Wade Lawson, Harvey Milk, Patricia Ireland, Donald Marshall, Tawana Brawley, Sofia Cooke, Jane Stafford, the literally countless prostitutes missing and presumed dead — all their kin, violated, dis¬credited and/or dead from racial and/or (hetero)sexual violence. Then I think that if the worst that can happen to white or male or heterosexual or rich or tem-porarily able people is that someone calls them on their conscious or uncon¬scious prejudices, or expects them to study histories and texts which correct par¬tial truths of liberal progress, or abstain from expressing subordinating &quot;jokes,&quot; then privilege is privileged indeed. To endorse the rhetoric or content of anti-PC literature, whether silently or openly, is to endorse a particular politics premised upon status inequalities and their maintenance. It is to endorse democratic double-talk perpetuating the second-class status of real people deemed formally equal only so long as they acquiesce in their own subordination.<br />

I know that people who make a living with words are understandably emotionally attached to their cherished metaphors - the beloved tools of their craft. Metaphors are an economical way to give language punch, to stimulate interest and emotions and, to sell papers. So when Mr. Harper and Mr. Dion talk past each other in Question Period, it is hard to resist the temptation to call it a &quot;dialogue of the deaf.&quot; That not only evokes a powerful image but also reignites a collective sub-conscious memory of the deaf and dumb as sub-human primates who can't hear, speak or think. But times change and the wordsmiths will have to find new ways to get their message across. We have survived the move away from language based on gender, race and religion. Just because people with a disability are not as powerful as some of these other groups, only creates a greater responsibility on those who control the media.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The decisionmaking paradigm inherent in the traditional forms of political engagement engages in an unconscious exercise of power over the self which regulates discourse and produces for itself legitimate methods for engagement which never result in change.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kulynych, 97</span>, Winthrop U Prof of Polysci (Jessica, “Performing Politics: Foucault, Habermas, and Postmodern Participation, Polity, Vol. 30, No. 2 (Winter, 1997), 315-346, accessed Jstor)<br />
While separately both Habermas and Foucault challenge the traditional understanding of participation, their combined insights further and irrevocably extend that challenge. Theoretical focus on the distinctions between Habermas and Foucault has all too often obscured important parallels between these two theorists. Specifically, the Habermas-Foucault debate has underemphasized the extent to which Habermas also describes a disciplinary society. In his descriptions of bureaucracy, technocracy, and system colonization, Habermas is also describing a world where power is productive and dispersed and where political action is constrained and normalized. Habermas, like Foucault, describes a type of power that cannot be adequately characterized in terms of the intentions of those who possess it. Colonization is not the result of conscious intention, but is rather the unintended consequence of a multitude of small adjustments. The gender and racial subtexts infusing the system are not the results of conscious intention, but rather of implicit gender and racial norms and expectations infecting the economy and the state. Bureaucratic power is not a power that is possessed by any individual or agency, but exists in the exercise of decisionmaking. As Iris Young points out, we must &quot;analyze the exercise of power [in contemporary societies] as the effect of often liberal and humane practices of education, bureaucratic administration, production and distribution of consumer goods, medicine and so on.&quot;' The very practices that Habermas chronicles are exemplary of a power that has no definitive subject. As Young explains, &quot;the conscious actions of many individuals daily contribute to maintaining and reproducing oppression, but those people are simply doing their jobs or living their lives, and do not understand themselves as agents of oppression.&quot;8 Colonization and bureaucratization also fit the pattern of a power that is not primarily repressive but productive. Disciplinary technologies are, as Sawicki describes, not... repressive mechanisms ... [that] operate primarily through violence ... or seizure ... but rather [they operate] by producing new objects and subjects of knowledge, by inciting and channeling desires, generating and focusing individual and group energies, and establishing bodily norms and techniques for observing, monitoring and controlling bodily movements, processes, and capacities.9 The very practices of administration, distribution, and decisionmaking on which Habermas focuses his attention can and must be analyzed as productive disciplinary practices. Although these practices can clearly be repressive, their most insidious effects are productive. Rather than simply holding people back, bureaucratization breaks up, categorizes, and systemizes projects and people. It creates new categories of knowledge and expertise. Bureaucratization and colonization also create new subjects as the objects of bureaucratic expertise. The social welfare client and the consumer citizen are the creation of bureaucratic power, not merely its target. The extension of lifeworld gender norms into the system creates the possibility for sexual harassment, job segregation, parental leave, and consensual corporate decisionmaking. Created as a part of these subjectivities are new gestures and norms of bodily behavior, such as the embarrassed shuffling of food stamps at the grocery checkout and the demeaning sexual reference at the office copier. Bodily movements are monitored and regularized by means of political opinion polls, welfare lists, sexual harassment protocols, flex-time work schedules, and so forth. Modern disciplinary power, as described by Foucault and implied by Habermas, does not merely prevent us from developing, but creates us differently as the effect of its functioning. These disciplinary techniques not only control us, but also enable us to be more efficient and more productive, and often more powerful. Focusing on the disciplinary elements of the Habermasian critique opens the door for exploring the postmodern character of Habermasian politics. Because Habermas does describe a disciplinary world, his prescription for contemporary democracy (discursive politics) ought to be sensitive to, and appropriate for, a disciplinary world. Foucault's sensitivity to the workings of disciplinary power is central to the articulation of a plausible, postmodern version of discursive politics. In the following discussion I will argue for a performative redefinition of participation that will reinvigorate the micro-politics demanded by Foucault, as well as provide a more nuanced version of the discursive politics demanded by Habermas.<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Role playing as authoritative institutions underrates the responsibility we have within our daily lives preventing change. The Aff plan text demands we be spectators to world events which makes all impacts inevitable, as well as causes us to shift the blame of violence on to foreign governments and terrorist groups as opposed to finding the violence within ourselves.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kappeler 95</span> (Susanne, Associate Professor at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The politics of personal behavior, Pg.10-11)<br />
Yet our insight that indeed we are not responsible for the decisions of a Serbian general or a Croatian president tends to mislead us into thinking that therefore we have no responsibility at all, not even for forming our own judgment, and thus into underrating the responsibility we do have within our own sphere of action. In particular, it seems to absolve us from having to try to see any relation between our own actions and those events, or to recognize the connections between those political decisions and our own personal decisions. It not only shows that we participate in what Beck calls ‘organized irresponsibility’, upholding the apparent lack of connection between bureaucratically, institutionally, nationally, and also individually organized separate competences. It also proves the phenomenal and unquestioned alliance of our personal thinking with the thinking of the major power mongers. For we tend to think that we cannot ‘do’ anything, say, about a war, because we deem ourselves to be in the wrong situation because we are not where the major decisions are made. Which is why many of those not yet entirely disillusioned with politics tend to engage in a form of mental deputy politics, in the style of ‘what would I do if I were the general, the prime minister, the president, the foreign minister or the minister of defense?’ Since we seem to regard their mega spheres of action as the only worthwhile and truly effective ones, and since our political analyses tend to dwell there first of all, any question of what I would do if I were indeed myself tends to peter out in the comparative insignificance of having what is perceived as ‘virtually no possibilities’: what I could do seems petty and futile. For my own action I obviously desire the range of action of a general, a prime minister, or a General Secretary of the UN – finding expression in ever more prevalent formulations like ‘I want to stop this war’, ‘I want military intervention’, ‘I want to stop this backlash’, or ‘I want a moral revolution. ‘We are this war’, however, even if we do not command the troops or participate in co-called peace talks, namely as Drakulic says, in our non-comprehension’: our willed refusal to feel responsible for our own thinking and for working out our own understanding, preferring innocently to drift along the ideological current of prefabricated arguments or less than innocently taking advantage of the advantages these offer. And we ‘are’ the war in our ‘unconscious cruelty towards you’, our tolerance of the ‘fact that you have a yellow form for refugees and I don’t’- our readiness, in other words, to build identities, one for ourselves and one for refugees, one of our own and one for the ‘others.’ We share in the responsibility for this war and its violence in the way we let them grow inside us, that is, in the way we shape ‘our feelings, our relationships, our values’ according to the structures and the values of war and violence.<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Their interpretation of fiat endorses an impovershed view of the state by portraying it as a homogenous entity capable of acting in predictable, rational ways. This neglects that the state is comprised of a multitude of personalities with competing institutional priorities and goals.</span><br />
<strong>Claude, ’88</strong> (Prof. of Gov. and Foreign Affairs, U of VA, States and the Global System, p. 18)<br />
<br />
This view of the state as an institutional monolith is fostered by the notion of sovereignty, which calls up the image of the monarch, presiding majestically over his kingdom. Sovereignty emphasizes the singularity of the state, its monopoly of authority, its unity of command and its capacity to speak with one voice. Thus, France wills, Iran demands, China intends, New Zealand promises and the Soviet Union insists. One all too easily conjures up the picture of a single-minded and purposeful state that decides exactly what it wants to achieve, adopts coherent policies intelligently adapted to its objectives, knows what it is doing, does what it intends and always has its act together. This view of the state is reinforced by political scientists’ emphasis upon the concept of policy and upon the thesis that governments derive policy from calculations of national interest. We thus take it for granted that states act internationally in accordance with rationality conceived and consciously constructed schemes of action, and we implicitly refuse to consider the possibility that alternatives to policy-directed behavior may have importance – alternatives such as random, reactive, instinctual, habitual and conformist behaviour. Our rationalistic assumption that states do what they have planned to do tends to inhibit the discovery that states sometimes do what they feel compelled to do, or what they have the opportunity to do, or what they have usually done, or what other states are doing, or whatever the line of least resistance would seem to suggest.<br />
Academic preoccupation with the making of policy is accompanied by academic neglect of the execution of policy. We seem to assume that once the state has calculated its interest and contrived a policy to further that interest, the carrying out of policy is the virtually automatic result of the routine functioning of the bureaucratic mechanism of the state. I am inclined to call this the Genesis theory of public administration, taking as my text the passage: ‘And God said, Let there be light; and there was light’. I suspect that in the realm of government, policy execution rarely follows so promptly and inexorably from policy statement. Alternatively, one may dub it the Pooh-Bah/Ko-Ko theory, honouring those denizens of William S. Gilbert’s Japan who took the position that when the Mikado ordered that something be done it was as good as done and might as well be declared to have been done.<br />

 <br />
The myth of the nation-state imposes false unity on culturally diverse countries like so-called India which reduces the individual and reifies the state allowing genocide and violence. Indo-Pak war as a justification for action is false.<br />

[Martin W. and Karen E, Assistant Research Professors of Geography and Ass. Prof. of History, Duke, “They Myth of Continents: A Critique of Metageography, p. xxiii-xxvi, GAL]<br />
Similarly simplistic assumptions are also encountered at other levels of geographical analysis. After the myth of continents and the fable of an enduring East-West division, the most debilitating geographical misconception is probably the myth of the nation-state. The nation-state idea-i.e., the assumption that cultural identities (nations) coincide with politically sovereign entities (states) to create a series of internally unified and essentially equal units-replicates at a smaller scale many of the errors found in continental thinking. To be sure, countries, unlike continents, are real entities, with armies to prove the point. For this reason alone, the global framework of sovereign states is essential for analyzing political affairs. But very few countries are nation-states in the strict sense of the term; seldom is an independent political territory coterminous with the territory of a self-consciously united people. That we elect to call such internally divided countries as India, Nigeria, or even Switzerland nation-states shows a determined desire to will uniformity out of diversity. In the process, states-like continents-become reified as natural and fundamental building blocks of global geography, rather than being recognized as the constructed, contingent, and often imposed political-geographical units that they are. The inevitable result is that state boundaries are evoked in innumerable arenas where their usefulness is truly circumscribed. Features of the natural world seldom conform to political terrains, and even patterns of human culture more often than not crosscut country boundaries. In few parts of the world, for example, does a map of language distribution bear much resemblance to the political map, and only in exceptional areas like Japan or Iceland do the two correlate more or less precisely. (Moreover, in the case of Japan, it has required centuries of concerted state effort to make them correspond.) Yet most of our encyclopedias, textbooks, atlases, and almanacs portray states as holistic entities, unified and distinct. While this may seem an innocuous device for classifying knowledge, it can lead to real mischief when its limitations are ignored. A country like Sudan is simply not a basic unit of the human community, despite its ubiquitous portrayal as such; northern Sudan has far more in common with Egypt than it does with Southern Sudan, which has a greater affinity with Uganda. To assume that northern and southern Sudan form a “Sudanese nation,” as the myth of the nation-state leads us to do, is to reduce the struggle currently being waged there to the status of a civil war-an internal affair that need not concern the global community to any great extent. In fact, the Sudanese war is a rather clear case of one people (those in the north) brutally attempting to impose its will on another. Clearly, countries do not cohere on all the levels we commonly imagine. At its best, the myth of the nation-state obscures internal difference. At its worst, it can become a tool of genocide.<br />

(Louis Rene, Prof of International Law at Purdue, Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law, Spring)<br />
The State requires its members to be serviceable instruments, suppressing every glimmer of creativity and imagination in the interest of a plastic mediocrity. Even political liberty within particular States does nothing to encourage opposition to war or to genocide in other States. Since &quot;patriotic self-sacrifice&quot; is demanded even of &quot;free&quot; peoples, the expectations of inter-State competition may include war and the mass killing of other peoples. In the final analysis, war and genocide are made possible by the surrender of Self to the State. Given that the claims of international law 35 are rendered [*14] impotent by Realpolitik, this commitment to so-called power politics is itself an expression of control by the herd. Without such control, individuals could discover authentic bases of personal value inside themselves, depriving the State of its capacity to make corpses of others. The herd controls not through the vulgar fingers of politics but by the more subtle hands of Society. Living without any perceptible rewards for innerdirection, most people have discovered the meaning of all their activity in what they seek to exchange for pleasure. Hence, meaning is absorbed into the universal exchange medium, money, and anything that enlarges this medium is treated as good. According to this model, finality of life is not, as Miguel de Unamuno wrote, &quot;to make oneself a soul,&quot; 36 but rather to justify one's &quot;success&quot; to the herd. Instead of seeking to structure what Simone Weil, who was strongly influenced by Unamuno, calls &quot;an architecture within the soul,&quot; we build life upon the foundations of death. Thus does humankind nurture great misfortune. The Talmud tells us: &quot;The dust from which the first man was made was gathered in all the corners of the world.&quot; 37 Seizing this wisdom, people everywhere must begin to move toward generous new visions of planetary identity. Shorn of the dreadful misunderstanding that people can exist only amid the death struggles of competing herds, the residents of Earth could escape from the dark side of national self-determination 38 and recover an overriding cosmopolitanism that brings self-affirmation and safety.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">A. Their depiction of United States “benevolent hegemony” is massively ignorant of history and legitimizes the third American holocaust. Kagan promotes a framework of American universal American history which terminates the being of all others and leads to the end of social progress. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sardar &amp; Wyn Davies ‘4</span> [Ziauddin, Visiting Professor, the School of Arts, The City University, London, Chair – Muslim Institute; Merryl, Welsh Muslim anthropologist; American Terminator: Myths, Movies, and Global Power p211]<br />
Consider, for example, Michael Ignatieff, the Canadian apologist for American imperialism and Professor at Harvard University, who describes the American Empire as a new kind of 'burden': 'America's empire is not like empires of times past, built on colonies, conquest and the white man's burden. We are no longer in the era of the United Fruit Company, when American corporations needed the Marines to secure their investments overseas. The 21st century imperium is a new invention in the annals of political science, an empire lite, a global hegemony whose grace notes are free markets, human rights and democracy.' The new burden means that the US is 'the only nation that polices the world throughout five global military commands; maintains more than a million men and women at arms on four continents; deploys carrier battle groups on watch in every ocean, guarantees the survival of countries from Israel to South Korea; drives the wheels of global trade and commerce; and fills the hearts and minds of an entire planet with its dreams and desires'. So the empire may now be 'lite', but it is still a universal soldier and does what good old heavy empires always did: occupies foreign lands, rapes their economies and cripples their minds! Apart from being 'lite', the empire is also 'benevolent'. In a much-quoted article in Foreign Policy, Robert Kagan, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, declared that 'the truth about America's dominant role in the world is known to most clear-eyed international observers'. And it is this: 'the benevolent hegemony exercised by the United States is good for a vast portion of the world's population.' A world without US hegemony, he suggests, would be more violent, more chaotic, less democratic and economically stagnant. And he spells out 'the unique qualities of American global dominance': despite overwhelming military and economic superiority, the American people chose not to 'set the crown of world empire on their brows'; instead, they chose a 'strategy to risk nuclear annihilation on [their] otherwise unthreatened homeland in order to deter attack, either nuclear or conventional, on a European or Asian ally'. Moreover, 'the identification of the interests of others with its own has been the most striking quality of American foreign and defence policy'. Americans may be self-interested, selfish, arrogant, and occasionally ham-handed, 'but excusez-moi'; Kagan asks in a mocking tone: “compared with whom? Can anyone believe that were France to possess the power the United States now has, the French would be less arrogant, less selfish, and less prone to making mistakes? Little in France's history as a great power, or even as a medium power, justifies such optimism. Nor can one easily imagine power on an American scale being employed in a more enlightened fashion by China, Germany, Japan, or Russia. And even the leaders of that least benighted of empires, the British, were more arrogant, more bloodyminded, and, in the end, less capable managers of world affairs than the inept Americans have so far proved to be. If there is to be a sole superpower, the world is better off if that power is the United States.&quot; So, what can we expect in this wonderful world of benign American power? Kagan suggests quite explicitly that America should not hesitate in drawing its mighty sword and slaying anything and anyone that gets in its way. Like the deranged villain in Universal Soldier, he laughs out loud at Europe and her multilateralism. A Europe that has achieved integration peacefully and multilaterally, by negotiations and without militarism, has moved 'beyond power into a self-contained world of laws and rules and transnational negotiations and cooperation', and thus has no understanding of the brute realism of empire-building. In contrast to Kant's 'Perpetual Peace' that is the lot of Europe, Kagan suggests in Paradise and Power, the United States is all about taming an anarchic Hobbesian world where war is a necessity. America is thus ever ready to visit violence to any corner of the world both to maintain and to expand its empire.' What both Ignatieff and Kagan amply demonstrate is a monumental ignorance of history. As Sidney Lens notes in reference to Ignatieff: 'only someone blind to the history of the United States, its obsessive drive for control of oil, its endless expansion of military bases around the world, its domination of other countries through its enormous economic power, its violations of the human rights of millions of people, whether directly or through proxy governments, could make that statement.&quot; Robert Jensen, Associate Professor of Journalism at the University of Texas in Austin, describes 'benevolent empire' as the 'third American holocaust' (the first two being the genocide of Native Americans and slavery), the product of a foreign policy that is 'relentlessly barbaric'.&quot; But something very specific is at work in Ignatieff and Kagan's views; something that we also find in Paul Berman's notion of 'liberal imperialism's and Stanley Kurtz's 'Democratic Imperialism' ,9 as well as in the works of a string of right- and left-wing champions of the American Empire.&quot;? And that something is the deterministic re-formulation of history in the universal soldier framework. History - of democracy, liberalism, cultures, civilisations and great powers - is being presented as universal destiny: the histories of all nations and peoples, states and empires, merge into the universal narrative of American history and culminate to produce a global, benevolent American Empire. This is what the world was created for. This is the sum of all human experience. This is the aggregate of all the yesterdays of humanity. This is the theory that Philip Bobbitt tries to demonstrate in his monumental study The Shield of Achilles.1I Subtitled 'War, Peace and the Course of History', the book suggests that all the wars of all histories and all the peaceful states of the world produced a 'course of history' that ends up with a very special state: a state that is immensely powerful and democratic and committed to human rights - the global United States of America. It is thus the only power that has not only might but historic right on its side - and hence, can attack any country it wishes. This historic imperative, this natural and universal destiny, also gives the US, says Bobbitt, the right to take pre-emptive action against any nation, and places it above international law. This is the new 'constitutional theory' that Bobbitt wants the rest of the world to embrace. In its most complete and articulate form, this thesis is expressed by Francis Fukuyama in his The End of History and the Last Man. Ignatieff, Kagan, Bobbitt and others are simply borrowing a leaf from Fukuyama, former Deputy Director of the US State Department's Policy Planning Staff and a signatory to the infamous policy paper 'Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century', cobbled together by the neo-conservative think-tank, The Project for the New American Century. Fukuyama developed his thesis immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The end of the Cold War, he argues, not only means the end of Communism, it also signifies the unabashed victory of American economic and political liberalism. American 'liberal democracy', he suggests, is the 'end point of mankind's ideological evolution', the 'final form of human government', and as such constitutes the 'end of history'. From the American Declaration of Independence onwards, there has been a trend towards democratic governance that demonstrates that there is 'a silent and mysterious inner process at work' underneath the perturbations of history, somewhat similar to the 'invisible hand' of the market. This suggests that: “There is a fundamental process at work that dictates a common evolutionary pattern for all human societies - in short, something like a Universal History of mankind in the direction of liberal democracy. The existence of peaks and troughs in this development is undeniable. But to cite the failure of liberal democracy in any given country, or even in the entire region of the world, as evidence of democracy's overall weakness, reveals a striking narrowness of view. Cycles and discontinuities in themselves are not incompatible with a history that is directional and universal, just as the existence of business cycles does not negate the possibility of long-term economic growth.” 13 Thus, for the past 300 years all histories, all cultures have been evolving, by the sheer force of nature and deterministic history, towards a single goal: to become part and parcel of a universal American narrative. “History was not a blind concatenation of events, but a meaningful whole in which human ideas concerning the nature of a just political and social order developed and played themselves out. And if we are now at a point where we cannot imagine a world substantially different from our own, in which there is no apparent or obvious way in which the future will represent a fundamental improvement over our current order, then we must also take into consideration the possibility that History itself might be at an end.&quot; All of us are thus as free as we will ever get, and the status quo is the best we can ever hope for. The United States of America, with its principles of 'Liberty' and 'Democracy', is the apex of human evolution and all of us are propelled towards the Great Republic. But since 'history' - that is, history of non-Western culture which Fukuyama has cannibalised - incorporates the worldviews of all other people, their value systems, their cultures, what we may call their total modes of being, the termination of history also terminates the very being, the very identities, of all Others. So other people, quite incidental to American 'Universal History', can now be truly declared dead and buried: 'it matters little what strange thoughts occur to people in Albania or Burkina Faso', as their culture is not part of the 'the common ideological heritage of [hu]mankind'.* Indeed, they are not people at all!<br />

Let's take another example. Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman, otherwise very sensible writers, complain that &quot;bombing a desperately poor country under the yoke of a repressive regime is a wrongheaded response [to the &quot;unspeakable acts of violence&quot; committed on Sept. 11]. &quot;The U.S. bombing of Afghanistan should cease immediately,&quot; they say. They discuss three reasons: &quot;1. The policy of bombing increases the risk of further terrorism against the United States. 2. The bombing is intensifying a humanitarian nightmare in Afghanistan. 3. There are better ways to seek justice.&quot; All three statements are true of course, but irrelevant, because seeking justice, avoiding humanitarian nightmares, and reducing the risk of terrorism do not enter into the calculations of US policy makers. Quite the contrary, US policy makers create injustice, humanitarian nightmares, and terrorism, throughout the world, in pursuit of the imperial objective of making profit, and this has been thoroughly documented in thousands of scholarly studies. So for Mokhiber and Weissman to talk in this way, and phrase the problem in this way, exposes their failure to really comprehend the enemy we face, which in turn prevents them from looking for effective strategies to defeat that enemy, like so many other opponents of the &quot;war&quot;. Hence all the moralizing, the bulk of which is definitely directed at the rulers, not at the ruled. That is, it is not an attempt to win over the ruled, but an attempt to win over the rulers. [4] It's what I call the &quot;we should&quot; crowd -- all those people who hope to have a voice in the formation of policy, people whose stances are basically that of consultants to the ruling class. &quot;We&quot; should do this, &quot;we&quot; shouldn't do that, as if they had anything at all to say about what our rulers do. This is the normal stance among the bootlicking intelligentsia of course. But what is it doing among progressives and radicals? Even if their stance is seen to be not exactly that of consultants, but that of citizens making demands upon their government, what makes them think that the government ever listens? I think this attitude -- the &quot;we should&quot; attitude -- is rooted in part at least in the fact that most progressives still believe in nations and governments. They believe that this is &quot;our&quot; country, and that this is &quot;our&quot; government, or at least should be. So Kevin Danaher says that &quot;we should get control of the government.&quot; They identify themselves as Americans, or Germans, or Mexicans, or Swedes. So they are constantly advising and making demands that 'their' government should do this and that. If they would reject nationalism altogether, and states and governments, they could begin to see another way.<br />

Unfortunately for Bradley Thayer, evolutionary arguments do not provide a simple and incontestable ontological and epistemological foundations for revitalized realism. Since arguments like Thayer’s draw on controversial scientific branches of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, which arguably assume the basic features of human nature they seek to prove, the conclusions for political theory remain almost as scientifically arbitrary as Morgenthau’s assumption of an animus dominandi. In framing the problematic of their exploration, many of these arguments assume an individualistic and egoistic human nature and question how political relations might arise out of the mechanical dynamics of self-interest. As Mary Clark’s work demonstrates, this ignores important factors in the evolutionary development of the human being. Since interpersonal, cultural, political ,and social influences have had a large role in shaping the evolution of humans and our primate relatives, it is not such a simple task to explain human nature based on rational actor models and mathematical calculations. In contrast to the sociobiology and evolutionary psychology’s depiction of human nature as biologically determined, Clark argues that it is a society’s construction of a ‘story’ of human nature that affects how people will imagine ways to live together, fulfilling basic human needs or not. Biology is not destiny, she seems to argue, but what we believe about our biology threatens to become our destiny if we allow it. This highlights the possibility that seemingly universal traits like competition, aggression and egoism might be contingent on the weight we lend them and not biologically determined. If we have a choice in the matter, it is possible to begin conceiving of political possibilities for global social orders that do not depend on a combative and competitive engagement with Others. In turn, this allows a reconsideration of the conceptual lens through which to view security. If it is not programmed into our genes to be intolerant, ethnocentric, and aggressive, then we can find ways to abandon the traditions that have normalized such behaviours. Following Jim George and David Campbell, perhaps a new conception of international relationships would serve better than the current paradigm, which is based on traditional views of an aggressive and competitive human nature. It may be that, as Clark suggests, conflict can only be mitigated when basic human needs are met. Doing so, it seems, would require a rethinking of how differences are engaged with, interpreted and reconciled in both international and local societies. If we humans are not biologically destined to draw lines between ourselves and others, then it is possible for us to escape conceptions of security that necessitate aggression against, or protection from, outsiders. Perhaps the security long sought after in international relations will come not from making societies secure from difference, but making difference secure within and between states.<br />

Our “economy” is our system of metabolic exchange, of mediation with one another and with the natural world. Why, we are led to ask, must so many lives be ruined or destroyed in the process? And this is only national, within our own very privileged corner of the First World. The international picture is much bleaker. For it must be cried out, at a time when some have the audacity to neo-evangelize in the name of the ideal of a liberal democracy that has finally realized itself as the ideal of human history: never have violence, inequality, exclusion, famine, and thus economic oppression affected as many human beings in the history of the earth and of humanity. Instead of singing the advent of the ideal of liberal democracy and of the capitalist market in the euphoria of the end of history, instead of celebrating the ‘end of ideologies’ and the end of the great emancipatory discourses, let us never neglect this obvious macroscopic fact, made up of innumerable singular sites of suffering: no degree of progress allows one to ignore that never before, in absolute figures, have so many men, women and children been subjugated, starved or exterminated on the earth.

Assuming we are able to predict who or what are optimized humans, this entire resultant worldview smacks of eugenics and Nazi racial science. This would involve valuing people as means. Moreover, there would always be a superhuman more super than the current ones, humans would never be able to escape their treatment as means to an always further and distant end. This means-ends dispute is at the core of Montagu and Matson's treatise on the dehumanization of humanity. They warn: &quot;its destructive toll is already greater than that of any war, plague, famine, or natural calamity on record -- and its potential danger to the quality of life and the fabric of civilized society is beyond calculation. For that reason this sickness of the soul might well be called the Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse.... Behind the genocide of the holocaust lay a dehumanized thought; beneath the menticide of deviants and dissidents... in the cuckoo's next of America, lies a dehumanized image of man... (Montagu &amp; Matson, 1983, p. xi-xii). While it may never be possible to quantify the impact dehumanizing ethics may have had on humanity, it is safe to conclude the foundations of humanness offer great opportunities which would be foregone. When we calculate the actual losses and the virtual benefits, we approach a nearly inestimable value greater than any tools which we can currently use to measure it. Dehumanization is nuclear war, environmental apocalypse, and international genocide. When people become things, they become dispensable. When people are dispensable, any and every atrocity can be justified. Once justified, they seem to be inevitable for every epoch has evil and dehumanization is evil's most powerful weapon.<br />

Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman, otherwise very sensible writers, complain that &quot;bombing a desperately poor country under the yoke of a repressive regime is a wrongheaded response [to the &quot;unspeakable acts of violence&quot; committed on Sept. 11]. &quot;The U.S. bombing of Afghanistan should cease immediately,&quot; they say. They discuss three reasons: &quot;1. The policy of bombing increases the risk of further terrorism against the United States. 2. The bombing is intensifying a humanitarian nightmare in Afghanistan. 3. There are better ways to seek justice.&quot; All three statements are true of course, but irrelevant, because seeking justice, avoiding humanitarian nightmares, and reducing the risk of terrorism do not enter into the calculations of US policy makers. Quite the contrary, US policy makers create injustice, humanitarian nightmares, and terrorism, throughout the world, in pursuit of the imperial objective of making profit, and this has been thoroughly documented in thousands of scholarly studies. So for Mokhiber and Weissman to talk in this way, and phrase the problem in this way, exposes their failure to really comprehend the enemy we face, which in turn prevents them from looking for effective strategies to defeat that enemy, like so many other opponents of the &quot;war&quot;. Hence all the moralizing, the bulk of which is definitely directed at the rulers, not at the ruled. That is, it is not an attempt to win over the ruled, but an attempt to win over the rulers. [4] It's what I call the &quot;we should&quot; crowd -- all those people who hope to have a voice in the formation of policy, people whose stances are basically that of consultants to the ruling class. &quot;We&quot; should do this, &quot;we&quot; shouldn't do that, as if they had anything at all to say about what our rulers do. This is the normal stance among the bootlicking intelligentsia of course. But what is it doing among progressives and radicals? Even if their stance is seen to be not exactly that of consultants, but that of citizens making demands upon their government, what makes them think that the government ever listens? I think this attitude -- the &quot;we should&quot; attitude -- is rooted in part at least in the fact that most progressives still believe in nations and governments. They believe that this is &quot;our&quot; country, and that this is &quot;our&quot; government, or at least should be. So Kevin Danaher says that &quot;we should get control of the government.&quot; They identify themselves as Americans, or Germans, or Mexicans, or Swedes. So they are constantly advising and making demands that 'their' government should do this and that. If they would reject nationalism altogether, and states and governments, they could begin to see another way.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">There are two models for public intellectuals: We can either emulate expert pundits like Kagan who aim their advice at centers of power or we can be intellectuals like Chomsky- exposing lies and providing the toolkit needed to mobilize for change. Our alternative is not a fiated advocacy to be implemented by policy elites, but a way to lay bare the lies and propaganda advanced by the 1ac, which is an ethically superior approach that provides ordinary citizens with the agency to pursue alternatives.</span><br />

<br />
Although the word 'intellectual' is more frequently used in Europe than in the USA, some thinkers, whether they be academics or think tank researchers, play the part of 'public intellectuals' or policy advisers. Noam Chomsky, the world-famous dissident and persistent critic of American foreign policy, seems to differ radically from Robert Kagan, a neoconservative activist who broadly approves of an interventionist American foreign policy as it is implemented by the Bush administration. These two intellectuals belong to two radically opposed wings of foreign policy thinking and represent two very different intellectual postures. Kagan, like most neoconservatives, is a unilateralist and favors American supremacy; Chomsky is a critic of imperialism or what he calls American hegemony'. Kagan is a journalist, essayist and a think tank pundit, Chomsky a university professor renowned in the field of linguistics and not recognized as a major thinker within the disciplines of political science or history. Kagan is an expounder of American nationalist identity using Europe as a foil whereas Chomsky, who himself repre¬sents a type of public intellectual that is more common in the USA than anywhere else, is a deconstructor of American identities. In a way, they typify two ways of being a politicized intellectual in the USA, two ways of thinking about the nation-state and two strategies about changing the world or the representations of the world that citizens and leaders have. In this article I will analyse these different ways of being an intellec¬tual in the USA by focusing closely on the work of these two emblematic figures, whilst making a few references to other thinkers. Chomsky and Kagan embody very different conceptions of society and two different ways of understanding the link between thought and deed. The two ways of thinking they represent are not the only ones, of course, but if one gets beyond partisan views, they represent two ideal types of the intellectual in society. I do not wish to focus on individuals and their personalities, nor to present Manichaean, and therefore simplis¬tic, oppositions between the professor and the pundit, the left-wing thinker and the right-wing one or the conservative and the liberal. This would be erroneous, not only because these categories do not fit exactly the two thinkers chosen but also because the two ideal types are somewhat unrelated to the ideological stances of Kagan and Chomsky. Yet, in order to discuss these ideal types I will have to deal with the specific writings of these two thinkers. It would have been more possible to contrast Chomsky with Kissinger; then the opposition would have been between two professors famous in Massachusetts and beyond, not between a prof and a pundit.1 At least Kagan's occasional bluntness shows that, as the English say, his mouth is closer to where his money is. Some intellectuals on the right or who describe themselves as conservatives, such as Andrew Bacevich, for instance, or a critic of Chomsky like Richard Posner, are closer to Chomsky in terms of ideal types, or of the definition of their roles in society and vis¬a-vis the nation-state. This also applies to their relationship to truth, although Posner would not call himself a 'public intellectual' in the sense he attributes to the term when labelling Chomsky and thinkers like him 'public intellectuals'. In structural terms, Edward Said was, of course, very similar to Chomsky and he could also have been chosen when considering the two major ideal types presented here.2 Samuel Hunting¬ton or Francis Fukuyama are very close to the Kagan ideal type, even if their ideas and relationship with power differ slightly from his.3 Writers like Christopher Hitchens represent another ideal type, that of the opportunist gadfly, a 'media intellectual' as pundits are called in France by critics on the left. Gore Vidal, who often takes stands similar to Chomsky's, is a literary intellectual who relishes bashing those he calls ignoramuses; his relationship to truth, society and the nation-state is structurally quite different from Chomsky's. If one were discussing the topic of 'intellectuals and the media' then an opposition between Hitchens and Mark Crispin Miller, two further ideal types, would be in order. If, on the other hand, one were dealing exclusively with foreign policy, Hunt¬ington, Chomsky and Ignatieff would have been three possible ideal types.4 In Chomsky's categorization, Kagan is a 'mandarin', whose intellectual work amounts to siding with power against truth, whereas, for neo¬conservatives, but also arch-conservatives or neo-cons, Chomsky represents the 'loony left' or 'dangerous liberal academic', an 'anti-American' divorced from political realities. Mandarins may be professors or pundits in think tanks; what distinguishes them is their rhetoric and behaviour rather than their professional affiliations. Although Kagan has lived in Brussels he represents a nationalist way of viewing intellectual and political work whereas Chomsky, an intellectual rooted in a long radical-libertarian American tradition, is a truly internationalist thinker who focuses his scathing criticism on the foreign policy of his own country. Chomsky himself does not approve of being labelled a 'public intellec¬tual'. The term is used here in the sense that the 'public' is the intended audience of such writers: ordinary citizens, not elites or the academy. As a linguistics professor Chomsky addresses his colleagues in an elaborately scientific way; as a 'public intellectual' his style and his intended audi¬ences are different. Ironically enough, although Kagan, like most so-called neoconservatives, dislikes Kissinger and his foreign policy realpolitik - therefore European - approach, Kissinger's thinking is structurally much closer to Kagan's American nationalism than to that of intellectuals like Said or Chomsky, who are more internationalist and also more widely read and discussed outside the USA than within it. If one follows Said's definition of an 'intellectual' as someone who, as a citizen, intervenes in the public sphere and not only in a given field of expertise, then Chomsky is an intellectual whereas Kagan, who does not write qua citizen for other citizens, is an expert or a pundit. Somebody like Niall Fergusson, though British and an academic, as a would-be Machiavellian advisor to the Prince and a so-called 'power intellectual', is structurally very close kin to Kagan.5 The first dimension to take into account when contrasting two types of intellectuals is that of closeness to power. Pundits like Robert Kagan do not necessarily agree with the powers that be or various administra¬tions but their aim is to talk to power. When neocons sent President Clinton a letter in 1998 arguing in favour of a war against Iraq, they hoped to exert some influence upon their political leader. Kagan, like the other neocons, is a constructor of visions for politicians to use or imple¬ment. Such intellectuals produce the analyses, interpretations and visions that leaders within the Beltway may implement. Kissinger, Brzezinski, Huntington or, more recently, Nye did the same, although the ideas and the leaders in power differed.6 They all inscribe themselves in a Machiavellian tradition and wish to give advice to the Prince. Kagan produces ideas for the people who matter - that is, in our time, either people with political power or more widely the chattering classes in politics and the media. Kagan thus speaks with or to power but not to the people. With the George W. Bush administration, Kagan is much closer to power: though not always heard or followed by political authorities, he only works for movers and shakers. Noam Chomsky famously disagreed with Edward Said when Said argued that the task of the intellectual is to 'speak truth to power', since, Chomsky argued, power already knows the truth. In his famous article entitled 'The Responsibility of Intellectuals', Chomsky wrote: 'It is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies' (Chomsky, 1967). Chomsky spent his lifetime doing precisely this. I will leave aside for a moment what the word 'truth' means in our so-called post-modern times.7 For Chomsky the role of the intellectual is to deconstruct, that is lay bare, the lies, fabrications and omissions of power. So Chomsky is not a constructor of visions for the elites or, as Marxists would say, for the dominant classes, but a deconstructor of lies and a rehabilitator of hidden facts. A lot has been said about Chomsky's rationalism, his belief in facts or even the possibility of facts and hence in the possibility of telling the truth. In one sense Chomsky could not be more of a contrast to thinkers like Jacques Derrida or Stanley Fish, for the existence of facts is not problematic in his political writings. One would need a long philosophical discussion to differentiate between various kinds of 'facts'. The 'facts' that are of interest to Chomsky are facts such as US support for the Indonesian junta which took power in 1965 and massacred hundreds of thousands of people, facts like the breaking of American or international law by the Reagan administration over Nicaragua or facts such as the absence of facts, as when the weapons of mass destruction and the links between Iraq and Al-Qaeda never materialized. For Chomsky, these facts do not depend on prior interpretations or theories. Facts can be established in a way that is similar to the way hard scientists work: by eliminating wrong interpretations and cross-referencing evidence. In this sense, it is impossible to prove the truth of a philosophical system like Marxism or Liberalism but quite easy to determine the lies of the US administration when it accused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction in 2002 and 2003. Thus Zizek's scathing criticism of Chomsky, whom he says he admires, is rather strange. I will use Zizek to reflect two basic critiques of Chomsky (and therefore, by implication, of the type of intellectual he is). Zizek declared in an interview in 2002: Let me give you a very naive answer. I think that basically the facts are already known. Let's take Chomsky's analyses of how the CIA intervened in Nicaragua. OK, [he provides] a lot of details, yes, but did I learn anything fundamentally new? It's exactly what I'd expected: the CIA was playing a very dirty game. Of course it's more convincing if you learn the dirty details. But I don't think that we really learned anything dramatically new there. I don't think that merely 'knowing the facts' can really change people's perceptions. (Zizek, 2002) Chomsky's texts are indeed often fact-packed or, as the phrase goes, 'bone-dry', and do not make for pleasant recreational reading. But of course, establishing the facts matters tremendously when fighting propaganda: who would know about the 'dirty game' of the CIA if not for those who had the facts? How could Zizek know without the facts? How could he distinguish between rumours, propaganda and unsubstantiated allegations if he had not studied the facts? Isn't it rather irresponsible in a media landscape dominated by Murdoch and Fox News, which special¬izes in the omission and distortion of facts, to rail against their overabundance? In short, Bertrand Russell's prediction of 'madness' when facts are discarded as the bases of theory seems to be operative here. Rather than challenging Chomsky, Zizek shows that his own work is quite different, based on erudite hunches, puns and rhetorical games but some¬times plagued by either a dearth of information or a conflation of fantasy and theory (anti-smoking as a sign of a 'falseness in liberalism' or of 'absolute narcissism' cannot of course be proved by facts, nor are these claimed linkages so well-known that there is no need to analyse them).8 But, of course, Zizek's critique is totally antithetical to the usual right-wing one, which attacks Chomsky for using too few facts or wrong facts or for his anti-American bile amounting to paranoia.9 Zizek is right about Chomsky's Americanness, though that cannot seriously be held against him. For Kagan, as for Charles Krauthammer, another blunt neoconservative nationalist who does not mince his words, the defence of the interests of the US nation-state is of paramount importance - the nation-state here being apprehended as the political machinery ruling over the people. In the battle between the US state apparatus and other powers in the world, Kagan, like most neo- or archeo-conservatives, takes a strong nationalist stand, even if this American nationalist stand is accompanied by a strong critique of nationalism in foreign countries and is not theorized as nation¬alism. The nationalism of the Other is targeted and demonized, not US nationalism, which is seen as a given, almost a natural phenomenon. Thus Chinese nationalism or European collective efforts to exist on the world stage may be criticized for going against US interests - that is, the inter¬ests of the ruling class in the USA (see Balibar, 2003). So one can say that Kagan is a Gramscian thinker assisting the intel¬lectual hegemon to control the machinery of the state. This is one form of irony which is often found when considering those pundits and academics who defend so-called neoliberal or neoconservative views tied to a defence of free trade, globalization and world orders based on market rules: such anti-state theorists often prove to be quite as statist as their ideological opponents. Their definition of the state is not a welfare state in which federal or state authorities fight poverty and social injustice and promote education and a safe environment, yet their theorizing implies a strong defence of a state viewed as a political-military machine serving the interests of US elites - that is, its dominant groups or classes. Kagan can be said to be a Social Darwinist statist for whom the nation-state does not operate for the benefit of its citizens but rather against the 'great beast' of the people. Kagan is very much in favour of a strong military American behemoth (although he calls it 'a behemoth with a conscience'; Kagan, 1998) and of a state that shapes the world according to the inter¬ests of some of its privileged citizens and does not hesitate to resort to Machtpolitik. Chomsky, by contrast, is not so much concerned with fighting to gain control of the machinery of the nation-state, though he belongs to the rather large group of people who feel that state, that is to say, federal authorities, should play a bigger role in the fight against deprivation. His main area of concern and therefore intervention is precisely the fight against the behemoth. His stress upon the American behemoth on the world stage has more to do with the fact that, as an American citizen, he can be most effective in his own country, which is also the only super¬power left. His critique of European or Asian powers, though less frequent than his critique of the USA, is just as scathing. He writes against the empire, against the lies of the nation-state, but focuses on power, wherever it is located. Whereas Kagan addresses the elites which he feels can implement his visions, Chomsky presents people with the facts he has disinterred so that they can mobilize for change. He believes in the agency of ordinary citizens and conceives of his work as a resource for others, and not a resource that requires a particularly high IQ or expert knowl¬edge to be used.10 Although Chomsky is often presented as an activist, a militant, a fire¬brand, he is, in fact, most of all, a thinker who believes people can make up their own minds on the basis of adequate information, which he feels it is his job to provide. In this he is probably closer to Emerson and Thoreau than to Marx and totally different from Lenin. Some blame him for being too individualistic or anarchistic, for he devises his 'tool-kits' in isolation from others. This criticism overlooks the intellectual and activist networks Chomsky is involved in and is anyway, of course, a charge that could be levelled at many, if not most, intellectuals. The other critique - whereby academics attack Chomsky for not playing by the rules of academia - is, of course, still relevant. Yet Chomsky does play by the academic rules in his linguistics and in some of his political publi¬cations.11 But not when writing as a public intellectual. It is a matter of choice. Also, too many academics play by the rules dictated by careerism and take only calculated risks or pseudo-risks in their political writings. Where the local academic power is radical and left wing, in admittedly the very few departments of this kind, being left wing may only be a matter of conforming to the local orthodoxy. Playing to the local choir when the local choir chants conventional insults at the broader national choir is an easy, hypocritical but perhaps necessary career move. Here one could introduce a discussion of courage versus conformity under many guises but, of course, the courage to express one's views, however un¬popular, in public does not characterize only one group of thinkers. Courageous radicals may also be of a right-wing persuasion. Psychologiz¬ing ideological positions always presents major difficulties in intellectual analyses. Useful, brilliant or unconventional intellectuals are not necess¬arily nice and friendly in public (and vice versa). Whereas Kagan could be said to be a 'top-down' theorist, Chomsky could be called a 'bottom-up' one, to use the admittedly problematic terminology in vogue in management circles. Kagan is an elitist who feels elites must tell others what to do and think, which corresponds to the definition of what public relations are for, according to Walter Lippmann, who coined the phrase 'the manufacture of consent'. Chomsky, in typical libertarian fashion, wants to tear away the veil hiding the naked reality of power. Chomsky invites his readers and listeners to see beyond media interpretations and omissions whereas Kagan is a publicist working for the manufacture of consent among dominant groups. Among other thinkers not interested in the conquest of the state appar¬atus, such as Lacan or Baudrillard in France, for instance, there is often an attitude or a pose that differs sharply from Chomsky's. Lacan or Baudrillard do not write for the ordinary reader; their writings address a small body of highly educated cognoscenti who generally respond to their reading in a very individualistic, personal way. The success of these two writers has, in part, something to do with the specific position of intel¬lectuals or pundits in France. In the USA and the English-speaking world more generally, their success is well established only in the humanities departments of elite universities. Chomsky is an intellectual who tries to bypass intellectuals and to cross the boundaries between academe and the people. Even when not working within the university, Lacan and Baudrillard never left the confines provided by well-read Parisian elites and do not write for the 'lay person'. So, even though their discourse may be subversive or dissident, they share the same elitist preference as Kagan. This, of course, does not invalidate the quality of their research or even its usefulness in the larger intellectual debate. Zizek's intervention in the public sphere, though often quite Lacanian in style, is more access¬ible to non-academics, for his production can be apprehended at differ¬ent levels. Yet his wild swings from Lenin to Lacan or from Kant to Habermas can only be understood or appreciated by listeners or readers who are well versed in philosophy and political theory. Bourdieu is a different case; in fact, he is the structural equivalent of Chomsky in France, intervening at two different levels, the academic one and the public one, in different types of publications. His public and political interventions are, however, directly based upon his sociological work. The citizen-scholar or public intellectual may also be an academic in a different capacity. Chomsky is therefore often called a populist because of the apparent simplicity of his (apparently) readily accessible style. This simplicity is common to him and the neocons, who do not write in a complex or convoluted Lacanian style at all. Kagan is a pundit in a rush; like other neocons he wants quick results, a new Middle East policy and a swift change in that area of the world. He wants efficiency and results on the ground. Intellectuals like Chomsky often strive to oppose such neocon objectives, but their aims and methods are more Socratic, in the sense that they address people's thinking abili¬ties, their thinking minds. Even political mobilization is secondary and in this they differ from regular activists writing for the dissident press or websites. Pundits like Kagan wish to change the world quickly from above; they are seekers after power, whereas Socratic public intellectuals like Chomsky are seekers after truth. This quest for truth often takes precedence over friendship and loyalty to institutions or groups of people. Chomsky has often got involved in bitter fights with other thinkers on the left or with liberals. His fight to establish the facts may explain his often somewhat harsh attitude in debates. For him, disseminating knowledge matters much more than propping up the nation-state. Citizen-intellectuals like Chomsky cannot hope to change the world in swift, direct ways because, by definition, they are excluded from the sphere of political power. Responsible public intellectuals seeking after truth have to combine scientific research with the dissemination of ideas which may cause public opinion to change - an arduous task which sometimes may be marred by simplification. A key distinguishing factor between Chomsky and Kagan or citizen-intellectuals, on the one hand, and pundits or 'expert-scholars', on the other, is the divorce between ethics and politics in the case of the latter, who are pragmatists for whom the end justifies the means. They are believers in the adage, 'my country, right or wrong', or, rather, 'my nation-state right or wrong', whatever the human costs for others or for subject groups within 'my nation'. Contrary to Kissinger's devious rhetoric, Kagan explains and justifies his pragmatic immorality very explicitly by quoting Cooper, a British analyst and advisor to Blair: 'we need to revert to the rougher methods of an earlier era - force, pre¬emptive attack, deception, whatever is necessary' (Cooper, quoted in Kagan, 2003b: 74). Kagan even argues: Among ourselves, we keep the law but when we are operating in the jungle, we must also use the laws of the jungle' (Kagan, 2003b: 74).12 Kagan and Cooper could not be more overt in their xenophobic and racist neo-Kiplingian distrust of the Other. Here Machiavelli's disciples show that advising the Prince entrains disre¬gard for ethics in the name of efficiency. Citizen-intellectuals cannot divorce ethics from politics. On the contrary, their politics is based upon a form of ethics. Responsible intel¬lectuals who 'speak the truth and expose lies' not only believe in the exist¬ence of facts and in the possibility of establishing them but also predicate their activity upon a moral principle. Truth is then the basis for political awareness and action. This reverence for truth is the basis of scientific research, for without truth there is no possibility of scientific discovery or technological innovation. If the expression had not been 'pre-empted' by Hardt and Negri one could say that citizen-scholars have another prince, the 'multitude', or in Marxist terminology, the masses - but to take that step could conjure up the concept of an avant garde, which does not agree with Chomsky's libertarian instincts. Machiavellians, on the other hand, can produce propaganda with no regard for the truth: the objective is to manufacture consent to support the powers that be or to influence power in a specific way (see Zinn, 2003). Expert-scholars like Kissinger illustrate La Rochefoucauld's (1665) maxim that 'Uhypocrisie est un hommage que le vice rend a la vertu' (hypocrisy is the homage paid by vice to virtue), for Kissinger claims that the USA is the most moral of nation-states when, as a decision-maker, he rushed to violate this very morality supposed to characterize America'. Kissinger confuses the rhetoric of morality often resorted to by American leaders with a truly ethical foreign policy, that is to say, he confuses propaganda with analysis. America's raison d'etat may be clothed in democratic, religious or allegedly post-national rhetoric; it is no less strong than it was in 17th-century Europe. The neocons have the advantage of letting Kissinger's cat out of the nationalist bag, even if for them the nation-state is not the state belonging to all its citizens. Marx's aphorism about philosophers - 'intellectuals' in our terminol¬ogy - is well-known. In his 'Thesis on Feuerbach' he wrote: 'philosophers have only interpreted the world, the point is to change it' ('Eleventh Thesis'; Marx, 1845: 156). Kagan could be said to be in a rush to change the world without first interpreting it whilst Chomsky does not share Marx's impatience with analysis and comprehension but provides the tool-kits and facts to help change the world. On this score Kagan, like so many so-called conservative thinkers, is a vulgar Marxist while Chomsky is decidedly a non-Marxist. Justice and truth matter more to Chomsky than the nation-state while the princes of the nation are Kagan's main focus.<br />

No matter if we are academic or practitioners of state craft, we must open up our foregin policy discourses to criticism. Failure to do so ensures the creation of populations for invasion control and bombing<br />
Agnew and Corbridge 95 [Mastering Space: Hegemony, territory and political economy. John, professor of geography @ Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs @ Syracuse, Stuart, Lecturer in Geography @ University of Cambridge, p. 48-9]<br />
<br />
There are four specific points that follow from these comments on geopolitical discourse and political elites (O'Tuathail and Agnew 1992). First, geopolitical discourse is not simply a separate activity or the identification of specific .geographical influences upon a particular foreign-policy &quot;situation, Just describing^ foreign-policy situation is to engage in geopolitics through The implicit and tacit normalization of a division and description of the world. .To identify and name a place is to&quot; trigger a series of narratives, subjects and understandings. For example, to designate an area as Islamic or western is 'not only To name it, but also to/brand it in terms of its politics and the type of foreign policy its 'nature' demands Second, geopolitical discourse involves practical reasoning rather than the deliberate deployment of formal geopolitical models; though these often capture important aspects of dominant spatial representations. Practical geopolitical reasoning relies on common-sense narratives and distinctions rather than formal models. Defining areas as modern or backward, Western or non-Western, civilized barbarian, and democratic or despotic have been important binary oppositions around which modern geopolitical discourse revolves, irrespective of whether its purveyors are academics (disciplinary or formal geopolitics), practitioners of statecraft_(practical geopolitics) or media-persons involved in representations in popular culture (popular geopolitics). &quot; Third, the geographical knowledge displayed in geopolitical discourse is usually of a reductive nature. Information about places is filtered and suppressed in order to fit into a priori geopolitical categories. Geopolitical reasoning operates through the active simplification of the complex reality of places in favour of controllable geopolitical abstractions. This is how places and their inhabitants can become 'security commodities', readily subject to invasion control or bombing. Fourth and finally, not all political elites have equal influence over how global political-economic space is represented. Those in authority in the Great Powers or within the hegemonic state (if there is one) have the power co constitute the dominant geopolitical discourse. This happens not only through their own practice but also through the active adoption of the dominant geopolitical discourse by both allies and enemies. Of course, hegemonic representations do not go unchallenged but even challenges often must conform to the 'terms of debate' laid down by the dominant discourse in order to be intelligible or readily understood.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Any move to methodologically bracket out our discussion cannot be viewed as value neutral, it is the worst form of conservatism favoring the established order at the expense of the oppressed. </span><br />

Nowhere is the myth of ideological neutrality – the self-proclaimed Wertfreiheit or value neutrality of so-called ‘rigorous social science’ – stronger than in the field of methodology. Indeed, we are often presented with the claim that the adoption of the advocated methodological framework would automatically exempt one from all controversy about values, since they are adequate method itself, thereby saving one from unnecessary complications and securing the desired objectivity and uncontestable outcome. Claims and procedures of this kind are, of course, extremely problematical. For they circularly assume that their enthusiasm for the virtues of ‘methodological neutrality’ is bound to yield ‘value neutral’ solutions with regard to highly contested issues, without first examining the all-important question as to the conditions of possibility – or otherwise – of the postulated systematic neutrality at the plans of methodology itself. The unchallengeable validity of the recommended procedure is supposed to be self-evident on account of its purely methodological character. In reality, of course, this approach to methodology is heavily loaded with a conservative ideological substance. Since, however, the plane of methodology (and ‘meta-theory’) is said to be in principle separated from that of the substantive issues, the methodological circle can be conveniently closed. Whereupon the mere insistence on the purely methodological character of the criteria laid down is supposed to establish the claim according to which the approach in question is neutral because everybody can adopt it as the common frame of reference of ‘rational discourse’. Yet, curiously enough, the proposed methodological tenets are so defined that vast areas of vital social concern are a priori excluded from their rational discourse ‘metaphysical’, ‘ideological’, etc. The effect of circumscribing in this way the scope of the one and only admissible approach is that it automatically disqualifies in the name of methodology itself, all those who do not fit into the stipulated framework of discourse. As a result, the propounders of the ‘right method’ are spared the difficulties that go with acknowledging the real divisions and incompatibilities as they necessarily arise from the contending social interests at the roots of alternative approaches and the rival sets of values associated with them. This is where we can see more clearly the social orientation implicit in the whole procedure. For – far from offering an adequate scope for critical enquiry – the advocated general adoption of the allegedly neutral methodological framework is equivalent, in fact, to consenting not even to raise the issues that really matter. Instead, the stipulated ‘common’ methodological procedure succeeds in transforming the enterprise of ‘rational discourse’ into the dubious practice of producing methodology for the sake of methodology: a tendency more pronounced in the twentieth century than ever before. This practice consists in sharpening the recommended methodological knife until nothing but the bare handle is left, at which point the new knife is adopted for the same purpose. For the ideal methodological knife is not meant for cutting, only for sharpening, thereby interposing itself between the critical intent and the real objects of criticism which it can obliterate for as long as the pseudo-critical activity of knife-sharpening for tits own sake continues to be pursued. And that happens to be precisely its inherent ideological purpose. Naturally, to speak of a ‘common’ methodological framework in which one can resolve the problems of a society torn by irreconcilable social interests and pursuing antagonistic confrontations is delusory, at best, notwithstanding all talk about ‘ideal communication communities’. But to define the methodological tenets of all rational discourse by way of transubstantiating into ‘ideal types’ (or by putting into methodological ‘brackets’) the discussion of contending social values reveals the ideological colour as well as the extreme fallaciousness of the claimed rationality. For such treatment of the major areas of conflict, under a great variety of forms – from the Viennese version of ‘logical positivism’ to Wittgenstein’s famous ladder that must be ‘thrown away’ at the point of confronting the question of values, and from the advocacy of the Popperian principle of ‘little by little’ in the ‘emotivist’ theory of value – inevitably always favours the established order. And it does so by declaring the fundamental structural parameters of the given society ‘of of bounds’ to the potential contestants, in the authority of the ideally ‘common’ methodology. However, even on a cursory inspection of the issues at stake it out to be fairly obvious that to consent not to question the fundamental structural framework of the established order is radically different according to whether one does so as the beneficiary of the order or from the standpoint of those who find themselves at the receiving end, exploited and oppressed by the overall determinations (and not just by some limited and more or less easily corrigible detail) of that order. Consequently, to establish the ‘common’ identity of the two, opposed sides of a structurally safeguarded hierarchical order – by means of the reduction of the people belong to the contending social forces into fictitious ‘rational interlocutors’, extracted from their divided real world and transplanted into a beneficially shared universe of ideal discourse – would be nothing sort of methodological miracle. Contrary to the wishful thinking hypostatized as a timeless and socially unspecified rational community, the elementary condition of a truly rational discourse would be to acknowledge the legitimacy of contesting the given order of society in substantive terms. This would imply the articulation of the relevant problems not on the plane of self-referential articulation of the relevant problems not on the plane of self-referential theory and methodology, but as inherently practical issues whose conditions of solution point towards the necessity of radical structural changes. In other words, it would require the explicit rejection of all fiction of methodological and meta-theoretical neutrality. But, of course, this would be far too much to expect precisely because the society in which we live is a deeply divided society. This is why through the dichotomies of ‘fact and value’, ‘theory and practice’, ‘formal and substantive rationality’, etc. The conflict-transcending methodological miracle is constantly stipulated as the necessary regulative framework of the ruling ideology. What makes this approach particularly difficult to challenge is that its value-commitments are mediated by methodological precepts to such a degree that it is virtually impossible to bring them into the focus of discussion without openly contesting the framework as a whole. For the conservative sets of values at the roots of such orientation remain several steps removed from the ostensible subject of dispute as defined in logico/methodological, formal/structural, and semantic/analytical terms. And who would suspect of ideological bias the impeccable – methodologically sanctioned – credentials of ‘procedural rules’, ‘models and ‘paradigms’? Once, though, such rules and paradigms are adopted as the common frame of reference of what may or may not be allowed to considered the legitimate subject of debate, everything that enters into the accepted parameters is necessarily constrained not only by the scope of the overall framework, but simultaneously also by the inexplicit ideological assumptions upon the basis of which the methodological principles themselves were in the first place constitution. This why the allegedly ‘non-ideological’ ideologies which so successfully conceal and exercise their apologetic function in the guise of neutral methodology are doubly mystifying. Twentieth-century currents of thought are dominated by approaches that lend to articulate the social interests and values of the ruling order through complicated – at times completely bewildering – mediations, on the methodological plane. Thus, more than ever before, the task of ideological demystification is inseparable from the investigation of the complex dialectical relationship between methods and values which no social theory or philosophy can escape.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Myth of benign US leadership anesthetizes American public to the evils of Empire</span><br />

The myth of the reluctant superpower does not preclude nor detract from the assertion that only by America's intervention was victory achieved and the high purpose of America as a nation fulfilled. Indeed, the myth of reluctance heightens, rather than diminishes, the feel-good factor of such a reading of history. Consistently, it is evil that is the spur to American action and intervention; therefore, the American people are reassured that their nation is good, acting disinterestedly and nobly according to its enduring values. But, as we have shown, there is an underlying coherence of purpose in US foreign policy - from the Founding Fathers to Roosevelt, Mahan, Beveridge and Hay through to William Taft and official endorsement of dollar diplomacy and on to Woodrow Wilson's moral charter for a global order of 'new Freedom'. The recurrences and sense of familiarity are unmistakable; they are articulated by Republicans and Democrats. And, as we shall see in Chapter Five, the enterprise was given a boost by Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the disintegration of Communism offered further opportunity to fulfil this vision. The administrations of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton revived the project with a new twist - whereas the orientation of US policy had been primarily defensive, it now became largely offensive. As Andrew Bacevich notes: Though garnished with neologistic flourishes intended to convey a sense of freshness or originality, the politicoeconomic concept to which the United States adheres today has not changed in a century: the familiar quest for an 'open world', the overriding imperative of commercial integration, confidence that technology endows the United States with a privileged position in that order, and the expectation that American military might will preserve order and enforce the rules. Those policies reflect a single minded determination to extend and perpetuate American political, economic and cultural hegemony - usually referred to as 'leadership' - on a global scale.23 The myth of the reluctant hero is used to camouflage<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">US IMPERIAL GEOPOLITICS THREATEN EXTINCTION.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Foster 2006</span> (John Bellamy, Monthly Review, January, Vol. 57, Iss. 8, “The New Geopolitics of Empire”)<br />
The unpopularity of geopolitical analysis after 1943 is usually attributed to its association with the Nazi strategy of world conquest. Yet the popular rejection of geopolitics in that period may have also arisen from the deeper recognition that classical geopolitics in all of its forms was an inherently imperialist and war-related doctrine. As the critical geopolitical analyst Robert Strausz-Hupé argued in 1942, &quot;In Geopolitik there is no distinction between war and peace. All states have the urge to expand, and the process of expansion is viewed as a perpetual warfare-no matter whether military power is actually applied or is used to implement 'peaceful' diplomacy as a suspended threat.&quot;35 U.S. imperial geopolitics is ultimately aimed at creating a global space for capitalist development. It is about forming a world dedicated to capital accumulation on behalf of the U.S. ruling class-and to a lesser extent the interlinked ruling classes of the triad powers as a whole (North America, Europe, and Japan). Despite &quot;the end of colonialism&quot; and the rise of &quot;anti-capitalist new countries,&quot; Business Week pronounced in April 1975, there has always been &quot;the umbrella of American power to contain it.... [T]he U.S. was able to fashion increasing prosperity among Western countries, using the tools of more liberal trade, investment, and political power. The rise of the multinational corporation was the economic expression of this political framework.&quot;36 There is no doubt that the U.S. imperium has benefited those at the top of the center-capitalist nations and not just the power elite of the United States. Yet, the drive for global hegemony on the part of particular capitalist nations and their ruling classes, like capital accumulation itself, recognizes no insurmountable barriers. Writing before September 11, 2001, István Mészáros argued in his Socialism or Barbarism that due to unbridled U.S. imperial ambitions the world was entering what was potentially &quot;the most dangerous phase of imperialism in all history&quot;: For what is at stake today is not the control of a particular part of the planet-no matter how large-putting at a disadvantage but still tolerating the independent actions of some rivals, but the control of its totality by one hegemonic economic and military superpower... .This is what the ultimate rationality of globally developed capital requires, in its vain attempt to bring under control its irreconcilable antagonisms. The trouble is, though, that such rationality...is at the same time the most extreme form of irrationality in history, including the Nazi conception of world domination, as far as the conditions required for the survival of humanity are concerned.37<br />

Most in Washington still embraces the notion that America is, and forever will be, the world’s indispensable nation. Some scholars, however, questioned the logic of hegemonic stability theory from the very beginning. A number continue to do so today. They advance arguments diametrically at odds with the primacist consensus. Trade routes need not be policed by a single dominant power; the international economy is complex and resilient. Supply disruptions are likely to be temporary, and the costs of mitigating their effects should be borne by those who stand to lose — or gain — the most. Islamic extremists are scary, but hardly comparable to the threat posed by a globe-straddling Soviet Union armed with thousands of nuclear weapons. It is frankly absurd that we spend more today to fight Osama bin Laden and his tiny band of murderous thugs than we spent to face down Joseph Stalin and Chairman Mao. Many factors have contributed to the dramatic decline in the number of wars between nation-states; it is unrealistic to expect that a new spasm of global conflict would erupt if the United States were to modestly refocus its efforts, draw down its military power, and call on other countries to play a larger role in their own defense, and in the security of their respective regions. But while there are credible alternatives to the United States serving in its current dual role as world policeman / armed social worker, the foreign policy establishment in Washington has no interest in exploring them. The people here have grown accustomed to living at the center of the earth, and indeed, of the universe. The tangible benefits of all this military spending flow disproportionately to this tiny corner of the United States while the schlubs in fly-over country pick up the tab.<br />

<br />
One potential explanation for the growth of global peace can be dismissed fairly quickly: US actions do not seem to have contributed much. The limited evidence suggests that there is little reason to believe in the stabilising power of the US hegemon, and that there is no relation between the relative level of American activism and international stability. During the 1990s, the United States cut back on its defence spending fairly substantially. By 1998, the United States was spending $100 billion less on defence in real terms than it had in 1990, a 25% reduction.29 To internationalists, defence hawks and other believers in hegemonic stability, this irresponsible 'peace dividend' endangered both national and global security. 'No serious analyst of American military capabilities', argued neo-conservatives William Kristol and Robert Kagan in 1996, 'doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace'.30 And yet the verdict from the 1990s is fairly plain: the world grew more peaceful while the United States cut its forces. No state seemed to believe that its security was endangered by a less-capable US military, or at least none took any action that would suggest such a belief. No militaries were enhanced to address power vacuums; no security dilemmas drove insecurity or arms races; no regional balancing occurred once the stabilis-ing presence of the US military was diminished. The rest of the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a pressing concern, despite the reduction in US military capabilities. Most of all, the United States was no less safe. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut its military spending under President Bill Clinton, and kept declining as the George W. Bush administration ramped the spending back up. Complex statistical analysis is unnecessary to reach the conclusion that world peace and US military expenditure are unrelated.<br />

There is, third, the additional critical attribute of contingency. It is this feature which does not merely add governing through contingency to the political rationalities and governmental technologies of contemporary liberal rule. It lends its own distinctive infection to them; one which has had a profound impact on the nature of liberal rule and war in relation, especially, to its current hyperbolicization of security and its newly problematized and proliferating accounts of dangers, threats and enemies. For if the biopolitical imperative is that of making life live, the martial expression of that imperative, the drive to liberal war, is preparedness to make war on the enemies of life. The biopoltiical imperative to make life live finds its expression today, however in making life live the emergency of its emergence; for that is what species life is now said to be. The liberal way of rule and war has thus become the preparedness to make war on whatever threatens life’s capacity to live the emergency of its emergence. For allied to the radical contingency of species existence is an account of species existence as a life of continuous complex adaptation and emergence. From the perspective of security and war, in particular, such a pluripotent life, characterized by its continuously unfolding potential, is a life that is continuously becoming-dangerous to itself, and to other life forms. Such danger is not merely actual; because life itself, here has become not merely actual. The emphasis in the problematization of danger which accompanies such a politics of life itself therefore also shifts dramatically from the actual to the virtual. Only this explains the astonishing degree to which the historically secure lives of the Atlantic basin have come to construe themselves, politically, as radically endangered by as many unknown as there are unknowable dangers; a point regularly and frankly admitted, officially, from terror to health mandarins, nationally and internationally. Many have observed that the societies of the Atlantic basin are now increasingly ruled by fear; that there is a politics of fear. But they interpret this politics of fear in political naïve ways, as the outcome of deliberate machination by political and economic elites. They may well be correct to some degree. But what is perfectly evident, also, is that the elites themselves are governed by the very grid of intelligibility furnished by the account of life as an emergency of emergence. It is not simply a matter, therefore, of leaders playing on fears. The leadership itself is in the grip of a conjugation of government and rule whose very generative principle of formation is permanent emergency. In other words, fear is no longer simply an affect open to regular manipulation by leadership cadres. It is, but it is not only that, and not even most importantly that. More importantly (because this is not a condition that can be resolved simply by ‘throwing the rascals out’) in the permanent emergency of emergence, fear becomes a generative principle of formation for rule. The emergency of emergence therefore poses a found crisis in western understandings of the political, and in the hopes and expectations invested in political as opposed to other forms of life. Given the wealth and given the vast military preponderance in weapons of mass destruction and other forms of global deployed military capabilities of the societies of the Atlantic basin, notably, of course, the United States, this poses a world crisis as well. In short, then, this complex adaptive emergent life exists in the permanent state of emergence. Its politics of security and war, which is to say its very foundational politics of rule as well, now revolve around this state of emergency. Here, that in virtue of which a ‘we’ comes to belong together, its very generative principle of formation (our shorthand definition of politics), has become this emergency. What happens, we also therefore ask of the biopoliticization of rule, when emergency becomes the generative principle of formation of community and rule? Our answer has already been given. Politics becomes subject to the urgent and compelling political economy, the logistical and technical dynamics, of war. No longer a ‘we’ in virtue of abiding by commonly agreed rules of government, it becomes a ‘we’ formed by abiding by commonly agreed rules of government, it becomes a ‘we’ formed by the rule of the emergency itself; and that is where the political crisis, the crisis of the political itself is that a ‘we’ can belong together not only in terms of agreeing to abide by the rule of its generative principles of formation but also by the willingness to keep the nature of operation of those generative principles of formation under common deliberative scrutiny. You cannot, however, debate emergency. You can only interrogate the futile demand it makes on you, and all the episteme challenges it poses, acceding to those demands according both to how well you can come to know them, and how well you have also adapted you affects to suffering them, or perish. The very exigencies of emergency thus militate profoundly against the promise of ‘politics’ as it has been commonly understood in the western tradition; not simply as a matter of rule, but as a matter of self-rule in which it was possible to debate the nature of the self in terms of the good for and of the self. Note, also, how much the very idea of the self has disappeared from view in this conflation of life with species life. The only intelligence, the only self-knowledge, the only culture which qualifies in the permanence of this emergency is the utilitarian and instrumental technologies said to be necessary to endure it. We have been here before in the western tradition and we have experienced the challenges of this condition as tyranny (Arendt 1968). The emergency of emergence, the generative principle of formation, the referential matrix of contemporary biopolitics globally, is a newly formed, pervasive and insidiously complex, soft totalitarian regime of power relations made all the more difficult to contest precisely because, governing through the contingent emergency of emergence, it is a governing through the transactional freedoms of contingency.<br />

Relations between states are, at least in part, constructed upon representations. Representations are interpretative prisms through which decision-makers make sense of a political reality, through which they define and assign a subjective value to the other states and non-state actors of the international system, and through which they determine what are significant international political issues.2 For instance, officials of a given state will represent other states as 'allies', 'rivals', or simply 'insignificant', thus assigning a subjective value to these states. Such subjective categorizations often derive from representations of these states' domestic politics, which can for instance be perceived as 'unstable*, 'prosperous', or 'ethnically divided'. It must be clear that representations are not objective or truthful depictions of reality; rather they are subjective and political ways of seeing the world, making certain things 'seen' by and significant for an actor while making other things 'unseen' and 'insignificant'.3 In other words, they are founded on each actor's and group of actors' cognitive, cultural-social, and emotional standpoints. Being fundamentally political, representations are the object of tense struggles and tensions, as some actors or groups of actors can impose on others their own representations of the world, of what they consider to be appropriate political orders, or appropriate economic relations, while others may in turn accept, subvert or contest these representations. Representations of a foreign political reality influence how decision-making actors will act upon that reality. In other words, as subjective and politically infused interpretations of reality, representations constrain and enable the policies that decision-makers will adopt vis-a-vis other states; they limit the courses of action that are politically thinkable and imaginable, making certain policies conceivable while relegating other policies to the realm of the unthinkable.4 Accordingly, identifying how a state represents another state or non-state actor helps to understand how and why certain foreign policies have been adopted while other policies have been excluded. To take a now famous example, if a transnational organization is represented as a group of 'freedom fighters', such as the multi-national mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s, then military cooperation is conceivable with that organization; if on the other hand the same organization is represented as a 'terrorist network', such as Al-Qaida, then military cooperation as a policy is simply not an option. In sum. the way in which one sees, interprets and imagines the 'other* delineates the course of action one will adopt in order to deal with this 'other'\<br />

For most of the last decade, NASA was unable to replace its climate-monitoring satellites. Replacing these satellites is crucial to avoid a drastic decline in collecting the most valuable information for monitoring climate change. The Obama administration has proposed a budget for NASA’s Earth science programs of $2.4 billion in new funding over the next five years, an increase of more than 60 percent. The new funding, which requires congressional approval, will help replace OCO and allow NASA to replace the twin GRACE satellites that make detailed measurements of Earth’s gravity field that can provide important climate data. The request for NOAA’s budget for climate-related activities has been increased as well. NOAA will be spending $2.2 billion to maintain and further develop satellites and to support climate research; $435 million has been requested to support the U.S. Global Change Research Program, with $77 million in new increases for core climate services and observations. Spending on space has always been a question of priorities. Until recently, those priorities were frozen in time, reflecting political needs that were decades out of date. Our national priorities have changed. A new priority, reflecting the new challenges to our security and national interest, involves monitoring and understanding climate change.<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Landsat-7 continues to operate, albeit, since May 31, 2003, with a failed scan line corrector (SLC). The SLC compensates for the forward motion of the sensor and its failure has resulted in images that have high geometric and radiometric fidelity, but no data present for wedges varying in size from one 30 m pixel near the centre of the image to fourteen 30 m pixels along the eastern and western edges of the image (Storey et al., 2005). Although the central swath of the Landsat-7 image (approximately 22 km wide) is not impacted by the SLC failure, approximately 22% of the image data are lost. To mitigate the impact of the data gaps caused by the SLC failure, a number of approaches have been developed, including image segmentation (Maxwell et al., 2007) and multi-date (same season) image compositing. Subsequent investigations have determined that the segment-based gap-filled SLC-off imagery is sufficiently robust for certain land cover applications ([Bédard et al., 2008] and [Wulder et al., 2008a]), while the multi-date compositing has been used for the NASA/USGS Global Land Survey (GLS) product suite (Gutman et al., 2008). Image compositing has also provided an opportunity to both address the data gaps related to SLC-off and to enable cloud infill for seamless, wide-area, characterizations ([Lindquist et al., 2008] and [Roy et al., 2010]).

1. Introduction Satellite climate observations offer broad and consistent spatial sampling, complementing surface-based observations, which may be compromised by correlations with anthropogenic or natural changes in surface conditions near observation sites, and which may be spatially biased by ease or difficulty of access to a given location on the surface. However, imperfect temporal sampling introduces random errors (due to aperiodic weather noise) and biases that can substantially reduce the accuracy of satellite observations of the state of the atmosphere. Selection of the number of satellites, their orbital configuration, and their scanning pattern all contribute to satellite sampling errors for climate studies. These errors have been carefully investigated for existing climate records (Salby and Callaghan 1997; Christy et al. 2003; Mears et al. 2003; Vinnikov and Grody 2003; Vinnikov et al. 2004). The latter three papers included specific measures to estimate and remove biases contributed by inadequately sampled diurnal variability, either by estimating the strength of various harmonics of the diurnal cycle directly from observations, or by simulating the diurnal cycle using a general circulation model (Mears et al. 2003). The continuing controversy over the tropospheric temperature record as measured by radiosondes and by the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU)/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) instruments illustrates the need for climate observing strategies that can produce absolutely accurate climate data records. Our purpose is to reduce the need for after-the-fact error correction by finding orbits that minimize sampling errors. For interannual trends, much of the bias treated by these authors derives from the drift in the equator-crossing time of sun-synchronous satellites. A theoretical study of sampling errors due to satellite orbital drift for a constellation of three sun-synchronous orbits was made by Leroy (2001), for the case of clear skies and large-amplitude diurnal variability in surface temperature. He showed that asymmetry in the time of observations for ascending and descending orbit legs caused substantial errors in high latitude regions even for three equally spaced satellites, due to aliasing of the semidiurnal cycle onto the long-term mean. He also showed that that cross-track scanning of practical width did little to reduce this sampling bias. We extend this work using a more realistic proxy dataset, and consider both bias and short term climate variability in order to determine which constellation of satellites in which orbital configuration are capable of adequately sampling radiance observations so as to obtain accurate climate means. The climate means investigated include annual and seasonal mean brightness temperature, as well as annual mean diurnal brightness temperature maximum, minimum, and range.<br />

<br />
The growth in the number of countries deploying Earth observing systems, and the commensurate increase in data, are likely to lead to instances of discrepancies in information collected from different instruments. These discrepancies are expected simply because of variations in technical and operating parameters, as well as in interpretation and analyses of data. For instance, land observing instruments differ with respect to their spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. Data are also subject to interpretation; for instance, multiple definitions of ‘‘urbanization’’ or ‘‘forestation’’ can lead to discrepancies in classifying land use. Differences in data provide opportunities for further research, instrument cross-calibration, and for the sharpening of classification schemes. Differences in data used for resource management may lead, however, to disagreement about which data are ‘‘correct.’’ An example is the case of differences in forested land as estimated by U.S. and European observations. Waggoner (2009) illustrates differences of 40 percent or more in forest acreage in the area from Mexico to Panama as estimated by data from NASA compared with data from Europe’s Global Land Cover measurements.42 The salience of this example is that these estimates are needed to improve measures of forests in the global carbon cycle, and to provide data essential for any future international policy efforts to manage forest carbon sequestration through carbon fees or permit trading. The economic value of international forest carbon sequestration to the United States would be about $20 billion by 2020, under congressional proposals, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.43 Significant disagreement in physical measures confounds both the estimate of the policy impact, and the efficacy of policy implementation. This example illustrates a looming problem in using space-derived Earth observations from platforms owned by one country to assess the natural resources of other countries, particularly when the resources have large economic value. While the space vantage point allows observations of other countries under the Remote Sensing Principles of the United Nations (UN), most space-derived data require some additional in situ measurement, like ground-truthing. For this reason, space-collected observations of nationally sovereign resources, such as forests, are likely to require cooperation with the sensed country. The efforts of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization in compiling a periodic inventory of global forests based on data that are self-reported by countries has been hampered by the problem of sovereignty, as well as differences in the technical and financial capacity of many countries to measure their forested land.44 Even countries with capacity may, for reasons related to international trade in timber and wood products markets, choose not to make public their national forest data.<br />

Yet the fact that Homo sapiens has managed to survive every disease to assail it in the 200,000 years or so of its existence is a source of genuine comfort, at least if the focus is on extinction events. There have been enormously destructive plagues, such as the Black Death, smallpox, and now AIDS, but none has come close to destroying the entire human race. There is a biological reason. Natural selection favors germs of limited lethality; they are fitter in an evolutionary sense because their genes are more likely to be spread if the germs do not kill their hosts too quickly. The AIDS virus is an example of a lethal virus, wholly natural, that by lying dormant yet infectious in its host for years maximizes its spread. Yet there is no danger that AIDS will destroy the entire human race. The likelihood of a natural pandemic that would cause the extinction of the human race is probably even less today than in the past (except in prehistoric times, when people lived in small, scattered bands, which would have limited the spread of disease), despite wider human contacts that make it more difficult to localize an infectious disease<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ocean is resilient – Natural mechanisms.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">ITOPF 7</span> [International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation, “Marine Recovery”]<br />
<br />
Marine organisms have varying degrees of natural resilience to changes in their habitats. The natural adaptations of populations of animals and plants to cope with environmental stress, combined with their breeding strategies, provide important mechanisms for coping with the daily and seasonal fluctuations in their habitats and for recovering from predation and other stochastic events. Some natural phenomena can be highly destructive. The short-term power of hurricanes and tsunamis can easily be appreciated, as can the damage they cause. The cyclical El Niño phenomenon has major long-term consequences for marine organisms, seabirds and marine mammals throughout the entire Pacific Ocean. Organisms suffer under such onslaughts, but after what is often severe disruption and widespread mortality, the marine populations re-establish themselves over a period of time and this process constitutes natural recovery. An important reproductive strategy for many marine organisms is the production of vast numbers of eggs and larvae which are released into the plankton and are widely distributed by currents. This mechanism has evolved to take maximum advantage of available space and resources in marine habitats and to deal with e.g. predation. In some cases, only one or two individuals in a million actually survive through to adulthood. … While it may be possible to help restore damaged vegetation and physical structures, designing meaningful restoration strategies for animals is a much greater challenge. In some cases it may be warranted to protect a natural breeding population at a nearby non-impacted site, for example by predator control, to provide a reservoir from which re-colonisation of the impacted areas can occur. In reality, the complexity of the marine environment means that there are limits to which ecological damage can be repaired by artificial means. In most cases natural recovery is likely to be relatively rapid and will only rarely be outpaced by restoration measures. The short-term effects of oil spills on many marine species and communities are well known and predictable, but concerns are often raised about possible longer-term (&quot;sub-lethal&quot;) population effects. Extensive research and detailed post-spill studies have shown that many components of the marine environment are highly resilient to short-term adverse changes, including oil spills, and as a result even a major oil spill will rarely cause permanent effects.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Many challenges exist that the US will need to overcome before a SUSTAIN type of capability could come to fruition. Some of these same challenges provide valid counterarguments against the need for launching troops through space. Since these challenges and counterarguments merit individual, extensive attention outside the scope of this paper, this section merely poses some important questions, in recognition that responsive space access is not an easy, risk-free proposition. What specific situations exist or could exist where transport by air, sea, or ground is not good enough and space transport would be required? Are there other non-materiel solutions that would obviate the need for transporting troops through space? What is the cost/benefit tradeoff? Will the military and commercial wartime and peacetime “market” adequately support this capability? These questions all deal with validating the need for space transportation of troops. Evolutionary improvements in air, land, and sea mobility coupled with improvements in forward basing structure could satisfy some of the USMC needs without traveling though space and developing revolutionary systems. Unfortunately, there are still limitations with each of these such as political overflight restrictions, that prevent them from meeting all of the USMC future expeditionary requirements. The draft ICD in Appendix A does a good preliminary assessment of the alternatives and how they might contribute to an interim solution. Is there enough room for people, weapons, gear, and extra people/cargo for the return flight? Will the passengers be mission-ready upon landing? Can they rapidly egress in a tactically sound manner? How much training will be required? How often will flights be practiced? These questions address the concept of operations. Although each question has its own unique problems, all of them can be resolved within the design trade space. Of these CONOPS issues, the mission readiness challenge may require the most research. Insufficient data exist to allow proper analysis of the impact on the human organism during these types of suborbital or possibly orbital profiles. Never has a human had to endure the physical rigors of combat immediately following spaceflight, so more work still needs to occur. What would such a capability force the enemy to do? Can they see you coming? How vulnerable would the system be to shoot-down, worst case with simply small arms fire? Does your landing let them know you are there? How do we ensure other states do not mistake troop launch as a hostile missile launch? Finally, these questions relate to enemy responses and system survivability. These are perhaps the most challenging of the questions posed since the enemy intentions are never certain and the enemy always gets a vote. Designing the vehicles with self-defense and fire support in mind can overcome the survivability issues; however, these capabilities will add weight, which is never the friend of space access. As for the mistaken identity problem, there is historical precedence for geographically separating nuclear and nonnuclear launch sites and flying different launch profiles to prevent just such a catastrophic misunderstanding. </span><br />

The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) is exploring the possibility of a space transport vehicle that could deliver troops anywhere in the world in two hours or less. The USMC is attempting to interest the Special Operations Command, the Air Force Space Command, and the National Space Initiative (a joint effort between NASA and the Pentagon) in what it is calling the Small Unit Space Transport and Insertion (SUSTAIN) program. Brig. Gen. Richard Zilmer, director of strategy and plans for the USMC, said that “While the [Marine Corps] does not expect to manage a space transport program in the future, our continuing expressions of need will help to steer and integrate the diverse technologies and demonstrations more rapidly and rationally.” The USMC hopes that SUSTAIN would reach initial operating capability in the 2025-2030 timeframe. The USMC has also established a link with the U.S. Strategic Command called the Marine Forces Strategic Command (MARFORSTRAT) to solidify its space operations.<br />

Exaggerated coverage aids jihadists by creating an atmosphere of fear” January, 14th 2010, lexis, Chetan]<br />
<br />
As terrorist plots against the United States have piled up in recent months, politicians and the news media have sounded the alarm with a riveting message for Americans: Be afraid. Al Qaeda is on the march again, targeting the country from within and without, and your hapless government cannot protect you. But the politically charged clamor has lumped together disparate cases and obscured the fact that the jihadist enemies on American soil in 2009, rather than a single powerful and sophisticated juggernaut, were a scattered, uncoordinated group of amateurs who displayed more fervor than skill. Their weapons were old-fashioned guns and explosives - in several cases, duds supplied by FBI informants - with no trace of the biological or radiological poisons, let alone the nuclear bombs, that have long been the ultimate fear. And though 2009 brought more domestic plots, and more serious plots, than any recent year, their lethality was relatively modest. Exactly 14 of the about 14,000 murders in the United States last year resulted from allegedly jihadist attacks: 13 people shot at Fort Hood in Texas in November and one at a military recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas, in June. Such statistics would be no comfort, of course, if an attack with mass casualties were to succeed some day. Nor do they excuse the acknowledged missteps at the bulked-up American security agencies that permitted a Nigerian student to carry a makeshift bomb onto a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day - the attempted attack that set off the flood of news coverage. But even that near miss, said Mark M. Lowenthal, assistant director of the Central Intelligence Agency for analysis from 2002 to 2005, may offer indirect evidence of the enemy's diminished strength, compared with the coordinated attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ''Sending one guy on one plane is a huge step down,'' Mr. Lowenthal said. ''They're less capable, even if they're still lethal. They're not able to carry out the intense planning they once did.''<br />

Far from being plausible, argued Ohio State University professor John Mueller in a recent presentation at the University of Chicago, &quot;the likelihood that a terrorist group will come up with an atomic bomb seems to be vanishingly small.&quot; (<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4246:http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/" rel="nofollow">http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4246 --> APSACHGO.PDF) The events required to make that happen include a multitude of herculean tasks. First, a terrorist group has to get a bomb or fissile material, perhaps from Russia's inventory of decommissioned warheads. If that were easy, one would have already gone missing. Besides, those devices are probably no longer a danger, since weapons that are not scrupulously maintained (as those have not been) quickly become what one expert calls &quot;radioactive scrap metal.&quot; If terrorists were able to steal a Pakistani bomb, they would still have to defeat the arming codes and other safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized use. As for Iran, no nuclear state has ever given a bomb to an ally—for reasons even the Iranians can grasp. Stealing some 100 pounds of bomb fuel would require help from rogue individuals inside some government who are prepared to jeopardize their own lives. The terrorists, notes Mueller, would then have to spirit it &quot;hundreds of miles out of the country over unfamiliar terrain, and probably while being pursued by security forces.&quot; Then comes the task of building a bomb. It's not something you can gin up with spare parts and power tools in your garage. It requires millions of dollars, a safe haven and advanced equipment—plus people with specialized skills, lots of time and a willingness to die for the cause. And if Al Qaeda could make a prototype, another obstacle would emerge: There is no guarantee it would work, and there is no way to test it. Assuming the jihadists vault over those Himalayas, they would have to deliver the weapon onto American soil. Sure, drug smugglers bring in contraband all the time—but seeking their help would confront the plotters with possible exposure or extortion. This, like every other step in the entire process, means expanding the circle of people who know what's going on, multiplying the chance someone will blab, back out or screw up. Mueller recalls that after the Irish Republican Army failed in an attempt to blow up British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it said, &quot;We only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always.&quot; Al Qaeda, he says, faces a very different challenge: For it to carry out a nuclear attack, everything has to go right. For us to escape, only one thing has to go wrong. .<br />

<br />
The technical capacity of groups to produce or acquire and effectively deliver unconventional weapons varies considerably. Achieving catastrophic outcomes with unconventional weapons requires a considerable scale of operations. Only in a very few cases have groups been able to amass the skills, knowledge, material, and equipment to perpetrate attacks with unconventional weapons on a scale that comes close to that of the danger posed by terrorist attacks with conventional explosives. To date, only Aum Shinrikyo and Al Qaeda have been able to achieve the scale of operations required to mount serious unconventional weapons programs, but even these two groups have encountered difficulties. Aum Shinrikyo, which had considerable financial resources, front companies, and members with scientific talents, failed in all 10 of its biological weapons attacks. n18 Similarly, the group's sarin attack on the Tokyo subway caused roughly the same number of fatalities as the average Palestinian suicide bomber attack. n19 Aside from some minor efforts to develop the toxin ricin, Al Qaeda and its affiliated groups tend to use explosives delivered by suicide attackers as its weapon of choice. During the last 25 years, terrorist attacks with unconventional weapons have inflicted far fewer casualties and fatalities than indiscriminate terrorist bombings or suicide hijackings, n20 the tragic toll of the September 11 attacks being the most pronounced example. In cases where terrorists have used unconventional weapons in the past, they mostly have used crude toxic materials, not sophisticated, military-grade weapons. Aum is the one group that developed a chemical agent that is commonly found in military arsenals. Otherwise, most cases have involved limited efforts to use industrial materials or industrial by-products as weapons. Toxic warfare can pose considerable security challenges, but on balance, these types of threats pale in comparison to the catastrophic terrorist attacks for which government authorities prepare in tabletop exercises. n21 In a survey of 60 tabletop exercises for federal departments and agencies, only a handful involve non -- military-grade weapons agents. An apparent lack of interest on the part of terrorist groups in acquiring unconventional weapons also helps explain why unconventional weapons attacks are so rare. In the case studies on the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the FARC, and Hamas, political vision, practical military utility, and moral codes all restrained them in part from seeking and using unconventional weapons. In some cases, group leaders indicated to members that the use of chemical or biological weapons would not be legitimate to their struggle. Hamas leader Abu Shannab, for one, stated that the use of poison was contrary to Islamic teachings.<br />

One reason al Qaeda and &quot;al Qaeda types&quot; seem not to be trying very hard to repeat 9/11 may be that that dramatic act of destruction itself proved counterproductive by massively heightening concerns about terrorism around the world. No matter how much they might disagree on other issues (most notably on the war in Iraq), there is a compelling incentive for states -- even ones such as Iran, Libya, Sudan, and Syria -- to cooperate in cracking down on al Qaeda, because they know that they could easily be among its victims. The FBI may not have uncovered much of anything within the United States since 9/11, but thousands of apparent terrorists have been rounded, or rolled, up overseas with U.S. aid and encouragement. Although some Arabs and Muslims took pleasure in the suffering inflicted on 9/11 -- Schadenfreude in German, shamateh in Arabic -- the most common response among jihadists and religious nationalists was a vehement rejection of al Qaeda's strategy and methods. When Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979, there were calls for jihad everywhere in Arab and Muslim lands, and tens of thousands flocked to the country to fight the invaders. In stark contrast, when the U.S. military invaded in 2001 to topple an Islamist regime, there was, as the political scientist Fawaz Gerges points out, a &quot;deafening silence&quot; from the Muslim world, and only a trickle of jihadists went to fight the Americans. Other jihadists publicly blamed al Qaeda for their post-9/11 problems and held the attacks to be shortsighted and hugely miscalculated.The post-9/11 willingness of governments around the world to take on international terrorists has been much reinforced and amplified by subsequent, if scattered, terrorist activity outside the United States.<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">In the years after 9/11, the images we were shown of terrorists were largely the same: shadowy jihadists who, even when they were foiled, seemed always to have come terrifyingly close to pulling off a horrific attack. We’ve all become familiar by now with the stock footage of Talibs in black shalwar kameezes zipping across monkey bars or, more recently, perfecting kung fu kicks in some secret training camp. Even in the aftermath of the botched Times Square bombing earlier this spring, the perception persists that our enemies are savvy and sophisticated killers. They’re fanatical and highly organized—twin ideas that at once keep us fearful and help them attract new members.But this view of the jihadist community is wildly off the mark. To be sure, some terrorists are steely and skilled—people like Mohamed Atta, the careful and well-trained head of the 9/11 hijackers. Their leaders and recruiters can be lethally subtle and manipulative, but the quiet truth is that many of the deluded foot soldiers are foolish and untrained, perhaps even untrainable. Acknowledging this fact could help us tailor our counterterrorism priorities—and publicizing it could help us erode the powerful images of strength and piety that terrorists rely on for recruiting and funding. Nowhere is the gap between sinister stereotype and ridiculous reality more apparent than in Afghanistan, where it’s fair to say that the Taliban employ the world’s worst suicide bombers: one in two manages to kill only himself. And this success rate hasn’t improved at all in the five years they’ve been using suicide bombers, despite the experience of hundreds of attacks—or attempted attacks. In Afghanistan, as in many cultures, a manly embrace is a time-honored tradition for warriors before they go off to face death. Thus, many suicide bombers never even make it out of their training camp or safe house, as the pressure from these group hugs triggers the explosives in suicide vests. According to several sources at the United Nations, as many as six would-be suicide bombers died last July after one such embrace in Paktika. Many Taliban operatives are just as clumsy when suicide is not part of the plan. In November 2009, several Talibs transporting an improvised explosive device were killed when it went off unexpectedly. The blast also took out the insurgents’ shadow governor in the province of Balkh. When terrorists do execute an attack, or come close, they often have security failures to thank, rather than their own expertise. Consider Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab—the Nigerian “Jockstrap Jihadist” who boarded a Detroit-bound jet in Amsterdam with a suicidal plan in his head and some explosives in his underwear. Although the media colored the incident as a sophisticated al-Qaeda plot, Abdulmutallab showed no great skill or cunning, and simple safeguards should have kept him off the plane in the first place. He was, after all, traveling without luggage, on a one-way ticket that he purchased with cash. All of this while being on a U.S. government watch list. Fortunately, Abdulmutallab, a college-educated engineer, failed to detonate his underpants. A few months later another college grad, Faisal Shahzad, is alleged to have crudely rigged an SUV to blow up in Times Square. That plan fizzled and he was quickly captured, despite the fact that he was reportedly trained in a terrorist boot camp in Pakistan. Indeed, though many of the terrorists who strike in the West are well educated, their plots fail because they lack operational know-how. </span><br />

The possibility of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United States is widely believed to be a grave, even apocalyptic, threat and a likely possibility, a belief supported by numerous statements by public officials. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, “the inevitability of the spread of nuclear terrorism” and of a “successful terrorist attack” have been taken for granted.48 Coherent policies to reduce the risk of a nonstate actor using nuclear weapons clearly need to be developed. In particular, the rise of the Abdul Qadeer Khan nuclear technology network should give pause.49 But again, the news is not as grim as nuclear alarmists would suggest. Much has already been done to secure the supply of nuclear materials, and relatively simple steps can produce further improvements. Moreover, there are reasons to doubt both the capabilities and even the interest many terrorist groups have in detonating a nuclear device on U.S. soil. As Adam Garnkle writes, “The threat of nuclear terrorism is very remote.”50 Experts disagree on whether nonstate actors have the scientific, engineering, financial, natural resource, security, and logistical capacities to build a nuclear bomb from scratch. According to terrorism expert Robin Frost, the danger of a “nuclear black market” and loose nukes from Russia may be overstated. Even if a terrorist group did acquire a nuclear weapon, delivering and detonating it against a U.S. target would present tremendous technical and logistical difficulties.51 Finally, the feared nexus between terrorists and rogue regimes may be exaggerated. As nuclear proliferation expert Joseph Cirincione argues, states such as Iran and North Korea are “not the most likely sources for terrorists since their stockpiles, if any, are small and exceedingly precious, and hence well-guarded.”52 Chubin states that there “is no reason to believe that Iran today, any more than Sadaam Hussein earlier, would transfer WMD [weapons of mass destruction] technology to terrorist groups like al-Qaida or Hezbollah.”53 Even if a terrorist group were to acquire a nuclear device, expert Michael Levi demonstrates that effective planning can prevent catastrophe: for nuclear terrorists, what “can go wrong might go wrong, and when it comes to nuclear terrorism, a broader, integrated defense, just like controls at the source of weapons and materials, can multiply, intensify, and compound the possibilities of terrorist failure, possibly driving terrorist groups to reject nuclear terrorism altogether.” Warning of the danger of a terrorist acquiring a nuclear weapon, most analyses are based on the inaccurate image of an “infallible tenfoottall enemy.” This type of alarmism, writes Levi, impedes the development of thoughtful strategies that could deter, prevent, or mitigate a terrorist attack: “Worst-case estimates have their place, but the possible failure-averse, conservative, resource-limited ªve-foot-tall nuclear terrorist, who is subject not only to the laws of physics but also to Murphy’s law of nuclear terrorism, needs to become just as central to our evaluations of strategies.”54 A recent study contends that al-Qaida’s interest in acquiring and using nuclear weapons may be overstated. Anne Stenersen, a terrorism expert, claims that “looking at statements and activities at various levels within the al-Qaida network, it becomes clear that the network’s interest in using unconventional means is in fact much lower than commonly thought.”55 She further states that “CBRN [chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear] weapons do not play a central part in al-Qaida’s strategy.”56 In the 1990s, members of al-Qaida debated whether to obtain a nuclear device. Those in favor sought the weapons primarily to deter a U.S. attack on al-Qaida’s bases in Afghanistan. This assessment reveals an organization at odds with that laid out by nuclear alarmists of terrorists obsessed with using nuclear weapons against the United States regardless of the consequences. Stenersen asserts, “Although there have been various reports stating that al-Qaida attempted to buy nuclear material in the nineties, and possibly recruited skilled scientists, it appears that al-Qaida central have not dedicated a lot of time or effort to developing a high-end CBRN capability. . . . Al-Qaida central never had a coherent strategy to obtain CBRN: instead, its members were divided on the issue, and there was an awareness that militarily effective weapons were extremely difficult to obtain.” 57 Most terrorist groups “assess nuclear terrorism through the lens of their political goals and may judge that it does not advance their interests.”58 As Frost has written, “The risk of nuclear terrorism, especially true nuclear terrorism employing bombs powered by nuclear mission, is overstated, and that popular wisdom on the topic is significantly ºawed.”59<br />

Space debris could be nudged out of the way using a moderately sized Earth-based laser, a team of NASA researchers suggests in a new paper. The laser wouldn’t blast the debris to smithereens, but combined with a ground-based telescope, it could be used to move space junkinto a different orbit so it would not collide with other debris or important spacecraft. Space debris has already threatened the International Space Station, and satellites are in harm’s way all the time. But most of the time, the station or satellite in question can be moved out of the way, letting the space junk continue on its orbital path. It’s easier to fire a couple thrusters than to throw out a giant space net, tether or solar sail. The laser system would take the opposite tack, nudging space junk and letting satellites stay put. It would ideally be based near one of the Earth’s poles, and would use photon pressure to disturb an object’s orbit, according to James Mason and colleagues at NASA’s Ames Research Center. Photons would target the debris every time it passed over the laser, and with enough pressure, it could nudge an object out of orbit enough to avoid a future collision. It could even be used to de-orbit the space junk entirely, perhaps by moving it low enough that atmospheric drag causes it to re-enter the atmosphere — so long as it's small enough to burn up, so there would be no laser-propelled garbage raining down on Earth. Previous space junk removal concepts have proposed blowing up or incinerating the debris, but a laser powerful enough to blow up some orbiting garbage would also be powerful enough to blow up some strategic assets, too. It’s a non-starter for political reasons. This laser is pretty weak, however, at just 5 kilowatts. Mason and colleagues say it could nudge up to 10 objects a day. They say it could reverse the “Kessler syndrome,” a phenomenon wherein new debris formation outstrips the pace at which it falls out of orbit and burns up. As Technology Review's arXiv blog explains, it’s named for NASA scientist Donald Kessler, who described the problem in the 1970s. He said colliding space junk could trigger a cascade of collisions that would create ever more space debris in ever more unpredictable orbits. This may already be happening, as evidenced by the collision between the Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 satellites in January 2009, as well as China’s destruction of its Fengyun 1C satellite in 2007. Both incidents created ongoing problems.<br />

If nothing is done, a kind of orbital crisis might ensue that is known as the Kessler Syndrome, after Kessler. A staple of science fiction, it holds that the space around Earth becomes so riddled with junk that launchings are almost impossible. Vehicles that entered space would quickly be destroyed. In an interview, Kessler called the worst-case scenario an exaggeration. &quot;It's been overdone,&quot; he said of the syndrome. Still, he warned of an economic barrier to space exploration that could arise. To fight debris, he said, designers will have to give spacecraft more and more shielding, struggling to protect the craft from destruction and making them heavier and more costly in the process. At some point, he said, perhaps centuries from now, the costs will outweigh the benefits<br />

The biggest challenge, however, will be simply starting the process of active debris removal. Despite growing consensus within the space debris community that active removal will be needed over the next several decades, the fact that space activities continue today without signiﬁcant interference causes the larger global community to not see space debris as an issue. Moreover, space suffers from the “tragedy of the commons,” a phenomenon that refers to the overexploitation of a shared resource when there is no clear ownership over it. This, in addition to the abovementioned challenges facing debris removal systems, means that the natural tendency of those in power will likely be to do nothing until they absolutely must. This is reminiscent of responses to climate change, where the failure of governments to take responsibility for their past actions and act preemptively is compromising the larger global good. Policy makers must therefore take necessary actions, as recommended in next section of this paper, to prevent what is now happening on Earth from also occurring in space.<br />

Space debris detection and tracking are integral to space debris elimination. Every elimination technology requires a supporting detection system in order to determine debris position, velocity and heading. Tracking systems are designed to keep records of information gathered from the detection systems, and computers are used to generate real time space environment models. Currently, these models provide information that is used for space mission operations. The largest detection, tracking and cataloging system in the world is currently the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). The SSN is comprised of U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force ground-based radars and optical sensors at 25 sites worldwide.148 The SSN currently tracks over 8,000 space objects of which approximately 93% represents space debris.149 The SSN is limited to tracking space debris that is greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter.<br />

<br />
The United States and Russia, as well as other countries, have already undertaken some measures that probably substantially reduced the danger of an accidental launch – reductions of their nuclear arsenals and de-targeting agreements. It has been argued that a combination of these steps with a political decision not to use launch on warning as an option, which countries could make unilaterally (and not necessarily openly), would be enough to reduce the risk of an accidental launch to an acceptably low level. Reductions of strategic forces and the transformation of the U.S.-Russian relationships that accompanied them, as well as various cooperation programs, were probably the most important and most effective steps toward reducing the risk of an accident. In addition to that, in 1994 the United States and Russia agreed to remove targeting information from their strategic missiles.[15] Later Russia and the United States reached similar agreements with other countries.[16] While de-targeting and a political decision not to rely on launch on warning are indeed important steps, they cannot eliminate the risk of an accident completely, since they leave the technical capability to conduct a launch on warning intact. Neither of these decision seems to have changed operational practices of the strategic forces, which include launch on warning as a possible scenario. For example, according to one of the U.S. nuclear policy documents, the United States does not rely on its capability for launch on warning or launch under attack to ensure the credibility of its deterrent. At the same time, the US ability to carry out such options complicates Russian assessments of war outcomes and enhances deterrence.[17] Recent statements of the U.S. military strongly suggest that this policy of maintaining the capability to launch on warning has not been changed since this document was adopted.[18] Russia has never publicly disclosed the degree to which it relies on launch on warning in operations of its strategic forces. It does, however, continue to maintain and upgrade its early warning system, so we have to assume that the technical capability to implement a launch-on-warning strike has been preserved. Although the United States and Russia have made great progress in transforming their relationships, we should not overestimate the extent to which they were successful in translating these changes into operational practices of their strategic forces and the assumptions about nominal adversary that guide their day-to-day operations.[19] Neither does it help that the military on both sides continue to conduct exercises of their strategic forces that include scenarios with nuclear strikes on U.S. or Russian territory.[20] An argument has been made that in peacetime, when considered “in the context of information about the general state of relations between the potential adversaries”, a warning is unlikely to be considered credible, and therefore it will not lead to a decision to retaliate.[21] This is only partially correct, since, first, an accident can be severe enough to immediately change the context and, second, understanding of “the general state of relations between countries” may be changed quite dramatically by short-term developments. Even if the general state of relationships is very good, they can occasionally suffer significant setbacks that might negatively affect the context in which the leadership would make the assessment of the situation. In this situation neither de-targeting nor a political decision not to launch on warning could adequately protect the United States and Russia from the risk of an accident. These steps could be easily reversed in real time if the warning provided by the early-warning system is considered serious enough to trigger retaliation, as it might be the case if the system reported a large-scale attack.<br />

Trend 6.1: US and Russia lead in general capability to detect rocket launches, while US leads in the development of advanced technologies to detect direct attacks on satellites —The ability to distinguish space negation attacks from technical failures or environmental disruptions is critical to maintaining international stability in space. Early warning also enables defensive responses, but the type of protection available may be limited. Only the US and Russia can reliably detect rocket launches. US Defense Support Program satellites provide early warning of conventional and nuclear ballistic missile attacks; Russia began rebuilding its aging system in 2001 by upgrading its Oko series satellites. France is developing two missile-launch early-warning satellites—Spirale-1 and -2. Most actors have a basic capability to detect a ground-based electronic attack, such as jamming, by sensing an interference signal or by noticing a loss of communications. It is very difficult to obtain advance warning of directed energy attacks that move at the speed of light<br />

The device uses the pressure of sunlight to get around in space, and atmospheric gases make the deployed sail act like a parachute, slowing it down so that it &quot;drags&quot; the satellite. Lead researcher Vaios Lappas says that the CubeSail could become the standard add-on system for end-of-mission, low-cost de-orbiting of satellites with a mass of less than 500 kg.

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Space weaponization isn’t inevitable—due to its unquestionable dominance in space capabilities, the U. S. can choose for the entire world whether or not space weapons will be deployed</span></strong><br />

<br />
The fallacy of the inevitability argument is that, in the short run at least, the United States is the only country that possesses the resources and capabilities necessary to deploy space weapons. This has never been the case in American history. As one historian notes, from the &quot;development of ironclad warships in the 1860s, Dreadnought battleships after 1900, or atomic weapons in the 1940s,&quot; different nations were simultaneously developing the same technology. This left a choice to the different governments to either take the lead in the arms race or get passed by. In the space weapons debate, in contrast, &quot;the United States can unilaterally [for the time being] choose whether space will be weaponized. &quot; Consequently, the United States controls the inevitability of space weaponization. This conviction is dangerously close to evolving into a self–fulfilling prophecy that simply cannot be refuted`<br />

Most in Washington still embraces the notion that America is, and forever will be, the world’s indispensable nation. Some scholars, however, questioned the logic of hegemonic stability theory from the very beginning. A number continue to do so today. They advance arguments diametrically at odds with the primacist consensus. Trade routes need not be policed by a single dominant power; the international economy is complex and resilient. Supply disruptions are likely to be temporary, and the costs of mitigating their effects should be borne by those who stand to lose — or gain — the most. Islamic extremists are scary, but hardly comparable to the threat posed by a globe-straddling Soviet Union armed with thousands of nuclear weapons. It is frankly absurd that we spend more today to fight Osama bin Laden and his tiny band of murderous thugs than we spent to face down Joseph Stalin and Chairman Mao. Many factors have contributed to the dramatic decline in the number of wars between nation-states; it is unrealistic to expect that a new spasm of global conflict would erupt if the United States were to modestly refocus its efforts, draw down its military power, and call on other countries to play a larger role in their own defense, and in the security of their respective regions. But while there are credible alternatives to the United States serving in its current dual role as world policeman / armed social worker, the foreign policy establishment in Washington has no interest in exploring them. The people here have grown accustomed to living at the center of the earth, and indeed, of the universe. The tangible benefits of all this military spending flow disproportionately to this tiny corner of the United States while the schlubs in fly-over country pick up the tab.<br />

<br />
In this article I challenge Brooks and Wohlforth. I show that the unipolar era already is visibly drawing to a close. Three main drivers explain the impending end of the Pax Americana. First, the rise of new great powers—especially China—is transforming the international system from unipolarity to multipolarity. Second, the United States is becoming the poster child for strategic over-extension, or as Paul Kennedy (1987) dubbed it, imperial overstretch. Third, the United States’ relative economic power is declining. In particular, mounting US fiscal problems and the dollar’s increasingly problematic role as the international financial system’s reserve currency are undermining US hegemony. To comprehend why the Pax Americana is ending we need to understand the linkages among these trends, and how each has feedback effects on the others. After examining how these trends undermine the Brooks and Wohlforth argument for unipolar stability and the durability of US hegemony, I conclude by arguing that over the next two decades the Pax Americana’s end presages dramatic changes in international politics—the outlines of which already are visible.<br />

The world is paying a heavy price for the instability created by the combination of globalization and unipolarity, and the United States is bearing most of the burden. Consider the case of nuclear proliferation. There’s effectively a market out there for proliferation, with its own supply (states willing to share nuclear technology) and demand (states that badly want a nuclear weapon). The overlap of unipolarity with globalization ratchets up both the supply and demand, to the detriment of U. S. national security. It has become fashionable, in the wake of the Iraq war, to comment on the limits of conventional military force. But much of this analysis is overblown. The United States may not be able to stabilize and rebuild Iraq. But that doesn’t matter much from the perspective of a government that thinks the Pentagon has it in its sights. In Tehran, Pyongyang, and many other capitals, including Beijing, the bottom line is simple: The U. S. military could, with conventional force, end those regimes tomorrow if it chose to do so. No country in the world can dream of challenging U. S. conventional military power. But they can certainly hope to deter America from using it. And the best deterrent yet invented is the threat of nuclear retaliation. Before 1989, states that felt threatened by the United States could turn to the Soviet Union’s nuclear umbrella for protection. Now, they turn to people like A. Q. Khan. Having your own nuclear weapon used to be a luxury. Today, it is fast becoming a necessity.<br />

Escalation of violence isalso basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchangesof violent acts can escalate to levels unimaginedby the participants before hand. Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible. In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possiblewith the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild Westof the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear ‘six-shooters’ on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations.<br />

S. Can Thrive as Other Powers Rise and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. , “The False Promise of Primacy”]<br />
One unquestionable success of the Obama administration so far has been to turn the page on the failed Bush foreign policy framework. Not so, says Robert Kagan, who reveals a perverse nostalgia for the previous paradigm in recent writings. To understand why, you have to remember that American foreign policy leaders during the Bush administration clung to the false promise of primacy, the belief that the lynchpin of American security was for it to remain more powerful than all other countries by a huge, fixed margin. Mona Sutphen and I described why this was a misguided strategy in our 2008 book, The Next American Century: How the U. S. Can Thrive As Other Powers Rise, but the proof is in the pudding. And in the end, the primacy strategy didn’t deliver. Primacy tempted our leaders into a reckless war in Iraq; it did not prevent North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons; it did nothing to slow China’s influence, as was its implicit goal; and it wrecked, with Moscow’s help, our relationship with Russia. A fixation on primacy paradoxically managed to undermine the influence and authority America did have. Nevertheless, the fact that the Bush administration embraced the notion of primacy was a comfort to the remaining Cold Warriors. President Barack Obama’s approach is different, to say the least. His political allies and his detractors can agree that Obama sees foreign policy not in terms of asserting America’s unparalleled might, but of seeking common cause, including with other major powers. On the one-year mark of his presidency, the contours of the new paradigm are fairly clear: Lead the world in addressing shared challenges Treat other governments and peoples, friends and foes, with respect Forge strategic collaborations with big, pivotal powers and demand responsibility from them on global challenges Reinvigorate and repair existing alliances Reengage with international institutions and rules, pushing for increased accountability Make basic political and economic rights available to more people, knowing that democratic government is the best way to achieve this goal As for primacy, Obama dismissed that as a strategy goal in his inaugural address when he observed, “Our power alone cannot protect us. ” Later, in Moscow, Obama elaborated on his view of great power relations, saying, “a great power does not show strength by dominating or demonizing other countries…[G]iven our interdependence, any world order that tries to elevate one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail. The pursuit of power is no longer a zero-sum game—progress must be shared. ” Robert Kagan now accuses President Obama of reorienting American foreign policy away from its WWII and Cold War roots, focusing on how “to adjust” to the decline in American primacy instead of trying to reverse it. He portrays administration officials as naïve ideologues, buttering up autocracies and forsaking our democratic allies. Kagan’s analyses fail to discuss two major developments that demand a new approach—the increased potency of transnational threats and the new salience of domestic policy in America’s world standing. Kagan writes as if the Obama administration is engaging with re-emerging powers to prove an ideological point that great power strife is a relic of history. Yet no staffer that I have ever spoken with would suggest that these relationships are beyond rivalry. More importantly, Kagan does not reveal the Obama administration’s reasons for pursuing strategic collaborations with China, Russia, India, and other pivotal powers. In fact, these partnerships are necessary to protect Americans from common threats in terrorists, global warming, economic crises, nuclear proliferation, and pandemics such as swine flu—the forces of disorder that can and do affect Americans right here at home. Kagan barely mentions these threats, but to keep its own people safe, America needs Russia to secure its loose nuclear materials so terrorists cant get it, China—the world’s largest emitter—to cut down on its carbon, India to help track extremists, and all of them to contain pandemics. How can we get these big, proud countries to take these steps? Aggressive diplomacy. Transnational threats also explain why the Obama administration is taking international institutions seriously. It’s not because the president is looking to attend more international meetings; it’s because international rules and institutions play a vital coordinating role when threats cross borders. The WHO led the battle against swine flu last year just as the IMF bailed out a slew of countries headed toward financial ruin. Fortunately, international architecture and traditional alliances are not mutually exclusive, as Kagan would imply. It’s still early days, but the Obama approach is paying dividends. China has agreed to limit its carbon intensity. And, for the first time last year, China not only voted for tough U. N. sanctions against Pyongyang—it also enforced them, in contrast to Kagan’s assertion that the administration has failed to gain “any meaningful Chinese help in North Korea. ” Russia has allowed the United States to transport supplies through its territory into Afghanistan. The Global initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, co-chaired by the United States and Russia, is up and running again. A successor to the START treaty to reduce our arsenal of nuclear weapons is not yet complete, but it’s on the way. And these nations and others agreed during the darkest days of the financial crisis to coordinate their macroeconomic moves. Iran remains a challenge, but Beijing and Moscow did recently join in a harsh rebuke that the International Atomic Energy Agency issued. Of course, we continue to have differences with these pivotal powers, including on human rights and democracy. Kagan is simply wrong to suggest that administration officials have failed to “continue to press Russia and China for reform. ” They have, just not in a grandstanding, provocative way that ends up being counterproductive. Here, for example, is what President Obama said in Moscow: The arc of history shows us that governments which serve their own people survive and thrive; governments which serve only their own power do not. Governments that represent the will of their people are far less likely to descend into failed states, to terrorize their citizens, or to wage war on others. Governments that promote the rule of law, subject their actions to oversight, and allow for independent institutions are more dependable trading partners. And in our own history, democracies have been America’s most enduring allies, including those we once waged war with in Europe and Asia—nations that today live with great security and prosperity. And here is what he said in Beijing a few months later: Finally, as I did yesterday in Shanghai, I spoke to President Hu about America's bedrock beliefs that all men and women possess certain fundamental human rights. We do not believe these principles are unique to America, but rather they are universal rights and that they should be available to all peoples, to all ethnic and religious minorities. And our two countries agreed to continue to move this discussion forward in a human rights dialogue that is scheduled for early next year. Where does Kagan get the idea that Obama is not a champion for liberal democracy? The difference is that the Obama staffers have no illusions about how hard it is to impose a liberal transformation from the outside. Every country has to forge its own future. America can help, but we can’t call the shots. Kagan also accuses administration officials of squandering American primacy. “Instead of attempting to perpetuate American primacy,” he writes, “they are seeking to manage what they regard as America’s unavoidable decline relative to other great powers. ” The truth is that America’s relative decline is, in fact, unavoidable in the short term. That’s just a matter of definition when China’s economy is growing at 8 percent or 10 percent, India’s at 6 percent, and ours not at all. It won’t always be this way, but it is now. Rather than pretending otherwise, the administration is facing and addressing this uncomfortable fact. Because while it is true that our toughest global challenges require cooperation, American power is a vital ingredient to securing the best possible future for Americans. Kagan declines to mention domestic policy, yet rebuilding American strength is, at the end of the day, a task for us here at home. Behind every great power is a great economy. We can try to perpetuate our power and influence all we like, but if our economy doesn’t begin to grow steadily again in the years to come, all our scrimping will be for naught—we simply will not be able to afford the tools for an expansive foreign policy, not to mention rising living standards for future Americans. Growing American strength is not about rhetoric; it involves tough political choices. Getting politicians to prioritize long-term success over short-term gain is never easy. The unifying theme of President Obama’s domestic agenda is retooling America so it can prosper in the global economy. That is what the health care debate, investments in basic science, green technologies, and public education are all about. , not to mention the banking rules designed to prevent another bubble/bust cycle. All of these investments would be a lot easier if the last administration hadn’t committed a trillion dollars to a needless war. Talk about squandering primacy. America will bounce back. And it will continue to be an indispensible nation, not because of our unassailable power, but because of our ideas, our flexibility, and our leadership – the strengths that in fact enabled our still vast military superiority. Fortunately, Barack Obama has proven to be a leader that reads America’s virtues broadly, and enlists others in their promise. Perhaps it is simply too inclusive a world-view for those that miss the clarity of a bipolar ideological contest. But as Obama has pointed out, such clarity is a luxury we can no longer afford.<br />

Looking for a sign of when the multipolar moment suddenly seemed real? You could do worse than mark the day when Brazil and Turkey -- two of the world's most avidly internationalist emerging powers -- joined together this May to announce they had stepped in to broker a nuclear-fuel swap deal with Iran that potentially -- though sadly not actually -- paved the way toward a peaceful solution to the standoff. Turkey and Brazil aren't superpowers, nor are they permanent U. N. Security Council members. But just as U. S. President Barack Obama came into office preaching a renewed focus on multilateralism, rising powers are reminding us that respect for hierarchy is no longer on anyone's agenda. What a difference a couple of decades makes. A little over 20 years ago, then U. S. President George H. W. Bush -- who had just witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall and saw the Soviet Union disintegrating before his very eyes -- stood at the granite podium of the U. N. General Assembly in New York and proclaimed a &quot;new world order,&quot; a U. S. -dominated international system &quot;where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. &quot; Two decades later, the &quot;new new world order&quot; we are in fact living looks almost nothing like what Bush -- and most Americans -- imagined or hoped. The United States still has the world's most powerful military, of course, but its utility is diminishing as the capacity to deter and resist spreads. Just look at Iraq and Afghanistan. Military might and political influence no longer necessarily go together, and too much of the former can even undermine the latter. More fundamentally, the world has quickly become multipolar, with the European Union a larger economic player than the United States while China rises quickly on all measures of hard and soft power. Obama couldn't give the &quot;New World Order&quot; speech today; he'd have to negotiate it first with his peers in Brussels and Beijing. And as for democracy: Meet authoritarian state capitalism, a new entry into our lexicon that underscores the non-Western options every state can pursue today. Nobody's talking about the Washington Consensus anymore -- instead the Beijing Consensus, the Mumbai Consensus, and even something only half-jokingly called the Canuck Consensus are competing for the hearts and minds of global elites. Rather than a world of alliances, it's a world of multi-alignment. Globalization means never having to choose sides. Look at the Persian Gulf states. They make big-ticket arms deals with Washington, buying weapons to recycle their petrodollars and deter Iran; sign huge trade agreements with China, where ever more of their oil flows; and negotiate currency arrangements with the European Union. If there is any doubt as to the general lack of foresight that governs international relations today, just consider how America has ceased certain joint weapons production with Israel as punishment for Israel's selling sensitive technology to China, which in turn sells missile technologies to Iran, whose leadership wishes to eradicate Israel from the map. Everyone is playing everyone else in what seem like endless single-iteration prisoner's dilemma games. Bush Sr. chose to give the speech at the United Nations for a reason: America was the preeminent power, but he was a multilateralist. Paralyzed during the Cold War, the United Nations now had a chance toplay the central role as arbiter of global governance for which it was envisioned. But rather than personify multilateralism itself, the United Nations is proving to be at best just one manifestation of it. Free-standing functional agencies like the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund -- which has only become more important in the wake of the financial crisis -- are our only effective global bodies, and they are solely economic in nature. But the G-20 has hardly lived up to its billing as the new &quot;steering committee for the world. &quot; Before the most recent Seoul summit, world leaders described U. S. proposals for harmonizing current account surpluses and deficits as &quot;clueless. &quot; The Security Council has long ceased to be legitimate or effective, with little prospect for reform in sight. As we learned so painfully this year, the United Nations can't forge a global climate deal and can't make the world meet the Millennium Development Goals. For every issue there are now several specialized agencies, like the World Food Program and Office of the U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees, that mostly secure their own funding contributions and are evolving at their own pace. The closest thing we have to multilateral governance happens on a regional level, and it is far more promising, whether the deeply entrenched and supranational European Union, the rejuvenated Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or the nascent African Union. Each is building a regional order tailored to its members' priorities and level of development. On Sudan and Somalia, it's Uganda leading the new diplomatic and peacekeeping push. For Palestine, the Arab League is considering a peacekeeping force. And on Iran, Turkey is now in the lead. The world of 1990 was expected to remain fundamentally international. Yet instead its very structure has changed as globalization has empowered legions of transnational nonstate actors from corporations to NGOs to religious groups. As a result, today's world features overlapping and competing claims to authority and legitimacy. The Gates Foundation gives away more money each year than any European country. Villagers in Nigeria expect Shell to deliver the goods, not their government. And Oxfam shapes the British development agency's priorities more than the reverse. Neither the United States nor the United Nations can put the genie back in the bottle. With each passing year, deal-making at Davos and the Clinton Global Initiative become more important than the glacial advance of empty declarations at international summits. These and other venues are the places where the &quot;new new world order&quot; is being built. And it's happening from the bottom up rather than the top down.<br />

 <strong>No chance of US – Sino war --- no incentive for China</strong><br />

China will not mount a military challenge to the US any time soon. Its economy and living standards have grown so quickly over the past two decades that it’s hard to imagine the kind of catastrophic event that could push its leadership to risk it all. Beijing knows that no US government will support Taiwanese independence, and China need not invade an island that it has largely co-opted already by offering Taiwan’s business elite privileged investment opportunities.<br />

<br />
Finally, China has 100-400 nuclear weapons. But only the 18 silos mentioned above are capable of striking the western continental United States and these cannot be launched quickly. Unless fired as a first-strike weapon, they could easily be destroyed. The United States, on the other hand, has almost 10,000 nuclear warheads and sufficient delivery capabilities to obliterate every Chinese city with a population of a half-million or more, and still have more than enough of a stockpile to hold the rest of the world at bay.<br />

<br />
Far from inevitable, the possibility of war between the United States and China is reduced by numerous factors: the enormous volume of trade and investment between the two powers chief among them. The same economic mechanisms are also drawing Taiwan and the PRC ever closer. Close examination of Beijing’s current terms for unification, in particular Jiang Zemin’s “eight points,” yields the conclusion that a political settlement of the Taiwan issue is not beyond the realm of possibility. 179 Such an outcome would do much to forestall the tendencies toward rivalry that characterized United States–China relations<br />

<br />
In addition to the Bush Administration’s tougher stand, there is another important consideration that has prompted Beijing to take a more conciliatory stand: to mobilize for war, China would have to mobilize the populace, and recent history suggests that once aroused, they can be difficult to control. 11 In 1989 the student protests that ended in the Tiananmen Massacre, began as a memorial march for Hu Yaobang, whom they regarded as a force for political liberalization. It turned into a protest against government corruption and mishandling of the economy. The leadership, split by indecision, failed to respond quickly to suppress it. As a consequence, the movement spread across the country, becoming a threat to the regime. It took 180,000 troops in central Beijing to reassert control. In May 1999, when the U. S. accidentally bombed the PRC embassy in Belgrade, the Chinese leadership sought to orchestrate anti-American demonstrations. However, once again the situation got out of hand. The U. S. consulate in Chengdu was torched, and the embassy in Beijing was seriously damaged. It was apparent that even a call to national pride was fraught with dangers for the regime. As a result, when a PRC fighter collided with a U. S. EP-3 surveillance plane near Hainan Island, the leadership did not permit any public demonstrations, limited press commentary, and regulated internet discussion of the incident. It is clear that the regime has reason to fear any mobilization of the people. Like the Cultural Revolution, mass movements can quickly spin out of control. Therefore, it is inconceivable that the regime would risk mobilizing a populace, which has already voiced a desire for political liberalization, to crush a functioning Chinese democracy (Taiwan), with which it has growing economic and cultural ties.<br />

<br />
Most importantly, the Chinese know better than anyone that they lack – and will continue to lack for some time – the power to afford serious military provocations. Any military scenario that generates a collision with the United States would be a calamity for China. The United States could blockade China at will and thus completely halt China's foreign trade and oil imports. Even short of that, as already noted, a serious conflict in the region could generate yet another nightmare for China: a militarily advanced and politically aroused Japan that is detached from the United States. By far the better course for China is to husband its strength, promote its own economic growth, patiently foster Taiwan's economic dependence on the mainland, and subtly promote a distinctive Asian po1itical identity through the cultivation of an Asian economic community that eventually entices Japan. China's political interest in promoting such a distinctive community, one not tied to America, has been evidently growing. In it, the Chinese expect that they would have the loudest political voice – and America would have to listen. The Chinese not only know that they need peace in the Far East to make that possible, they also know that with peace, China stands a good chance of becoming, quite literally, the global factory – the world's center for manufacturing investments and the world's main exporter of finished manufactured products. In that respect, China is already putting out of business some traditional industrial sectors in the highly developed economies – inc1uding America's – and even in such economically developing rivals as India. Chinese firms are also beginning to buy out some bankrupt Japanese firms in Southeast Asia. The Chinese sense that over the next two decades or so, the cumulative effect of this trend could make China the dominant trade power as well as the political leader of Asia. In any case, the year 2008 can serve as a marker for the minimum period of China's continued external prudence. The 2008 Olympics, to be hosted in Beijing, are simply too important to China's self-image and too vital to its socioeconomic success to be jeopardized by an international crisis of China's own making. That applies as much to the Taiwan Straits as to North Korea. Moreover, the Chinese elite sense that their country’s internal political and social tensions are rising, potentially even posing a threat to the stability of the system as a whole. Among the many factors likely to produce political and social unrest, two stand out: the younger generation’s increased access to the Internet and the growing signs of social inequality. The first is breaking down the Communist Party's long-established monopoly on information. Approximately 35 million Chinese are Internet users, and studies show that they are mainly younger, relatively well-off educated males – and therefore full of social and political aspirations. They tend to rely on the Internet as a prime source of information, and they prefer to seek this information from non-domestic sources. In an interesting comparison, only 4 percent of Japanese Internet users were visiting non-Japanese sites, whereas 40 percent of Chinese users visited non-Chinese sites. Secondly, growing social inequality is likely to pose an intensifying challenge to the regime's formally egalitarian doctrines. Even the official Communist Party organ has publicly acknowledged that &quot;the gap between the rich and the poor has begun to widen and is widening further, and contradictions in distribution have become increasingly obvious. . . . Contradictions and conflicts are getting more antagonistic. ” Other Chinese studies report that social inequality has already reached &quot;dangerous levels. ” In sum, for the next decade at least, and probably longer, China is unlikely to see itself as ready to pose a serious political challenge to the existing international pecking order. That gives America time to prod East Asia in the direction of a modified replay of Europe's post-1950 success, and away from a replay of Europe's post-1914 disaster. The United States has a decade or so to translate the emerging informal political equilibrium among itself, Japan, and. China into a more structured security relationship capable of absorbing the various strains and rivalries inherent in today's politically awakened but institutionally underdeveloped East Asia. But the needed structures and cooperative arrangements will not congeal on their own.<br />

Japan recently made serious strides toward leading exploration and implementation of space-based solar power. While many countries (US excluded) have set goals for domestic renewable energy production, Japan has literally set loftier goals, announcing ambitions to collect solar power in space by 2030. That solar power would be harvested as part of Japan’s Space Solar Power System (SSPS), in which solar arrays several square miles in size would hover in a geosynchronous orbit above Japan and beam collected solar energy down to receivers on earth via lasers or microwave radiation. Intense, right? Adding a notable level of seriousness to its plan, Japan has selected a consortium of industry giants to make their science-fiction plan a reality. These include Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, Fujitsu and Sharp, led by researchers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). JAXA researchers’ primary goal is a one-gigawatt SSPS that would produce home solar power at eight yen per kilowatt-hour, six times cheaper than the current cost of electricity in Japan. Solar power in space has key advantages that could contribute to such low costs. Solar energy in space is much more concentrated than here on Earth and obstacles such as clouds and even nightfall can be mitigated. Obviously, there are huge obstacles to overcome in achieving such a stellar goal. Not least of which are cost, transporting the components to space, accurately and safely beaming the solar power to earth, as well as security issues. Yet Japan has been working on the project for 11 years already and apparently has reached a level of confidence in which they’re willing to publicly set goals and hire high-tech companies to participate.<br />

China's rapidly growing need for electric power results in projects like the Three Gorges Dam, and a regular progression of coal-fired power plants being built across the country. The environmental devastation is staggering. Yet the economic boon has helped fund China's space program, one which generates considerable national pride. China's government is also famously forward-looking. China will probably be the first country to develop SSP on a large scale.<br />

 Launching SPS alone would take 32,000 years, and one SPS alone would require 280 heavy lift vehicle launches over a period of 8 years.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Two problems stand out in regard to launching the material required for SPS. One is the cost and the other is scheduling the large number of launches that would be required. The number of launches required per SPS depends on the mass of one SPS and the assumed lift capability of the launch vehicle. The number of launches per year depends on the previous two quantities plus the assumed rate at which SPS systems are deployed. It has already been noted that an estimate for the mass of a 5GW SPS is about 35,500MT based on significant advances in solar cell technology. While some studies have assumed that a HLV capable of lifting 400 to 500MT to LEO will be developed, the 125 MT-to-LEO HLV presently being developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) for human lunar and Mars missions is more realistic. Delivery of one 5 GW SPS would require about 280 launches with this vehicle. It is not clear how frequently such heavy-lift launches can be implemented from ground facilities, but it seems likely that they might be limited to an upper limit of perhaps one launch per month per launch site. If there were say, three heavy-lift launch sites, each capable of sending up HLVs at the rate of one per month, the entire set of 280 launches for one SPS could be carried out in about eight years. To send up an entire family of 4000 such satellites would take 32,000 years at this rate. Even with the assumed super HLV capable of lifting 500 MT to LEO, it would still require 6000 years to establish the entire fleet of SPS, although one could establish the capability for say, sixty GW of power on Earth in one century. </span><br />

The largest solar panels ever deployed in space are currently being used on the International Space Station. They cover more than 830 square meters and are 73 meters long and 11 meters wide. These large panels make the ISS one of the brightest objects in the night sky. Scaling up from there to something much larger would be challenging, but the good news is that we can take one thing at a time. For a proof of concept satellite it makes sense to use the station’s solar panels as a baseline. By taking advantage of improvements in solar cell technology we could launch a demonstration satellite of the same size that generates up to 3 times as much power. The station’s solar panels are 14% efficient, but recent advances with solar cells and solar concentrators could allow us to build panels that are up to 50% efficient. If this demonstration system validated the theory behind generating power in space and beaming it down to Earth, the next step would be figuring out how to put even bigger solar panels in space. It </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="Underline">may be that with our current launch options it simply isn’t possible to launch an operational solar power system into orbit.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">A multitude of issues hang over the SPS concept. These are summarized briefly below. . It is not clear how many SPS can be safely placed into GEO. . The greatest technical and economic challenge of the SPS concept is the problem of transporting huge amounts of mass to GEO. Two problems stand out in regard to launching the materiel for SPS. One is the cost and the other is scheduling the large number of launches that would be required. . Orbit-raising from LEO to GEO is another major challenge for SPS. Use of reusable SEP vehicles has been proposed for this purpose, but this approach has significant problems. The viability of the SEP tug concept depends critically on use of hypothetical high-efficiency lightweight solar arrays that are likely to be difficult to develop, and lightweight propulsion components. Radiation would gradually diminish the efficiency of the solar arrays with each passage through the radiation belts. . The size and scope of the solar arrays needed by SPS are orders of magnitude beyond the scope of any solar arrays ever used in space missions. . Assembly on-orbit is another major challenge. On-orbit construction requires a massive construction facility in involving hundreds of astronauts working continuously over several decades. While most concept papers assume assembly in LEO and transport of the assembled SPS to GEO via SEP, Reference [4] claims that assembly in lower orbits is not viable due to space debris and radiation. . Degradation of the solar cells and their optical coverings due to the space environment. . Research planned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in 1979 on environmental effects does not seem to have been carried out to completion, leaving many uncertainties. . In order for SPS to have any hope of becoming economically competitive, large reductions must be made in current launch and orbit-raising costs and the mass of solar arrays per kW generated must also be reduced significantly. It is not clear how feasible this will be. . Of equal importance is the fact that no revenues are generated until the entire system is complete and operational. The very large cost-to-first power characteristic will be unattractive to investors. . The outstanding international legal issues that might affect SPS development include: (1) jurisdiction over the placement of satellites in GEO; (2) provisions against environmental disturbances; and (3) military uses of space.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Robert Zubrin has argued against the cost effectiveness of the SPS using current technology capabilities.15 Based on a 50% transmission coefficient from solar-generated electric power in space to power at the buss bar we can estimate that the power generated by the solar array for a 2-GW SPS must be 4GW. Current solar array technology can produce about 50W=kg; therefore, the mass of the solar array using current technology is estimated to be 8_104 MT. If the remainder of the system is neglected, and only the solar array is included, the cost of delivering the solar array to GEO becomes the determining factor in the SPS cost. Zubrin estimated the current cost to deliver one MT of payload to GEO at 40 million dollars. Thus, the cost to deliver the entire array to GEO is 8_104MT_$40_106=MT or 3.2 trillion dollars. Zubrin suggested that the total cost of the entire SPS system, when all the other subsystems are included, might be about double this value or roughly 6 trillion dollars. He then went on to show that the cost of the SPS is several thousand times the cost of conventional power plants, and the annual interest alone on a 3 trillion dollar investment would be unaffordable. The fact that terrestrial power plants require fuel would not affect the conclusion substantially. The bottom-line cost of electric power to the consumer would be over a thousand times the cost from conventional sources. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is widely agreed that costs for launch and delivering to GEO will constitute a major part of the total cost of any SPS. These transportation costs depend directly on the mass that must be transported to space. Hence, the mass of a SPS is a critical factor in estimating the installation cost, which in turn, affects the viability of SPS concepts. Several SPS concepts have been put forward, but most of the detailed analyses of SPS were done on early concepts in the late 1970s. Furthermore, it is difficult to project the mass of systems that lie so far in the future. A NASA study3 estimated the mass of a five GW SPS Reference System to be in the range 34,000 to 51,000 metric tons (MT). This was based on a system with an overall efficiency of 7% (i.e., 7% of the solar energy impinging on the arrays of the SPS ends up as power fed to the grid on Earth). This implies that to provide 5GW of power on Earth, 70GW of solar power must be intercepted by a large solar array. Using the solar intensity at one Astronomical Unit (AU), about 1367W=m2 (watts per meter squared), suggests that the size of such a solar array is about 50km2 (kilometer squared) or 7_7 km. Assuming that the solar array has an efficiency of _13%, this would imply that it generates about nine GW (0.13_70GW) of electric power in space. Current solar arrays have specific power of 50 to 80W=kg (watts per kilogram). Some studies assumed that in the future, this may be increased to say, 400W=kg using thin film arrays. With this assumption, a 70-GW array with a conversion efficiency of say 13% would weigh approximately 9_109 (W)=400(W=kg) or 22,500 MT. The mass of the associated microwave antenna has been estimated to be about 13,000 MT, so the mass of a SPS to deliver 5GWat Earth would be estimated on this basis to be about 35,500MT without contingency allowance. Using currently available solar arrays, it would be a good deal higher. Current costs to deliver mass to GEO are around forty million dollars per MT, so the cost to merely deliver such a SPS to GEO would be a prohibitive at 1400 billion dollars.4 Most advocates of SPS assume that launch costs can be reduced by factors of up to 100 in the future. With this assumption, the cost to deliver such a SPS to GEO would be reduced to fifteen billion dollars. However, the basis for assuming such reductions in launch costs is a generic expectation that costs go down as activity increases. </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Full solvency requires AT LEAST one hundred million metric tons delivered to GEO, an absurd figure in terms of launch facilities, frequency, and cost.</span></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">There are many difficulties in the SPS concept, but the need to transport huge masses to GEO appears to be the most formidable impediment. Indeed, for a complete fleet of SPS to provide the entire world’s energy, the required mass in GEO would exceed 100,000,000MT, and perhaps several times that figure. Transporting that amount of mass to GEO is unimaginable in terms of implied launch facilities and the required frequency of heavy lift launches, not to mention the cost. But even a system to provide 5% of the world’s energy, would weigh 5,000,000MT.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is well known that it is difficult to estimate the cost of a small space mission on the order of 1 billion dollars. As the years go by, it has found that all cost estimates are typically low and all projects overrun. To compensate, NASA requires that after preparing detailed cost estimates, mission proposals must tack on additional cost reserves to account for unforeseen factors that will inevitably drive up the mission cost. Such small space missions typically utilize mainly proven technology. We can then imagine how difficult it must be to estimate the cost of a futuristic enterprise, much greater in scope than a small space mission, which utilizes many new, unprecedented technologies and systems. Two critical aspects of the SPS cost are: (1) future launch and orbit-raising costs per MT; and (2) mass of future solar arrays per kW generated in GEO. If one utilizes current data for these factors, the cost of an SPS is clearly unaffordable. However, a number of investigators have made various projections of significant future reductions in these quantities—and even then, the projected cost of an SPS is very high; although some have argued that under those assumed conditions it can become cost-effective. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Reference [31] emphasized that current overall cost estimates for the SPS and its major components are highly uncertain. The assessments of up-front costs range from $40 billion to $100 billion. The NASA reference design calls for a 22-year investment of $102.4 billion (1977 dollars), including transportation and factory investment costs to produce the first 5GWsatellites, with each additional satellite costing $11.3 billion. Based on past experience, it is expected that such estimates will be low—possibly very low. Reference [12] goes on to say that opponents believe these cost estimates are unrealistically low, and the cost of SPS would significantly increase as SPS is developed—as in other aerospace projects and the Alaskan pipeline. Most opponents also do not believe that SPS will be cost competitive and argue that the amount of energy produced by SPS would not justify its large investment cost. </span><br />

The viability of the SEP tug concept depends critically on use of hypothetical high-efficiency lightweight solar arrays that are likely to be difficult to develop, and lightweight propulsion components. Radiation would gradually diminish the efficiency of the solar arrays with each passage through the radiation belts. . The size and scope of the solar arrays needed by SPS are orders of magnitude beyond the scope of any solar arrays ever used in space missions. . Assembly on-orbit is another major challenge. On-orbit construction requires a massive construction facility in involving hundreds of astronauts working continuously over several decades. While most concept papers assume assembly in LEO and transport of the assembled SPS to GEO via SEP, Reference [4] claims that assembly in lower orbits is not viable due to space debris and radiation. . Degradation of the solar cells and their optical coverings due to the space environment. . Research planned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in 1979 on environmental effects does not seem to have been carried out to completion, leaving many uncertainties. . In order for SPS to have any hope of becoming economically competitive, large reductions must be made in current launch and orbit-raising costs and the mass of solar arrays per kW generated must also be reduced significantly. It is not clear how feasible this will be. . Of equal importance is the fact that no revenues are generated until the entire system is complete and operational. The very large cost-to-first power characteristic will be unattractive to investors. . The outstanding international legal issues that might affect SPS development include: (1) jurisdiction over the placement of satellites in GEO; (2) provisions against environmental disturbances; and (3) military uses of space.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Advocates of the SPS concept have projected significant reductions in future launch and orbit-raising costs. Reference [16] states that published SPS cost estimates are based on a launch cost of $150=kg. However, these estimates remain controversial. For example, present-day launch and space assembly costs are greater than two orders of magnitude higher than the desired $150=kg. While NASA expects launch costs to decrease by a factor of 100 by 2025 and by a factor of 1000 by 2040, ESA [European Space Agency] is less optimistic. In a corresponding report, ESA assumed transportation costs of $1500=kg. However, in the same report it was suggested that transportation costs may be reduced to $200=kg in the future. Fetter argued that launch costs must be less than $200 to $460 per kg to enable SPS as compared to the current cost to low-Earth orbit of about $10,000 per kg.17 Thus, it is claimed that launch costs must fall by a factor of 20 to 50 simply to allow SPS to break even with terrestrial solar power. However, Criswell suggests that launch costs would have to be reduced by a factor of 10,000 to make SPS competitive.18 Reference [7] emphasized that many of these goals for launch costs and for system mass and cost must be significantly lower if the system is to produce competitive terrestrial power. Reference [5] echoed this by saying that launch costs are the single most important parameter in assessing the economic viability of solar power satellites. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thus, even if a launch is purely private, the respective government will be held liable for damages. The U.S. government took this into account by creating liability insurance requirements. In the case of SBSP satellites, however, many dozens of launches may be required to put all of the components of an SBSP system into orbit, so the failure to successfully launch one or more modules may have the unusual consequence of putting the entire project off schedule. Thus, the damage questions may be more complicated than typical launch failures.</span><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Work by the engineers designing the SPS 2000 system has led to the assessment that the project's largest risk is the technical risk arising from relying on 100% automatic deployment of the satellite. Since it is not uncommon even today for satellites to suffer a failure in the deployment of an antenna or solar panel, the probability of a problem arising with the automatic deployment of a 200 ton satellite some 300 metres in dimensions, and comprising several different payloads which are to dock autonomously, must be assessed as much higher. Indeed, unless this risk can be reduced very substantially, it seems unlikely that this project could be selected for funding as such.</span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Why Haven’t Solar Sats Been Built in Orbit Until Now? The single hurdle is the economics of launching them. Based on estimates we have gotten from several aerospace firms, the total cost of mass producing all the solar sat components (including the cells, the guidance and transmitting equipment) works out to about $2,000 per pound. It takes about 2 pounds of these components to generate and transmit 1 kilowatt of electricity to the antenna. But it costs $10,000 to $20,000 per pound to get these components up to this 22,000 mile altitude. Launching robot assemblers controlled from Earth to put these components together nearly double this cost. Launching and housing astronauts in orbit to do this assembly would double it again. Solar satellites can physically be built, but at the above costs their electricity would have to sell for $5 per kWh to even approach breakeven. </span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Relatively little work has been done on assembly of the SPS in space. An URSI study briefly examined several scenarios in which assembly was carried out in GEO or in a lower orbit.6 Another scenario involves rapid transport of thin-film cells to GEO to avoid cell degradation by radiation. In these scenarios, assembly at lower altitudes (assembly at 500 km) is undesirable due to debris impacts. The debris problem can be avoided by carrying out assembly at altitudes above 3000 km. However it was concluded that the SPS should not be assembled at any altitude between 3000km and 11,000km due to degradation of the cells in the radiation environment. Other papers on the SPS seem to imply assembly in LEO. This remains an issue that requires further study.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">SPS proponents assume development of an SEP vehicle for “orbit-raising” from LEO to GEO. </span></em><br />
<br />
<em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This isn’t feasible- multiple reasons.</span></strong></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In principle, a reusable solar electric propulsion (SEP) system could be used for orbit-raising and return. The spacecraft is spiraled out from the starting orbit to its destination. This approach minimizes the propellant required for the transfer, at the cost of increased transfer time. With its much higher specific impulse, the amount of propellant required would be greatly reduced. However, a number of issues would have to be dealt with: . degradation of the solar cell performance when passing through the radiation belts; . orbit-raising requires a very large solar array; . developing and implementing high-performance ion thrusters; . slow spiraling out of the SEP vehicle (several months required for transfer) creates time delays and operational scheduling difficulties; . a fast ‘‘personnel taxi’’ powered by chemical propulsion would be needed to transport workers to GEO to avoid the radiation exposure with SEP; and . the requirement for Xenon (Xe) propellant for SEP would far exceed world production levels. While most SPS studies have assumed that reusable solarelectric orbit transfer vehicles would routinely drag huge masses from LEO to GEO, this approach is problematic. Orbit raising looms as a potential ‘‘show-stopper’’ for SPS as is launching to LEO.</span></em><br />
<br />
<em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Frequency allocation and tort liability for damage caused by microwaves are legal barriers which will block use of SPS.</span></strong></em><br />
<br />

<em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In 1979, at the ITU’s World Administrative Radio Conference, the U.S. raised the question of allocating a frequency position for future SPS testing; the proposal was referred to a specialized study group for evaluation and future decision. Allocation decisions by the ITU have been characterized by debate over the ‘‘first-come first-serve’’ tradition, whereby first users have priority in the use of frequencies and orbital slots. Newly space-capable states as well as least developed countries (LDCs), and others who intend to develop such capabilities in the future, have urged since 1971 that all states have ‘‘equal rights’’ to frequencies and positions, and the ITU has called both the radio spectrum and the geostationary orbit ‘‘limited natural resources’’ that ‘‘should be most effectively and economically used.’’ A number of LDCs have proposed that space be reserved for their future use. Since there is no legal basis for permanent utilization or ownership of positions, the possibility of future reallocation clearly has considerable support among LDCs. Established users such as the U.S. remain opposed to a priori assignment of slots and frequencies. Again, the ITU debate is part of LDC attempts to gain leverage. SPS development could be affected by attempts of disaffected states to block development by denying frequency allocations, or by making consent contingent on concessions by states with the most interest in SPS. International law has not established international microwave exposure standards. Nonetheless, the Liability Convention has established international tort law rules. If microwave transmissions of energy from geostationary levels were to cause harm to plants, animals, and tangible items, the Convention would cover the subject. It is difficult to summarize the legal and political aspects of beamed solar power. Clearly, there are serious issues involved in allocating space in GEO or on the Moon to specific projects and countries, but perhaps more vexing problems would be caused by filling up atmosphere with microwave or laser beams with as-yet unclear impacts on biota. The ramifications if there is a system failure or an act of terrorism are difficult to imagine. It is perhaps not an exaggeration to suppose that the political and legal aspects may be as challenging as technical and economic aspects. </span></em><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Without Earth's atmosphere to protect them, satellites are exposed to the full force of solar radiation, including ultraviolet rays, X-rays, positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. n16 Ultraviolet rays and X-rays can damage satellites by degrading solar panels, which many satellites use as a source of energy, thus shortening their useful life. n17 When solar activity increases, the number of damaging rays also increases. The charged particles can cause even more damage than the rays because the particles penetrate the outer layers of the satellite and directly degrade its electronic systems. Unlike the rays, which are generally evenly distributed around Earth, the particles become trapped in Earth's magnetic field and concentrate in two doughnut-shaped (torus) areas around the equator. n18 These regions are called the Van Allen radiation belts. n19 The Van Allen radiation belts significantly limit the operation of satellites.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">A further problem is that satellites in geosynchronous orbit are outside the Earth's magnetosphere, leaving them open to bombardment by charged particles. This will drastically limit their lifetime compared to ground-based systems. A satellite in geosynchronous orbit will see a flux of 6·1013 (1 MeV electrons) cm-2 year-1 (with considerable variation year-to-year depending on solar flare activity). A 1 Mega electron volt particle is highly energetic and more than enough to break bonds and eject K and L-shell electrons from semiconductors. A solar cell in geosynchronous orbit will typically lose 5-6 % of its performance per year. Compare that to ground based units that are guaranteed to provide 90 % power after 12.5 years, or a loss of 0.8 %/year. We can see that even if a space solar panel receives 8× the insolation of a ground based unit, it will in fact produce less energy over its much shorter lifetime. The wikipedia article claims a lifetime of 20 years but that is not realistic. The economics suffer as a result.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">February 23, 2009 The concept of Space-Based Solar Power (SBSP) has been doing the rounds for decades with fantastic claims of 24 hour a day solar power beamed from space via microwave to any point on earth. A start up company called Space Energy, Inc says it plans to develop SBSP satellites to generate and transmit electricity to receivers on the Earth's surface. To do this, the company plans to create and launch a prototype satellite into low earth orbit (LEO). The hitch: this concept is based on as yet unproven technology. SBSP was theorized over 40 years ago by renowned scientist Dr. Peter Glaser. Since then, in response to periodic energy crises, the idea has been re-evaluated from time to time by the U.S. Department of Energy, NASA, major aerospace companies and countries such as Japan and India. Solar power satellites are large arrays of photovoltaic panels assembled in orbit, which use microwave radio waves to transmit solar power to large receiving antennas on Earth. The resulting power can either supplement, or be a substitute for, conventional electricity sources. The advantage of placing solar collectors in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO), about 36,000 kilometres (22,500 miles) above Earth, is that it uses the constant and unobstructed output of the Sun, unaffected by the Earth's day/night cycle. By contrast, ground-based solar power provides a vital and valuable addition to the Earth's energy needs, but is limited by these factors: Weather Variable seasons Atmospheric blocking of sunlight Poor direct sunlight at higher and lower latitudes Because none of these factors applies in outer-space, an orbiting SBSP station can supposedly provide an estimated 6-8 times more power than a comparable solar cell on the Earth's surface. Here’s where the entire concept falls flat. Space Energy, Inc claims that a successful long-range wireless power transmission test was conducted in mid-2008, that supposedly transmitted a microwave beam (similar to the kind that would be used to transmit energy from space to Earth) between two Hawaiian Islands across 148 kilometres - more than the distance from the surface of the Earth to the boundary of space. They claim this test demonstrated the technical feasibility of transmitting SBSP to Earth. Less than 1/1000th of 1% received Unfortunately for Space Energy, Inc and the entire concept of space based solar power, the actual test results conducted for a Discovery channel documentary proved a total failure. The former NASA executive and physicist who organized the experiment, John Mankins, admitted in a press conference that the $1 Million budget spent of the experiment resulted in less than 1/1000th of 1% of the power transmitted being received on the other island. The most successful test of wireless power transmission over any distance at high efficiency was conducted by Bill Brown in 1975. Using a NASA deep space tracking dish they transmitted 30kw over 1.6 km (1 mile) at 82.5% efficiency at the Goldstone Deep Space Communication Complex. A Since Geostationary orbit is 36,000 km (22,500 miles) away from earth the space based power station needs to efficiently transmit power over twenty thousand times further than has ever been achieved to date. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hoffert is wary of Solaren's latest step forward and the company's promise of delivering 200 megawatts to PG&amp;E utility customers in California by 2016. Hoffert estimates that Solaren could manage to get about 50 percent transmission efficiency in a best-case scenario, meaning that half of the energy collected by space solar panels would be lost in the transfer down to Earth. Solaren would then need to launch a solar panel array capable of generating 400 megawatts. The total launch weight of all the equipment would be the equivalent of about 400 metric tons, or 20 shuttle-sized launches, according to Hoffert. But Solaren says that it would just require four or five heavy-lift rocket launches capable of carrying 25 metric tons, or about one fourth of Hoffert's weight estimate. The company is relying on developing more efficient photovoltaic technology for the solar panels, as well as mirrors that help focus sunlight. &quot;Solaren?s patented SSP [space solar power] system dramatically reduces the SSP space segment mass compared to previous concepts,&quot; Boerman told SPACE.com. Solaren has not provided details on just how its technology works, citing intellectual property concerns. But it expects that its space solar power can convert to RF energy with greater than 80 percent efficiency, and expects similar conversion efficiency for converting the RF energy back to DC electricity on the ground in California. The company also anticipates minimal transmission losses from the space to the ground. Hoffert remains unconvinced without knowing the details of Solaren's technology. He frets that &quot;premature optimism&quot; over unproven and perhaps scientifically implausible concepts could end up ruining the reputation of space solar power, even as advocates desperately want to see their vision come true. &quot;Too many space power guys have been silent, perhaps to not give comfort to opponents,&quot; Hoffert noted in a recent e-mail to colleagues. &quot;But scientists should not do this.&quot;</span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">NEW DELHI: Competition over controlling the planet's water resources will increase among nations in the next decade but will not lead to war, says UNDP's policy specialist Arunabha Ghosh. Hydrologists have set 1,700 cubic metres per person as the minimum amount of water needed to grow food, support industries and maintain the environment. At present, 800 million people across the globe live below this threshold. According to UNDP's Human Development Report 2006, by 2025, over 3 billion people would be living under water stress. Putting to rest the theory of water wars between countries who share rivers and lakes, Ghosh told TOI, &quot;In past 50 years, 37 stray incidents of violence have taken place between countries over water, 30 of which have been in the Middle East. However, none of them were wars. The last war fought over water was 4,000 years ago. Also in the last 50 years, over 200 treaties on water were negotiated between countries. India and Pakistan, despite two wars and constant geopolitical tension, have for half a century jointly managed shared watersheds through the Permanent Indus Water Commission.&quot;</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This paper investigates the reality of historic water conflict and draws lessons for the plausibility of future &quot;water wars.&quot;The datasets of conflict are explored for those related to water -- only seven minor skirmishes are found in this century; no war has ever been fought over water. In contrast, 145 water-related treaties were signed in the same period. These treaties, collected and catalogued in a computerized database along with relevant notes from negotiators, are assessed for patterns of conflict resolution.War over water seems neither strategically rational, hydrographically effective, nor economically viable. Shared interests along a waterway seem to consistently outweigh water's conflict-inducing characteristics. Furthermore, once cooperative water regimes are established through treaty, they turn out to be impressively resilient over time, even between otherwise hostile riparians, and even as conflict is waged over other issues. These patterns suggest that the more valuable lesson of international water is as a resources whose characteristics tend to induce cooperation, and incite violence only in the exception.</span><br />

In this section we describe the main results of the estimate of the overall CO2 emission from constructing and operating the SPS system. Table 3 shows that the CO2 released by the SPS system would be some 1. 58 billion tons, which is about 25 more than the 1. 2 billion tons of CO2 released by Japan during 1990. Notably, the quantity released by the rockets used to launch the SPS satellites is relatively low. The major components are the CO2 released in producing the photo-voltaic panels, which is some 60 of the total, and that from the rectenna which is some 30 of the total. The CO2 released by maintenance is not included, however, since data is not available:if the maintenance ratio of the satellite and rectenna is 1 per year, the overall CO2 emission would increase by some 30.<br />

The UK's MailOnline did just that this week under the headline The mini ice age starts here. Lead paragraph? &quot;The bitter winter afflicting much of the Northern Hemisphere is only the start of a global trend towards cooler weather that is likely to last for 20 or 30 years, say some of the world's most eminent climate scientists. &quot; Right. MailOnline reporter David Rose doesn't call them &quot;the world's leading climate skeptics. &quot; He calls them &quot;some of the world's most eminent climate scientists&quot;--and he goes on to cite &quot;Mojib Latif, a leading member of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),&quot; &quot;Anastasios Tsonis, head of the University of Wisconsin Atmospheric Sciences Group,&quot; and &quot;William Gray, emeritus Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Colorado State University. &quot; Contrary to fears of inexorably diminishing Arctic sea ice, Rose cites the U. S. National Snow and Ice Data Center as reporting that &quot;Arctic summer sea ice has increased by 409,000 square miles, or 26 per cent, since 2007. &quot; Though snow's been unusual for most of the southern half of the United Kingdom in recent decades, the Mail published the accompanying satellite photo of Great Britain during the recent cold snap. The island is essentially all covered with snow. Rose reported record lows as far south as Cuba--something I can attest to, living near Miami in south Florida, where we experienced sub-freezing weather over the weekend. He quoted Tsonis as saying that last week 56% of the United States was covered by snow--something that hasn't happened in several decades. And the &quot;'Arctic oscillation'--a weather pattern that sees the development of huge 'blocking' areas of high pressure in northern latitudes, driving polar winds far to the south . . . is at its strongest for at least 60 years. As a result, the jetstream--the high-altitude wind that circles the globe from west to east and normally pushes a series of wet but mild Atlantic lows across Britain--is currently running not over the English Channel but the Strait of Gibraltar. &quot; Consequently, most of the Northern Hemisphere is much colder this winter than it's been in decades--and the Southern Hemisphere is cooler, too. According to Rose, Latif, Tsonis, and other scientists attribute the cold shift primarily to a shift in the world's dominant ocean circulations--the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation--from a warm phase to a cool phase, something that happens about every 20 to 30 years. &quot;The scientists' predictions also undermine the standard climate computer models, which assert that the warming of the Earth since 1900 has been driven solely by man-made greenhouse gas emissions and will continue as long as carbon dioxide levels rise. They say that their research shows that much of the warming was caused by oceanic cycles when they were in a 'warm mode' as opposed to the present 'cold mode'. &quot; That's a point made by Dr. Roy W. Spencer in the science chapter of the Cornwall Alliance's new document A Renewed Call to Truth, Prudence, and Protection of the Poor: An Evangelical Examination of the Theology, Science, and Economics of Global Warming and illustrated in the graph below. &quot;A significant share of the warming we saw from 1980 to 2000 and at earlier periods in the 20th Century was due to these cycles,&quot; said Latif, &quot;perhaps as much as 50 per cent. They have now gone into reverse, so winters like this one will become much more likely. Summers will also probably be cooler, and all this may well last two decades or longer. The extreme retreats that we have seen in glaciers and sea ice will come to a halt. For the time being, global warming has paused, and there may well be some cooling. &quot; Tsonis also believes that the ocean current cycles dominated global climate change in the 20th century, including the post-1970s, the period many point to as driven by human greenhouse gas emissions, but he doesn't venture to attribute specific percentages to the natural and human causes. &quot;I do not believe in catastrophe theories,&quot; Rose quoted him as saying. &quot;Man-made warming is balanced by the natural cycles, and I do not trust the computer models which state that if CO2 reaches a particular level then temperatures and sea levels will rise by a given amount. These models cannot be trusted to predict the weather for a week, yet they are running them to give readings for 100 years. &quot; Gray went farther: &quot;Most of the rise in temperature from the Seventies to the Nineties was natural. Very little was down to CO2--in my view, as little as five to ten per cent. &quot; Gray, Tsonis, and Latif all agreed that the findings about the ocean currents undermined the credibility of the computer climate models on which the IPCC and other alarmists rely.<br />

Solar panels don’t come falling out of the sky – they have to be manufactured. Similar to computer chips, this is a dirty and energy-intensive process. First, raw materials have to be mined: quartz sand for silicon cells, metal ore for thin film cells. Next, these materials have to be treated, following different steps (in the case of silicon cells these are purification, crystallization and wafering). Finally, these upgraded materials have to be manufactured into solar cells, and assembled into modules. All these processes produce air pollution and heavy metal emissions, and they consume energy - which brings about more air pollution, heavy metal emissions and also greenhouse gases.<br />

Climate change is essentially irreversible, according to a sobering new scientific study. As carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise, the world will experience more and more long-term environmental disruption. The damage will persist even when, and if, emissions are brought under control, says study author Susan Solomon, who is among the world's top climate scientists. &quot;We're used to thinking about pollution problems as things that we can fix,&quot; Solomon says. &quot;Smog, we just cut back and everything will be better later. Or haze, you know, it'll go away pretty quickly. &quot; That's the case for some of the gases that contribute to climate change, such as methane and nitrous oxide. But as Solomon and colleagues suggest in a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, it is not true for the most abundant greenhouse gas: carbon dioxide. Turning off the carbon dioxide emissions won't stop global warming. &quot;People have imagined that if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide that the climate would go back to normal in 100 years or 200 years. What we're showing here is that's not right. It's essentially an irreversible change that will last for more than a thousand years,&quot; Solomon says. This is because the oceans are currently soaking up a lot of the planet's excess heat — and a lot of the carbon dioxide put into the air. The carbon dioxide and heat will eventually start coming out of the ocean. And that will take place for many hundreds of years. Solomon is a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Her new study looked at the consequences of this long-term effect in terms of sea level rise and drought.<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">Yesterday, the Defense Department announced the results of its Renewable Energy Project Review, undertaken to determine the impact of renewable energy use on military missions, and the results are very promising. Of the 249 projects under consideration (including wind turbines and solar power, to be undertaken in 35 states and Puerto Rico), 229 would have little or no negative impact on missions. These projects, which will produce more than 10 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, are great news for both the military and the country. For the military, “These new energy projects will increase the nation’s energy security while ensuring that our military services have the test capabilities, training venues, and equipment to help keep America safe.” Our nation’s servicemen and women know all too well the price that our nation has paid for continued reliance on fossil fuels. According to Rocky Mountain Institute’s Amory Lovins, over 1000 soldiers have been killed simply transporting fuel, deaths that could have been avoided with renewable energy use. Furthermore, the DoD pays a staggering $2 billion every day in direct fuel costs. The costs, both human and monetary, associated with fueling military equipment directly affect the success of our missions in the Middle East. The military is acutely aware of its need to find reliable sources of fuel that do not affect readiness and are not vulnerable to sabotage, and the Renewable Energy Project Review demonstrates definitive action on this issue. For American civilians, these projects mean new jobs: “green” sector jobs that will improve military readiness abroad while building our economy at home. Defense Department investment in renewable energy projects is an important step toward protecting our military personnel abroad, improving readiness, and promoting clean and reliable fuel sources that can drive sustainable economic growth. Energy is one of the tremendous security challenges our nation will face this century, and the DoD is providing excellent leadership by investing in renewable sources of energy.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">A Forward Operating Base (FOB) exists to support a small number of reconnaissance and surveillance teams as well as for military power projection ahead of primary forces. As such, the FOB can be anywhere from 50 to 5000 personnel because it is task-organized and scales to meet the size of the assigned task(s). Provision of electrical energy to the FOB must be viewed as a necessary commodity. The FOBs tend to be in remote, relatively inaccessible areas, due to both terrain and location of opposing forces (OPFOR). Resupply missions are tradeoffs between the risk of sending in an armed convoy and the risk, and substantial additional costs, of air resupply. With basic assumptions of 1 to 3 kW/person at the FOB, generator usage can grow rapidly. An appropriate example is the mobile Command and Control center known as the Unit Operations Center (UOC) – the generator provided is 20 kW and consumes approximately half of a small trailer (the other half is occupied by an 8-ton environmental control unit and tent). The UOC is appropriately sized for use in an FOB and yet provides power only for itself. One innovative option is to have battlefield vehicles provide power for temporary operations – a concept demonstrated by the Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Targeting Vehicle (RST-V) – which was capable of providing 30 kW of prime power to external systems. While 30 kW may be adequate for temporarily powering the UOC, as was suggested by the prime vendor, it is inadequate for any larger installation. Currently, we use sets of semipermanent generators, set some distance away from the Command Operations Center (COC) in order to provide both thermal and noise abatement. Fuel and ammunition (designated the Forward Ammunition and Refueling Point or FARP) are likewise separated from the COC and living spaces for safety reasons. Could SBSP credibly provide power to the FOB? Any replacement for the generators would have to meet similar safety and density provisions to those currently in operation. One of the advantages of using liquid fuel is that it is relatively dense for the energy provided. The generators are relatively small and portable (towable) and usage is well understood. Many SBSP proposals limit power density to the equivalency of one Sun at ground level. This implies that for a FOB of 500 persons (medium task size, no air strip) we need 500 m 2 of antenna, energy conversion, and short-term storage equipment, and support systems to provide ~200 kW of power. Support would include the necessary security perimeter. Efficient microwave power transfer to such a small area would be challenging. Instead, much of the surrounding countryside would likely also benefit from the power transfer, OPFOR included. The size of the base in question is a critical factor. For microwave power reception from an SBSP satellite in space for sizable power provision while maintaining safe power densities, a contiguous elliptical area on the order of square kilometers will likely be required. This may limit applicability to infrastructure supporting tactical operations. Depending on the area and resources available for setting up a receiving array, forward bases, larger command posts, and supply depots may or may not be supportable with SBSP.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some observers believe that the American era is coming to an end, as the Western-oriented world order is replaced by one increasingly dominated by the East. The historian Niall Ferguson has written that the bloody twentieth century witnessed &quot;the descent of the West&quot; and &quot;a reorientation of the world&quot; toward the East. Realists go on to note that as China gets more powerful and the United States' position erodes, two things are likely to happen: China will try to use its growing influence to reshape the rules and institutions of the international system to better serve its interests, and other states in the system -- especially the declining hegemon -- will start to see China as a growing security threat. The result of these developments, they predict, will be tension, distrust, and conflict, the typical features of a power transition. In this view, the drama of China's rise will feature an increasingly powerful China and a declining United States locked in an epic battle over the rules and leadership of the international system. And as the world's largest country emerges not from within but outside the established post-World War II international order, it is a drama that will end with the grand ascendance of China and the onset of an Asian-centered world order. That course, however, is not inevitable. The rise of China does not have to trigger a wrenching hegemonic transition. The U.S.-Chinese power transition can be very different from those of the past because Chinafaces an international order that is fundamentally different from those that past rising states confronted. China does not just face the United States; it faces a Western-centered system that is open, integrated, and rule-based, with wide and deep political foundations. The nuclear revolution, meanwhile, has made war among great powers unlikely -- eliminating the major tool that rising powers have used to overturn international systems defended by declining hegemonic states. Today's Western order, in short, is hard to overturn and easy to join. This unusually durable and expansive order is itself the product of farsighted U.S. leadership. After World War II, the United States did not simply establish itself as the leading world power. It led in the creation of universal institutions that not only invited global membership but also brought democracies and market societies closer together. It built an order that facilitated the participation and integration of both established great powers and newly independent states. (It is often forgotten that this postwar order was designed in large part to reintegrate the defeated Axis states and the beleaguered Allied states into a unified international system.) Today, China can gain full access to and thrive within this system. And if it does, China will rise, but the Western order -- if managed properly -- will live on.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The security/interdependence nexus results in the exaggeration of threats to American strategic interests because it requires the United States to defend its core interests by intervening in the peripheries. There are three reasons for this. First, as Johnson points out, order-maintenance strategies are biased inherently toward threat exaggeration. Threats to order generate an anxiety “that has at its center the fear of the unknown. It is not just security, but the pattern of order upon which the sense of security depends that is threatened.”4’ Second, because the strategy of preponderance requires U.S. intervention in places that concededly have no intrinsic strategic value, U.S. policymakers are compelled to overstate the dangers to American interests to mobilize domestic support for their policies.42 Third, the tendency to exaggerate threats is tightly linked to the strategy of preponderance’s concern with maintaining U.S. credibility. The diplomatic historian Robert J. McMahon has observed that since 1945 U.S. policymakers consistently have asserted that American credibility is “among the most critical of all foreign policy objectives.” As Khalilzad makes clear, they still are obsessed with the need to preserve America’s reputation for honoring its security commitments: </span><br />

While it has been suggested that in the long term, space solar power (SSP) can provide all the clean, renewable energy Earth could possibly need (and then some), there has been less discussion on the most economic way to produce that power. If we want to build two or three solar power satellites, one obvious approach is to manufacture the parts on the ground, launch them into orbit, and assemble them there, just like the International Space Station. But a few power satellites won’t solve our energy or greenhouse gas problems. We’ll need more. To generate all the energy used on Earth today (about 15 terawatts) would require roughly 400 solar power satellites 10 kilometers across. Assuming advanced, lightweight space solar power technology, this will require at least 100,000 launches to bring all the materials up from Earth. But even 400 satellites won’t be enough.<br />

One still largely unpredictable source of environmental risks in space activities is the use of solar power satellites. Solar power satellites would collect solar energy in space, convert it first to electricity and then to microwave beams for transmission to Earth, where it would be reconverted into electricity. This 4would in principle be a non-polluting, practically unlimited power source. 1*' Solar power satellites can be positioned so that they receive constant direct sun light, which would enable the use of solar power also at night time and during less than optimal cloud conditions. Other advantages of solar power satellites are that there would be no need to use large terrestrial land areas, unlike with ground-based solar collectors. 1&quot; Solar power satellites may, however, have serious impacts on the space environment, and the possible transmission of solar power to Earth may not only harm the ozone layer but also impact life on the surface of the globe directly Furthermore, it could result in harmful electromagnetic interference with aerial navigation systems, for instance,106 Of particular concern is the long-term impact of exposure on humans and biota on the ground in the receiving area and in the airspace that the beams transverse. 1 ' Exploitation of solar power will also require orbital positions for the satellites, which will be potentially very large in size10* and thus more susceptible to collisions than smaller space objects. 107 It is likely that nor all of the risks connected to the utilization of solar power satellites arc even known in detail yet. Moreover, later on, lunar materials are likely to be used for the construction of solar power satellites and solar cells. This would entail new kinds of environmental concerns. Considering in particular the plans to establish permanent lunar colonics,110 and die lact that a research group has already managed to use simulated moon dust to make a key component of a working solar ccIL111 such concerns might become topical surprisingly soon.<br />

If Commerce will fund SSP development, the issue of launch costs will still need to be addressed. Launching satellites and related materials into space has remained extremely expensive for decades because the current market isn't big enough to justify the major investment required to develop new technology. Given the potential size of this new energy source, it would make sense for the US government to put money into R&amp;D. It would also help if the government subsidized launch costs for the first four full scale solar power satellites in return for a percent of the power produced for the life of the satellite. This could help to get the energy market moving in the direction of space. It may also help to address some of the power needs of our Department of Defense. To meet the demands of launching the components of four solar power satellites into geosynchronous orbit, the launch industry would have to rapidly up-size. Putting the power of the government behind this effort would assure development of improved facilities and technologies. Four satellites would allow the SSP technology to go through several generations of improvement while the market was being established. Once their capabilities are proven, with four electricity generating satellites in orbit, the industry will have a track record on which to secure investment capital for additional launches. It is hoped that because of the investment and new technologies applied launch costs will have been lowered. . Billions of people today have totally inadequate energy supplies—and the population is growing. Providing everyone with reasonable quantities of energy might take five to ten times more than we produce today. To supply this energy from solar power satellites requires a staggering launch rate. There are two major issues with a very high launch rate.<br />

Global fleet launch rates sufficiently large to exceed the 0. 2% threshold for any propellant type mix are not likely without revolutionary changes in the space industry. We cannot know when or how such changes might come about though serious planning and discussions are ongoing. 36 Various proposals for very large space infrastructure projects, space tourism, or RLVs with very high launch rates have been seriously proposed and significant resources have been invested. All of these proposals would result in large launch vehicles with very high launch rates (i. e. , daily ) and so it is of interest to evaluate them based on their impact on the ozone layer. One often discussed concept is the use of Solar Power Satellite (SPS) systems for electricity production. A recent study37 indicates that the required annual launch demand for an economically viable SPS system would be about 25 kt per year, over many years, perhaps indefinitely. Figure 4 shows that this SPS launch system would be constrained to use liquid propellant systems in order to ensure that DO3 remains below the 0. 2% threshold; an SPS launch system could not make significant use of SRMs in the stratosphere. Since we are able to define LRE ozone loss in only approximate term, we cannot rule out that even an all liquid propellant fleet at SPS launch rates might result in significant global total ozone loss, depending on the actual effect of a specific LRE type. The ambiguity of SPS launch illustrates the need for an improved understanding of rocket emissions of all types. With the current knowledge gaps, we cannot predict with any confidence which (indeed, any) large launch or space systems are plausible with respect to ozone depletion.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The biggest immediate threat to the vast majority of endangered species in Canada is not global warming, but issues such as habitat loss, pollution and overexploitation. &quot;We all worry about climate change, as we should, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't worry about protecting habitat,&quot; says James Grant, a biology professor at Concordia University in Montreal and co-author of a new report on threats to endangered species in Canada. &quot;The really immediate causes right now for many species are things like farming, urbanization and habitat loss caused by the direct things we do.&quot; Research by Grant and his pupils shows the biggest threat is habitat loss at 84 percent, overexploitation 32 percent, native species interactions 31 percent, natural causes 27 percent, pollution 26 percent, and introduced species 22 percent. On average, species are threatened by at least two of the six categories. Human activities representing the biggest source of habitat loss and pollution are not industrial resource extraction, but agriculture at 46 per cent and urbanization at 44 per cent. &quot;Farming is huge,&quot; Grant said in an interview. &quot;The Prairies are one of the most affected habitats in the world. We've turned them into wheat fields.&quot;The southern Okanagan-Similkameen is another example, home to about one-third of species at risk in B.C. as well as a thriving agricultural industry, including vineyards, and increased urban development. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">While species constitute a &quot;valuable endowment&quot; and should be protected, there is &quot;a total lack of evidence&quot; of a biological holocaust, said Dr. Julian Simon, a University of Maryland economist. He is perhaps better known for arguing that the world's resources, coupled with human ingenuity, can support a surging population. &quot;We're being asked to take the entire scenario on faith&quot; and on the judgment of those who advance it, he said. The warnings of mass extinction, he said, &quot;seem like guesswork and hysteria.&quot; Other dissenters say there is a problem, but that its dimensions simply cannot be known at the moment. No one even knows the true number of species in the world, they say. This is acknowledged by Dr. Wilson and others who share his view. Only 1.4 million species have been identified worldwide, but estimates of South American species alone range from 5 million to 50 million, and estimates of global species range up to 100 million. &quot;When you deal with that kind of error, it's hard to say what's happening,&quot; said Dr. Michael A. Mares, a zoologist at the University of Oklahoma who is an expert on neotropical habitats. Likewise, he said, it is difficult to come up with a rate of extinction when the geographical distribution of organisms is not known. &quot;Most of them are invertebrates,&quot; he said. &quot;We really don't have a good handle on whether or not they're going extinct and how rapidly. The problem is data right now.&quot; More should be known, he said, before the poor countries of the world are asked to make large sacrifices to preserve tropical forests. For his part, Dr. Mares said, he believes that the wolf is not yet at the door. &quot;The wolf is coming,&quot; he said, &quot;but he's coming later.&quot; It is &quot;understandable that there's disagreement,&quot; said Dr. Jared Diamond, an ecologist at the University of California at Los Angeles who has examined the problem. &quot;What people are arguing about is what's going to happen in the future.&quot; Predicting the stock market, with its well-known variables and wealth of data, is a far more certain pursuit than predicting the future of species, he said</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Financial Express 10-10-09 [“COLUMN A FULL PRIZE FOR POLICIES HALF-COOKED,” Lexis]</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">To be sure, Barack Obama is no ordinary political leader. That he has won the Nobel Peace Prize even before he completed nine months in the White House and served barely two years on the national stage prior to that, underlines the huge impact President Obama has had on political imagination in the US and in the world. Obama's decision to end the war in Iraq, reverse US opposition to climate change negotiations, reach out to Muslims in the Middle East, question some Israeli policies, offer negotiations to Iran, propose a re-set in the relations with Moscow, pull back from the missile defence plans in Europe, commit the US to a future elimination of nuclear weapons have clearly made a big impression on chattering classes in Europe, where the Nobel Committee resides. Nevertheless, the committee's announcement to give the 2009 Peace Prize to Obama is bound to generate controversy, in no place more than the US. There is no question that the decision is a huge surprise, given reports that Obama was not of the original short list of candidates for the Nobel this year. If the International Olympics Committee snubbed the US President who flew through the night to Copenhagen and made a personal pitch in favour of his hometown Chicago which wanted to host the 2016 Olympics, the Nobel Committee seems to have more than compensated. America's people are bound to be proud at their President getting the Nobel. But the reaction of the deeply divided political class will underline the current polarisation in the US. The Democrats will hail Oslo's decision as a vindication of president's determination to reverse the negative policies of his predecessor George W. Bush. They would also argue that if America was reviled in much of the world during the Bush years, the Nobel Prize to Obama is restoring the attractiveness of America's soft power in the world. The Republicans will dismiss the prize as a pathetic attempt by the Europeans to celebrate Obama's presidency for being simply 'un-Bush' in its approach to the world. Given the extraordinary power the United States wields over the world, it is entirely understandable that much of the world wants to express its preferences within the US political debates. In the end the outsiders have no vote in American politics and the external interventions at best feed into American political divisions. The very reasons that Oslo cites to justify the prize - the contribution to internal diplomacy and cooperation-are strongly questioned in the United States. What European liberals find endearing in Obama's foreign policy angers American conservatives.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Soft power is ineffective at solving threat</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kagan 2006</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> [Robert. May 28, 2006. Washington Post. “If Power Shifts In 2008: A Democrat Might Not Be as Different as You Would Think” ]</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The case for electing a Democrat is not only to save the party's soul, though that's a worthy task, but to pull the country together to face the difficult times ahead. The last time the Democrats were in office, the world seemed a comparatively manageable place. They have not yet had to deal with the post-Sept. 11 world. Since the only post-Sept. 11 foreign policy Americans know is Bush's, many believe -- especially many Democrats -- that if only Bush weren't president, the world would be manageable again. Allies could be easily summoned for the struggle against al-Qaeda or to bring pressure on Iran or to replace American troops in Iraq. Threats could be addressed without force, through skillful diplomacy and soft power. Maybe some of the threats would disappear. This is fantasy. The next president, whether Democrat or Republican, may work better with allies and may be more clever in negotiating with adversaries. But the realities of the world are what they are, and the imperatives of U.S. foreign policy are what they are. The diffuse threats of the post-Cold War world simply don't unite and energize our European allies as the Soviet Union did, and even a dedicated &quot;multilateralist&quot; won't be able to get them to spend more money on defense or stop buying oil from Iran. A smarter negotiating strategy toward Iran might or might not make a difference in stopping its weapons program. Soft power will go only so far in dealing with problems such as North Korea and Sudan.</span><br />

<br />
Yet the probability of a frontal confrontation and a new Cold War remains very remote for at least three reasons. First, despite the erosion, the countries’ geopolitical assets are still very weighty, as the bedrock issues of anti-terrorism, nuclear nonproliferation, and energy will continue to force them to seek common ground and at least limited partnership.[17] Second, the “restorationist” foreign policy notwithstanding, the three basic elements of the 1992-1993 national consensus on the foreign policy and defense doctrine remain largely the same. Russia is to stay a nuclear superpower and the regional superpower, but it seems to have settled for the role of one of the world’s great states, rather than a global superpower engaged in a worldwide competition with the United States. While these desiderata will continue to cause occasional sparring with the United States, they are no longer dedicated to the attainment of goals inimical to the vital interests of the United States and are not likely to ignite a relentless antagonistic struggle to the bitter end. Lastly, despite the muscular rhetoric emanating of late from the Kremlin, unlike the Soviet Union twenty years ago and China today, Russia<br />
is not a “revisionist” power. It does not seek radically to reshape the geopolitical “balance of forces” in its favor. Moscow may rail at the score, but it is unlikely to endeavor to change the rules of the game.<br />

<br />
For almost half a century, the world's most powerful nuclear states have been locked in a military stalemate known as mutual assured destruction (MAD). By the early 1960s, the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union had grown so large and sophisticated that neither country could entirely destroy the other's retaliatory force by launching first, even with a surprise attack. Starting a nuclear war was therefore tantamount to committing suicide. [LEIBER AND PRESS CONTINUE – PARAGRAPH LATER] This debate may now seem like ancient history, but it is actually more relevant than ever -- because the age of MAD is nearing an end. Today, for the first time in almost 50 years, the United States stands on the verge of attaining nuclear primacy. It will probably soon be possible for the United States to destroy the long-range nuclear arsenals of Russia or China with a first strike. This dramatic shift in the nuclear balance of power stems from a series of improvements in the United States' nuclear systems, the precipitous decline of Russia's arsenal, and the glacial pace of modernization of China's nuclear forces. Unless Washington's policies change or Moscow and Beijing take steps to increase the size and readiness of their forces, Russia and China -- and the rest of the world -- will live in the shadow of U.S. nuclear primacy for many years to come.<br />

 <strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Their impact scenarios are over-exagerated hype, even if terror attacks will happen they'll be incredibly small and unsuccessful</span></strong><br />
<strong>Shane 10</strong> [Scott, International Herald Tribune, “U.S. clamor over Qaeda may overstate its capability;<br />
<br />
Exaggerated coverage aids jihadists by creating an atmosphere of fear” January, 14th 2010, lexis, Chetan]<br />
<br />
As terrorist plots against the United States have piled up in recent months, politicians and the news media have sounded the alarm with a riveting message for Americans: Be afraid. Al Qaeda is on the march again, targeting the country from within and without, and your hapless government cannot protect you. But the politically charged clamor has lumped together disparate cases and obscured the fact that the jihadist enemies on American soil in 2009, rather than a single powerful and sophisticated juggernaut, were a scattered, uncoordinated group of amateurs who displayed more fervor than skill. Their weapons were old-fashioned guns and explosives - in several cases, duds supplied by FBI informants - with no trace of the biological or radiological poisons, let alone the nuclear bombs, that have long been the ultimate fear. And though 2009 brought more domestic plots, and more serious plots, than any recent year, their lethality was relatively modest. Exactly 14 of the about 14,000 murders in the United States last year resulted from allegedly jihadist attacks: 13 people shot at Fort Hood in Texas in November and one at a military recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas, in June. Such statistics would be no comfort, of course, if an attack with mass casualties were to succeed some day. Nor do they excuse the acknowledged missteps at the bulked-up American security agencies that permitted a Nigerian student to carry a makeshift bomb onto a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day - the attempted attack that set off the flood of news coverage. But even that near miss, said Mark M. Lowenthal, assistant director of the Central Intelligence Agency for analysis from 2002 to 2005, may offer indirect evidence of the enemy's diminished strength, compared with the coordinated attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ''Sending one guy on one plane is a huge step down,'' Mr. Lowenthal said. ''They're less capable, even if they're still lethal. They're not able to carry out the intense planning they once did.''<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">In the years after 9/11, the images we were shown of terrorists were largely the same: shadowy jihadists who, even when they were foiled, seemed always to have come terrifyingly close to pulling off a horrific attack. We’ve all become familiar by now with the stock footage of Talibs in black shalwar kameezes zipping across monkey bars or, more recently, perfecting kung fu kicks in some secret training camp. Even in the aftermath of the botched Times Square bombing earlier this spring, the perception persists that our enemies are savvy and sophisticated killers. They’re fanatical and highly organized—twin ideas that at once keep us fearful and help them attract new members.But this view of the jihadist community is wildly off the mark. To be sure, some terrorists are steely and skilled—people like Mohamed Atta, the careful and well-trained head of the 9/11 hijackers. Their leaders and recruiters can be lethally subtle and manipulative, but the quiet truth is that many of the deluded foot soldiers are foolish and untrained, perhaps even untrainable. Acknowledging this fact could help us tailor our counterterrorism priorities—and publicizing it could help us erode the powerful images of strength and piety that terrorists rely on for recruiting and funding. Nowhere is the gap between sinister stereotype and ridiculous reality more apparent than in Afghanistan, where it’s fair to say that the Taliban employ the world’s worst suicide bombers: one in two manages to kill only himself. And this success rate hasn’t improved at all in the five years they’ve been using suicide bombers, despite the experience of hundreds of attacks—or attempted attacks. In Afghanistan, as in many cultures, a manly embrace is a time-honored tradition for warriors before they go off to face death. Thus, many suicide bombers never even make it out of their training camp or safe house, as the pressure from these group hugs triggers the explosives in suicide vests. According to several sources at the United Nations, as many as six would-be suicide bombers died last July after one such embrace in Paktika. Many Taliban operatives are just as clumsy when suicide is not part of the plan. In November 2009, several Talibs transporting an improvised explosive device were killed when it went off unexpectedly. The blast also took out the insurgents’ shadow governor in the province of Balkh. When terrorists do execute an attack, or come close, they often have security failures to thank, rather than their own expertise. Consider Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab—the Nigerian “Jockstrap Jihadist” who boarded a Detroit-bound jet in Amsterdam with a suicidal plan in his head and some explosives in his underwear. Although the media colored the incident as a sophisticated al-Qaeda plot, Abdulmutallab showed no great skill or cunning, and simple safeguards should have kept him off the plane in the first place. He was, after all, traveling without luggage, on a one-way ticket that he purchased with cash. All of this while being on a U.S. government watch list. Fortunately, Abdulmutallab, a college-educated engineer, failed to detonate his underpants. A few months later another college grad, Faisal Shahzad, is alleged to have crudely rigged an SUV to blow up in Times Square. That plan fizzled and he was quickly captured, despite the fact that he was reportedly trained in a terrorist boot camp in Pakistan. Indeed, though many of the terrorists who strike in the West are well educated, their plots fail because they lack operational know-how</span>
