===Contention One—(Inner)Space Colonization=== 

**What is space? What is its purpose? Who owns it?**

**In a globalized world, the way we answer these questions effects and shape the way we think about politics in general. Space is both a blank canvas and a mirror—how we theorize space can aid or abet our thinking about sovereignty, cooperation, and violence**

<span style="text-decoration: none;">Sadly, the radical potential to think differently about space and sovereignty has been hijacked by militarization. This is not just a militarization of OUTER space—it is also a militarization of our INNER space. Status quo politics and rhetoric is an attempt to militarize both space and the American psyche in order to maintain imperial dominance. </span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;">This militarized mindset is the cause of genocidal violence—a politics based in bounded communities cannot result in anything but atrocities—it can only solve wars between like-minded people</span>

<span class="Debate-CardTagandCite-F6Char">And, moreover, this psychological emphasis on the nation and the individual community first can no longer solve problems in the world. Every existential threat humanity faces—war, terrorism, proliferation, population growth and total environmental collapse—can only be dealt with via true international cooperation.

**This means that the role of the ballot is to investigate methodology and psyche before material or empirical arguments. Rejecting methodological nationalism creates a new research agenda that is critical to understand the world and advance cosmopolitanism.**

Nietzsche simply dismisses the designed cosmos, which

We remember that we have suffered, and thus we shape this into our depiction of the Apparent World – making us strive more for the Real World.

**Post cold war society is focused around productive expenditure. Arms races, space races and credit cards all embody a society that must keep spending, grasping at utility. The aff’s space program is rooted in a method of accumulation, precluding the alt.**

**The hoarding of energy eliminates the world’s autonomy in favor of violent commandeering, ordering and stockpiling of energy in which the human plays only a part. This method turns the world into an energy reserve where humans come to light in the concentration camps, to be known, perfected and destroyed.**

**Stoekl 07** (Allan, Prof of French and comp lit at Penn State and Bataille Scholar, __Bataille’s Peak__, P 131)

**The alternative is to celebrate the useless expenditure of energy in the form of sacrifice. In the context of the affirmative this means sacrificing the world described by the 1AC by refusing the aff and its purposefulness.**

**This move puts energy at the forefront of thinking in order to affirm the prolifigate spending necessary for the continuation of human life.**
