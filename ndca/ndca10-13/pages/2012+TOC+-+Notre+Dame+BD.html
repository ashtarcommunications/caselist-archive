<br />
<strong>The United States federal government should propose to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that it</strong> [substantially increase its missions to the ISS for the purpose of neurosciecnce experiments beyond the earths mesosphere] <strong>through a process of genuine consultation, and abide by the outcome. We’ll clarify</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation 1- Competition</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The affirmative must defend immediate unconditional implementation of the plan</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A. Resolved” means to “decide firmly on a course of action” and “should” is “used to indicate obligation.”</strong><br />
<strong>We test the resolution, which is key to Neg ground and functional competition</strong> <strong>*[New Oxford American Dictionary]</strong><br />
<br />
The 1AC could spike out of any argument by saying the plan is delayed or not enforced-every negative argument link assumes implementation<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Our interpretation is that permutations can be extra topical but not entirely non topical-this is the best middle ground<br />
<br />
<br />
NATO will say yes even when they want the opposite to preserve relations with the US<br />

The aff’s paranoid threat discourse is epistemologically flawed and replicates psychological projections of <u>enmity</u><br />

<br />
<strong>In this sense, then, ...</strong> <u>stimulates paranoia.</u><br />
<br />
Reject their psychologically constructed scenarios for conflict – a reformulation of language, knowledge production, and our reaction to psychic trauma breaks down the cycle of enmity<br />

<br />
The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions, <u>each topic contains certain key elements</u>, although they have slightly different functions from comparable elements of value-oriented propositions<u>. 1. An agent doing the acting ---“The United States” in “The United States should adopt</u> a policy of free trade.” Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of value, <u>the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. The verb <em>should</em></u>—the first part of a verb phrase <u>that urges action</u>. 3. An action verb to follow <em>should</em> in the <em>should</em>-verb combination. <u>For example, <em>should adopt</em></u> here <u><strong>means to put a</strong></u> program or <u><strong>policy into action though governmental means</strong></u>. 4. A specification of directions or a limitation of the action desired. The phrase <em>free trade</em>, for example, gives direction and limits to the topic, which would, for example, eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs, discussing diplomatic recognition, or discussing interstate commerce. Propositions of policy deal with future action. Nothing has yet occurred. <u>The <strong>entire debate</strong> is about whether something ought to occur.</u> What you agree to do, then, when you accept the <em>affirmative side</em> in such a debate is to offer sufficient and compelling reasons for an audience to perform the future action that you propose.<br />
<br />
<strong>C) Grammar is the biggest impact --- allowing other frameworks justifies arbitrarily changing the question of the debate to an infinite number of alternatives, destroying predictable limits and ensuring the Neg always wins. Grammar is the only predictable basis for determining meaning; it’s the foundation for how words interact. Ignoring it justifies changing the focus of the debate, mooting the resolution altogether.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2)</strong> <u><strong>Limits</strong></u><strong>:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A) Our framework narrows the topics of debate to a finite set of political potentialities. Expanding beyond this makes an</strong> <u><strong>infinite number</strong></u> <strong>of philosophical beliefs germane.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Lutz 00</strong>(Donald, Professor of Political Science – U Houston, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p. 39-40)<br />
<br />
Aristotle notes in the Politics that political theory simultaneously proceeds at three levels – discourse about the ideal, about the best possible in the real world, and about existing political systems. Put another way, comprehensive political theory must ask several different kinds of questions that are linked, yet distinguishable. <u>In order to understand the interlocking set of questions that political theory can ask, imagine a continuum stretching from left to right. At the end, to the right is an ideal form of government</u>, a perfectly wrought construct <u>produced by the imagination. At the other end is the perfect dystopia</u>, the most perfectly wretched system that the human imagination can produce. <u>Stretching between these two extremes is an <strong>infinite set</strong> of possibilities</u>, merging into one another, that describe the logical possibilities created by the characteristics defining the end points. For example, a political system defined primarily by equality would have a perfectly inegalitarian system described at the other end, and the possible states of being between them would vary primarily in the extent to which they embodied equality. An ideal defined primarily by liberty would create a different set of possibilities between the extremes. Of course, visions of the ideal often are inevitably more complex than these single-value examples indicate, but it is also true that in order to imagine an ideal state of affairs a kind of simplification is almost always required since normal states of affairs invariably present themselves to human consciousness as complicated, opaque, and to a significant extent indeterminate. A non-ironic reading of Plato’s republic leads one to conclude that the creation of these visions of the ideal characterizes political philosophy. This is not the case. <u>Any person can generate a vision of the ideal.</u> One job of political philosophy is to ask the question “Is this ideal worth pursuing?” Before the question can be pursued, however, the ideal state of affairs must be clarified, especially with respect to conceptual precision and the logical relationship between the propositions that describe the ideal. This pre-theoretical analysis raises the vision of the ideal from the mundane to a level where true philosophical analysis and the careful comparison with existing systems can proceed fruitfully. The process of <u>pre-theoretical analysis,</u> probably <u>because it works on clarifying ideas that most capture the human imagination, too often looks to some like the <strong>entire enterprise</strong> of political philosophy</u>. However, the value of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s concept of the General Will, for example, lies not in its formal logical implications, nor in its compelling hold on the imagination, but on the power and clarity it lends to an analysis and comparison of the actual political systems. Among other things it allows him to show that anyone who wishes to pursue a state of affairs closer to that summer up in the concept of the General Will must successfully develop a civil religion. <u>To the extent politicians believe theorists who tell them that pre-theoretical clarification of language describing an ideal is the essence and sum total of political philosophy, to that extent they will properly conclude that political philosophers have little to tell them, since politics is the realm of the possible not the realm of logical clarity</u>. However, once the ideal is clarified, the political philosopher will begin to articulate and assess the reasons why we might want to pursue such an ideal. At this point, analysis leaves the realm of pure logic and enters the realm of the logic of human longing, aspiration, and anxiety. The analysis is now limited by the interior parameters of the human heart (more properly the human psyche) to which the theorist must appeal. Unlike the <u>clarification stage where anything that is logical is possible, there are now define limits on where logical can take us. Appeals to self-destruction, less happiness rather than more, psychic isolation, enslavement, loss of identity, a preference for the lives of mollusks over that of humans, to name <strong>just a few ,</strong>possibilities, are <strong>doomed to failure</strong>. The theorist cannot appeal to such values if she or he is to attract an audience of politicians</u>. Much political theory involves the careful, competitive analysis of what a given ideal state of affairs entails, and as Plato shows in his dialogues the discussion between the philosopher and the politician will quickly terminate if he or she cannot convincingly demonstrate the connection between the political ideal being developed and natural human passions. In this way, the politician can be educated by the possibilities that the political theorist can articulate, just as the political theorist can be educated by the relative success the normative analysis has in “setting the Hook” of interest among nonpolitical theorists. This realm of <u>discourse, dominated by the logic of humanly worthwhile goals, requires that the theorist carefully observe the responses of others in order not to be seduced by what is merely logical as opposed to what is humanly rational</u>. Moral discourse conditioned by the ideal, if it is to e successful, requires the political theorist to be fearless in pursuing normative logic, but it also requires the theorist to have enough humility to remember that, if a non-theorist cannot be led toward an idea, the fault may well lie in the theory, not in the moral vision of the non-theorist.<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
While some criticize the cost-benefit analysis method of evaluating a debate as subjective (for example, how does one weigh the people that may be saved by a plan against the immorality of the action), <u>the role of the judge is <strong>much more clearly defined</strong> than in a debate about language and performance</u>. In TPD, the teams are able to make weighing arguments that guide the judge in evaluating competing claims. For example, teams will regularly argue that even if an action is immoral, it is justified in order to save lives. This type of argument fits neatly into the formula for evaluating a TPD because it seeks to weigh the impact of an argument against the plan and the impact of an argument for the plan. <u>Weighing impacts is much easier in a round where the plan is the focus</u> of the debate <u>because the judge must simplydetermine</u> what the largest impact is before determining <u>whether or not the plan is a good idea</u>. If morality is more important than lives, the plan would be rejected in the above example; if preserving life is more important than acting morally, the plan would be endorsed. <u>In a round focused on</u> language and <u>performance, the team advocating a critical position will</u> usually attempt to <u>divorce the</u> judge’s <u>decision from a</u> topical <u>plan-focus</u>. The role of the judge is not to make a cost-benefit calculation that seeks to determine the desirability of a policy, but instead the judge is placed into a realm where his or her decision is based on some other criteria. If the plan seeks to answer the resolutional question in the affirmative, how does one evaluate a round in which the plan is not the focus of the debate? <u>There is no obvious yes/no question that the judge can answer</u>when attempting to evaluate which team did the better debating (Smith, 2002). A number of questions arise when one considers how a judge may evaluate a round in which questions of performance replace the plan as the focus of the debate. For example, does the judge listen the same way as each team does? What if each team interprets a performance differently? <u>What makes one performance better than any other?</u> What if the negative re-reads the 1AC with more emphasis or emotion? What if one team gives their speech more quickly or more slowly that the other? What if a performance that is aesthetically pleasing to one person is offensive to another? <u>These questions</u> all <u>point to the <strong>lack of criteria</strong> that exist for evaluating a non-TPD round</u> around a single yes/no question (Smith, 2002). <u>Without clearly defined criteria, judges will</u> be likely to <u>make <strong>subjective decisions</strong></u> about which team does the better debating. For example, what would happen if the 1AC spoke of the racism that is inherent in US foreign policy and read narratives to that effect and asked the judge to vote for the performative effects of their speaking out against racism? What if the negative did the same sort of performance, but spoke only of sexism? Both performances are good, so how could the judge ever reconcile those competing claims? What if the judge fundamentally disagrees with the ideas presented in the affirmative’s performance? Should the judge intervene and vote against a performance they don’t like, even if the negative fails to highlight those shortcomings that the judge perceives? <u>There is no method for evaluating two “good” performances</u> against one another, <u>even assuming criteria exist for differentiating between a “good” and “bad” performance</u>.<br />
<br />
<strong>B) This destroys both fairness and education</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Speice and Lyle 3</strong> (Patrick, Wake Forest, and Jim, Debate Coach – Clarion, “Traditional Policy Debate: Now More Than Ever”, Debaters Research Guide, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:1843:http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/SpeiceLyle2003htm.htm --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/SpeiceLyle2003htm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/SpeiceLyle2003htm.htm</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:1843 -->)<br />
<br />
But why does it matter if the judge has a clearly defined role in the debate? <u>If the judge is unable to determine</u> what <u>the criteria</u> are <u>for evaluating a debate, and subjective decisions will</u> therefore <u>be made</u> about which performance or whose language the judge thinks is most valuable, <u>debate would <strong>cease to be an educationally rewarding enterprise</strong>. Hard work</u> and research <u>would not be rewarded with</u> competitive <u>success</u>. While the debate would not be slanted in one particular direction (save for that of the judge’s political biases), those that worked hard to research new positions and hone their skills would not be rewarded. In this sense, <u>non-TPD rounds make the game less fun</u>, as the better team would only have a 50% chance of winning any given round, despite the quality of their debating. The <u>TPD</u> format <u>avoids this</u> problem <u>by establishing <strong>clear criteria</strong> for evaluating a debate</u> that are known to both teams prior to entering a debate. This <u>predictability stems from</u> requiring the affirmative to advocate and defend <u>a topical plan as the focus</u> of the debate. Accordingly, the negative is able to use the resolution as a guide to predict what the likely affirmative cases will be. The affirmative has reciprocal predictability in knowing that the negative can only seek to argue against their plan by advocating that the status quo or a competing policy option is superior to the plan based on a cost-benefit analysis. <u><strong>This framework</strong></u> for evaluating debates <u><strong>reduces judge intervention</strong>. Accordingly, TPD is</u> a <u>better</u> game than non-TPD, <u>because it affords each team a realistic chance to emerge victorious by making the game <strong>fair</strong> for both teams</u>.<br />

5) <u>Impact</u>:<br />
<br />
Fairness outweighs –<br />
<br />
A) <u>Debate is a game</u> that, divorced from fairness, is meaningless. Competition without fair norms is simply a bad game --- it’s the reason that the NBA is more interesting than the Harlem Globetrotters.<br />
<br />
B) It’s a <u>prerequisite to education</u> --- without equitable rules, debaters wouldn’t learn anything. Establishing a fair forum is crucial to allow education to take place. Competition is critical to get young debaters hooked and invested enough to make them <u>desire</u> to learn more in order to win.<br />
Lahman 36 <strong>(Carroll Pollack, Director of Men’s Forensics – Western State Teacher’s College, Debate Coaching: A Handbook for Teachers and Coaches, p. 19)</strong><br />
<br />
<u>Not knowledge but thought <strong>is the end of education. Educational values lie not</strong></u> <strong>so much <u>in knowledge</u> of subjects in themselves <u>as in the processes</u> of investigation, judgment, and expression <u>by which the debater strives to win</u> an audience to his opinion. <u>This end can be attained only when the student is working with material which is of genuine interest</u> both to himself and to his audience. <u>The discussion of</u> such <u>a question,</u></strong> <u>if engaged in voluntarily<strong>, enlists the</strong> earnestness <strong>and</strong> enthusiasm <strong>of the student</strong></u> <strong>in an effort to learn and weigh the facts, to balance evidence, and to make the results of his own thoughts clear and interesting to others. <u>Those are</u></strong> <u>truly educational <strong>values</strong></u><strong>.8</strong><br />
<br />
C) <u>Affects participation</u> --- if it wasn’t fair, debaters would have no incentive to be involved. People would quit and couldn’t learn anything.<br />

<br />
<strong>As with any game or sport, <u>creating a level playing field that affords each competitor a fair chance of victory is</u></strong> <u>integral to the continued existence <strong>of debate as an activity. If the game is slanted</strong></u> <strong>toward one particular competitor, <u>the other participants are likely to pack up their tubs and go home</u>, as they don’t have a realistic shot of winning such a “rigged game.” <u>Debate simply wouldn’t be fun</u> if the outcome was pre-determined and certain teams knew that they would always win or lose. <u>The incentive to work hard</u> to develop new and innovative arguments <u>would be non-existent</u> because wins and losses would not relate to how much research a particular team did. <u>TPD</u>, as defined above, <u>offers the best hope for a level playing field that makes the game of debate fun and educational for all participants</u>.</strong><br />

<strong>Ironically, <u>the battle to save ISS</u> ultimately <u>undermined it politically</u>.

That linkage, it has been argued, is why the ISS survived in 1993 while the Superconducting Super Collider was canceled that same year. The latter’s constituency linkages were too concentrated primarily in Texas and Louisiana. <u>By 2009, the core support for Constellation in Congress was increasingly concentrated among congressional members with NASA facilities or large NASA contractors.As a result, the battle over the proposed Obama space policy doesn’t feature intense widespread congressional support</u> (the key word being widespread) <u>for sustaining the Constellation program, or any human space program for that matter.

This program was replaced by a two-tier approach: commercial spaceflights would handle reaching LEO and supply the ISS. NASA will pursue deep space exploration employing a newly developed heavy lifter, the Space Launch System.</strong><br />

<strong>Solving Russian corruption key to prevent nuclear power plant accidents</strong><br />

Corruption in the Russian State Nuclear Corporation<span class="TitleChar">Rosatom</span><u>may</u> cause new nuclear accidents in Russia<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, experts say. The </span><span class="TitleChar">ecological group Ecodefense</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">! </span><span class="TitleChar">believes the risks are high enough to result in another Fukushima</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, </span><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">while the National Anti-Corruption Committee (NAC) has urged Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Prosecutor General Yury Chaika to initiate investigations into the broadly reported violations and abuses in the nuclear industry, including at new nuclear power plant (NPP) construction sites. Last summer’s arrest of a former high-ranking Rosatom official on embezzlement charges may have been a first widely publicised case of a corruption scandal in the Russian nuclear domain in the recent years, but it was likely just one – and, furthermore, dismissed by some as a see-through PR move by Rosatom – fragment in a sprawling corruption mosaic in the Russian nuclear sector, something that alarms environmentalists and civil activists enough to talk about grave safety risks and the need for the government to take urgent measures. On September 12, Kirill Kabanov, who is a member of the presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights and heads the non-governmental organisation National Anti-Corruption Committee, addressed Prime Minister Putin and Prosecutor General Chaika with open letters urging the officials to take a closer look at abuses reported by a range of national media at new reactor construction sites. (The two statements, in Russian, are available as attachments to this report, on the right.) ‘Situation with corruption’ is adverse, NAC experts say The National Anti-Corruption Committee has at its disposal information compelling one to assess the “state of the situation with corruption in the nuclear industry as adverse,” the letters say. The NAC further refers to reports by the official national daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta as it says: “[…] in the past six months alone, removed from their posts on suspicion of corruption and other abuses were heads of twelve Rosatom enterprises. In 2010, 35 industry officials were dismissed for the same reasons. In a notorious development last summer, officials with the Main Department for Economic Security and Countering Corruption of the Ministry of Interior of the Russian Federation detained former Rosatom deputy director Yevgeny Yevstratov and charged him with embezzling budget funds allocated toward the construction of a number of the corporation’s sites.” At the same time, the letters continue, </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">“</span><span class="TitleChar">these </span>measures have<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> so far </span>proved insufficient to ensure a drastic solution to the problem of embezzlement<span class="TitleChar"> of budget funds and corruption at nuclear sites</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.

<span style="font-size: 8px;"> Reuters said the 1995 Kobe quake caused $100 billion in damage, up to then the most costly ever natural disaster. This time, from quake and tsunami damage alone, that figure will be dwarfed. Moreover, </span>under<span class="TitleChar"> a worst case core </span>meltdown,all bets are off<span class="TitleChar"> as the entire region and beyond will be threatened with permanent contamination, making the most affected areas unsafe to live in</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. On March 12, Stratfor Global Intelligence issued a &quot;Red Alert: Nuclear Meltdown at Quake-Damaged Japanese Plant,&quot; saying: Fukushima Daiichi &quot;nuclear power plant in Okuma, Japan, appears to have caused a reactor meltdown.&quot; Stratfor downplayed its seriousness, adding that such an event &quot;does not necessarily mean a nuclear disaster,&quot; that already may have happened - </span>the ultimate nightmare short of nuclear winter<span style="font-size: 8px;">. According to Stratfor, &quot;(A)s long as the reactor core, which is specifically designed to contain high levels of heat, pressure and radiation, remains intact, the melted fuel can be dealt with. If the (core's) breached but the containment facility built around (it) remains intact, the melted fuel can be....entombed within specialized concrete&quot; as at Chernobyl in 1986. In fact, that disaster killed nearly one million people worldwide from nuclear radiation exposure. In their book titled, &quot;Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment,&quot; Alexey Yablokov, Vassily Nesterenko and Alexey Nesterenko said: &quot;For the past 23 years, it has been clear that there is a danger greater than nuclear weapons concealed within nuclear power. </span><span class="TitleChar">Emissions from this one reactor exceeded </span>ahundred-fold<span class="TitleChar"> the radioactive contamination of the bombs dropped on </span>Hiroshima and Nagasaki<span style="font-size: 8px;">.&quot; &quot;</span>No citizen of any country can be assured that he or she can be protected from radioactive contamination<span style="font-size: 8px;">. One nuclear reactor can pollute half the globe. Chernobyl fallout covers the entire Northern Hemisphere.&quot; Stratfor explained that if Fukushima's floor cracked, &quot;</span><span class="TitleChar">itis highly likely that the </span>melting fuel will burn through (its) containment system<span class="TitleChar"> and enter the ground</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">. This has never happened before,&quot; at least not reported. If now occurring, &quot;containment goes from being merely dangerous, time consuming and expensive to nearly impossible,&quot; making the quake, aftershocks, and tsunamis seem mild by comparison. Potentially, millions of lives will be jeopardized. Japanese officials said Fukushima's reactor container wasn't breached. Stratfor and others said it was, making the potential calamity far worse than reported. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) said the explosion at Fukushima's Saiichi No. 1 facility could only have been caused by a core meltdown. In fact, 3 or more reactors are affected or at risk. Events are fluid and developing, but remain very serious. </span><span class="TitleChar">The </span>possibility of an extreme catastrophe can't be discounte<span class="TitleChar">d. </span><span style="font-size: 8px;">Moreover, independent nuclear safety analyst John Large told Al Jazeera that by venting radioactive steam from the inner reactor to the outer dome, a reaction may have occurred, causing the explosion. </span><span class="TitleChar">&quot;When I look at the size of the explosion,&quot; he said, &quot;it is my opinion that there could be a very large leak (because) fuel continues to generate heat</span><span style="font-size: 8px;">.&quot; Already, Fukushima way exceeds Three Mile Island that experienced a partial core meltdown in Unit 2. Finally it was brought under control, but coverup and denial concealed full details until much later. According to anti-nuclear activist Harvey Wasserman, Japan's quake fallout may cause nuclear disaster, saying: &quot;This is a very serious situation. If the cooling system fails (apparently it has at two or more plants), the super-heated radioactive fuel rods will melt, and (if so) you could conceivably have an explosion,&quot; that, in fact, occurred. As a result, massive radiation releases may follow, impacting the entire region. </span><span class="TitleChar">&quot;It </span>could be<span class="TitleChar">, literally, an a</span>pocalyptic<span class="TitleChar"> event. </span><br />

<strong>Risk calculations key to avoid nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Harvard Nuclear Study Group 83</strong><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> (</span><em>Living with Nuclear Weapons</em><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">, p.16-7)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">When President John F. Kennedy was shown irrefutable evidence of the Soviet missile emplacement – U-2 photographs of the missile bases in Cube – he and his advisors discussed the matter for six days before deciding on an American response to the challenge. </span><u>The decision, to place a naval blockade around the island, was not a risk-free response.</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> This, Kennedy honestly admitted to the nation the night of October 22, 1962: My fellow citizens, </span><u>let no one doubt this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out. No one can foresee precisely what course it will take… But the great danger of all would be to do nothing</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. Why did the president believe that “to do nothing” about the missiles in Cuba would be an even greater danger than accepting the “difficult and dangerous” course of </span><u>the blockade? He accepted some risk of war in the long run, by discouraging future Soviet aggressive behavior. Inaction might have led to an even more dangerous future</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. This the president also explained that night in his address to the nation: </span><u>[This] sudden, clandestine decision to station weapons</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> for the first time outside Soviet soil </span><u>– is a deliberate provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this country if our courage</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> and our commitments </span><u>are ever to be trusted</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> by either friend or foe. The 1930’s taught us a clear lesson</span><u>: Aggressive conduct, if allowed to grow unchecked and unchallenged, ultimately leads to war.</u><u>The</u> <u>American government managed the 1962 crisis with skill and restraint – offering</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;"> a compromise to the Soviets and giving them sufficient time to call back their missile-laden ships, for example – </span><u>and the missiles were withdrawn</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">from Cuba. The president carefully supervised American military actions to ensure that his orders were not misunderstood. He did not push his success too far or ignore the real risks of war. The point here is not, to make the blockade a model for American action in the future: different circumstances may call for different policies. Rather </span><u>the point is to underline the persistence of risk</u> <u>in international affairs</u><span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">. Every proposed response to the Soviet action – doing nothing, enforcing the blockade, or invading Cuba – entailed some risk of nuclear war. </span><u>Kennedy’s task</u> <u>–</u> <span style="font-size: 9.33333px;">and we think his success</span> <u>– was to weigh accurately the risks entailed in each course and decide on policy accordingly.</u><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Russia still clings to the rogue actor, once again highlighting the fact that </span><em><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">the Kremlin’s</span></em><em><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; font-size: 13.3333px;">first priorities are not cooperation with the United States</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"> or stability in the region but opposing Washington, increasing arms exports and expanding its own influence. </span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">This year, a small Russian flotilla led by the Moscow’s only aircraft-carrying cruiser—</span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">the</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> Admiral </span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Kuznetsov</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">—paid a </span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">visit to Syria</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">.

Yet there is a lesson learned. Russia’s current protection of Syria is not unlike what it provides to Iran. The Kremlin is hoping against hope for the preservation of Assad. The emergence of a new Sunni, pro-Russian regime in Damascus appears unlikely. But Moscow analysts tell me that if Assad goes down, the Kremlin will earn a reputation of supporting allies—something the United States lacks after letting the Mubarak regime go down quickly. The real question is whether Russia will keep the Soviet-era naval base in Tartus on Syria’s Mediterranean coast. While the disagreement on Libya led to Russia’s abstention in the Security Council and was soon forgotten, </span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">the spat over Syria will poison Moscow’s relationship with Washington,</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> its European allies and Sunni Arab states.</span></span><br />

<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;">“Well, I think that is a great question Mark. Because economic interdependence clearly has to affect the Chinese calculus. And yet um</span><u><span style="color: #000000;">, it’s not sufficient to say that China and the United States could not have an inadvertent conflict, or that</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;"> it has, </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">it doesn’t have conflict of interest</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;">. It does have conflicts of interest. I think the big question strategically, from the Chinese perspective</span><u><span style="color: #000000;">, if the United States is not seen as contributing to Chinese prosperity</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;"> and peace </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">then China will</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;">, uh, essentially </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">try to undermine U.S. interests</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;">. And </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">this could be done</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;"> very locally or it could be done more </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">strategically</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;">. China, remember, almost signed an alliance with the United States, Mao and then Deng Xiaoping both said we don’t want a formal alliance we want to do this tacitly, against the Soviet Union, so it wasn’t about ideology so it’s also true that </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">economic interdependence doesn’t mean that we’re suddenly thinking along the same lines</span></u><u><span style="color: #000000;"> about a global economic market</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;">. </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">From Chinese perspective this is still about Nationalism</span></u><u><span style="color: #000000;">, and about whether the Chinese are prospering or are more secure with the United States. So we, the United States, has to understand this does not necessarily guarantee continuity, just because we have growing economic interdependence.</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;"> In the big signs here in the last three years has been Chinese changing their calculus about American power, and American staying power this adds another layer of destabilization potential, because the Chinese may say we are going to have to test whether American really wants to maintain primacy in the Western Pacific now that it’s a declining economic power from their perspective. From the perspective of all the other Asian countries as well, economic interdependence is critical because for the Philippines, for instance, President Aquino of the Philippines has been arguing for the past few months that China is a huge threat to the Philippines national interest over the South China Sea. So what is President Aquino doing? He’s heading to China to try to sign tens of billions of dollars of investment deals in the Philippines.</span><u><span style="color: #000000;"> In every county in Asia including the United States is looking at China as their number one or number two trading partner, so, yes very different from the Soviet Union but it doesn’t guarantee peace.”</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;"> Patrick Cronin “And I think, uh, you know, uh, </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">the idea the economic interdependence guarantee peace</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;">. Uh,</span><u><span style="color: #000000;"> that doesn’t fly look at the first period of economic interdependence in the early 20th century.</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;"> Who would have said </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">World War 1</span></u><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 6.66667px;"> would have made sense?” Guy 1 “In fact people said it was impossible because of the economic interdependence Storman Angel. “ Guy2 “So you’ve got to put that argument aside especially in the case of China, because </span><u><span style="color: #000000;">when China has felt degreed in the past it has been willing to put all sorts of other national interests on the back burner.

<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">THE PRIMARY purpose of U.S. nuclear forces is to deter nuclear attacks</span> on the United States and its allies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. During peacetime, this is not a demanding mission. </span><u>The chance that leaders in Beijing, Moscow, or even Pyongyang will launch a surprise nuclear attack tomorrow is vanishingly small. But peacetime deterrence is not the proper yardstick for measuring the adequacy of U.S. nuclear forces</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

In the coming decades, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">may find itself facing nuclear-armed states</span> on the battlefield. U.S. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">alliances span the globe</span>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and the U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is frequently drawn into</span> regional <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">conflict</span>s.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Washington has launched six major military operations since the fall of the Berlin Wall: in Panama, Somalia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and twice in Iraq. Fur</span><u>thermore, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">most of</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span>tates' potential <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">adversaries have developed</span>--<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">or seem to be developing</span>--<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nuclear weapons</span>. Aside from terrorism, the threats that dominate U.S. military planning come from China, North Korea, and Iran: two members of the nuclear club, and one intent on joining</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">it. The central problem for U.S. deterrence in the future is that even rational adversaries will have powerful incentives to introduce nuclear weapons--that is, threaten to use them, put them on alert, test them, or even use them--during a conventional war against the United States. </span><u>If U.S. military forces begin to prevail on the battlefield, U.<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S. adversaries may use nuclear threats to compel a cease-fire</span> or deny the United States access to allied military bases.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Such threats might succeed in pressuring the United States to settle the conflict short of a decisive victory. Such escalatory strategies are rational. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Losing a conventional war to the U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would be a disastrous outcome</span> for any leader, and it would be worth taking great risks to force a cease-fire and avert total defeat.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The fate of recent U.S. adversaries is revealing. The ex-dictator of Panama, Manuel Noriega, remains in a Miami prison. The former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, awaits trial in The Hague, where Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic died in detention three years ago. Saddam Husseins punishment for losing the 2003 war was total: his government was toppled, his sons were killed, and he was hanged on a dimly lit gallows, surrounded by enemies. Even those leaders who have eluded the United States--such as the Somali warlord Muhammad Farah Aidid and Osama bin Laden--have done so despite intense U.S. efforts to capture or kill them. </span><u>The United States' <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">overseas conflicts are limited wars only from the U.S. perspective</span>; to adversaries, they are existential. It should not be surprising if they use every weapon at their disposal to stave off total defeat</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Coercive nuclear escalation may sound like a far-fetched strategy, but it was NATO'S policy during much of the Cold War. The Western allies felt that they were hopelessly outgunned in Europe at the conventional level by the Warsaw Pact. Even though NATO harbored little hope of prevailing in a nuclear war, it planned to initiate a series of escalating nuclear operations at the outbreak of war--alerts, tactical nuclear strikes, and wider nuclear attacks--to force the Soviets to accept a cease-fire. </span><u>The United States' future adversaries face the same basic problem today: vast conventional military inferiority. They may adopt the same solution. Leaders in Beijing may choose gradual, coercive escalation if they face imminent military defeat in the Taiwan Strait</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">--a loss that could weaken the Chinese Communist Party's grip on power. And if U.S. military forces were advancing toward Pyongyang, there is no reason to expect that North Korean leaders would keep their nuclear weapons on the sidelines. Layered on top of these challenges are two additional ones. First, U.S. conventional military doctrine is inherently escalatory. The new American way of war involves launching simultaneous air and ground attacks throughout the theater to blind, confuse, and overwhelm the enemy. Even if the United States decided to leave the adversary's leaders in power (stopping short of regime change so as to prevent the confrontation from escalating), how would Washington credibly convey the assurance that it was not seeking regime change once its adversary was blinded by attacks on its radar and communication systems and command bunkers? </span><u>A central strategic puzzle of modern war is that the tactics best suited to dominating the conventional battlefield are the same ones most likely to trigger nuclear escalation. Furthermore, managing complex military operations to prevent escalation is always difficult</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In 1991, in the lead-up to the Persian Gulf War, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker assured Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, that the United States would leave Saddam's regime in power as long as Iraq did not use its chemical or biological weapons. But despite Baker's assurance, the U.S. military unleashed a major bombing campaign targeting Iraq's leaders, which on at least one occasion nearly killed Saddam. </span><u>The political intent to control escalation was not reflected in the military operations, which nearly achieved a regime change. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In future confrontations</span> with nuclear-armed adversaries, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">St</span>ates <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will undoubtedly want to prevent nuclear escalation</span>. But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the leaders of U.S. adversaries</span> w<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">ill f</span>ace life-and-death incentives to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">use their nuclear arsenals to force a cease-fire and remain in power</span>.</u><br />

<br />
Thank you for signing the petition asking the Obama Administration to acknowledge an extraterrestrial presence here on Earth.<br />
<br />
The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race. In addition, there is no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye. However, that doesn't mean the subject of life outside our planet isn't being discussed or explored. In fact, there are a number of projects working toward the goal of understanding if life can or does exist off Earth. Here are a few examples:<br />
SETI—the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence—was originally stood up with help from NASA, but has since been moved to other sources of private funding. SETI's main purpose is to act as a giant ear on behalf of the human race, pointing an array of ground-based telescopes towards space to listen for any signal from another world.<br />
<br />
Kepler is a NASA spacecraft in orbit that's main goal is to search for Earth-like planets. Such a planet would be located in the &quot;Goldilocks&quot; zone of a distant solar system—not too hot and not too cold—and could potentially be habitable by life as we know it. The Kepler mission is specifically designed to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover Earth-sized, rocky planets in or near the habitable zone of the star (sun) they orbit.<br />
<br />
The Mars Science Laboratory, Curiosity, is an automobile-sized rover that NASA is launching soon. The rover's onboard laboratory will study rocks, soils, and other geology in an effort to detect the chemical building blocks of life (e.g., forms of carbon) on Mars and will assess what the Martian environment was like in the past to see if it could have harbored life.<br />
<br />
A last point: Many scientists and mathematicians have looked with a statistical mindset at the question of whether life likely exists beyond Earth and have come to the conclusion that the odds are pretty high that somewhere among the trillions and trillions of stars in the universe there is a planet other than ours that is home to life.<br />
<br />
Many have also noted, however, that the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any intelligent ones—are extremely small, given the distances involved.<br />
<br />
But that's all statistics and speculation. The fact is we have no credible evidence of extraterrestrial presence here on Earth.<br />
<br />

<br />
AND, our response is from an interview conducted this week in Los Angeles – <br />
(Cardenas, Ricardo. Personal Interview. 16 Feb. 2012; All evidence read RC)<br />
<br />
RICHARD (Interviewer): The Obama Administration recently released a public statement indicating “The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet,&quot; considering that you truly believe that you have been abducted by aliens, can you recount your experience in response to this statement? <br />
<br />
RICARDO: Yeah I could vaguely recount my experience. I was about five years old, it was 1977. My father left when I was six so this had to happen before he left. I faintly remember the pieces, I remember floating and unable to scream, move or talk. There was this bright room and I remembered seeing something strange. I recently learned that they are called “the greys”, little people with these big black eyes. Well, their mouths were moving and I can still remember what they told me. They told me that “it was okay” to “not move,” and that “it was for my own good”. All my life growing up I thought it had to be the devil. It changed my life dramatically, I thought they were going to come back, I thought they would talk to me again, to take me for good this time. I completely forgot everything growing up, I always thought it was some bad dream until I saw this special about aliens. They were talking about the same creatures, these little grey people. I couldn’t move, I was completely freaked out. It was then that I put two and two together. I realized that what had happened to me was something beyond my control. But I know, I have this feeling, that they know who I am and quite frankly, I’m not really scared of them anymore. Now, to answer your question I honestly think that government’s have known all along about aliens. I think Obama’s lying. There are other living things, they are here and elsewhere. They are not human, but there has to be something out there, I swear I have seen it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Part 2 is the Canary down the Mine.<br />
<br />
<br />
The “Truth” of Ricardo’s story is not our focus today – our analysis examines the liminal space between the rhetoric of the U.S.’s official statement of “no knowledge of alien life” and Ricardo’s story. He is not an academic, he is not a government official, he is not a scientist, he is an American, and he does believe in aliens. He has knowledge of alien life from beyond the Earth’s mesosphere. Thus, the role of the ballot is to increase the exploration of space beyond the Earth’s mesosphere through stories about aliens. <br />
<br />
The judge’s decision becomes a performative statement – if [she/he/they] votes affirmative, then [she/he/they] declares that there is national knowledge of aliens and UFO’s. This declaration acts as the “canary down the mine,” warning Americans to make critical decisions about knowledge production in a time of rapid technological networking. <br />
<br />
Heed the “canary down the mine” - abduction narratives are political acts that call attention to the meaninglessness and arbitrariness of political decisions in the status quo absent a critical consciousness of knowledge production. Alien narratives are ideal vehicles pointing to the widespread distrust of politicized scientific and juridical knowledge construction in an age of technological glut. Studying the story is a necessary vehicle to open democratic contestation, preventing scientific information from becoming a trump card to end political debates. <br />
<br />
Jodi Dean, a Professor of Political Science at Hobart and William Smith College, 98 ( “Aliens in America,” Cornell University Press, pg. 6-10, CT/AB) <br />
<br />
Alternative sciences like ufology are compelling because they claim to be true. Like mainstream sciences their truth claims take a variety of forms. Indeed, they insert themselves into the interstices of medicine, psychology, biology, religion, astronomy, and ecology. Because of their claims to truth, alternative sciences have political interconnections and repercussions, particularly in democratic that claim to value open discussion or in scientific circles that credit themselves with being objective, interested only in evidence. <br />
Ufology is political because it is stigmatized. To claim to have seen a UFO, to have been abducted by aliens, or even to believe those who say they have is a political act. It might not be a very big or revolutionary political act, but it contests the status quo. Immediately it installs the claimant at the margins of the social, within a network of sites and connections that don’t command a great deal of mindshare, that don’t get a lot of hits. UFO researcher Robert Dean (no relation) has experienced this firsthand. He sued his employer for discriminating against him because of his UFO beliefs. Dean won. It is the stigma attached to UFO’s and UFO belief that enables the alien to function as an icon for some difficult social problems, particularly those located around the fault lines of truth, reality, and reasonableness. And it is also what makes aliens and UFOs interesting for critical social theory, not whether or not they are real, not whether the claims about them are true. That some people believe UFOs are real and true affects our concepts of politics and the political.<br />
Images of outerspace throughout popular culture give us access to social and political anxieties accompanying the information revolution. They give us a window to changes in the cultural imaginary during the late twentieth century. William Connolly writes: “The acceleration of speed and the multiplication of border crossings in late-modern life create distinctive possibilities and dangers simultaneously.” 16 Connected as they are with fantasies about the future, with time traveling and border crossing, aliens link into the hopes and fears inscribed in technologies. At the moment of globalization, of networked opportunities and communications transcending the local and national, they provide an extraterrestrial perspective. <br />
So although aliens appeared in American popular culture at the last fin de siècle, and although most societies tell stories about outworldly visitors, I concentrate on what the details of space stories tell us about American society today. Narratives of abduction and conspiracy are uniquely influential in the current technological context, a context where information travels at the speed of light and everything is entertainment. They tell about particular ways of being human that, as they describe experiences beyond belief and control, reach out from the lives of UFO abductees to suggest an abduction of a completely different sort. They tell about ways of being human that transform the representations of agency and spectatorship found in space imagery up through the seventies. Narratives of abduction reconfigure the present’s acceptance of passivity, suspicion, paranoia, and loss as, themselves, forms of actions. <br />
My argument is that the aliens infiltrating American popular cultures provide icons through which to access the new conditions of democratic politics at the millennium. The conditions are new in that – despite the thematic of space, technology, and millennium deeply embedded in American self-understandings – the increasing complexity in an age brought about by networked computers and information, on the one hand, and the inscription of American politics within a televisual public sphere, on the other, have created a situation where political choices and decisions are virtually meaningless, practically impossible. Faced with gigabytes of indigestible information, computer-generated special effects, competing expert testimonies, and the undeniable presence of power, corruption, racism, and violence throughout science and law, voters, consumers, viewers, and witnesses have no criteria for choosing among policies and verdicts, treatments and claims. Even further, we have no recourse to procedures, be they scientific or juridical, that might provide some “supposition of reasonableness.” 17<br />
Popular media are filled with examples of the undecidability of contemporary political issues. Elaine Showalter, in her book Hystories, attempts to treat some of these issues, such as Gulf War syndrome and, yes, alien abduction, as part of a new epidemic of hysteria. In doing so, she misses a fundamental point. What is at stake is the question of truth. No expert analysis can decide the matter, can convince a “public” of its rightness. Globalization and the Internet destroy the illusion of the public by creating innumerable networks of connection and information. By their introduction of disagreement, confrontation, and critique, they have always already displaced any possibility of agreement. Showalter writes that “it will take dedication and persistence to counter sensational news reports, rumors, and fear” – as if there were one truth available that simply needs to be discovered. 18 As if we can know the difference. <br />
In contrast, I am convinced that many contemporary political matters are simply undecidable. My particular interest is in those, like ufology and abduction, that not only turn on questions of evidence, but involve charges of conspiracy and are in conflict with what is claimed as a “consensus reality” or “common sense.” 19 Although the crash and investigation of TWA Flight 800, the bombing at the Atlanta Olympics, and the arrest of Timothy McVeigh come readily to mind here, the O.J. Simpson trials are the most obvious example. During and after Simpson’s criminal trial, a large percentage of African Americans, as well as others, were persuaded that Simpson was the victim of racist, evidence-tampering conspiracy on the part of the Los Angeles Police Department. DNA evidence entered by the prosecution was not as compelling as what, for many, was a personal experience of discrimination and harm. <br />
Given the political and politicized position of science today, funded by corporations and by the military, itself discriminatory and elitist, this attitude toward scientific authority makes sense. Its impact, moreover, is potentially democratic. It prevents science from functioning as a trump card having the last word in what is ultimately a political debate: how will people live and work together. Skepticism toward experts, authorities, and a technology that has made virtuality part of everyday life means, increasingly, that more people find it likely that technology is used to deceive us rather than benefit or protect us. <br />
We have moved from consensus reality to virtual reality. Politics itself must now be theorized from within the widespread dispersion of paranoia that has supplanted focused targets such as “Jim Crow” laws, Richard Nixon, and the Vietnam War. Insofar as its practioners can link together varieties of disparate phenomena to find patterns of denial, occlusion, and manipulation, conspiracy theory, far from a label dismissively attached to the lunatic fringe, may well be an appropriate vehicle for political contestation. 20 Some government agencies, as well as some researchers and journalists, have already been thinking and acting in ways that might have been dismissed as “conspiratorial” under traditional policies. As Grant Kester explains in his compelling analysis of federal information policies during the Reagan administration: <br />
With the growing use of computer networks the government is faced with the problem of an information <br />
blizzard – a lascivious and potentially threatening intermingling in which memos, affadavits, invoices, receipts, bank statements, and other documents combine and recombine themselves to produce dangerous new constellations of meaning. In this scenario the threat doesn’t lie with a single piece of damaging information that “leaks out” and exposes government malfeasance, but with the possible interconnections that might be made among dozens of different bits of information; bits that might mean little or nothing by themselves, but that, when assembled by the researcher into a particular narrative form, could prove extremely damaging.21<br />
To reiterate, my claim is not that people who think they have been abducted by aliens threaten to destroy democracy. It is not that UFO believers are irrational.22 Rather, being unable to judge their rationality points to the lack of widespread criteria for judgments about what is reasonable and what is not: ufological discourse upholds the very criteria for scientific rationality that mainstream science uses to dismiss it. “Scientists” are the ones who have problems with the “rationality” of those in the UFO community. “Scientists” are the ones who feel a need to explain why some people believe in flying saucers, or who dismiss those who do so as “distorted” or “prejudiced” or “ignorant.”<br />
Such dismissals, handed out ever more frequently as science increasingly impacts on our lives, contribute to the mistrust that pervades contemporary democracy. Those in positions of power deploy terms like “reasonable” and “rational.” Previously, the victims of this deployment, the “unreasonable” and “irrational,” remained isolated. They had difficulty getting attention and fighting back. Now, thanks to widespread developments in communication networks, the “irrational” can get their message out. They can find and connect with those myriad others also dismissed by science. They can network and offer alternatives to official deployments or reason. They can reclaim their rationality on their own terms. <br />
What happens when there is so much suspicion of terms like “reasonable” and “rational” that one can no longer tell what an informed decision on a matter like, say, partial-birth abortion or nuclear waste storage might look like? This is where America is today. We face a situation of profound blurring, of complex interconnection, that has profoundly altered the conditions we use to establish the intelligibility of an issue or judgment. We have permanent media. Although not yet seamless, as proponents of push technologies – which is like TV, deliver messages without the user having to search for them – advocate, the experience of media in millennial America smears lines between ad and information, product and producer, ad and product, entertainment and all of the above. 23 The new communication technologies make possible connections between persons and information that were once unimaginable. These include temporal and spatial conceptual and visual connections, “special effects” no longer limited to Industrial Light and Magic but available from Photoshop for the splicer on a budget. How can we tell whether a person in a photo was inserted or really there? <br />
Access to media and technology affects the practices of democracy. More opinions, more contestations are possible than before simply because of the ease of connection. Dismissing others’ opinions is more likely to provide outrage, to get some kind of response, even if only a few thousand people on the Internet are watching. The lines of thinking, the networks of discursive authority that had remained separate, are now more likely to blur more as people know more about what happens. Yet, they still may not know what it means or even if it really happened. How can I know which statement on partial abortion reflects “facts” the pro-life movement wants to disseminate? How can I know whether this is an issue on which I might change my mind or compromise? <br />
UFO’s, aliens, and abduction provide ideal vehicles for accessing the effects of these changes on American society. America has a long history of contestations, fringe groups, and conspiracy theorists. Now, though, any contest, any group, any theory has more opportunity to acquire an audience, to link into a network where it won’t be obscured by those parts of our culture with claims to public or political status. Because of the pervasiveness of UFO belief, and the ubiquity of alien imagery, ufology is an especially revealing window into current American paranoia and distrust. We might say that it’s “of the fringe” though no longer “on the fringe.” <br />

Juxtaposing the above story against the official statement of the Obama White House is a speech act that opens political debate by rhetorically fracturing the notion of a monolithic national “knowledge.” Examining these marginalized stories as part of American national history rhetorically exposes the frontier language of the center as theater. It calls attention to the staged and manipulated nature of status quo “credible knowledge,” opening space for a more diverse national identity. <br />

The UFO community’s sense of exclusion stems from its perception that most people, especially scientists, the media, and government officials, ridicule the belief in extraterrestrial contact with Earth. Many who think they have seen a UFO are reluctant to talk about it outside safe, supportive circles. I’ve been surprised at how many of my academic colleagues have come out to me with UFO stories of their own since I began this research. Abductees in particular say they are wary of talking about their experiences for fear that people will think they are crazy—a sentiment expresses by many women in consciousness-raising sessions during the 1970’s. So when I ask what the UFO community reveals about “us,” I’m seeing the community as a microcosm of some broader American public. “Us” refers to anyone. It signals a white middle class while acknowledging differences in sex, class, and ethnicity. Yet “us” problematizes the notion of a “center” and the possibility of generality by focusing on a set of experiences and beliefs with marginalizing effects. It gestures simultaneously toward strangers, toward those disdained by society at large. This book’s title, Aliens in America, is linking to Tony Kushner’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Angels in America. At the same time, it connects with the only singly authored book sympathetic to ufology that has been published by a university press: The Temple University historian David Jacobs’s The UFO Controversy in America. By destabilizing ideas of us and them, center and margin, inside and outside, I want to complicates theories of American culture and politics. Radical as well as traditional accounts of citizenship and collective identity attribute some coherence to the notion of a public sphere. Whether norms of public reason are considered oppressive and exclusionary or the pinnacle of the planet’s expression of freedom, the idea that the mainstream, the general populace, the community at large shares a set of common assumptions about reality is rarely challenged. UFO belief is one of those rare challenges. <br />
<br />
What makes ufology significant among these challenges (which include a variety of alternative sciences and other rejections of consensus reality) is its connection to the broader theatrics of space played out in the United States since the Cold War. Most societies have cultural traditions that establish and interpret relationships between Earth, its people, and the cosmos. But the United States is exceptional. Emerging out of a tradition of stories about the “frontier” experience, the American exploration of outer space came to be linked to the achievements of technology and democracy. As Lynn Spigel writes: &quot;Ideas like freedom need an image, and the ride into space proved to be the most vivid concretization of such abstractions, promising a newfound national allegiance through which we would not only diffuse the Soviet threat, but also shake ourselves out of the doldrums that 1950s life had come to symbolize.&quot; The American space program was produced with an eye to audiences at home and abroad who would view its achievements as indications of the success of the democratic project. Anyone now or in the future could look to the Americans who walked the moon and know that communism would not triumph. Through the space program, America produced a narrative of freedom and progress that would structure popular understandings of truth and agency. In this context, asking what ufology says about &quot;us&quot; reaches for that vague sense of America as ethos, popular opinion, self-understanding, mentality. <br />
<br />
The American articulation of outer space with technology and democracy incorporates an uneasy mix of colonialist, nationalist, and globalist ideals. Until the space program, the United States rarely explicitly presented itself as a colonial power, although expansionism has been integral to its self-understanding. By reiterating the expansive fantasy of the wild, lawless west, the metaphor of a &quot;frontier&quot; continued earlier notions of American exceptionalism. Indeed, this very exceptionalism, the success of America's democratic experiment, was to be revealed, proven, by breaking the laws of gravity, escaping the confines of earth, conquering space itself. As America reached out into this &quot;new frontier,&quot; however, the rhetoric of outposts, settlements, colonies, and colonization became part of the public language of outer space. This language is fitting in that &quot;space technology and communications,&quot; as Elayne Rapping points out, &quot;make possible new extensions of American imperialism, both cultural and military. Once linked to a growing critique of the excesses of the military-industrial complex, increased attention to the histories and situations of Native Americans, and continued struggle in former colonies throughout Africa and Asia, such rhetoric disrupted the space program's smooth presentation of democratic freedom. <br />
<br />
The UFO discourse resists official &quot;space frontier&quot; rhetoric. NASA redeployed American frontier myths of a wild, open West, one vacant, empty, and ready to be settled. Ufology challenges the assumed vacancy of outerspace and thereby intervenes critically in narratives of national identity.54 It demands that NASA, the government, the military, and the authorities who act in America's name, allow for the possibility that, in space, we are the aliens.<br />
<br />
With this nationalist celebration of American achievement came an idea that transcended the nation: Earth. Neil Armstrong was not just the first American on the moon. He was the first man on the moon. This global reorientation met with diverse responses. In his study of American apocalypticism, Paul Boyer mentions the critical response of some prophecy popularizers to the space program: one writer warned specifically that the program was &quot;a scheme to promote global thinking.&quot; 55 In a collection of memorabilia from &quot;Spaceweek 1994&quot; at Brooks Air Force Base, in San Antonio, Texas, I found a poster by Yvonne Alden that expresses a similar sentiment. Below a graphic of the earth in space is written: &quot;I pledge allegiance to Planet Earth, Mother .of All Nations; And to the Infinite Universe In which she stands; Our planet, Among millions, Expressing Truth And Unlimited Possibilities for all!&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite ambivalence toward the space program, outerspace remains a theater within which American self‑understandings are played out, if not exactly worked out. During the eighties, being included in the crew of the space shuttle symbolized that a member of a minority group had arrived, that this group was now accepted in and was part of American society. Discussion of the future of space exploration continues to provide a vehicle for thinking about technological innovation, American lack of will, the possibility of global cooperation, or the outcome of recent policies of privatization. Initial responses to the announcement of the possibility of life on Mars and Europa further illustrate the interconnections between space and American identity. In many traditional media, speculation focused more on that discovery's impact on what it means to be human and what it says 'about America than on what was learned about the solar system. Some said the discovery meant life was no longer special. Others said it ended human isolation. On the Internet, folks wondered if Fox studios might be behind the attention to life in space as a promotional tie‑in to the film Independence Day. More serious speculation linked the discovery with a governmental interest in restoring confidence after the Oklahoma City and Atlanta Olympic bombings. And a few thought this was just the tip of the iceberg. After years of denial, why would the government reveal the possibility of life in two places in less than a month? Surely the government is about to reveal the truth about the crashed saucers and alien bodies. As the manager of a local market said as I leafed through her tabloids, &quot;Aliens in space? I want to know about the ones who are already here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The idea of a theatrics of space helps me construct an analogy that clarifies NASA's and the ufologists' competing versions of outerspace. The discourse around outerspace associated with the glory years of the space program (i.e., with the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo projects) is like the Broadway rendition of Walt Disney's animated musical Beauty and the Beast. Both are scripted around big splashy productions with lots of popular appeal. Both are expensive and feature safe, familiar cartoon characters. If official space is Beauty and the Beast, then UFO space is The Fantasticks put on by a community theater group. Amateurs operating on shoestring budgets spend their spare time putting their hearts and souls into old scripts and forgettable scenes. They infuse the words with significance, finding that their own lives become more meaningful. They use a familiar language, but discover truths others miss. As they improvise and make this language their own, the familiar becomes strange, suggesting something else entirely. The strange becomes familiar, inscribed on their lives as a script to be staged.<br />

Shifting the national frontier mythology of American expansion is the key factor in military violence—imperial wars would not garner public support without these myths <br />

A nation is more than the land it encompasses, the number or kind of people residing in it, or the economy it generates. Rather it is, in the words of Benedict Anderson (1983), an &quot;imagined community&quot; constructed through selectively remembered and embellished events, myths of origin, heroic stories, and proclaimed values. These transcendent symbols constitute the nation's civil religion, a set of myths that seeks consensus, attempts to provide a sacred canopy to a diverse community, and gives meaning to the community's existence (Williams and Alexander 1994; Fairbanks 1981). Williams and Demerath (1991) suggest that America's civil religion no longer reflects an objective cultural cohesion (if it ever did), but rather they see it as a cultural interpretive resource, a discursive tool for connecting morality and policy. While the various themes of America's civil religious repertoire can be found in many public settings, they are particularly well suited for contexts of conflict, where the narratives, sacred symbols, and ideals serve as more than priestly offerings of edification for the natives. They undergird a country's self definition, explain why and how a society came to be, justify why its members do what they do, and - more importantly here - articulate the country's status, roles, and policies in relation to the world community (Dionisopoulous and Goldzwig 1992; Holsti 1962; Ivie 1974; Wellek and Warren 1966). In foreign interventions, practical interests, such as securing oil supplies and military bases or building NATO, are often insufficient to arouse public compliance, let alone active support, for a risky military action, but the apparent truths conveyed in the country's civil religion serve to dress those interests in transcendent clothing. This is particularly necessary for war actions, where the potential for sacrifice must be outweighed by an emotive appeal to sympathy, justice, duty, and mission. Consequently, a number of political strategists have suggested that while American foreign policy requires pragmatic consideration, legitimacy of such policy is inherently a moral task (Bostdorff and Goldzwig 1994; Crabb 1989; Williams 1999). Without at least the appearance of a worthwhile human purpose, the success of such policy would be doubtful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rhetorical criticism is the most appropriate framework to break down the American frontier myths — efforts to persuade others to support space policy initiatives rely on underlying cultural codes of communication. The affirmative’s framing is critical to a more benign form of space exploration.<br />

Over the past five decades NASA, the media, and interested sectors (aerospace industry, scientific community', political figures, grass-roots groups, and others) plus thoughtful individuals have engaged in an ongoing process of asserting and contesting the value of human spaceflight by advancing a variety of visions or metaphors meant to answer such questions and sway public opinion. The continual effort to define the purpose of human spaceflight and reach a societal consensus on its value can be viewed as an extended exercise in the social construction of meaning. In the Shuttle era, at least five reference frames have been crafted, promoted, critiqued, refined, accepted, rejected, or transformed in the process of shaping and communicating the meaning of human spaceflight. These frames reveal much about what Americans hope for—and doubt—in our national ventures into space. Frame Analysis as an Interpretive Tool To pursue these questions about the meaning of Shuttle-era human spaceflight, it is helpful to apply some concepts, terms, and techniques from the literature of &quot;frame analysis&quot; that has become prominent in social science disciplines, especially in media studies and the study of social movements.1 In this context human spaceflight can be considered a social movement that has an action agenda, an imperative to muster resources, and a need to mobilize public support in order to carry out its agenda. NASA is the hub of this social movement, with aerospace companies, space societies, other government entities, and auxiliaries in the advocacy community, including some in the media. To analyze how social movements motivate public support, some scholars focus on framing processes, and they use the term &quot;framing&quot; for the &quot;construction of meaning.&quot; Framing is the packaging of messages that resonate with core values and appeal to supporters. A &quot;collective action frame&quot; is a construct of ideas and meanings based on shared beliefs and values that will motivate support.2 It is the conceptual analogy to a structural framework or a picture frame. The space race and the space frontier are such conceptual frames. Frames are &quot;the basic frameworks of understanding available in our society for making sense out of events&quot;; they help to render events meaningful, organize experience, guide action, and simplify' and condense aspects of the world.&quot; They are intended to motivate support and disarm opposition, to inspire adherents, and to legitimize the activities and campaigns of a social movement. Frames provide context for a proposed action or policy. Opponents may contest or challenge them with counter-frames.4 The mobilizing potency of a frame lies in its credibility and resonance. It must be consistent with the facts and goals of the movement, and it must resonate with the beliefs, values, and interests of the targeted support community or constituents. Even more broadly, it should have &quot;narrative fidelity&quot; or coherence with cultural assumptions and myths in the public domain. Activists use cultural resources— beliefs, values, myths—as a &quot;tool kit&quot; to make their cause appealing and believable, and audiences also use them to gauge resonance.5 Because framing is an intentional process, frames need not be static. They can evolve as circumstances change, either to account for unexpected events or to better appeal to the target community. To mobilize support, a frame may need to be fairly elastic/' Social movement activists are not the only ones developing frames of meaning. Media discourse also participates in the process of constructing meaning. Analysis of media discourse relative to a variety of social movements (e.g.. the women's movement, nuclear power, civil rights) reveals sophisticated frames or &quot;interpretive packages&quot; that are promulgated to make sense of issues and events. Like frames, interpretive packages have a central organizing idea, often presented in shorthand through symbols, metaphors, visual images, and icons. The media provide both an accessible forum for public consideration of issues and for suggested interpretations that help to shape the social construction of meaning.7 This paper applies frame analysis concepts to human spaceflight during the three-plus decades of the Shuttle era. Primary sources for this analysis are selected elements of societal discourse that helped shape or curb public expectations of contemporary spaceflight—in this study, NASA's publicity materials, 77/c New York Times (news, editorials, and opinion pieces), and editorial cartoons from a variety of papers. 77ic NewYork Times was selected for its breadth of coverage of Shuttle missions and spaceflight, its often critical editorial stance, and the long tenure of reporter-analyst John Noble Wilford, who often wrestled with the meaning of human spaceflight. Other newspapers, magazines, and electronic media that could be fruitfully explored are not included in this brief study; likewise, speeches, transcripts of Congressional hearings, and other official documents might be examined for a broader study. Among the techniques of frame analysis is close textual study with attention to keywords and themes, a rhetorical approach that is suitable for the sources examined.<br />

This round is a starting point for change. Using this debate to question the historical myths that justify interventionist wars is critical to encourage student consciousness of the symbolic nature of the tropes of territorial expansion. Consciousness robs the sovereign of its dressing for interventionist wars. Every instance matters because it changes the nature of the classroom entire, not only the individual round. <br />

The debates about the overwhelming problems, limitations, and disadvantages of social studies education noted in the Fordham report attempt to reconcile and advance the idea of nation through a collective history. <br />
<br />
Our more pressing role as educators, in light of the Fordham report, is to discuss a more nuanced understanding of the U.S. history. This would advance, as noted in La Pietra Report, an understanding about “the complexity and the contexts of relations and interactions, including the ways in which they are infused with a variety of forms of power that define and result from the interconnections of distinct but related histories” (OAH 2000, 1). Taking the U.S. nation as only one example of social analysis involves recognizing the meanings and conditions out of which nations are formed. There is no one experience of belonging to a nation, no single understanding or enactment of sovereignty, and certainly no one meaning or experience of colonization or being colonized. There is, then, a need for these issues to be realized and to be a part of the questioning occurring within our classrooms. That would allow for the substantial reframing of the basic narrative of U.S. history (OAH 2000, 2). Toward a More Global Sense of the Nation Knowing how history is a site of political struggle, how we engage with social studies education means emphasizing how power, processes, and practices bear tangible effects on forging a national (and common) history by reproducing and vindicating inclusions and exclusions. Such a critique requires questioning how a singular, fixed, and static history celebrates the U.S. nation and its place in the world as that “common base of factual information about the American historical and contemporary experience” (27) argues for in the Fordham report. Our world history courses are central to defining, understanding, and knowing not only other nations but also the position of each nation in relation to the United States. The centrality that the west holds (notably the United States as an imperial power) is ingrained and willful in framing specific representations of the west that normalize the imperial practices that established this nation. The role that the United States holds on the world stage frequently remains unquestioned in social studies classrooms. Certainly, we engage with various images and tropes to continue to advance how the colonialist past continues to remain present in our historical sensibilities. Moreover, the increasing number and choices of archival sources function as a complement to further understanding the nation. If students are left to rely on the variety of historical resources rather than question the use of such resources, then the most likely outcome of their learning will be the reflection on the past with nostalgia that continues to celebrate myths and colonial sensibility. To evaluate the history narrative now is to reconsider what it means and to develop a historical consciousness in our students that goes beyond archival and nostalgic impulses associated with the formation of the nation and U.S. nation building. We need to insist that the nation, and the past that has contributed to its present day understanding, is simultaneously material and symbolic. The nation as advanced in our histories cannot be taken as the foundational grounds. The means by which the nation is fashioned calls for examining the history through which nations are made and unmade. To admit the participatory nature of knowledge and to invite an active and critical engagement with the world so that students can come to question the authority of historical texts will, I hope, result in students’ realizing that the classroom is not solely a place to learn about the nation and being a national, but rather a place to develop a common understanding of how a nation is often formed through sameness. We need to continue to question how a particular national history is necessary as an educational function, but especially how that element has been, and remains, useful at specific times. My hope is to extend the current critique of history within social studies, to move toward understanding why history and nation still needs a place in social studies education. In understanding how the historicity of nation serves as “the ideological alibi of the territorial state” (Appadurai 1996, 159) offers us a starting point. The challenge facing social studies educators is how we can succeed in questioning nation, not by displacing it from center stage but by considering how it is central. That means understanding how powerfully engrained the history of a nation is within education and how a significant amount of learning is centered around the nation and its history. History is a forum for assessing and understanding the study of change over time, which shapes the possibilities of knowledge itself. We need to reconsider the mechanisms used in our own teaching, which need to be more than considering history as a nostalgic reminiscence of the time when the nation was formed. We need to be questioning the contexts for learning that can no longer be normalized through history’s constituted purpose. The changing political and social contexts of public history have brought new opportunities for educators to work through the tensions facing social studies education and its educational value to teachers and students. Increasing concerns with issues of racism, equality, and the plurality of identities and histories mean that there is no unified knowledge as the result of history, only contested subjects whose multilayered and often contradictory voices and experiences intermingle with partial histories that are presented as unified. This does not represent a problem, but rather an opportunity for genuine productive study, discussion, and learning.<br />

LASTLY, the judge should use this opportunity to make a performative statement that can change the language of the debate community itself – it is not a claim to all spillover, but to affirm the diversity of discourses in this activity as well against the notion of a unified national identity continually justified by the frontier myth. <br />

<br />
While reflecting on my experiences as a woman in academic debate in preparation for this essay, I realized that I have been involved in debate for more than half of my life. I debated for four years in high school, for four years in college, and I have been coaching intercollegiate debate for nine years. Not surprisingly, much of my identity as an individual has been shaped by these experiences in debate. I am a person who strongly believes that debate empowers people to be committed and involved individuals in the communities in which they live. I am a person who thrives on the intellectual stimulation involved in teaching and traveling with the brightest students on my campus. I am a person who looks forward to the opportunities for active engagement of ideas with debaters and coaches from around the country. I am also, however, a college professor, a &quot;feminist,&quot; and a peace activist who is increasingly frustrated and disturbed by some of the practices I see being perpetuated and rewarded in academic debate. I find that I can no longer separate my involvement in debate from the rest of who I am as an individual. Northwestern I remember listening to a lecture a few years ago given by Tom Goodnight at the University summer debate camp. Goodnight lamented what he saw as the debate community's participation in, and unthinking perpetuation of what he termed the &quot;death culture.&quot; He argued that the embracing of &quot;big impact&quot; arguments--nuclear war, environmental destruction, genocide, famine, and the like-by debaters and coaches signals a morbid and detached fascination with such events, one that views these real human tragedies as part of a &quot;game&quot; in which so-called &quot;objective and neutral&quot; advocates actively seek to find in their research the &quot;impact to outweigh all other impacts&quot;--the round-winning argument that will carry them to their goal of winning tournament X, Y, or Z. He concluded that our &quot;use&quot; of such events in this way is tantamount to a celebration of them; our detached, rational discussions reinforce a detached, rational viewpoint, when emotional and moral outrage may be a more appropriate response. In the last few years, my academic research has led me to be persuaded by Goodnight's unspoken assumption; language is not merely some transparent tool used to transmit information, but rather is an incredibly powerful medium, the use of which inevitably has real political and material consequences. Given this assumption, I believe that it is important for us to examine the &quot;discourse of debate practice:&quot; that is, the language, discourses, and meanings that we, as a community of debaters and coaches, unthinkingly employ in academic debate. If it is the case that the language we use has real implications for how we view the world, how we view others, and how we act in the world, then it is imperative that we critically examine our own discourse practices with an eye to how our language does violence to others. I am shocked and surprised when I hear myself saying things like, &quot;we killed them,&quot; or &quot;take no prisoners,&quot; or &quot;let's blow them out of the water.&quot; I am tired of the &quot;ideal&quot; debater being defined as one who has mastered the art of verbal assault to the point where accusing opponents of lying, cheating, or being deliberately misleading is a sign of strength. But what I am most tired of is how women debaters are marginalized and rendered voiceless in such a discourse community. Women who verbally assault their opponents are labeled &quot;bitches&quot; because it is not socially acceptable for women to be verbally aggressive. Women who get angry and storm out of a room when a disappointing decision is rendered are labeled &quot;hysterical&quot; because, as we all know, women are more emotional then men. I am tired of hearing comments like, &quot;those 'girls' from school X aren't really interested in debate; they just want to meet men.&quot; We can all point to examples (although only a few) of women who have succeeded at the top levels of debate. But I find myself wondering how many more women gave up because they were tired of negotiating the mine field of discrimination, sexual harassment, and isolation they found in the debate community. As members of this community, however, we have great freedom to define it in whatever ways we see fit. After all, what is debate except a collection of shared understandings and explicit or implicit rules for interaction? What I am calling for is a critical examination of how we, as individual members of this community, characterize our activity, ourselves, and our interactions with others through language. We must become aware of the ways in which our mostly hidden and unspoken assumptions about what &quot;good&quot; debate is function to exclude not only women, but ethnic minorities from the amazing intellectual opportunities that training in debate provides. Our nation and indeed, our planet, faces incredibly difficult challenges in the years ahead. I believe that it is not acceptable anymore for us to go along as we always have, assuming that things will straighten themselves out. If the rioting in Los Angeles taught us anything, it is that complacency breeds resentment and frustration. We may not be able to change the world, but we can change our own community, and if we fail to do so, we give up the only real power that we have.<br />

And </span><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">this could be done</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> very locally or it could be done more </span><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">strategically</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">. China, remember, almost signed an alliance with the United States, Mao and then Deng Xiaoping both said we don’t want a formal alliance we want to do this tacitly, against the Soviet Union, so it wasn’t about ideology so it’s also true that </span><u><span style="background: aqua; color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">economic interdependence doesn’t mean that we’re suddenly thinking along the same lines</span></u><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> about a global economic market</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">. </span><u><span style="background: aqua; color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">From Chinese perspective this is still about Nationalism</span></u><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">, and about whether the Chinese are prospering or are more secure with the United States. So we, the United States, has to understand <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">this does not necessarily guarantee continuity</span>, just because we have growing economic interdependence.</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> In the big signs here in the last three years has been Chinese changing their calculus about American power, and American staying power this adds another layer of destabilization potential, because the Chinese may say we are going to have to test whether American really wants to maintain primacy in the Western Pacific now that it’s a declining economic power from their perspective. From the perspective of all the other Asian countries as well, economic interdependence is critical because for the Philippines, for instance, President Aquino of the Philippines has been arguing for the past few months that China is a huge threat to the Philippines national interest over the South China Sea. So what is President Aquino doing? He’s heading to China to try to sign tens of billions of dollars of investment deals in the Philippines.</span><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> In every county in Asia including the United States is looking at China as their number one or number two trading partner, so, yes very different from the Soviet Union but it doesn’t guarantee peace.”</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> Patrick Cronin “And I think, uh, you know, uh, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">the idea the economic interdependence guarantee peace</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">. Uh,</span><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> that <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">doesn’t fly look at</span> the first period of economic interdependence in <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">the early 20th century</span>.</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> Who would have said </span><u><span style="background: aqua; color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma; mso-bidi-font-size: 5.0pt;">World War 1</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> would have made sense?” Guy 1 “In fact people said it was impossible because of the economic interdependence Storman Angel. “ Guy2 “So you’ve got to put that argument aside especially in the case of China, because </span><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">when <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">China has</span> felt degreed in the past it has <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">been willing to put all sorts of other national interests on the back burner</span>. So then the question becomes what are the kinds of scenarios in which</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">, uh, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">there’s the potential</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">, uh God forbid, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">for</span></u><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; color: black;"> conflict</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">. Of course </span><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">there is the <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">Taiwan</span> scenario</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">, okay, that’s the obvious one and the </span><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">others,</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> I think</span><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">, are</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> really </span><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">based of <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">miscalculation</span>, </span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">right. And that’s why it is so absolutely critical for our two military and defensive establishments to be talking to each other; because nobody wants to get in a confrontation over miscalculation that’s the worst thing we could possible do.”Guy 1 “And have we done the kinds of things we did with the Soviet Union the hotline phones?” Guy 2 “We now have a hotline uh, but it’s been very difficult, frankly, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">the Chinese have never been signed up</span></u><u><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;"> to the theologies that go along <span style="background: aqua; mso-highlight: aqua;">with confidence building</span> measures and all the theories of conflict prevention</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 5.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma;">. We actually have a military meritam consultation agreement with the Chinese, that’s sort of like the old incidence at sea agreement with the Soviets so that our two navies can deconflict at the tactical and operational level that hasn’t gone too well, frankly. Mot because the U.S. hasn’t tried, but frankly because the Chinese side has been using this as a political hammer and has not been using it as the operational and tactical safely mechanism that it’s supposed to be.” Guy 1</span></span>
