==Micropolitics K== 
**A. Their macro-political advocacy maintains the control-oriented mindset of status quo politics – instead of engaging in the fascist practice of role-playing bureaucracy or macropolitics, we should instead seek to describe the way politics influences everyday existence –**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Marks, '05</span>**(John, 2005, The Deleuze dictionary, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. 227-229)

'Representation', for Deleuze, entails an essentially moral view of the world, explicitly
AND
of challenging the interpretative tendency of representation to trace becomings back to origins.
**B. Their method of control-oriented political communication is the lynchpin for microfascism, or the permeation of fascism into both our daily lives and our mentalities – this is the internal link to all oppression and violence –**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Guattari, '92</span>** (Felix, Pour une refondation des pratiques socials, 1992, reprinted in The Guattari Reader, p. 265)

Social and moral progress is inseparable from the collective and individual practices that advance it
AND
the social. Thus, a subjective music remains to be thereby composed.
**C. Their replication of the system of control suppresses life and freedom – instead, __we should hijack speech to elude control__, disrupting the dominant modes of control and fostering a smooth space upon which to create new political strategies –**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Deleuze and Negri, '90</span>**(Gilles and Antonio, Control and Becoming, [[http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdeleuze3.htm]])

Deleuze: What I've been interested in are collective creations rather than representations. There's
AND
of non-communication, circuit breakers, so we can elude control.
