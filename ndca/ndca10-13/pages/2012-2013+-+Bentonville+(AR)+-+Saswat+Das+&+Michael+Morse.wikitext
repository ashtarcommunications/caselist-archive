===Contention 1-Technology=== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Transportation technology’s fixation with speed manipulates nature draining it of value</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Nadis,</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> History professor at California State University, 20</span>**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">06</span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> (Fred, “</span>//The Enchantments of Technology (review)”,// <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Technology and Culture, Project Muse)</span>

In this intriguing synthesis............<span style="font-size: 10pt;">would be ideal readers.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The logic of distance and time is a representation of technological thought. Shrinking the distances in all aspects of life to pure efficiency—Heidegger ‘50</span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Martin </span>Heidegger<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, June </span>1950<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, “The Thing” pg. 1</span>

<span style="font-size: 110%;">All distances in time and space are shrinking...........</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nor is great distance remoteness.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The current pace of technological evolution is accelerating to a point where we will reach a rupture in the fabric of humanity representing the next technological paradigm shift—Kurzweil ‘01</span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Ray Kurzweil, 2001, “The Law of Accelerating Returns,” </span><span style="color: blue; font-size: 10pt;">[[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns]]</span>

<span style="font-size: 110%;">Can the pace of technological progress continue to speed up indefinitely.......... </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">the next high level</span> __paradigm shift.__

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">A Technological View of Earth Pushes Us Into Anthropocentrism because we see everything as having no inherent relationship. Other species and animals become less than objects to us allowing the justification of an anthropocentric view of the world.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Turnbull '06</span>**<span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">[Neil, Cool Dude, “The Ontological Consequences of Copernicus”, Theory, Culture & Society Journal, 2006, Vol. 23(1): 125-139, DOI: 10.1177/0263276406063232, Page 131 - 132, JCOOK]</span>

Thus, for the later Heidegger worlds............the anthropocentric measure of all things).

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Our Technological thinking causes the brutalization of humanity and establishes a false sense of value to life- this outweighs any impact. Metaphysical approaches have been exhausted—Weinberger ‘92</span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Jerry Weinberger, Professor of Political Science at Michigan State University, “Politics and the Problem of Technology: An Essay on Heidegger and the Tradition of Political Philosophy”, The American Political Science Review, Vol. 86, No. 1 (Mar. 1992), pp. 112-127, JSTOR) KR/JRC</span>

<span style="font-size: 12px;">Recent thinking about technology..........it will not be to recur to the contending elements of modern rationalism.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Humanity’s attempt at making calculations is a facet of our technological mindset. These calculations represent our reduction of the world to a subject/object dualism in order to assign value and deciding what is to be consumed or discarded. This results in the stripping of nature and a hollowing or our being—DeLuca ‘05</span>**
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Kevin Michael DeLuca, Associate Professor of Speech Communication and adjunct in the Institute of Ecology at the University of Georgia, “Thinking With Heidegger: Rethinking Environmental Theory and Practice”, Ethics & the Environment 10.1 (2005) 67-87, Project Muse)//JRC—no change</span>

Machination is unconditional controllability,..........Others translate it as lived-experience.)

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Our Aff represents a radical break from the technological age through the examination of being- This break will reconnect humans with nature and remove themselves and nature from standing reserve, now is the key time to act; We are fighting for our lives—Best and Nocella ‘06</span>**
Best and Nocella, 2006,<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> –associate professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso (Igniting a Revolution: Voices in Defense of the Earth, p. 82-84, google books)//JRC</span>

Yet, for both Heidegger and revolutionary environmentalists...........It is in this sense of releasement Heidegger writes, 

===Contention 2-Mother Nature=== 
**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 13pt;">Current transportation infrastructure instrumentalizes the environment for solely human ends—This reinforces our separation from the ecological systems in which we participate, ensuring catastrophic collapse.</span>**
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 13pt;">Duyser ‘10</span>
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Mitchell Duyser. Master of Architecture at University of Cincinnati. April 2010. “Hybrid Landscapes: Territories of Shared Ecological and Infrastructural Value”. Masters Thesis.Pages 3-7.</span>

The construct of modern human life.............means of reintegrating civilization with ecology.

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 13pt;">Transportation Infrastructure epitomizes anthropocentric bias—environments are destroyed and reduced to human interests resulting in the systemic slaughter of animals.</span>**

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 13pt;">Davenport ‘6</span>
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">John Davenport and Julia Davenport. Dept of Conservation Biology at Swedish University of Ag Sci. 2006. “Mortality in Wildlife Due to Transportation”. __The ecology of transportation__. Pgs 165-166.</span>

No other ecological impact of transportation................... an environmentally sound and sustainable development. 

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">This ontology is flawed—anthropocentrism disconnects humanity from nature.</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13pt;">Turner 95</span>**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> (Jack, previous professor of philosophy at the University of Illinois “Gary Snider and The Practice of the Wild” in </span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Deep Ecology for the 21st Century</span>//<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">, ed. George Sessions, p. 41-42)</span>

With such raw contact we learn what primary cultures learned............... yet we are so early weaned from her breast to society.' " 

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">And—tolerating the destruction of this ecosystem saps us of our humanity</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13pt;">Bookchin 87</span>**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> (Murray, co-founder of the Institute of Social Ecology “An Appeal For Social and Psychological Sanity” 1987)</span>

<span style="font-size: 12px;">Industrially and technologically, we are moving at an ever-accelerating pace...........disempowered of its capacity to reproduce a green and living world.</span>


**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Our affirmative is used to entail __rejection__ of the __human-centered justifications__ and framing in current transportation infrastructure. </span>**
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Eric </span>**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Katz and</span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Lauren </span>**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Oechsli, 1993</span>**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Members of the Science, Technology, and Society Program,, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark. Katz is currently Vice President of the International Society for Environmental Ethics , “Moving beyond Anthropocentrism: Environmental Ethics, Development, and the Amazon”, </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: initial;">[[http://www.umweltethik.at/download.php?id=392]]</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.)</span>

Can an environmentalist defend a policy avoiding problems.......................... in environmental policy that a human-based ethic cannot.13

**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Increase in wildlife crossings allows for a shift in the way in which we use transportation from pure human-use.</span>**
Tarantino, Angie. "Environmental Issues and Discussions." //Environmental Issues and Discussions//. N.p., 28 Aug. 2012. Web. <http://begreen.botw.org/2012/08/ecoducts-bridges-for-wildlife/>.

A dead animal lying on the side of the road is.....................a year in damages. 

===Plan Text=== 
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">My partner and I advocate that the United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment by increasing the construction wildlife crossings highly ecologically damaged areas.</span>**
