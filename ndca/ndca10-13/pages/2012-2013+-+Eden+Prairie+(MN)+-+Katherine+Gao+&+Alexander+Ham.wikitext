**Contention 1 is Economic Leadership**

<span style="vertical-align: baseline;">Investment in ports is crucial to the competitiveness and employment of the US</span>

Aging infrastructure for marine ports, inland waterways, and airports threatens more than 1
AND
American family if we fail to recognize the importance of our nation~’s ports."


We will Isolate Three Internal Links to Competitiveness:

First – Seaport Competitiveness – ports are the vital internal link to US economic growth – seaports represent a quarter of US GDP and contribute over 3 trillion to the economy in exports and trade
Nagle, 11<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> —- president and chief executive officer of the American Association of Port Authorities (December 2011, Kurt, Industry Today, "Association: American Association of Port Authorities; Port-Related Infrastructure Investments Can Reap Dividends," vol. 14, no. 3, [[http://www.industrytoday.com/article_view.asp?ArticleID=F370-http://www.industrytoday.com/article_view.asp?ArticleID=F370]])</span>

It seems the United States willingly allows infrastructure to crumble as other countries – particularly
AND
Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is utilized to maintain federal navigation channels.

Increasing exports decrease the trade deficit and makes growth sustainable – prevents investment bubbles and collapses
Istrate et al, 10<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> — senior research analyst and associate fellow with the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative (Emilia, "Export Nation: How U.S. Metros Lead National Export Growth and Boost Competitiveness", July, Brookings, [[http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/reports/2010/7/26%20mountain%20exports%20muro/0726_exports_istrate_rothwell_katz.pdf-http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2010/7/26 mountain exports muro/0726_exports_istrate_rothwell_katz.pdf]]</span>

Exports Could Contribute to the Rebalancing of the U.S. Economy and a
AND
imports can be part of the solution to many long-standing difficulties.

Expanding port infrastructure is vital to US global economic leadership

Kiefer et al, 2k <span style="font-size: 7pt;">– principal investigator for Planning and Management Consultants– study authorized by Section 401 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1999, report to the US Army Corps of Engineers (Jack, Planning and Management Consultants, "The National Dredging Needs Study of Ports and Harbors Implications to Cost-Sharing of Federal Deep Draft Navigation Projects Due to Changes in the Maritime Industry", May 2000, [[http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/docs/iwrreports/00-R-8.pdf-http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/docs/iwrreports/00-R-8.pdf]]) // CB</span>

2.2.2 Other Tangible Benefits Indirect benefits of Corps projects include gains
AND
trade are widespread and are not limited to a handful of coastal states. 

Second - Certainty - the federal government~’s uncertain commitment prevents new projects - Federal funding is increasing but not for new harbor deepening

**Szakonyi 12**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">— associate editor of the Journal of Commerce (Mark, "The Hill Ramping Up Dredging Efforts", Journal of Commerce, 5/7, ProQuest) EL</span>

The push by U.S. ports for more federal dredging dollars is finally
AND
short-term fixes over harder, more meaningful long-term decisions.

Federal regulations prevent other actors from solving – only federal action to streamline the process and increase funding solves

With increasingly larger ships calling the East Coast, it is now more crucial than

process for prioritizing, approving and funding critical infrastructure projects is fundamentally broken.

And these federal regulations mean any new projects will take decades unless the federal government expedites construction
Nagle, 2012<span style="font-size: 7pt;">- President and CEO of the American Association of Port Authorities (Kurt J., "Testimony of Kurt J.

First, the funding level of the Corps of Engineers~’ new construction budget has decreased
AND
port infrastructure so that we can meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.


Third - Perception - The federal commitment to port infrastructure is vital to retain foreign customers – this will collapse the recovery

Calhoun 11<span style="font-size: 7pt;">— President of Cargo Carriers (Cargill) and Chairman of Waterways Council, Inc (Rick, "DREDGING FOR PROSPERITY", Marine Log, August, ProQuest, [[http://proxy.lib.umich.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/docview/889143450?accountid=14667-http://proxy.lib.umich.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/docview/889143450?accountid=14667]]") EL</span>

Just like the nation itself, our maritime industry is facing a multitude of challenges
AND
not a cost, in the future of our inland waterways transportation system.


Our Impacts - Boosting economic Leadership is vital to preventing military retrenchment – loss of leadership risks great power wars

Khalilzad, ~’11<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – Bush~’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the UN and former director policy planning at the DOD (Zalmay, "The Economy and National Security", National Review, 2-8-11, [[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/259024/economy-and-national-security-zalmay-khalilzad-http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/259024/economy-and-national-security-zalmay-khalilzad]])</span>

Today, economic and fiscal trends pose the most severe long-term threat to
AND
leading the world toward a new, dangerous era of multi-polarity.

Strong US growth is key to promoting an American economic model – the alternative is mercantilism, which destroys economic cooperation and risks protectionism

Posen 9<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – Deputy director and senior fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics (Adam, "Economic leadership beyond the crisis," http://clients.squareeye.com/uploads/foresight/documents/PN%20USA_FINAL_LR_1.pdf)</span>

In the postwar period, US power and prestige, beyond the nation~’s military might
AND
rise to the challenge, it should concentrate on the following priority measures.

Protectionism will cause terrorism and global wars – risks extinction

Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire the United

between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.

Economic leadership prevents economic collapse—leadership key to resilience

Although the spread of nuclear weapons, with the corresponding increase in the likelihood that
AND
United States would in this way resemble a fleet of cars without gasoline.

That goes nuclear without leadership
