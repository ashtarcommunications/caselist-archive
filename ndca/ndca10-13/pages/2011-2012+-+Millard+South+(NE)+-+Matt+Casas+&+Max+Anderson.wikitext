===Whitey On the Moon=== 

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Walking under the crisp, bright lights of downtown Omaha was something I always cherished as a hip, young rebel who never really left the comfort of my suburban wonderland. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The smell of cheap alcohol eating through the air and my innocence was something that I knew I would treasure and watching a few folks wear the heart on their sleeves as they played blues and folk music for a few bucks was like a picture-perfect Kodak moment that I would never tell myself existed anywhere besides the wonderful world of this corrupted hipster nation of the Old Market, the Dundee area and Omaha itself. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The trendy retro nature of everything, of book stores and coffee shops was just another piece of the puzzle of this unknown that I was strolling through to capture a new perspective of my life and the world surrounding it. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">And who wouldn't want //this// perspective? – I was bored with my luxuries and fed up even more with the responsibilities that came along with them. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">This place was my escape, my Narnia, my Amurrica.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">If I had encountered something ugly I would just turn my head towards this hidden gem, and I would caress its beauty with my shining eyes and the lights would bounce off of my luscious red hair and every previous thought of boredom or frustration would exist no more, and I could explore the privilege of imagination without limitation.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">This place was my escape, Nirvana, without the dead Kurt Cobain – my glowing, mystical moon.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">But every moon has a dark side.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Walking under the crisp, bright lights of downtown Omaha was doubled by the aroma of cheap alcohol used as a means to escape one's depressing life – a weapon of intoxication that pushed the drinker closer to the edge with each drink. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The bleeding hearts that played music for those of us anxiously waiting to be impressed and thrilled wanted those couple of bucks for food for that night because they didn't have the means of getting by in any other manner.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">And outside of those closed book stores and coffee shops were people sleeping, and they should be grateful that the store owners would grant them even that much.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">This other side of the world that I was unknowingly passing through was invisible to me as an outsider because I was too busy taking in the bright, lit side of this moon to bring myself to look towards its unlit side that was always there but never really seemed important to me.</span>


<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">I was privilege. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">I was a man watching the news who cared more about the weather than the child who died the night before.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">I was George Bush flying over Katrina cheesing at the camera.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">but Whitey's on the moon...</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">After walking endlessly through the world of poverty, rat bites and a system that turned its back on him, 1960's bluesologist Gil Scott Heron became convinced that the system he was told he could always rely on was more willing to focus on “more important matters” rather than acknowledge those who live within the cracks of such systems.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">And the post cold war space race would only confirm such a profound thought as the system had embodied a privileged ideology that would enable itself to become distanced from lesser attractive things in life in order to focus on the interesting nature of the untouched mystery that existed beyond the Earth's mesosphere.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The resolution is itself a result of such privilege – a call for us to play the same politicians that sapped funds from the working class to build rocket ships, from FEMA to fund the war on terror.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">By surrendering our political and personal agency to a brand of politics that historically and necessarily ignores and pushes away those who are oppressed, we embody the identity of the Whitey that condones the presence of the violence that it creates or sustains in order to focus on sexier distractions. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Mumia Abu Jamal explains the harsh realities of being on the other side of this privilege...of being pushed to the bottom of political and social institutions...of being invisible...when he said:</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">Mumia Abu-Jamal 1998[“A QUIET AND DEADLY VIOLENCE,” 9/19/98, </span><span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt;">http://www.mumia.nl/TCCDMAJ/quietdv.htm]</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Therefore, this debate is about who best performatively and methodologically challenges structural violence.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The reasons for why society and politics is unable to effectively call into question systems of oppression is because we are never willing to escape the privileged nature of our politics that we have become so comfortable and satisfied with so that we never have to investigate how we contribute to and sustain such forms of oppression.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">We watch a sad movie about poverty and that becomes our one good deed for the day so poverty goes to the back of our minds</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">We go to war with terrorism but in doing so, we bomb civilians and take money from FEMA</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">We go to space to stay at the top of the world but in doing so we take money from the people who don't really matter to us.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Discontinuing these forms of oppression that remain unseen requires that we escape the privilege ideologies in our political and social interpretations of the world.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">We need to stop worrying so much about how we need to sustain the system and understand what happens when the system turns its back on those who become disposable when then the system comes face to face with something that matters more</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">We must investigate the unlit side of our debate community and the resolution because doing so allows us to better understand the ways our practices replicate privilege.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">We must open ourselves and our politics to the voices of those who are overlooked and invisible to us in order to reverse the very logic of privilege that justifies masking over and ignoring structural violence.</span>

===F* Cyborgs=== 
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the cyborg myth has failed. what began as a potentially liberating schema has fallen on deaf ears. the cyborg myth has not proven intrinsically liberating, infact popular appropriation of the cyborg mythology turns the project on its head. in place of genderless-boundriless entity, the cyborg has become a hyper-sexualized creature that reinforces rather than destroys identity limits. in the face of the loss of the human identity to hybrid technology, the powers that be reinforce other static notions of identity. this turns the case.</span>

**Cohen Shabot ’06**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (Sara, “Grotesque Bodies: A Response to Disembodied Cyborgs.” Journal of Gender Studies, Vol. 15, No. 3, November. P. 223-235)</span>



<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">furthermore, despite the integration of the technological into the human, the myth of the cyborg does not affirm our humanness. instead, the technological attempts to perfect the body, making the cyborg a being who desires a god-like status and rejects the corporeal body. we will offer the grotesque body as an alternative to this rejction.</span>

**Cohen Shabot ’06**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (Sara, “Grotesque Bodies: A Response to Disembodied Cyborgs.” Journal of Gender Studies, Vol. 15, No. 3, November. P. 223-235)</span>



<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">and, good intentions of the cyborg project are irrelevant. the flight from the body and reliance on strict binaries dooms the project to failure. the embodied grotesque offers a hybrid notion of the subject that achieves the ends of the cyborg project without the flight away from the body which is at the very core of our deconstruction of the subject.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the excesses inherent in the human body prevent the philosophical from integrating the grotesque into the schema of the same, guaranteeing that our project cannot be coopted. furthermore, the return to the body as the center of the deconstruct of the subject opens up the space necessary for a reimagination of our connection to technology. this means the grotesque will always be a prerequisite to their solvency.</span>

===<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Frontier</span>=== 


THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF OUTER SPACE AS AN ARENA FOR WESTERN EXPANSION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD IS THE VERY SOCIO-POLITICAL FRONTIERISM THAT WE FIND SEALED WITHIN CURRENT US SPACE POLICY AND ITS EFFORTS TO RECREATE ITSELF INTO A NEW WORLD ORDER. IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND SUCH A EUROCENTRIC DIALECTIC, WE BEGIN A DESTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF “THE FRONTIER” AND THE VIOLENT ONTOLOGY FROM WHICH IT DERIVES.

THE IMPERIAL PROCESS OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT, OF PERPETUATING THE VIOLENT WESTERN IDENTITY INTO THE STARRY ABYSS IS NOTHING MORE THAN CULTURAL, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL WARFARE MADE INVISIBLE THROUGH MYTHS OF PROGRESSION, CIVILIZATION AND MODERNIZATION. THIS MOVE TOWARDS A COMPLETE REIGN OF EXCEPTIONALISM GUARANTEES A FORM OF ERROR-REPLICATION THAT JUSTIFIES THE DEATH OF DIFFERENCE.

Thus our alternative is to reject the American frontier myth – Only then can a destabilization of the ideological violence that is Western ontology exist as we open national identity to a state of fluidity necessary for genuine freedom.

**This debate is all about methodology – There is no opportunity for a permutation because the 1AC has already done harm. Its advancement of the frontier myth has constructed a universal narrative of violence that has subjected bodies to nationalism, imperialism and epistemological violence. A debate about methods allows us to determine the most education and productive forum for politics because it not just what you have done but what you have justified. Questioning history is critical to challenge exclusion and imperialism – this evidence is specific to high school students and colonial nation state histories**

==Gnosticism== 

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the JUDEO-CHRISTIAN Religion- specifically the book of Genesis- has become the source for understanding humanity’s relation to nature in the Western world. Adam claimed dominion over nature through a process of naming based on the unimpeachable authority of God. Our project of post-sustainability is to find a counter book to this dominant discourse.</span>

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">**Stoekl 2007**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University. “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability.” P. 151-152)</span></span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">Now one could certainly argue that White’s...... still offer us some hope: St. Francis of Assisi.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Unfortunately, current humanist modes of environmental ethics fail to provide this counter-book. Rather, these ethics have rewritten the book in a way that maintains the trace of absolute divinity. Humanity In effect replaces God. This humanist construction of religion represents the worst of both worlds; the Environment is bent to the will of humanity, while the motives underlying this action remain unassailable. </span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">This desire to save the planet reduces all energy/resources to the role of work. This is the logic of the standing reserve. This austere cult of sustainability ignores the accursed share of energy that resists this utter classification. Only a mode of expenditure that puts us in touch with this cursed energy and thus loss can liberate us from the slavery of work. The unintended consequence of such expenditure is the salvation of the planet from ecological destruction.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Our mode of expenditure predicated on cursed objects/energy disinvests and reinvests the standing reserve- returning it from the world of work- tearing us from our projects and placing us into a community of those who expend on an intimate level. It is time to accept our madness.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Our attachment to cursed energy/matter reveals the nature of our counter-book- one not based on the unimpeachable authority of God, but one rather based in the moment when God realizes his own insufficiency and thus dies a humored atheist.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">In order to communicate this fall of God we come to the public square- a place racked with the same kind of authority present in the status quo's relationship to nature, the very authority we have come here to topple- and in our madness declare out loud "THE DEATH OF GOD."</span>
