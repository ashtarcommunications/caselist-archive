2. Just questioning UFOs is enough to solve the case – we don’t need to look for ET

Raymond Duvall, Professor of Political Sciences at the University of Minnesota. August 2008. Political Theory. “Sovereignty and the UFO.” [[http://ptx.sagepub.com/content/36/4/607.full.pdf+html]] JT)


<span class="DebateUnderline">One might expect </span>unexplained incidents ...<span class="DebateUnderline"> hard to find out what UFOs are.”17</span>


3. Internal Net benefit – humans looking for ET is bad: Either they are in microbial form and the aff has no impact or they are more advanced than us and will colonize us. UFO research avoids the impact

<span class="DebateUnderline">What are the </span>chances that we will encounter ...<span class="DebateUnderline"> to say.</span> Thank you for listening.
==K== 
===Whiteness=== 
Their argument elevates white supremacy to an all-pervasive force that explains nearly all global oppression – this conceptual expansion hides the actual practice of racism and makes breaking it down more difficult
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Andersen 3</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Margaret L. Andersen, Professor of Sociology and Women's Studies and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs at the University of Delaware, 2003, “Whitewashing Race: A Critical Perspective on Whiteness,” in White Out: The Continuing Significance of Racism, ed Doane & Bonilla-Silva, p. 30-32</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Conceptually, </span>one of the major problems...<span class="UnderlineChar">it ends up meaning hardly anything.</span>

Their belief that white supremacy inevitably stops reforms dooms the aff – their reliance on essentialized notions of white supremacy as the glue that holds the entire system of oppression together means their politics goes nowhere
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Andersen 3</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Margaret L. Andersen, Professor of Sociology and Women's Studies and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs at the University of Delaware, 2003, “Whitewashing Race: A Critical Perspective on Whiteness,” in White Out: The Continuing Significance of Racism, ed Doane & Bonilla-Silva, p. 30-32</span>

<span class="UnderlineChar">Even those who acknowledge the material basis...segregation and discrimination, this seems unlikely.</span>

Political systems historically constituted by white supremacy are not inevitably oppressive – setting the goal of the aff as ending white supremacy is politically ineffective – reforming whiteness to resolve the impacts of oppression is better
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sullivan 8</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Shannon Sullivan, Head of Philosophy and Professor of Philosophy, Women's Studies, and African and African American Studies at Pennsylvania State University, Spring 2008, “Whiteness as Wise Provincialism: Royce and the Rehabilitation of a Racial Category,” Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society: A Quarterly Journal in American Philosophy, Vol. 44, No. 2</span>

It is commonly acknowledged today, at least in academic circles, that racial essences....__**theory of racial justice that ignores this need will not be effective in practice.**__

===Capitalism=== 
**<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Science fiction is both the product of and the sustainment for hegemonic, capitalist power relations by normalizing dystopian futures and depicting economic tension as inevitable</span>**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dickens and Ormrod 7 </span>(Peter, Affiliated Lecturer in the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Cambridge and Visiting Professor of Sociology, University of Essex and **James, Lecturer in Sociology at the University of Brighton, Cosmic Society: Towards a sociology of the universe, pg 69-71)**

**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Some </span>commentators on science fiction<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have ... this requires engagement in praxis. </span>**

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Space exploration is merely an outlet for the state to expand its capitalist grip – infinite wars will be fought over new resources – also their advantages are made up and/or inevitable in capitalism</span>
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dickens 9</span>(Peter, Visiting Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex, “The Cosmos as Capitalism’s Outside,” The Sociological Review, 57: 66–82)**

**<span style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span class="UnderlineChar">The imminent conquest of outer space ... be</span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> of a </span><span class="UnderlineChar">temporary</span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">, sticking-plaster, variety. </span></span>**
**Their explotative project is a band-aid solution for Earthly problems that simply serves to buttress capitalist structures**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dickens 10</span> (Peter, Visiting Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex, “The Humanization of the Cosmos – To What End?”, Monthly Review Vol 62, No 6, November 2010)**

**<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Instead of indulging in over-optimistic and fantastic visions, ...</span><span class="UnderlineChar"> to make their own cosmic “fixes.”</span>**

**<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Science fiction as resistance fails—it’s appropriated by capital to project social issues far into the future, glossing over war and crises to fragment contemporary resistance.</span>**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dickens and Ormrod 7</span> (Peter, Affiliated Lecturer in the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Cambridge and Visiting Professor of Sociology, University of Essex and** James, Lecturer in Sociology at the University of Brighton, Cosmic Society: Towards a sociology of the universe, pg 96-97)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fear of Soviet domination of space was also reflected in ...</span> and economic institutions and processes involved.

**<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Capitalism relies on biopower, and creates domination over people with the ability to destroy entire populations.</span>**
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Internationalist Persepective 2k</span>(Internationalist Perspective; “Capitalism and Genocide,” Issue 36, Spring 2000; [[http://www.reocities.com/wageslavex/capandgen.html]])

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For Anders, the first industrial revolution introduced ... which revolutionaries ignore at their peril. </span>

Alt – vote negative to reject the flawed methodology of the affirmative.
The alternative is the only way out – we need to analyze the flaws in the system to find the preconditions for movements away from capitalism and its inevitable collapse – this is key to develop a real political strategy
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Carroll 10 </span>(William, founding director of the Social Justice Studies Program at the University of Victoria, Crisis, movements, counter-hegemony: in search of the new,” Interface 2:2, 168-198)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the most general terms and at the ...</span><span class="UnderlineChar"> subordination</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (De Leon, Desai and Tuğal 2009: 216; Joseph 2002).</span>

===Security=== 
Their hegemony impacts are based off a militarized conception of geopolitics. This distorts causes of war into simplistic security assumptions.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dalby 6</span> (Simon, Professor of Geography – Carleton University, Hegemony or Empire?, Ed. Grondin & Philippe, p. 40-1)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Complaining that the Clinton administration had ...</span>practices that emphasize conflict and militarized understandings of security.

Security discourse causes endless apocalypse in the name of survival
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Coviello 1</span> (Peter Coviello, Asst Prof of English – Bowdoin, Queer Frontiers, ed. Boone, author’s italics)

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Perhaps. But </span>to claim that American culture is...seems a civic initiative that can scarcely be done without.

The alternative is to reject the aff's security logic - opens up the space necessary for emancipation from endless securitization
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Neocleous 8</span> (Mark, Professor of the Critique of Political Economy; Head of Department of Politics & History Brunel Univ, Critique of Security, 185-6)

The only way out of such a dilemma...;it requires us to be brave enough to return the gift."'

===Agonism=== 
A. The Aff’s embrace of identity politics is naïve – true equity requires Agonistic pluralism
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Deylami 4</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Shirin S. Deylami, Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota, “(Un)Closeting Democracy: the Limits and Possibilities of Legalism in the Pursuit of Queer Politics”, AllAcademic)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Political Recognition and Agonistic Politics While ... legal protections of sexuality are unfair “special” protections. 13 </span>

B. The fiction of harmony and universal inclusion within political spaces has lead to mass genocides, war, and absolute exclusion – acknowledging ideological distinctions through agonism is the only way to avoid inevitable destruction
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rasch 5</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (William, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana University Lines in the Sand: Enmity as a Structuring Principle South Atlantic Quarterly 104 (2) http://saq.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/104/2/253.pdf)</span>

<span class="UnderlineChar">Schmitt, then, starts from the premise of ...</span> asphyxiating political nightmares of absolute exclusion<span class="BoldUnderlineChar">.</span>

C. Reject the aff to create a political space for discussion – it’s an environment where we can practice agonistic pluralism and an acknowledgement of inevitable conflict as part of the political process
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mouffe 2K</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Chantal Mouffe, Visiting Professor at the Department of Political Science of the Institute for Advanced Studies, June 2000, “Deliberative Democracy or Agonistic Pluralism”, http://users.unimi.it/dikeius/pw_72.pdf)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Besides putting the emphasis on practices ...</span><span class="UnderlineChar"> should be seen as temporary respites in an ongoing confrontation.</span>

===<span class="UnderlineChar">Over-identification</span>=== 
A. The Aff’s embrace of science and the search rejects the normal stigma of aliens – kills overidentification
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Harrison 5</span> (Albert Harrison, Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis “Overcoming the Image of Little Green Men: Astrosociology and SETI” 2005 http://www.astrosociology.com/Library/PDF/submissions/Overcoming%20LGM_Harrison.pdf)
Recognizing that contemporary human ...<span class="DebateUnderline"> growing enthusiasm for the search itself</span>.
B. Social violence and war are inevitable without Overidentification
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek 97 </span>(Slavoj <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek</span>, researcher at the institute of sociology at the university of Ljubljana, <span class="underline">The Plague of Fantasies</span>, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">1997</span>. pg. 28-29)
Or- to put it another way- t<span class="DebateUnderline">he </span>paradoxical ...<span class="DebateUnderline"> this act are so </span>catastrophic<span class="underline">.</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">
</span>
C. Thus the alternative - To truly traverse the fantasy, we should not attempt to remove ourselves from it and come to grips with some material “reality” – rather, we must overidentify with the joke of the Aliens, to be more profoundly in its grips than ever
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek 2 </span>(Slavoj <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek</span>, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies in Ljubljana, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">2002</span>, Welcome to the Desert of the Real!, p. 17-19)
<span class="DebateUnderline">The fact that the September 11 attacks were ... </span>they do not represent people as they ‘really are’.

===Its=== 
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A. Its implies ownership</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Glossary of English Grammar Terms ‘5 </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">(http://www.usingenglish.com/glossary/possessive-pronoun.html)</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Mine, yours, his, hers, </span>__<span style="background-color: yellow;">its..</span>__</span>shows that it belongs to me.)

===<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">ASPEC</span>=== 
This guts education about the topic
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Livingston '1</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – adjunct professor at the University of North Dakota Graduate School of Space Studies; Doctorate in Business Administration (DBA) also at Golden Gate University (Dr.David, 2001, "Barriers to Space Enterprise," http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/barriers_to_space_enterprise.shtml, RG)</span>

__Relationships within government organizations...____other agencies for they only cooperate superficially.__

===Framework=== 
The affirmative must __defend a world__ where the United States federal government increases exploration and/or development in space beyond the earth’s mesophere. The __purpose of the ballot__ is to decide whether the enactment of a topical plan is better than the status quo or a competitive policy option.

This is most predictable –
A) “Resolved” before a colon reflects a legislative forum
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Army Officer School 4</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (5-12, “# 12, Punctuation – The Colon and Semicolon”, [[http://usawocc.army.mil/IMI/wg12.htm]])</span>

The colon introduces <span class="UnderlineChar">the following<span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;">...</span></span>"<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Resolved: (colon) That this council petition the mayor.</span>

B) “United States Federal Government should” means the debate is __solely about__ the outcome of a policy established by governmental means
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ericson 3</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts – California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater’s Guide, Third Edition, p. 4)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Proposition of Policy: Urging...perform the future action that you propose. </span>

C) Grammar is the biggest impact --- allowing other frameworks justifies arbitrarily changing the question of the debate to an infinite number of alternatives, destroying predictable limits and ensuring the Neg always wins. Grammar is the only predictable basis for determining meaning; it’s the foundation for how words interact. Ignoring it justifies changing the focus of the debate, mooting the resolution altogether.

2) Limits:

A) Our framework narrows the topics of debate to a finite set of political potentialities. Expanding beyond this makes an __infinite number__ of philosophical beliefs germane.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lutz 2K</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Donald, Professor of Political Science – U Houston, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p. 39-40)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Aristotle notes in the Politics that political theory...not in the moral vision of the non-theorist. </span>

B) This is a prior question – it’s a prerequisite to any debate
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shively 2K</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Ruth Lessl, Assistant Prof Political Science – Texas A&M U., Partisan Politics and Political Theory, p. 182)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The requirements given thus...contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.</span>

3) __Ground__: their framework inevitably caters to the Aff ---

A) Tautologies – resolutionally-divided ground is chosen by the community because it is __balanced__ and __educational__. Anything less than plan-focus allows the Aff to claim “racism bad” and put the Neg in the indefensible position of being forced to impact-turn.

B) Impact – ground is key to fairness. Their framework is skewed against the Neg from the beginning. This also turns case because debate becomes meaningless and produces bad political strategies
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shively 2K</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Ruth Lessl, Assistant Prof Political Science – Texas A&M U., Partisan Politics and Political Theory, p. 182)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The point may seem trite, as...</span>agreements are <span class="UnderlineChar">simply </span>implicit in <span class="UnderlineChar">the act of </span>argumentation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>

4) __Impact__:

Fairness is the most important consideration ---

A) __Debate is a game__ that, divorced from fairness, is meaningless. Competition without fair norms is simply a bad game – it’s the reason that the NBA is more interesting than the Harlem Globetrotters.

B) It’s a __prerequisite to education__ --- education is a __process__, not a __product__ – in-depth debate is key to education, not argumentative freedo
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lahman 36</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Carroll Pollack, Director of Men’s Forensics – Western State Teacher’s College, Debate Coaching: A Handbook for Teachers and Coaches, p.19)</span>

Not knowledge but thought...Those are truly educational values<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

===Beyond=== 
A. Interpretation- The Mesosphere is 50-85 km above the Earth's surface
<span class="CiteChar">NSIDC No Date </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(National Snow and Ice Data Center, US research center, "Mesosphere",No date provided, http://nsidc.org/arcticmet/glossary/mesosphere.html|azt)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Mesosphere </span>The region of the atmosphere between about 50 km and 80-85 km<span class="UnderlineChar">, extending from the top of the stratosphere to the upper temperature minimum.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is characterized by a broad temperature maximum (near 0 °C) at its base, from which the temperature decreases to a minimum (about -90 °C) at themesopause level.</span>
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">
</span>
And "beyond" means past
<span class="CiteChar">AHD 11</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(American Heritage Dictionary, “beyond”, http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/beyond)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">PREPOSITION: </span>On the far side of; past<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: Just beyond the fence. Later than; after: beyond midnight. To a degree that is past the understanding, reach, or scope of: an evil beyond remedy. To a degree or amount greater than: rich beyond his wildest dreams. In addition to: asked for nothing beyond peace and quiet.</span>

===Substantial=== 
**A. Substantial increase is 2.6 billion**
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Amir </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Alexander</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Professor of History UCLA, 10-16-20</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">08</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Projects: Space Advocacy – President Signs NASA Authorization Bill</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">On Wednesday, October 15, 2008, President Bush signed into law the NASA Authorization Bill passed by Congress last month. By authorizing NASA to spend $20.21 billion in fiscal year 2009, </span><span class="DebateUnderline">__<span style="font-size: 11pt;">the bill represents a substantial increase of $2.6 billion over the administration's budget request for NASA earlier this year.</span>__</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">$4.9 billion of the bill's total is directed towards science operations, and another $4.9 billion is authorized for exploration. An authorization bill, unlike an appropriations bill, does not actually fund programs, and the spending levels it cites are not binding on NASA. Nevertheless it does provide the agency with spending guidelines and indicates Congress's priorities.</span>
