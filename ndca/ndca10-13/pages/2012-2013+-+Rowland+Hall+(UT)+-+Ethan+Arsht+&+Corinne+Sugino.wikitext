Contention one is transportation


**The whole year we’ve been debating whether the United States Federal Government should increase its investment in transportation infrastructure in the United States, and in all that time the community has spent zero time researching or discussing the people who use that infrastructure and why**


**The homeless body is the body curled up asleep in the last row of the bus, the body you see every day on your way to school, and the body we~’ve neglected to mention THIS ENTIRE DEBATE SEASON**
**Kawash 98**<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> (Samira Kawash, teaches in the Department of English at Rutgers University.</span>

It’s late, and I`m hurrying home, thinking about feeding the cats
AND
car, this body exerts so powerful an effect on the other riders.


**The homeless body is the topic – the debate isn’t about how many buses there are, they already show up every 10 minutes – it’s about the only group of people for whom those buses are a 24-hour reality – by the way, there is no usfg policy in regards to homelessness and transportation**
**Nichols 11** (Laura, Professor of Sociology, Santa Clara University and former employee of the Housing Services Division in Santa Clara. "Homelessness and the Mobile Shelter System: Public Transportation as Shelter," Journal of Social Policy 40 (Apr 2011): 333-350)

Every night people in Santa Clara County, USA board 24-hour public transportation
AND
Nine unhoused riders said they had no options other than the bus.


**This securitization and sanitation of the so-called ~’homeless problem~’ is part of a broader narrative of societal renewal that systematically excludes homeless bodies**

The dislocations and disruptions caused by programs of urban renewal launched in the 1980s in
AND

Homelessness and Placelessness Since the magnitude of the problem of homelessness came into widespread pub
AND
and often dangers of such places, many choose to avoid them altogether.

At the same time, both national and international security policies centre on securing the

civic, urban, domestic and personal: security is coming home.85


===__**1ac – 2**__=== 


**Contention two is ethics**


**The role of the ballot is to vote for the team with the best ethical orientation to the resolution as a site of dwelling.**


**Our ethics is homelessness in the topic – we cannot complacently affirm and re-affirm transportation without interrogating the ways we are all complicit in an unethical society**
(we don’t endorse gendered language)
Theodor Adorno 1951 – renowned German philosopher and Holocaust survivor ("Minima Moralia: Reflections on a Damaged Life," Verso)

Refuge for the Homeless - The predicament of private life today is shown by its
AND
conscience to keep what they have. Wrong life cannot be lived rightly.


**This debate isn’t about being engaged citizens – that’s an inherently privileged perspective – we think it’s about how citizenship has been defined to exclude the homeless and why**
Martin James Whiteford 10, phd in philosophy from Bournemouth University, "Homelessness and Citizenship: Exploring the Meaning and Negotiation of Place, Space and Geography for Rough Sleepers", April, [[http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/15866/1/WHITEFORD-Martin_J-_PhD_April_2010_FINAL.pdf-http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/15866/1/WHITEFORD-Martin_J-_PhD_April_2010_FINAL.pdf]]

A paradigm of the homeless has been formulated through the confluence of media, academic
AND
active participation in the pursuit of political strategies that challenge relations of domination.


**The desire to be at home in the resolution is fundamentally violent – every debate becomes an attempt to reconstruct an idealized and bounded mode of education that does not exist**
Feldman, ’6 (Leonard C, Assistant Prof of Polisci @ the U of Oregon, Citizens Without Shelter: Homelessness, Democracy, and Political Exclusion, p. 145-148)

An ethic of dwelling does not involve stripping away superficial differences to find the essential
AND
a politics no longer premised on the isolation and exclusion of bare life.

===**Contention One: A Failure of Imagination**=== 

**A psychological reflection on these absurdities reveals that war is intimately engrained in modern transportation infrastructure.**
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">**Hillman 79** <James. A Founding Fellow of the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture, Senior Fellow at the Institute of Philosophic Studies. “Psychological Fantasies in Transportation Problems” Published 1979.></span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“</span>How about that word 'efficiently?' … more radically, or must a breakdown first occur?

**It is no surprise that the archetype of war is present even in the within the civilian realm of transportation. War is normal, inevitable, and an integral part of our being but we’ve ignored this part of the psyche by separating war from civilian life and by sanitizing it’s true nature. This suppression of war causes us to erupt violently in our never-ending quest against delusional enemies.**

Our immigrant dream of escape<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from …</span>paranoid defenses against delusional enemies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

**This failure of imagination, the refusal to see war in our everyday, the separation of war from the spiritual, results in dangerous literalism – the impact is making violence and apocalypse more likely.**

We do not know much nowadays … separate themselves from his dominion<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.</span>



===**Contention Two: This is the Place**=== 

**Current transportation infrastructure pathologizes slowness – our “drive” for speed causes us to lose sense of place in a never ending race for more speed and efficiency**
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">**Hillman 79** <James. A Founding Fellow of the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture, Senior Fellow at the Institute of Philosophic Studies. “Psychological Fantasies in Transportation Problems” Published 1979.></span>

Our view of transportation in …. burgeoning of optimistic desire.

**Two impacts-**
**1. Efficiency – when we become too preoccupied with efficiency and it becomes a cause in of it self we lose touch with life and anything become justifiable as long as it is efficient**
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">**Hillman 95** </span>(James, retired Director of the Jung Institute, “Kinds of Power”, Doubleday, pgs 33-44)

The extermination camp in …, “that for the sake of which" your efficient actions are performed?

**2. Speed – when we lose our sense of place it creates a politics of speed, which decreases time for deliberation making nuclear war more likely**

===**Contention Four: The Role of the Ballot**=== 

**A) The psyche exists and comes first**
**The psyche shapes our understanding of the world – everything depends on it. The resolution should only be evaluated on its psychological qualities.**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Jung 58</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> (Carl G., renowned scholar of psychoanalysis and founder of the Jung Institute, __The Undiscovered Self__, New American Library, New York, 81-83)</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">For more than fifty years we … every day and can happen to everyone.</span>
**This is especially true in the context of transportation infrastructure – the psyche is a prerequisite to effective policymaking.**
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">**Hillman 79** <James. A Founding Fellow of the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture, Senior Fellow at the Institute of Philosophic Studies. “Psychological Fantasies in Transportation Problems” Published 1979.></span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The invitation extended so courageously…</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. I mean that’s where it’s most acute."</span>

**Refusing to operate on the terrain of the psyche ensures a loss of soul. This state of dehumanization destroys any meaning to life and risks death.**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Hillman 1990</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri;"> (James, has written dozens of critically acclaimed books, received his PhD from the </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: Calibri; text-decoration: none;">[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Zurich|University of Zurich]]</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">, and is a retired Director of the Jung Institute, “A Blue Fire”, //a blue fire//, Routledge; 1 edition p. 17-18)-mikee</span>

**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14pt;">B) Our interpretation:</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14pt;">The judge should endorse the best psychological approach to the resolution.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14pt;">This necessarily requires affirmation. It requires saying ‘yes’ to public transportation, ‘yes’ to infrastructure, and ‘yes’ to the archetype of the topic. It entails loving what the soul presents.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14pt;">Therefore, we psychologically and emphatically affirm the text:</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14pt;">The United States federal government should substantially increase its public transportation infrastructure investment.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 14pt;">All we have in this debate space is our imagination and our relationships. The ballot is the most tangible form of relating and it signifies an endorsement of the best types of relationships. If we win our approach is psychologically beneficial, you should vote aff.</span>**

**C) Solvency**
**Public transportation disrupts our damaging relationship with space – working on an individual level is key**
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">**Hillman 79** <James. A Founding Fellow of the Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture, Senior Fellow at the Institute of Philosophic Studies. “Psychological Fantasies in Transportation Problems” Published 1979.></span>

In conclusion now, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">…c</span>an never truly be in our own hands<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.</span>


**The current relationship to the city fails because it relies on the values of efficiency and speed – the plan solves because it reforms our understanding of cities to place rather than space**

//We must re-imagine the city and ….//we might then be less eager to get away.



**D) Our Method**
**The negative will attempt to map out the topic and psychologically silence the soul within it by trying to empiricize and literalize it, looking at implementation, and attempting to get the upper hand. The entire ethos of traditional debate is one that tries to fix, control, and cure problems instead of being open to the world as it presents itself. This is the plan of archetypal psychology: to explore our deep psychological commitments and affirm our most terrorizing images of the world**

==<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Homelessness Affirmative</span>== 


===Observation One: This is a public space=== 



**We begin with the descriptions by Samira Kawash, from her article "The Homeless Body"**
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Samira **Kawash**, teaches in the Department of English at Rutgers University. She is the author of Dislocating the Color Line. Her current research explores place and body in relation to the theoretical and cultural significance of homelessness "The Homeless Body," Public Culture 10(2): 319-339.)-mikee</span>

It’s late, and I`m hurrying home, thinking about feeding the cats
AND
car, this body exerts so powerful an effect on the other riders.


**That question posed by the homeless body is the same question inherent in this year’s topic. Traditional infrastructure investment operates within the project of urban renewal that attempts to purify and improve our society’s operations, movement, and space. The problem is that these policies attack the economically and socially marginalized through gentrification and privatization of that space. Status quo infrastructure improvements seek to eliminate the homeless because they are seen as a problem TO the economy instead of product OF it.**

Kawash, ~’98 <span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Samira, teaches in the Department of English at Rutgers University. She is the author of Dislocating the Color Line. Her current research explores place and body in relation to the theoretical and cultural significance of homelessness "The Homeless Body," Public Culture 10(2): 319-339.)-mikee</span>

The dislocations and disruptions caused by programs of urban renewal launched in the 1980s in
AND
phantomal public is what I will call in this essay the homeless body.


**The exclusion of the homeless body and the securitization of public space make violence inevitable. Policies become tools to exclude, humiliate, and eliminate homeless people.**
Kawash, ~’98 <span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Samira, teaches in the Department of English at Rutgers University.</span>
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">She is the author of Dislocating the Color Line. Her current research explores place and body in relation to the theoretical and cultural significance of homelessness "The Homeless Body," Public Culture 10(2): 319-339.)-mikee</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Homelessness and Placelessness Since the magnitude of the problem of homelessness came into widespread </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">many choose to avoid them altogether. </span>



**This fuels a type of management and exclusion that creates an endless apocalypse for countless populations not included within society.**
Coviello 2000 (Peter, Prof. of English at Bowdoin College, Apocalypse From Now On, pg. 11)

Perhaps. But to claim that American culture is at present decisively postnuclear is not
AND
or otherwise, seems a civic initiative that can scarcely be done without.





===Observation Two: Not being at home in one~’s home…=== 

**Modern politics is obsessed with the "homecoming," of finally reaching the utopian future where growth, security, and freedom all exist in perfect harmony. More speed, more progress, more expansion – Infrastructure is our home. But as the state tries to build a better home, they displace those who won~’t live there.**


**These dreams of a perfect and comfortable home stigmatize the homeless and destroy alternative dwelling options – this creates barelife and prevents the possibility of ethical living.**
Feldman, ~’6 (Leonard C, Assistant Prof of Polisci @ the U of Oregon, Citizens Without Shelter: Homelessness, Democracy, and Political Exclusion, p. 22-24)-mikee

At this point, however, a critic might argue that "pluralism" is
AND
have been found. These limits, though, are more like frontiers.



**Meaning, ethical living, and genuine hospitality are impossible within the status quo~’s conception of a home.**
**Theodor** Adorno **1951** **– renowned German philosopher and Holocaust survivor ("Minima Moralia: Reflections on a Damaged Life," Verso)**

Refuge for the Homeless - The predicament of private life today is shown by its
AND
conscience to keep what they have. Wrong life cannot be lived rightly.



We must give up on the home – The comforts there are simply neurotic and cause totalitarian living. Only a gesture that embraces homelessness within one~’s home can preserve the possibility of morality.
Tyson **Lewis** and Daniel **Cho** 2006 ("HOME IS WHERE THE NEUROSIS IS: A TOPOGRAPHY OF THE SPATIAL UNCONSCIOUS," University of Minnesota Press, Project Muse)

In sum, the traditional house is haunted by ghosts; the modern house is
AND
subjectivity beyond the confines of the traditional home and its attending immanent paradox.





===Contention Three – Our Response=== 

**We affirm the topic as a site of multiple forms of dwelling and as an opportunity to come to terms with homelessness. Thus, Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States.**


**Our method and advocacy is based in nomadism and is the only approach that solves – other strategies reach a "home" or a redemptive endpoint, while ours continually acts to prevent injustice**
**Ilan** Gur-Ze~’ev **2005** **– professor at the University of Haifa ADORNO AND HORKHEIMER: DIASPORIC PHILOSOPHY, NEGATIVE THEOLOGY, AND COUNTER-EDUCATION)**

This is where the Diasporic dimension is so central to the mature thinking of Adorno
AND
creativity within the framework of a present-day Diasporic counter-education.



And, our act of dwelling affirms the public transportation infrastructure as an alternative site of home dwelling. The affirmation of the bus as home is a form of pluralization that disrupts the political order of the status quo. Voting affirmatives establish an ethic of responsiveness that respects the homeless.
**Feldman, ’6** **(Leonard C, Assistant Prof of Polisci @ the U of Oregon, Citizens Without Shelter: Homelessness, Democracy, and Political Exclusion, p. 145-148)-mikee**

An ethic of dwelling does not involve stripping away superficial differences to find the essential
AND
a politics no longer premised on the isolation and exclusion of bare life.


Solvency – expose the violence.

**The counterplan competes – tests ‘its’ in the resolution – refers to possession and the necessity of U.S. investment**

**Also severs certainty – the world of the counterplan reserves the possibility of the U.S. saying no – aff certainty is key to avoid aff conditionality which means they can no link out of any DA – crushes ground**

The counterplan solves 100% of the case – it’s popular in both the U.S. and China

Many Americans might be surprised to hear …. hope that outcome can be avoided.”


The counterplan solves unemployment – and it independently prevents China from selling U.S. debt-based treasuries

===Capitalism Kritik=== 
**<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Infrastructure investment is a tool of the capitalist state—people, values and goods all become commodities to be transported</span>**

__Capitalism has not changed its spots….__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, however, is to change it.’ If Marxism is correct, then we must act on it.</span>

**<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Alternative text: Reject the affirmative as a means of refusing complicity with capitalism. </span>**

**<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Rejecting capitalism is key to opening up new alternatives. Only complete refusal, not piecemeal reform, can prevent otherwise inevitable slavery and extinction. </span>**

===__<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Hillman Kritik</span>__=== 
**A) Framework: The psyche exists and comes first – it shapes our understanding of the world – everything depends on it**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Jung 57 </span>**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Carl G., renowned scholar of psychoanalysis and founder of the Jung Institute, __The Undiscovered Self__, New American Library, New York, 81-83)</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">For more than fifty years we have known</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt;">, …observed every day and can happen to everyone.</span>

**B) Links: Aversion to warfare and diplomatically pacifying the conditions for war don’t engage our desire to fight - instead of hating war we should embrace it – only then can we repair the psyche**
**<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Hillman 04</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt;"> (James, retired Director of the Jung Institute, “A Terrible Love of War”, The Penguin Press, ISBN 1-59420-011-4, pgs 90-92)</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt;">Why dwell on this archaic god of war when …maneuvers of the mind would be enough.</span>

**C) Impact: Rotten psyche = rotten policy and makes humans hollow beings that can’t relate to the world around us.**
Walter A**<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> Davis in 2001</span>** (//Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative.// State Univesrity of New York Press, p. 95-96)
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">It is never enough</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> however. Inner discord …motive finds its first ghostly articulation in Kant’s struggle with the sublime. </span>

**D) The alternative is to love war.**
**Instead of going to war in the name of peace, we should enter war for war’s own sake.**
**Also, the alternative comes first and is a prerequisite to aff solvency because war is the primary psychological task that shapes all of our notions about society.**
