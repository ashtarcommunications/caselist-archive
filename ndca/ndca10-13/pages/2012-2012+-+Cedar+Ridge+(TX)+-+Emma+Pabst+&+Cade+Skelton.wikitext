==The K aff== 

======CONTENTION ONE: LIVING IN THE END TIMES====== 

The modern road structure is the largest human object in the world. The automobile sits atop a material regime of violence against the animal other in the form of roadkill, habitat destruction and global warming.

We are living in climatological times. Global warming overwhelms us in terms of scale and duration—leaving our calculation of timeframes in ruins. Yet we are always-already terrorized by the ghosts of future generations, because we cannot conceive of a world without the human.

Markley 2012

Unfortunately, the price for the eternal life of the human is paid in animal blood. The modern highway infrastructure is nothing more than a tombstone for the animal dead.

<span class="UnderlineBold">**Yet, paradoxically, the continued use of fossil fuels also brings about humanity’s own self-immolation. Climate change is the final reminder that the world does not need us and ever needed us—existing long before the first humans walked the earth.** </span>

The entire history of humanity is indebted to an anthropocentrism that enacts endless violence against the nonhuman other. Anthropocentrism is the structuring foundation for all forms of oppression.

Thus the plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its highway transportation infrastructure investment in the United States.

======<span class="UnderlineBold">**CONTENTION TWO: WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE**</span>====== 

Our affirmative, much like the fossil itself, resides at the temporal intersection between life and death. We must simultaneously acknowledge that modernity is fueled by animal bodies as well as willfully embrace the continued use of fossil fuels to bring about the human extinction.

Rather than a synthesis of these two seemingly contradictory positions, we hold both terms at a standstill, refusing a legibility to the living and holding open the possibility of the dead.

This round is NOT about a __responsibility towards the future__, but an __accountability for the past__. Voting aff is a thought experiment—we must embrace global suicide of humanity as the only ethical act in the face of the immeasurable violence committed against the nonhuman.

<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">(book excerpt)</span>

This year’s topic is centered on US transportation infrastructure and future policy. The construction of this year’s resolution mirrors academia’s attempts to discuss America’s transportation policy outside its context. In reality America’s first transportation policy was the middle passage and it is the ugly under belly of our transportation history. Our goal is to inject this discussion into the narrative of transportation.

Some would like to look at slavery as a thing of the past but the middle passage and chattel slavery all prove how White Supremacy was and still is crucial to the formation of policies of the past and is still the violent, genocidal logic that orders the world as we know it today. A socialhistorical analysis is critical to break away from the liberal multicultural narrative of state-based reforms that allow for the continuation of violence against the black body.

THUS EMMA AND I ADVOCATE THE TOPIC AS A SITE TO AVOW THE MIDDLE PASSAGE AS AMERICA’S FIRST TRANSPORTATION POLICY.

The Middle Passage represents a rupture in the narrative of progress, agency, and democracy that characterizes discussions of black transportation. Unflinching structural analysis of the ontological position of Blackness allows for the possibility of ethics and freedom through the rejection of democracy, the state, and civil society. The affirmative’s genealogical analysis represents a radical critique that resists the tendency to naturalize anti-black violence, this is the starting point for imagining a new world.
Kokontis 2011<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Kate, PhD in Performance Studies from UC-Berkeley, “Performative Returns and the Rememory of History: genealogy and performativity in the American racial state,” Dissertation available on Proquest)</span>

Anti-Blackness structurally underpins all forms of violence—while racialized violence is still a daily reality for people caught in the position of the slave, the rhetoric of “oppression” or “exploitation” alone asks only how we might redeem this failed American experiment. There is no analogy for the structural suffering of the slave, meaning the starting point for any authentic engagement with social violence must begin with the Middle Passage and the creation of the anti-human void known as Blackness.

Injection of the black subject allows for radical conditions of possibility because it creates a grammar of suffering so intense it opens up space to fight against white supremacy and make the black subject visible in spaces like our transportation policy

The United States Federal Government should increase its transportation infrastructure investment for climate adaptation including changes in design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure.
