===Heg=== 

Russia is building up its fleet of icebreakers – now is key to invest and maintain US presence and Arctic Leadership
Revkin 8 (Andrew C., New York Times, “A Push to Increase Icebreakers in the Arctic, August 2008, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/world/europe/17arctic.html)
A growing array of military leaders, Arctic experts and lawmakers say the United States AND of small submarines to the seabed at the North Pole a year ago.

Arctic will be the geopolitical focus point of the 21st century – sustainable US presence is key to leadership
Cohen et al. 2008 [Ariel, Ph.D., is Senior Research AND in the Arctic”, October 30th, 2008, pg 1-3]
The Arctic is quickly reemerging as a strategic area where vital U.S. AND toward the Arctic has been irresolute and inadequate. This needs to change.

Federal investment in icebreakers is critical to sustainable presence
National Research Council 7 (NRC, Committee on the Assessment of U.S. Coast Guard Polar Icebreaker Roles and Future Needs, National Research Council. “Polar Icebreakers in a Changing World: An Assessment of U.S. Needs. Washington, 2007, http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11753&page=2)
In the Arctic, economic activity is expected to increase as the southern extent of AND might partner to invest in a Polar class icebreaker with the United States.

Heg is good – it solves all impacts
Zhang, researcher at Carnegie, and Shi, consultant for the World Bank, 11 ¬– both MA candidates at Columbia University [January 22, 2011, Yuhan Zhang and Lin Shi, “America’s decline: A harbinger of conflict and rivalry,” http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/01/22/americas-decline-a-harbinger-of-conflict-and-rivalry/]
Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously AND forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.

And, US pursuit of hegemony is inevitable – only a question of effectiveness
Calleo, Director – European Studies Program and Professor @ SAIS, ‘10
(David P, “American Decline Revisited,” Survival, 52:4, 215 – 227)
The history of the past two decades suggests that adjusting to a plural world is AND turns the dollar into an imperial instrument that threatens the world with inflation.

The transition independently causes extinction
Brzezinski 12 (Zbigniew, Prof of US Foreign Policy at School of Advanced International Studies – Johns Hopkins University, Counselor – CSIS and Trustee and Co-Chair – CSIS Advisory Board, Former National Security Advisor – Carter, “After America”, Foreign Policy, January / February, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/artic les/2012/01/03/after_america?page=full)
For if America falters, the world is unlikely to be dominated by a single AND policy -- or start bracing itself for a dangerous slide into global turmoil.

===Artic War=== 

Competition is imminent now – US led diplomatic solutions prevents inevitable Arctic War –plan is key
Borgerson 8 [Scott G. Borgerson is International Aªairs Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Coast Guard; Foreign Affairs; March /April 2008; http://library.arcticportal.org/1570/1/BorgersonForeignAffairsarticle.pdf; Boyce]
The Arctic Ocean is melting, and it is melting fast. This past summer AND the region could erupt in an armed mad dash for its resources.

Absent these solutions, current militarization will ensures Arctic conflicts go nuclear

Lost in the dominant discussion AND federal funds should be a genuine consequence.

**And, failure to build-in a termination condition ensures cost-overruns – the plan’s advantages are gross over-estimations**

Right now, federal transportation AND our cities, and our families.

**And, failure to restore U.S. competitiveness crushes U.S. primacy—the impact is global war**

**And, 10 percent ought to be the cost-threshold – federal asset programs are the perfect model for the cp**
GAO ‘97 (Government Accountability Office, “Transportation Infrastructure Managing the Costs of Large-Dollar Highway Projects,” pg online @ http://www.gao.gov/assets/160/155775.pdf)
While FHWA’s formal review AND management of large-dollar highway projects.

**And, ONLY an on-going cost-benefit analysis can solve – ONLY instituting controls BEFORE the plan is not enough – projections will be wrong, resulting in overruns – there needs to be a measure of the plan AS it’s being carried out**

This does not show the AND also necessary, as we will see below.

And, failure to institute cost controls BEFORE the project begins means the stimulus advantage is a disad to the aff – negative repercussions for going over cost MUST be a part of the plan

(i) Transparency and public control AND planning, implementation, and operations.

===Privatize FAA CP=== 

====1NC====

**Text – The United States Federal Government should organizationally reform air traffic control, making it self-supporting and managed by commercial operators.**

**Privatization solves safety, congestion, and efficiency better --- federal bureaucracy dooms the plan**

Jr., Director of Transportation Policy and Searle Freedom Trust Transportation Fellow – Reason Foundation, and Chris Edwards, Director of Tax Policy Studies – Cato Institute, “Airports and Air Traffic Control”, June, http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/transportation/airports-atc)
Commercializing Air Traffic Control AND that have been implemented abroad.

===Icebreakers CP=== 

====1NC====

**Text – The President of the United States should issue a Presidential Decision Directive mandating that the United States Coast Guard should invest polar icebreakers to maintain and support United States waters.**

**Solves power projection**
