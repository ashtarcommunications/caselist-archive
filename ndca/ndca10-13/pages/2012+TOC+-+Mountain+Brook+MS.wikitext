Focus on __strategic deterrence__ and __…__ root causes that debilitate action
John <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Moore 4</span> chaired law prof, UVA. Frm first Chairman of the Board of the US Institute of Peace and as the Counselor on Int Law to the Dept. of State, Beyond the Democratic Peace, 44 Va. J. Int'l L. 341, Lexis

<span class="Underline">If major interstate war is predominantly a product of a synergy between a potential nondemocratic aggressor and an absence of effective deterrence, what is the role of the many traditional "causes" of war? Past, and many contemporary, theories of war have focused on the role of specific disputes between nations, ethnic and religious differences, arms races, poverty and social injustice, competition for resources, incidents and accidents, greed, fear, perceptions of "honor," and many other factors. Such factors may well play a role in motivating aggression or generating fear and manipulating public opinion. </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The reality</span>//<span class="Underline">, however, is that </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">while some of these factors may</span>//<span class="Underline"> have more potential to </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">contribute to war</span>//<span class="Underline"> than others, there may well be an </span>infinite set<span class="Underline"> of motivating factors, or human wants, motivating aggression. It is not the independent existence of such motivating factors for war but rather </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">the circumstances</span>//<span class="Underline"> permitting or encouraging high-risk decisions </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">leading to war </span>//<span class="Underline">that is the </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">key to</span>//<span class="Underline"> more effectively </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">controlling armed conflict</span>//<span class="Underline">. And the same may also be true of democide. The early focus in the Rwanda slaughter on "ethnic conflict," as though Hutus and Tutsis had begun to slaughter each other through spontaneous combustion, distracted our attention from the reality that a nondemocratic Hutu regime had carefully planned and orchestrated a genocide against Rwandan Tutsis as well as its Hutu opponents. 158 Certainly if we were able to press a button and end poverty, racism, religious intolerance, injustice, and endless disputes, we would want to do so. Indeed, democratic governments must remain committed to policies that will produce a better world by all measures of human progress. The broader achievement of democracy and the rule of law will itself assist in this progress. No one, however, has yet been able to demonstrate the kind of robust correlation with any of these "</span>traditional" causes of war<span class="Underline"> that is reflected in the "democratic peace." Further, given the difficulties in overcoming many of these social problems, an approach to war exclusively dependent on their solution may doom us to war for generations to come. [*394] A useful framework for thinking about the war puzzle is provided in the Kenneth Waltz classic Man, the State and War, 159 first published in 1954 for the Institute of War and Peace Studies, in which he notes that previous thinkers about the causes of war have tended to assign responsibility at one of the three levels of individual psychology, the nature of the state, or the nature of the international system. This tripartite level of analysis has subsequently been widely copied in the study of international relations. We might summarize my analysis in this classical construct by suggesting that the most critical variables are the second and third levels, or "images," of analysis. Government structures, at the second level, seem to play a central role in levels of aggressiveness in high-risk behavior leading to major war. In this, the "</span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">democratic peace</span>////<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">" is an essential insight</span>//<span class="Underline">. The third level of analysis, the international system, or totality of external incentives influencing the decision to go to war, is also critical when government structures do not restrain such high-risk behavior on their own. Indeed, nondemocratic systems may not only fail to constrain inappropriate aggressive behavior, they may even massively enable it by placing the resources of the state at the disposal of a ruthless regime elite. It is not that the first level of analysis, the individual, is unimportant - I have already argued that it is important in elite perceptions about the permissibility and feasibility of force and resultant necessary levels of deterrence. It is, instead, that the second level of analysis, government structures, may be a powerful proxy for settings bringing to power those who are disposed to aggressive military adventures and in creating incentive structures predisposed to high-risk behavior. We might also want to keep open the possibility that a war/peace model focused on democracy and deterrence might be further usefully refined by adding psychological profiles of particular leaders as we assess the likelihood of aggression and levels of necessary deterrence. Nondemocracies' leaders can have different perceptions of the necessity or usefulness of force and, as Marcus Aurelius should remind us, not all absolute leaders are Caligulas or Neros. Further, the history of ancient Egypt reminds us that not all Pharaohs were disposed to make war on their neighbors. Despite the importance of individual leaders, however, the </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">key to war avoidance</span>//<span class="Underline"> is understanding that major international war is critically an interaction, or synergy, of certain characteristics at levels two and three - specifically </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">an absence of [*395] democracy</span>//<span class="Underline"> and an </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">absence of effective deterrence</span>//<span class="Underline">. Yet another way to conceptualize the importance of democracy and deterrence in war avoidance is to note that each in its own way </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">internalizes the costs to decision elites</span>//<span class="Underline"> of engaging in high-risk aggressive behavior. Democracy internalizes these costs in a variety of ways including displeasure of the electorate at having war imposed upon it by its own government. And deterrence either prevents achievement of the objective altogether or imposes punishing costs making the gamble not worth the risk. 160 III. Testing the Hypothesis Hypotheses, or paradigms, are useful if they reflect the real world better than previously held paradigms. In the complex world of foreign affairs and the war puzzle, perfection is unlikely. </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">No general construct will fit all cases </span>//<span class="Underline">even in the restricted category of "major interstate war;" </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">there are simply too many variables</span>//<span class="Underline">. We should insist, however, on </span>//<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">testing against the real world and on results that suggest enhanced usefulness over other constructs</span>//<span class="Underline">. In testing the hypothesis, we can test it for consistency with major wars. That is, in looking, for example, at the principal interstate wars in the twentieth century, did they present both a nondemocratic aggressor and an absence of effective deterrence? 161 And although it, by itself, does not prove causation, we might also want to test the hypothesis against settings of potential wars that did not occur. That is, in non-war settings, was there an absence of at least one element of the synergy? We might also ask questions about the effect of changes on the international system in either element of the synergy. That is, what, in general, happens when a totalitarian state makes a transition to stable democracy or vice versa? And what, in general, happens when levels of deterrence are dramatically increased or decreased? </span>
