EVERYONE EVERYONE

THE FASCISTS HAVE TAKEN DOWN MY HILARIOUS MEMES/PICTURES OF SAM IN NATURE.

STOP THIS INJUSTICE.

A wiki with no pictures is just used for cites and education, which is like using Formspring for anything besides cyberbullying: It is just pointless.

OCCUPY JPEGS.

Love,
Joe.

(But seriously, this wiki is way less funny without memes of William Spanos)


=disclaimer and stuff= 

Hello everyone - Sam here - if you want aff cites, I'm at swolff13@brophybroncos.org. Or, you can write me at PO Box 2800/175, Carefree, AZ, 85377, and I'll get back to you within 3 to 5 business days. 

Also, I am not responsible for any images or comments below (including the addendum). Blame Joe.

Addendum: Sam's email was recently hacked by cyber terrorists, don't email him, unless you want viruses.

Addendum to Addendum: Fine, email us both. Make sure you add [[mailto:jskoog13@brophybroncos.org|jskoog13@brophybroncos.org]] to your email. Unless you just want to talk to Sam, that's cool I guess. I'll understand....

Forgot how to read but still need cites?
Sam just learned with Hooked on Phonics and can help you, or you can email Joe at jskoog13@brophybroncos.org.

If you need brackets based upon predictions alone and no fact, also feel free to contact me.

Seriously, that man needs more balloons.

Demanding more pictures of this hunk of West German man candy?

I would very much appreciate it if someone asked me for cites. You get a couple prizes.

1.) I will add you on gchat and you get to see my clever/hilarious statuses
2.) You get a cite to an argument that you probably have already cut before
3.) A pun or joke about Katie Roberts
4.) The knowledge you will have interacted with someone who has shared a bed with Sam Wolff before

So what are you waiting for? Email today.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Contention 2 is Relations</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">China wants to co-operate with the U.S. – U.S. blocks.</span>

The third is in satellite applications including disaster monitoring and management.</span>





<span style="font-size: 12pt;">No cooperation over space ensures that any attempt for relations will fail – that threatens overall security and Asian stability </span>

**We’ll isolate two scenarios:**



<span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Conflict with China causes United States nuclear first strike </span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">Third, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">the growth of China’s</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> space and </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">counterspace capabilities contributes to raising the costs of American victory in any future conflict </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">with Beijing. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">ensuring that a future limited war between China and the United States stays restricted will itself become a significant challenge.</span>



**2. EMP**

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">China’s counterspace technologies guarantee EMP and cyber attacks</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">What is the net impact of these military space capabilities? I would urge you to think of it in terms of two dimensions: </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">the space capabilities that are focused on force enhancement primarily allow China today to mount a wide variety of conventional operations with a great deal of confidence</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, either within its borders or at some distance from its borders. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">synergistic use of space electromagnetic attack and cyber attack that poses</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, I think, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">the greatest threat </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">to our warfighters.</span>



**EMP attacks cause extinction**

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Contention 4 is leadership </span>

He is frequently invited as a keynote speaker on many international forums, and is increasingly dedicated to frontier research ranging from human space exploration; solar energy to global collective intelligence and risk based policy-making on emerging environmental and energy security issues. Hsu holds a bachelors degree in Applied Math, masters degree in Operations Research and Statistics and a doctoral degree in Engineering Science. As senior advisory of Aerospace Technology Working Group (ATWG) and a co-founder of Space Development Steering Committee, Dr. Hsu has been a strong advocate for SBSP for years and was instrumental in instigating the 2007 NSSO study on space solar energy and has contributed whole-heartedly to the great human endeavor of harnessing solar energy for sustainable human development., “Harnessing the Sun: Embarking on Humanity's Next Giant Leap,”[[http://spacejournal.ohio.edu/issue16/hsu.html]], AM) *we do not endorse gendered language. </span>

He has most recently left NASA and is taking on greater challenges as Sr. VP of the Space Energy Group. Dr. Hsu was until recently head of the NASA GSFC risk management function, and was the GSFC lead on the NASA-MIT joint project for risk-informed decision-making support on key NASA programs, as GPM, LSS and the CxP etc. He was also a leading engineer/scientist in the Shuttle and Exploration Analysis Department at JSC in Houston, and led key projects such as the Shuttle PRA modeling & integration, SLEP and Shuttle upgrade trade studies. Dr. Hsu served on many agency and center expert panels supporting challenging SMA issues, including his key roles in the STS-107 (Space Shuttle Columbia) investigation team, the Return to Flight team, and ECO expert team for the Discovery mission. Dr. Hsu has over 90 publications and is coauthor of two books and co-chair of several technical committees. He is frequently invited as a keynote speaker on many international forums, and is increasingly dedicated to frontier research ranging from human space exploration; solar energy to global collective intelligence and risk based policy-making on emerging environmental and energy security issues. Hsu holds a bachelors degree in Applied Math, masters degree in Operations Research and Statistics and a doctoral degree in Engineering Science. As senior advisory of Aerospace Technology Working Group (ATWG) and a co-founder of Space Development Steering Committee, Dr. Hsu has been a strong advocate for SBSP for years and was instrumental in instigating the 2007 NSSO study on space solar energy and has contributed whole-heartedly to the great human endeavor of harnessing solar energy for sustainable human development., “Harnessing the Sun: Embarking on Humanity's Next Giant Leap,”<span style="color: #1155cc;">[[@http://spacejournal.ohio.edu/issue16/hsu.html]]</span>, AM)</span></span>
