BAGHDAD — The U.S. military has been approaching its goal to withdraw all combat forces from Iraq. Officials said the U.S. military presence in Iraq has dropped to a total of about 74,000 troops, Middle East Newsline reported. They said most of the troops were flown from bases in Iraq to neighboring Kuwait, and from there either to Europe or the United States. The U.S. withdrawal has accelerated despite political turmoil in Baghdad, without a government
since elections in March 2010. 

Contention Two: The Plan
The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in Kuwait by removing all troops.
