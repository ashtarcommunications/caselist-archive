<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Despite significant progress in short sea container transportation in Europe and recent successful service startups here in the United States, America's Marine Highway must still overcome barriers before it can reach its potential. Disincentives to increased use of the Marine Highway include the unfamiliarity of shippers with this domestic transportation alternative, the lack of an established network of frequent service for container and trailer cargoes, the need for coordinated investment in port infrastructure and vessels, tax issues, and the fact that public benefits attributable to the use of Marine Highway services do not factor into many private sector transportation decisions... </span>__Government action is required to help overcome these challenges and assist the expansion of Marine Highway services in a significant manner__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

===<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">1NC Military Topicality</span>=== 
**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Interpretation – </span>****<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Infrastructure is physical capital that provides public services – it excludes the military</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Fourie 06 </span>**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">– Chief Operating Officer of ArcelorMittal South Africa (Johan, ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE: A REVIEW OF DEFINITIONS, THEORY AND EMPIRICS, 9/06, South African Journal of Economics, Vol 74, Issue 3, Wiley Online Library)</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">One way to define infrastructure is to describe it in terms of its characteristics. A perhaps sufficiently succinct definition of infrastructure, also called ‘social overhead capital’, is provided by</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;"> Hirschman</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> (1958). He </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">defines infrastructure as “capital that provides public services</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">”. In essence, </span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">infrastructure therefore consists of two elements – ‘capitalness’ and ‘publicness</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">’. The first element is used to distinguish between infrastructure (defined as a stock variable) and public goods (defined as a flow variable) (Rietveld and Bruinsma, 1998:18). The latter element involves the general properties of non-rivalry and non-excludability. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">A distinction can</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">, thus, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">be made between infrastructure and public capital where infrastructure would include goods that have a capital character, but are not necessarily public. Such goods</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">could include privately owned telecommunications, but</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial;">would exclude publicly owned military equipment </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="font-family: Arial;">(which are public capital, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">but does not provide public services</span>__<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">). Thus, a common feature of infrastructure seems to be that there is at least a strong public involvement in the use thereof (Rietveld and Bruinsma, 1998:19). Economists label such goods physical infrastructure, or infrastructure capital, while urban planners might refer to them as transportation modalities and utilitcies.</span>

__As a definition for transport infrastructure we use those immovable capital goods for transport which are characterized by a considerable degree of economies of scale__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> so that it is usually supplied as a collective input into production. As a consequence, the government has a high degree of control on the level of supply, price, and/or quality. </span>__Transport infrastructure includes facilities such as railway lines, railway stations, highways, canals, seaports, and airports__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As indicated in Table l, transport infrastructure investments have both temporary and nontemporary effects on the economy. A major temporary effect concerns the stimulation of employment and income during the construction phase via the demand side.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Transportation or transport is the carrying of people and goods from one destination to another. The term comes from the Latin trans meaning “across” and //portare// meaning “to carry”. </span>__Transportation can be divided into three distinct fields__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: 1. </span>__Infrastructure -__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">When we refer to infrastructure it includes </span>__our transport networks such as roads, railways, airways, canals, and pipeline__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This also includes the terminals or nodes such as </span>__airports, railway stations, bus stations, and seaports__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 2. </span>__Vehicle – These comprises of the vehicles that we regularly ride in the networks__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">for instance automobiles (buses, cars, taxis, and etc.), trains and airplanes. 3. Operations – They are the control of the whole transport system including traffic lights/signals on roads, ramp meters, railroad switches, air traffic control, and etc.</span>

While it is perfectly true that universalism can never become Universal (it will always require a hegemonic-par­ticular embodiment in order to have any meaning), what is novel about Zizek’s universalism is that it would not attempt to conceal this fact or to reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix. </span>

**<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Our alternative is a complete rejection of capitalism.
