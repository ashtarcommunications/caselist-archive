**2.) Takes too long**

The plan can’t solve and distracts from reduction of CO2 emissions – that’s the onlylong-termsolution to warming

<span class="s1">**The Counterplan solves 100% of the aff**</span>
<span class="s1">**Mantra Energy 10** [</span>June 28; Mantra has applied for a patent for its Electro Reduction of Carbon Dioxide (ERC) process. The ERC process has been under development for 9 years, and was originally developed by Professor Colin Oloman at the University of British Columbia’s Clean Energy Research Centre. For the past two years, the development process has taken place in Mantra’s labs, funded by a blend of equity and government grants, the latter from National Research Council – Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP). “Mantra Successfully Completes Carbon Recycling Development Program and Is Now Ready for First On-Site Demonstration Project” (http://www.mantraventuregroup.com/Press/PressReleases/tabid/359/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/6/Mantra-Successfully-Completes-Carbon-Recycling-Development-Program-and-Is-Now-Ready-for-First-Ever-On-Site-Demonstration-Project.aspx)[KC]
