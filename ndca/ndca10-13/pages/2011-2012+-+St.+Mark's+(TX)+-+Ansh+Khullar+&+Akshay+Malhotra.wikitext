ADV 1 Space Colonization
Limited first possession is the most efficient method of allocating property rights
Collins, Lecturer City Law School London, ’08</span> (David, 14 B.U. J. SCI. & TECH. L. 201, EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF REAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ON THE PLANET MARS, Boston University Journal of Science and Technology Law, Summer, twm)
VII. Bounded First Possession by Landfall
__As an alternative to fixing future claims on Mars based upon a re-allocation of pre-existing ones, the most efficient mechanism of real property allocation of an un-owned res nullius planet Mars would be a limited form of first possession: the allotment of only a portion of land to the first arriving organization, not the entire surface of the planet. The size of the allocation would be set at the optimal level to encourage exploration and development while conserving land for future explorers.____The first landers could claim all terrain, for example, within a hundred kilometer radius of their landing point subject to an increase if productive use is made of an even larger portion. The rest of the planet would remain un-owned and available to become possessed by subsequent explorers. This bounded first possession is in keeping with the language of the Outer Space Treaty and Moon Treaties that prohibit only sovereign claims to the celestial body, which could be interpreted to mean the planetary sphere itself.__ Such a credible interpretation reads in the word "entire" to the following provision for the purpose of clarity: "neither the [*216] entire surface or entire subsurface of the Moon [or Mars] shall become the property of any State"." n74 __Partial allocation as described is just because landing on one minuscule portion of a world should not entitle a claimant to ownership of all of it, much of which may be left completely idle by the original explorer, resulting in an inefficient use of the planet's resources.__ The problem of __inefficient races to achieve the legal right to first possession will be avoided by this regime, as second and third place finishers will be rewarded with other plots of land on the surface.____Consequently pre-mature and therefore non-productive missions will be avoided because there is no risk of exclusion for failing to land first; the marginal benefit of arriving second will be as high as the marginal benefit of arriving first.__ Of course, the pride engendered by first arrival, such as that generated by the first Moon landing, would help to encourage earlier Mars expeditions rather than later ones. Incentive to settle on Mars before others may similarly result from the fact that some regions of the planet could be more valuable than others. For example, just as the flat, northern hemisphere would may be more conducive for agriculture than the rugged southern hemisphere, the equatorial zone would probably hold greater value because of their warmer climates. n75 Part of the concern of developing nations in espousing the Common Heritage principle for planetary bodies was that the planet's resources would already be depleted by the time nations with weaker initial resource endowments (the developing world) are capable of exploiting the land on Mars. n76 __Plot ownership would address this concern since vast regions of Mars would likely remain un-owned for centuries, giving developing nations a chance to "catch up".____Private easements and restrictive covenants arrived at by bargaining among the landed owners (rather than through international political consensus) and enforced through private litigation would control competing land uses such as over exploitation or pollution in order to produce an efficient allocation of resources.__ At least in the early stages of colonization there would be no need to incur the cost of a special "Mars Court" to adjudicate such disputes. Instead, landowners could litigate in the courts of their choice on Earth, subject to that court's own rules on taking jurisdiction. For example, an American corporation owning land on Mars could bring suit in nuisance against another American landowner in the Federal court of the United States. n77 Disputes between sovereign landowners on Mars could similarly be brought in the International Court of Justice. n78 Again, it is expected that __such private land use adjudication among fewer parties should be less costly than public control of__ [*217] __commonly held land through regulation.__ n79 Moreover, bargaining among a limited number of initial owners should arrive at the most efficient manner of land use without the need to resort to lawsuits. __Excessive land use regulation resulting from the need to satisfy all decision-makers could diminish the overall productivity of the land, especially if such regulations were imposed ex post after valuable resources had already been wasted.__ It is further expected that landowners on Mars would adopt the self-imposed obligation to engage in reasonable and productive use of that land in order to maximize the value of their own holdings. Such "injunctions against waste" n80 would become more significant in later stages of settlement when vacant land on Mars had become scarcer. Accordingly, if a plot is not being used efficiently, for example, by an owner that held expertise in space travel but not in colonization, then title in the land could be transferred on the authority of a court, perhaps through the Common Law doctrine of adverse possession, n81 to another party that had these skills and intentions. Should a terraforming project be undertaken - transforming the whole of Mars into an environment that could sustain life - landowners would have an incentive to "free ride" by not contributing resources to such an inherently communal project, allowing them to benefit from the labors of others without cost. Perhaps a mandatory fee could be imposed upon all residents by a court in order to address this problem - although it is unclear what legal precedent could be invoked to do so - in advance of the establishment of zoning or centralized governance on the planet. n82 Market forces should provide, however, that a party not adding value to its land through development would have an incentive to sell or lease it to a party that would make a more productive use of it. Thus, __the first explorers might wish simply to sell their claims as suggested above. To facilitate such bargaining among landowners, the establishment of a land registry system, which would set standardized plot dimensions and record transactions and would represent one of the few costs associated with private ownership of land on Mars, would be necessary.__ n83

Property rights is key to encourage the first colonizers.

**The recognition of bounded land claims on a planet appears already to be envisioned by the text of the Moon Treaty which as noted above, permits individual states to retain jurisdiction and control over their personal property, such as bases and equipment, that is brought to the moon. n84 However, as noted above, the rights in such chattels are not equivalent to the full property rights exercised by terrestrial landowners since there is no exclusivity - treaty [*218] requires parties to allow others to use these equipment and facilities when requested. n85 On one hand such compulsory property sharing is economically efficient because it would encourage further development by minimizing one of the costliest aspects of settlement. A subsequent arrival could benefit from existing infrastructure devoting resources to the more productive development of the region without redundant expenditure that would impede overall progress. However, __the common property regime envisioned by the space treaties ignores the reality that without adequate compensation for such sharing there might be an incentive to free-ride by waiting for another explorer to incur the initial costs of establishing a Mars base with oxygen/fuel production facilities. It would therefore be more cost effective to be the second or third Mars colonizer, potentially inducing a strategic waiting game. To resolve this problem it should be permissible to charge a fee for the use of one's facilities because such fees represent the fundamental economic gain of granting property rights in land on Mars. Developed land, such as land with a base upon it that could sustain human life, becomes valuable to subsequent visitors, and this can generate revenue that will offset the initial costs. Bargaining would naturally set the use fee at an optimal level that encouraged subsequent parties to land and make use of existing facilities and would not be too low to deter the initial landing and construction.__ Thus, the direction to share resources in the Moon Treaty might be unnecessary - sharing might increase wealth for all parties, much as land values increase in proportion to the rise in population of an area.**
Private property rights key to colonization – no incentive to create livable areas without property rights.
**<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Collins, Lecturer City Law School London, ’08</span> (David, 14 B.U. J. SCI. & TECH. L. 201, EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF REAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ON THE PLANET M0ARS, Boston University Journal of Science and Technology Law, Summer, twm)**
**However, __the land on Mars is naturally inhospitable to humans and agriculture as we know it. The land must be altered through the establishment of infrastructure, like environmentally controlled bases or artificially irrigated greenhouses, before it can be useful in any practical sense. Because of the enormous technological commitment involved, land uses of this nature will be relatively restrictive (at least at first) and probably of small dimension compared to the entire surface of the globe. Such uses are therefore exclusive and rivalrous because there is limited room to live in a constructed base, limited soil under a greenhouse roof, limited artificially liberated oxygen (from the carbon dioxide atmosphere) for breathing and limited melted water for drinking. In that sense the land of Mars should also be viewed as a private good.__ __The incentive to make these productive uses of the land of Mars necessitates non-communal ownership because private property rights encourage the maximization of resource potential due to the prospect of higher individual gains. The cost of monitoring property is also negated through a regime where private entitlements are enforced by law.__ n35 Similarly, it has now been widely and effectively argued n36 that __the recognition of property rights will be a strong incentive for space exploration because the expectation of future profit, such as derived from property claims, legitimizes the enormous expense from a rational cost-benefit perspective.__ __Missions to Mars are particularly needful of such clear incentivization because of the high costs and uncertain benefits.__ Recent estimates suggest that a manned mission to Mars would cost $ 55 billion. n37 The establishment of bases or other such infrastructure could cost significantly more, and the value of such improved land is at best uncertain, [*208] especially since its expected utility may depend on some as yet unknowable future eventuality on Earth. In contrast, __equal distribution of Martian land in line with the Common Heritage principle would lead to no profit in the economic sense and would inevitably result in the "tragedy of the commons," the risk of self-interested over-exploitation or under-exploitation of shared resources if there is no enforcement mechanism that ensures each user pulls their own weight__. n38 __If each nation or person has equal claim to Mars as a matter of right and not as a function of contribution, then non-space faring nations and their taxpayers will avoid contributing to the efforts to reach and develop Mars. No country is likely to undertake the enormous risks, economic and otherwise, associated with Mars colonization without the legal certainty that their rewards will not be distributed to others.__ n39 __The private property rights to exclude others from specific developed areas of Mars, to transfer that right to others in a market, and to use the land in a productive manner are crucial incentives.__**

Because these threats would generally only affect life on Earth and not life elsewhere,[[#bfn3]]<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">3</span> __self-sufficient space colonies would survive these catastrophes, enabling life to persist in the universe.__ For this reason, space colonization has been advocated as a means of ensuring long-term human survival [[#bbib32]]<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">[32]</span> and [[#bbib33]]<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">[33]</span>. Space exploration projects can help increase the probability of long-term human survival in other ways as well: technology developed for space exploration is central to proposals to avoid threats from large comet and asteroid impacts [[#bbib34]]<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">[34]</span> and [[#bbib35]]<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">[35]</span>. However, given the goal of increasing the probability of long-term human survival by a certain amount, there may be more cost-effective options than space colonization (with costs defined in terms of money, effort, or related measures). More cost-effective options may include isolated refuges on Earth to help humans survive a catastrophe [[#bbib36]]<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">[36]</span> and materials to assist survivors, such as a how-to manual for civilization [[#bbib37]]<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">[37]</span> or a seed bank [[#bbib38]]<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">[38]</span>.

**As for astronomical risks<span class="Underline">, to escape our sun's death, humanity will eventually need to relocate.

**The plan is the most cost-effective way to reduce existential risk—when you evaluate impacts you have to include the value of all FUTURE generations of people.**

**6. COST EFFECTIVENESS AND UNCERTAINTY To establish the priority of delaying human extinction among other public projects, we need to know not only the value of future lives but also the costs of extinction countermeasures and how to account for their uncertain success. __Cost-effectiveness analysis__ (CEA) __is often used to prioritize public projects__ (Jamison, 1993 ). __The ethical premise behind CEA is we should deliver the greatest good to the greatest number of people. With finite resources, this implies investing in projects that have the lowest marginal cost per unit of value__—life-year saved, case of disease averted, etc. (McKie et al., 1998). Even when CEA employs distributional constraints or weights to account for fairness or equity, cost effectiveness is typically seen as an essential aspect of the fair distribution of finite resources (Williams, 1997).10 The effects of public projects are uncertain. Some projects may not work and some may address problems that never emerge. The typical way of dealing with these uncertainties in economics is to use expected values. The expected value of a project is the sum of the probability of each possible outcome of the project multiplied by each outcome's respective value. 7. EXAMPLE: THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF REDUCING EXTINCTION RISKS FROM ASTEROIDS __Even if extinction events are improbable, the expected values of countermeasures could be large, as they include the value of all future lives. This introduces a discontinuity between the CEA of extinction and nonextinction risks. Even though the risk to any existing individual of dying in a car crash is much greater than the risk of dying in an asteroid impact, asteroids pose a much greater risk to the existence of future generations__ (__we are not likely to crash all our cars at once__) (Chapman, 2004 ). __The "death-toll" of an extinction-level asteroid impact is the population of Earth, plus all the descendents of that population who would otherwise have existed if not for the impact. There is thus a discontinuity between risks that threaten 99% of humanity and those that threaten 100%__. As an example, __consider asteroids__. Let p be the probability of a preventable extinction event occurring in this century: p = pa + po where pa is the probability of an asteroid-related extinction event occurring during the century, and po is the probability of any other preventable extinction event occurring. The (reducible) extinction risk is: Lp = L(pa + po) where __L is the expected number of future human life-years in the absence of preventable extinction events during the centur__y. The expected value of reducing pa by 50% is thus: L(pa + po) - L(0.5pa + po) = 0.5Lpa __Suppose humanity would, in the absence of preventable extinction events during the century, survive__ as long as our closest relative, homo erectus, and could thus survive __another 1.6 million years__ (Avise et al., 1998 ).11 __Further suppose humanity maintains a population of 10 billion persons__.12 __Then__, __L =__ 1.6 million years x 10 billion lives = __1.6 x 1016 life-years__. Based on the frequency of previous asteroid impacts, the probability of an extinction-level (=10 km) asteroid impact in this century is around one in 1 million (Chapman, 2004; NASA, 2007). Thus, 0.5Lpa = 0.5 x 1.6 x 1016 life-years x 10-6 = 8 billion life-years. A system to detect all large, near-Earth asteroids would cost between $300 million and $2 billion (Chapman, 2004; NASA, 2006 , pp. 251–254), while a system to deflect large asteroids would cost between $1 and 20 billion to develop (Gritzner, 1997, p. 156; NASA, 2006 , pp. 251–254; Sommer, 2005 , p. 121; Urias et al., 1996 ).13 Suppose a detect-and-deflect system costing a total of $20 billion would buy us a century of protection, reducing the probability of an extinction-level impact over the next century by 50%.14 Further suppose this cost is incurred even if the deflection system is never used, and the system offers no benefit besides mitigating extinction-level asteroid impacts.15 Then the cost effectiveness of the detect-and-deflect system is $20 billion/8 billion life-years = $2.50 per life-year. By comparison, it is common for U.S. health programs to spend, and for U.S. policies and citizens to value, more than $100,000 per life-year (Kenkel, 2001; Neumann et al., 2000 ; Viscusi & Aldy, 2003 ).16 Even if one is less optimistic and believes humanity will certainly die out in 1,000 years, asteroid defense would be cost effective at $4,000 per life-year.**
