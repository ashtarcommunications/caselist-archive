==Black Paintings 1AC - Valley== 
We begin our discussion of this year’s resolution in a place about as far away from space as possible. Madrid Spain the 27th of February 1819, Franscisco Goya purchases the Quinta del Sordo. This desolate outpost was a home but Goya’s mad visions poured out off of the canvas and onto the very walls themselves…these were not the portraits for which he had become famous with the elites but grotesque images that conjure up the darkest content of the human soul…




Glendinning reflects on these “Black Paintings:”

It is not a religious mystery that one finds in his work. Rather he looks for new areas of mystery, scaling the highest points in the landscape, from which unusual phenomena can be seen. The chief magnetic force acting on fantasy, working upon it in the reverse direction from gravity and pointing its head to the sky, is the force which drives us to intuit, glimpse or even touch things which are above human existence. It is this which brings us to surrealism from time to time: a surrealism which has always been at work in Spanish minds. Because our spirit is especially realistic, its excursions into fantasy have always been made from a base of realism, so that the creations of Spanish genius turn out to be surreal rather than superfantastic. Ours is a time of thirst and aspiration. We need to disturb life, make it problematical, create our own miniature monsters, reach beyond the normal possibilities, seeking a kind of delirious rhythm which will raise us above everyday life. After a period of naturalism in which everything tended to be seen in terms of clear-cut mathematics, we feel impelled to bifurcate reality, burst its limits, tremulate it…We must exercise the rights of miniature monsters and drive reality mad. Humor is the way to do it since the surreal grin (very different from the unreal is half serious and half tragic.) Goya is nearest to this mysterious realism in his Proverbios or Disparates, the pages of his work which dived deepest into heights and depths previously unplumbed: those which even to-day we explore in our planes and submarines. These powerful, disquieting, superb proverbs spring from collective fears and fights in which monsters come down to the plains. These plates are larger than the Caprichos; like strange squares opening out from the hemmed-in alleys of his drawings. The fact that they have no ultimate explanation makes them all richer in meaning…In my view Goya reaches heights in his Disparates: capital letters engraved and adorned for a book which has yet to be written; a formidable book for which he has provided the first letters of chapters which the next generation will write.




Here is the first of them the black silhouette of the he-goat looms omnipresent and yet invisible in the cover of blackness…he presides over the grotesque mass of humanity like the practioner of a long forbidden ritual of unspeakable evil…the faces contort…snarl…both repulsed and fascinated…




The devil is in the inky black…

Goya turns his eyes to the heavens…Saturn wild eyed consumes one of his creations as if Goya is reminding us that the Gods too are mad…

In place of salvation from the dark forces that Goya conjures his Saturn offers only a glare of hopeless surrender to the frenzy…as if to tell us without equivocation that the gods too are subject to the irrational mystery of the void. The black of the paintings then fulfill a duplicate role…we experience both suffocation and isolation. The suffocation of the mass of humanity and the bodies of our gods and demons piled on top of each other…the heat of another’s breath…the stench, sweat, and decay of death…a rapturous noise.

Behind the din we can hear him whispering:




I am Goya

of the bare field, by the enemy’s beak gorged

till the craters of my eyes gape

I am grief.




I am the tongue

of war, the embers of cities

on the snows of the year 1941

I am hunger.




I am the gullet

of a woman hanged whose body like a bell

tolled over a black square

I am Goya




O grapes of wrath!

I have hurled westward

the ashes of the uninvited guest!

and hammered stars into the unforgetting sky like nails.

I am Goya.




Goya is indeed the tongue of war. He speaks of other sources of human suffering too, and their causes in human behavior, social and political attitudes and the nature of things. Goya is also the tongue of beauty and joy. There is laughter as well as anger in his work; hope and despair. We listen to the tongue, we try to interpret it. We say what we see in the pictures. We say how line or color or texture seem to be. Yet still in the end, as Wittgenstein said: ‘Whatever we see could be other than it is. Whatever we can describe at all could be other than it is.




Now look at The Dog…

Here for the first time we see a painting not of blackness but of space…the hollow echo of the void…The rest of the series is raging, violent, tortured…this one is different; the content is almost missing…sunken into the earth or the sea…more accurately swallowed by the horizon. The dog feels the banal hopelessness of crude material reality depicted in the other works…alone…his eyes turn ever so slightly to heaven…looking for its master…searching for God…But where are the gods this time? No chariots…or winged angels…no easy salvation…he looks up into the mottled yellow void that dominates the majority of the painting. This is the sensation of emersion…he feels the cold rush of the void and we are transported right along with him…




Against all of that darkness Goya leaves us art…and his art transports us but another artist radicalizes the notion of travel…in an echo from the dark corner of Goya’s world Mark Rothko begins to explore the emptying of content from his paintings until they share an almost uncanny relationship to the strange vacant world of our worried dog. He began with large fields of color burning with intense light viewed as if they were on the other side of some ethereal fog. The works pulse with life beckoning the viewer to come into their softly permeable surfaces…




On the other hand, that morning I had a yen to see Francis Bacon; so into the Tate I went, down the grand processional space of the Duveen Gallery, took a wrong turn and there they were. It was definitely not love at first sight. Sight was in any case a problem, Rothko having insisted that the lighting be kept almost pretentiously low. But that, of course, was a clever prescription. One's eyes took their leave from the white glare of the gallery wall, and, as they adjusted to the velvety obscurity, entered an altogether different optical realm. It was rather like going into a cinema where the main feature had had the sound turned down: expectation in the dimness. Something crimson and purple in there was doing a steady throb, like the valve of a body part. Rothko had said of his paintings that they were 'an adventure into an unknown world which can only be explored by those willing to take risks'. The longer I stared, the more powerful was the magnetic pull through the black columnar forms towards the interior of Rothko's world. I still wasn't sure it was somewhere I wanted to be; only that by some sorcery of vision I had no choice but to go on. And that the destination might not prove to be a picnic.




Our method for this debate then is to use these paintings and the creative will that gave birth to them to performatively enact an exploration of space. Our affirmation is likewise in this spirit of artistic exploration…the resolution fades into a Rothko mist…it pulses with primordial energy…it obscures and reveals itself…it is like the inside of a Rothko painting…a place for artistic creation…both the nightmare and the sublime…




The bright colors of Rothko fade…this is what the void looks like…

The Houston Chapel:

This is the claustrophobia of death. A face to face visit with the beyond. Like Goya’s Dog we are swallowed by these paintings…they come and get us…force us to look. This is the darkest night of the artist’s soul. Alone with the cool darkness the skin ripples and the senses elevate…the artist is a totally vulnerable now…childlike…the portal opens once again and the artist who is willing to risk everything throws itself into the night time…Rothko thankfully does not leave us in the dark…an alien planet rises recreating the moment of original creation…somewhere a god whispers “let there be light.”




So when, finally, he did break out of his old style, it was to go raven-black; as black as Texas oil. In 1964, when Dominique and John de Menil, enthusiastic collectors of modern art from a family that had become hugely wealthy through selling drilling equipment, offered Rothko exactly what he wanted – a chapel, custom-built to his specifications – he jumped at the opportunity. But what he had built, and the pictures he made for it, sucked away the warm light of the Seagram pictures and seemed to replace them with a sepulchre of the spirit. At first sight, the stark octagonal room feels like a chamber of live burial, a black full stop to Rothko's journey through radiance. The rippling flares of light at the edges of the colour panels, his sunspots, have been wiped out. Instead there are hard-edged panels covered with opaque layers of black paint. But this isn't the end of the story visually. Between the two crow-wing panels of one of the triptychs is a brushy purple panel, with more forgiving stainings and soakings. Although the modulation seems slight, the relief from the hard black seems like an invitation to a different universe. And as one's eyes adjust, it's this velvety tone that expands and diffuses, like air entering a sealed chamber. An American actress friend of mine (from a long line of butchers), about to film a famously difficult part on location in Texas some years ago, decided to get into the role by spending the night in the Rothko chapel – an experience that would not, I suspect, have most of us on our toes in the morning, bright, breezy and ready for action. But no, she said, it was wonderful: 'Coming out, I felt so light.' Rothko would have loved that. He, however, got heavier. In 1968 he suffered an aortic aneurysm that nearly killed him. Then he turned to drink in a serious way. His marriage to Melt fell apart. But he resisted the clichés. Instead of a complete extinction of light, the very opposite happened. Brilliance was reborn. It was not the luminous explosion of the early 1950s – in the late 1960s the radiance is almost always challenged by areas of inky darkness. But that only gives it startlingly augmented force, as if the painter were himself on the threshold between two worlds. In the lower section of painting Rothko after painting made in 1969 he laid down a zone of milky grey, like the rim of the moon – a way station to the universe, still soaked with light and somehow tethered to the known world, but on the very lip of infinity. It's as if Rothko had himself already gone into deep space and was looking back, presiding god-like over a moment of creation, dividing the light from the darkness. That he was not at all running out of creative juice is suggested by the party Rothko gave for friends in December 1969 so that they could voice their reaction to these new paintings. He was also suffering from emphysema. After the aneurysm doctors had advised that (apart from giving up smoking and drinking) he should paint nothing taller than two feet. He responded, in the few months before he cut his wrists and arms open, with gestures of heroic defiance against any enclosing of the night. Both chromatically and conceptually the acrylics on paper are some of the most brilliant things he ever did, poetically compressed and lyrically intense. A celestial cobalt breaks into the black and pushes into the advancing darkness, blue flame licking at the edges. The very last canvas is a blaze of vermilion light, a warrior cremation.




So contemplate…the Goat…Saturn…the Dog…human violence and cruelty…birth and joy…eternity…the void…it is all here with us now. It is in this place where we come to engage in the project of being human beings…to celebrate…morn…to cope…and in the face of all of that to finally live…and die…




So how wrong did I get it that morning in 1970, just before I collided with Mark Rothko? About as wrong as I could. If there was one word I might have ignorantly used to sum up his late paintings, it would have been 'forbidding'. But in fact they are embracing. No artist in the modern canon, at any rate, went to such lengths to include us, the spectators, in the enactment of the work. If ever we think of Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, van Gogh and even Picasso at his Guernica moment as virtuoso solo turns, off doing their own thing, heedless of anyone else, we couldn't be more mistaken. All of them assumed our participating presence. But perhaps none, not even the master of unfinish, Rembrandt, not even the sweetly hand-shaking Vincent van Gogh, took such pains to make us partners, not just in the beholding, but in the creation of his art. Without our becoming enfolded within his mantle of light, Rothko thought, there was no art. His greatest paintings, and especially the Seagram murals, are, then, performance pieces, the work of someone who never stopped talking about their drama. For some critics, then and now, this theatricality smacks of visual posturing. Not for me, though. The artist's reach through the canvas seems, as it does for Caravaggio and Turner, a gesture of humane inclusiveness. We, as much as the artist, are players. We enter stage left. We stick around. We are moved by what happens. And when we exit stage right, the rest of our lives are marked by that performance. The greatest compliment that Rothko (who wasn't free with them) handed out was to describe someone as a 'human being'. How moving, then, to discover that he needed us ordinary human beings to make his art just as much as we certainly need the extraordinary one who was Mark Rothko. I believe that one reason we need the `place' that did eventually get made in Tate Modern is that it goes so much against the grain of the contemporary fetish of Now. It's ironic, given how much fissile creative energy has been generated by contemporary British art, that when Rothko was looking for somewhere he might place the last series of nine Seagram murals, he settled on Britain as perhaps the place farthest from the commercial hustle and critical blood sports that animated its counterpart in New York. (And this was 1969!) But then Rothko had last visited England ten years before, and then his pilgrimage had been to the cosy art enclave of St Ives in Cornwall. But the fierce buzz of Tate Modern, of course, only makes the effect of its fade-out in the Rothko room, where the Seagram paintings have been reinstalled, the more complete. Whatever that room is about, it's certainly not Now. More like forever. This is a place where we come to sit –on the kind of bench Rothko specified, naturally – in the low light, and sense the aeons rolling by; where we can feel beckoned towards those hanging veils with their mysterious interior glimmer; or through the portals that seem to suggest both a vision of infinity and its unattainability. One of the words Rothko used most often about his art – but it could be extended to all art – is 'poignant', for the best of it is suffused both with a sense of the inevitable passing of things, including us, and with art's determination to trap, consolingly, those fugitive visions. It's impossible, then, to come to this room and not be touched by that poignancy: of our comings and goings, entrances and exits, womb, tomb and everything in between. Which only makes the discrepancy between writing and looking the more pitiful. One of the words that Mark Rothko used with greatest disdain was the dismissive word about words: 'verbiage'. If there is any commandment hanging in the place that he (with help from the Tate, but also from all of us) eventually made, it is, finally, to please shut up. So just for once I will.
