<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Along with the economic boom following the Great <u>[[#|Depression]]</u>, came a car culture where the travel patterns of men were privileged due to the role they had within their family. The 1990’s presented a pivotal shift in social roles when it came to both men and women.

Transport is a traditionally male-dominated sector<span class="underline">, both from the <u>[[#|employment]]</u> point of view and </span>for the values that are embedded<span class="underline"> (ECE, 2009). A recent report from the European Parliament (20061) referring to travel differences between women and men as European citizens and as users of the transport system stated: The study of </span>the data on gender differences in transport shows that “Normal” transport research and transport policies emerge to be androcentric.<span class="underline"> Men’s travel patterns are the ones which are represented in transport policy reports and decision making as “common” and seem to be its focus, in spite of significant gender differences, that are relevant to transport operations, management and decision making (European Parliament, 2006). Although transport planning is considered to be ―neutral, this paper has highlighted differences between women and men and suggests that </span>a gendered engineering approach to transport and infrastructure design is required<span class="underline">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">As Mashiri, Venter and Buiten (2006) suggest, infrastructure provision has until recently generally been dominated by a ―top-down‖ planning approach, concentrating on technical requirements and goals, as it is implicitly regarded as ―neutral‖ technological developments have, however, increasingly come into focus as technologically sound investments fail to achieve their intended goals. </span><span class="underline">Hamilton (2002) believes that </span>there are significant differences between women’s transport demands and experiences, <span class="underline">as opposed to those of men — </span>differences in access <span class="underline">to private transport, in </span>patterns<span class="underline"> of commuting and employment, in child-care and eldercare responsibilities, in basic </span>attitudes <span class="underline">to private and <u>[[#|public transport]]</u> — to justify treating women separately</span>.Recognizing all this makes transport policy more responsive<span class="underline"> to the needs of women and requires developing structured approaches to understand their needs, identify instruments to address those needs, analyze the costs and benefits of those instruments</span>, and establish an appropriate policy framework.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It also requires that women are represented at each step of the planning and design process of transport investments. Gender differences in time spent on travel and transport are visible from gender-disaggregated quantitative transport data: in Portugal, mobility patterns are closely linked to the definition of local labor markets and different social roles; in regions where interaction is greater, men travel outside their municipality of residence more often than women. This is associated with the use of individual transport and the relative increase in travel times. </span><span class="underline">There is now much greater awareness that </span>women are more dependent on public transport than men<span class="underline">. Women’s and men’s travel patterns vary greatly and different modes are used. As gender-disaggregated data on transportation becomes more available, evidence supporting general trends in gendered mobility patterns and needs is likely to be increasingly supplemented with regional differences.It is this awareness and careful documentation of regional peculiarities that is so essential for the development of local, gender-aware transport planning strategies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Also the particular balance among these will vary from country to country and area to area, and it is therefore essential for policy makers and transport operators to gather information locally in line with best gender balancing practice (Hamilton, 2002). For mobility patterns, women travel smaller distances for reasons of employment than men, use more public transport and walk more, and spend less time to perform the movements. The mobility patterns shown by both men and women are closely associated with the definition of employment areas, verifying that in regions where the interaction is greater, men go out more often, out of the county of residence than women, associating it with the use of private transport and the relative increase in travel times. However, in metropolitan areas the differences between men and women are fewer in terms of travels to outside the municipality or residence, as expected in a metropolitan functional area. In the Greater Lisbon, Greater Oporto and Setubal Peninsula, women use public transportation more often. Observing these NUTS we can see the biggest differences between men and women regarding the use of public transport, 12.0%, 11.8% and 12.5% respectively. Gender-sensitive transport strategies need to be developed and for a start, practical advances can be made by improving the quality of household and user surveys and by collecting all data in a sex-disaggregated manner. Meanwhile, these efforts should be complemented by comprehensive, regionally- and locally-targeted gender analyses and action plans for transportation. According to ECE (2009) all transport system development must be informed by the lived experience of women; governments should integrate experts on gender-sensitive transport system planning and decision-making in their planning structures. Design of transport services and transport schedule must incorporate women’s special needs. As Peters (2001) suggests, several generic interventions in the public transport sector, such as improved off-peak, noncommuter (decentralized) services, improved safety conditions in waiting areas, and more advance ticket sales, present themselves as obvious solutions for alleviating many problems of access and mobility for women. Many obstacles will require specifically targeted, local responses, however. Affordability remains a key issue</span><span class="underline">. </span>Policy-makers have a key role to play in the active mainstreaming of gender issues into all infrastructure sectors, with transport being one of the most important ones.<br />

<br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Status Quo transportation infrastructure privileges masculine norms and misrepresent what new studies are calling “the mobility of care” which makes public transportation more challenging for persons in traditionally feminine roles.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If we bothered to anthropomorphize the problems of public transit, we'd probably consider them equal-opportunity haters. Cars crowd, fares rise, service dwindles for one and all. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But it turns out </span>our public <u>[[#|transportation services]]</u> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">might </span>harbor a<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> bit of a </span>gender bias against women<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. That's the argument put forth by Gendered Innovations, a </span>Stanford University project devoted to gender analysis<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, in a new line of study called &quot;Transportation: Reconceptualizing Data Collection.&quot; By reexamining transportation data, the researchers at Gendered Innovations believe they've </span>uncovered evidence that women ride transit systems much more often than typical numbers suggest. The researchers contend that regular transit surveys obscure the number of trips caregivers<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (particularly parents or, more likely, mothers</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">) </span>take<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">; that serial trips, which women make more often than men, aren't sufficiently defined</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span><span class="underline">and that aggregated ridership figures</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, particularly by race, </span>create incomplete pictures of the riding public<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>These<span class="underline"> true </span>numbers<span class="underline">, the researchers conclude, </span>should encourage<span class="underline"> metro </span>transit systems to redesign facilities to accommodate the transport needs of women<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. First the hidden &quot;mobility of care.&quot; The gender gap may be closing when it comes to performing domestic or &quot;care&quot; work, but there's still enough space to park an SUV in there. Recent time-use surveys in Europe have found that </span>women spend much more time than men do on tasks related to child care each day.<span class="underline"> The situation is roughly the same in the United States. Of course a lot of this type of work is done outside the home: taking a child to soccer practice, running household errands, and what-not. </span>But traditional public transportation <u>[[#|surveys]]</u> don't do a great job of offering &quot;care work&quot; as a primary ridership category. As a result, the researchers contend, estimates of transit use fail to properly represent the significance of women riders who bear the bulk of the &quot;care&quot; load<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If data were reorganized to emphasize this &quot;mobility of care,&quot; a different picture would emerge, they argue: </span>The<span class="underline"> innovative </span>concept, &quot;mobility of care,&quot; captures significant travel patterns, and can be used to render public transportation more equitable and responsive to users’ needs<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<span class="TitleChar">Instead of addressing small-scale traffic problems, transportation planners offer complicated yet elegant technological solutions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="TitleChar">The construction of highways and rapid transit trains, which takes priority over the infrastructures of slow-moving traffic, does not correspond with the mobility needs of the majority of the population, but is instead a field for technicians and engineers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to earn their reputations. As I studied the publications that praised the construction of the transportation infrastructure in the Ruhr region, I was truly surprised by the enthusiasm with which these “daring” and “clever” men – technicians, engineers, and construction workers – were described (see Bauhardt 1995, p. 120 ff.). </span>Technology<span class="TitleChar">, in particular complicated but elegant technological solutions, </span>contributes to the reproduction of masculine stereotypes<span class="TitleChar">.

To achieve this, </span>one<span style="font-size: 8pt;">first</span>needs to understand the gendered organization of time and space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the urban setting. The most important traffic problems emerge in the organization of everyday life. Intelligent solutions are therefore more often found through organizational rather than technological means. </span>A strictly technical understanding tends to accelerate time and overcome space<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="TitleChar">Time and space are perceived as economic resources: acceleration aims to save time and overcome space, so that mobility becomes “as fast as possible and as far as possible.” </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The historical development of transportation infrastructure in the Ruhr region clearly demonstrates this. </span>Overcoming long distances with the fastest possible means of transportation has long been and still is understood as<span class="TitleChar"> an efficient way to organize transportation and as an </span>appropriate<span class="TitleChar"> means of measuring a population’s mobility</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Increasing the distances travelled was an explicit goal of the regional planning: “The future image of transportation in the Ruhr region will be very different from that of today. The new possibilities for transportation, in conjunction with the realization of regional planning goals, will lead to greater mobility for people, greater commuting distances, and ultimately to a new distribution among means of transportation” (SVR 1970, p.55). </span><span class="TitleChar">The new distribution of transportation means</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> brought about an increased use of private passenger cars, while </span><span class="TitleChar">environmentally friendly forms of mobility</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="TitleChar">in particular the number of pedestrian paths, were reduced</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Starting from the premise that mobility is a result of the relationship between distance and acceleration, the political concept of decentralized concentration (Siedlungsschwerpunktekonzept) comes to the following conclusion: “As a result of the considerably increased speed of transportation, the distances that will be travelled in the future will be on average much greater than they are today” (SVR 1970, p.56). </span><span class="TitleChar">In the daily organization of their lives, women combine through time and space the productive and reproductive spheres of life. Their model of mobility can be described as a combination of usually shorter trips or travel sequences</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>Such an integration of activities in time and space is the basis for a qualitative understanding of mobility, <em>which examines the reasons for the need to be mobile as opposed to the quantitative concept of mobility,</em><span class="TitleChar"> which merely calculates the amount of human tonnage that can be moved how far in how much time</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>A feminist perspective <span class="TitleChar">in transportation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> research and </span><span class="TitleChar">planning </span>perceives time and space less as economic resources than as social categories. This approach raises the issue of re-appropriating time and space as <em>prerequisites</em> for communication and <span class="TitleChar">an improvement in the </span><u>[[#|quality of life]]</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the city. In my opinion, </span><span class="TitleChar">these are </span>absolutely essential<span class="TitleChar"> conditions </span>for a sustainable <span class="TitleChar">planning of </span>urban development and transportation systems<span class="TitleChar">.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;">Much of </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">the current &quot;unmanageability&quot; of contemporary life</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"> in patriarchal societies, (d), </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">is</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"> then </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">viewed as a consequence of a patriarchal preoccupation with activities, events, and experiences that reflect historically male-gender</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"> identified beliefs, values, attitudes, and </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">assumptions.Included </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;">among these real-life consequences </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">are</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;">precisely those </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">concerns with nuclear proliferation, war, environmental destruction, and violence toward women,</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"> which many feminists see as </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">the logical outgrowth of patriarchal thinking.</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"> In fact, it is often </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">only through observing these dysfunctional behaviors </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;">-- the symptoms of dysfunctionality -- that </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">one can truly see that and how patriarchy serves to maintain and perpetuate them</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;">. When patriarchy is understood as a dysfunctional system, this &quot;unmanageability&quot; can be seen for what it is -- as a predictable and thus logical consequence of patriarchy. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">11The theme that global environmental crises, war, and violence generally are predictable and logical consequences of sexism and patriarchal culture</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;">is pervasive in ecofeminist literature (see Russell 1989 , 2). Ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak, for instance, argues that &quot;a militarism and warfare are continual features of a patriarchal society because they reflect and instill patriarchal values and fulfill needs of such a system. </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Acknowledging the context of patriarchal conceptualizations that feed militarism is a first step toward reducing their impact and preserving life on Earth&quot;</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"> ( Spretnak 1989 , 54). Stated in terms of the foregoing model of patriarchy as a dysfunctional social system, the claims by Spretnak and other feminists take on a clearer meaning: </span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Patriarchal conceptual frameworks legitimate impaired thinking</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;">(about women, national and regional conflict, the environment</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif; font-size: 11pt;">) which is manifested in behaviors which, if continued, will make life on earth difficult, if not impossible.</span><span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;"> It is a stark message, but it is plausible. Its plausibility ties in understanding the conceptual roots of various woman-nature-peace connections in regional, national, and global contexts.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Take, for instance, a recent transportation data set from Spain. &quot;Care&quot; tasks don't appear at all in the original figures. But when the researchers treated &quot;care&quot; as a distinct category on par with &quot;work,&quot; they found that a significant share of transit activity was related to these trips alone. With these adjusted figures, &quot;care&quot; accounted for 25 percent of all trips — second only to work, at 30 percent, and well ahead of the next highest category: It's not just general categorization that obscures gender-related transit data. The mere definition of a &quot;trip&quot; as a single journey also does the trick. A good bit of transportation data has found that people often travel in a cluster of trips that might also be called a &quot;trip-chain&quot; — stopping at a day care center on the way to work, for instance. In the United States women &quot;chain-trip&quot; much more than men do, according to Gendered Innovations. They make more side trips than men during their commute, for instance, often for the purpose of family errands. When both partners in a marriage work, women are twice as likely as men to trip-chain a child care task during their commute, and when the couple has a child under age 5, the amount of trip-chaining — and thus the transport burden on women — increases: [chart showing studies]... he </span><span class="underline">discoveries made by Gendered Innovations have a relevance beyond the abstract reorganization of numbers. </span>Once a transit system knows that &quot;care&quot; trips make up a sizable proportion of daily travel, it can improve its facilities to accommodate these users — replacing stairs with ramps, widening aisles or gates, and raising platforms to train level, for instance, to aid women with strollers and bags. A recognition of the practice of trip-chaining can help designers plan system extensions of transit lines into areas high in care-related sites, like schools and parks<span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Systems can also conduct what the researchers call &quot;gender audits&quot; to evaluate their ability to meet the transport needs of female riders.</span><br />

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Studies show that squo transportation infrastructure ignores a very important type of mobility- “the mobility of care.” We must recognize these in order for public transport to be balanced and fair.</span><br />

Researchers examining public transportation often categorize trips according to purpose in order to better understand existing transportation patterns and to better plan for infrastructure changes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration uses the following categories for public transit (U.S. FHA, 2009): -To/From Work -Work Related Business -Shopping -Other Family/Personal Errands -School/Church -Social and Recreational -Other </span>Categories used in transportation surveys—and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, hence, </span>the way statistics are gathered <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and analyzed—</span>may not <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">properly </span>account for caring work<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">—that is, </span>unpaid labor performed by adults for children or other dependents, including labor related to the upkeep of a household.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Gendered Innovation 1: Visualizing the Mobility of CareTime Use Surveys provide a perspective for evaluating transportation surveys.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Harmonised European Time Use Survey codes time use into forty-nine categories and provides sex-disaggregated data on time usage within fifteen countries</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. In Spain, </span>women spend more time than men performing the three explicit categories of childcare <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">coded in the Survey: Data for Spain is similar to data averaged across the EU; in the 15 countries surveyed, women performed an average of 32 minutes childcare per day, and men performed an average of 12 minutes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In all EU countries surveyed, women spent significantly more time performing childcare than men—from 1.7 times more in Sweden to 4.8 times more in Latvia</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>This pattern holds in the U.S. as well<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">—in 2010, the average U.S. woman spent 32 minutes caring for and helping children in her household, twice as much as the average U.S. man’s 16 minutes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011). It is important to recognize that men’s caring work has increased over time. For example, British fathers with children under age 5 spent an average of only 13 minutes on childcare in 1961; this increased to 120 minutes by 1999 (O’Brien et al., 2003). </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">That </span>women spend much more time than men performing caring work implies that consideration of caring work is key to gender equality in transportation<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">; many forms of caring work rely upon public transportation. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nés Sánchez de Madariaga’s </span>innovative concept, “mobility of care,” provides a perspective for “recognizing and revaluing care work”<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">—to appreciate the trips that women and men make when caring for others</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Sánchez de Madariaga, 2009).

The first chart (left) graphs transportation data as traditionally collected and reported. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It privileges paid employment by presenting it as a single, large category. Caring work</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (shown in red</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">) is divided into numerous small categories and hidden under other headings, such as escorting, shopping, leisure, etc. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The second chart (right) reconceptualizes public transportation trips by collecting care trips under one category. </span>Visualizing care trips in one dedicated category emphasizes the importance of caring work and allows transportation engineers to design systems that work well for all segments of the population<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, improve urban efficiency, and guard against global warming </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Sánchez de Madariaga, 2011). </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A number of innovations in transportation design have been implemented to support the mobility of care.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In London, for example, these include: -Step-free access to trains, subways, and busses.

The incorporation of a gender perspective in transportation sector in Sweden <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">began to take shape in 1994</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, when the Parliament adopted a national directive requiring that all committees and working groups include an analysis of how their proposals affect gender equality (Direktiv. 1994:124). The aim of this directive was to require the active mainstreaming of gender equality in all sectors of Swedish society. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Within the transportation sector, this </span>started within the overall process of designing a policy for a sustainable transportation system<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In preparation for this, one of the expert groups convened in 1996 dealt specifically with gender equality. The 1997 final background report on transportation policy, <em>A new course in transportation policy</em>, included a chapter on gender equality (SOU, 1997:35). </span>This<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">chapter</span> set the stage for gender mainstreaming within the sector by presenting differences in travel patterns between women and men and noting the lack of women in the decision-making process<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Ensuing from </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the 1998 governmental proposition, <em>Transport policy for sustainable development</em>, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">resulted in the 1999 appointment of an advisory council charged with collecting information and suggesting measures for attaining gender equality within the transportation sector</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Proposition 1997/98:56). This council was called the Gender Equality Council for Transport and IT. The Gender Equality Council presented their final report, <em>Gender equality—transportation and IT</em>, in June 2001 (SOU, 2001:144). The Gender Equality Council’s 2001 report is a broad analysis that presents a history of gender equality, a vision for the future, methods for gender mainstreaming, and a summary of the laws and regulations that influence, or could be used to influence, gender equality (ibid). </span>A clear connection is made between the goals of gender equality and sustainable development, especially regarding equal representation and participation in societal decision-making.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> A great deal of attention is also given to governmental measures that can be used to ensure gender mainstreaming, such as the use of socioeconomic modelling, public bidding, and requiring the companies that receive conracts from the state actively promote gender inequality (ibid).</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In this article, I explore the discursive constitution of concepts of (gender) violence and (international) security in particular texts. However, </span>this research is explicitly not ‘merely theoretical’<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, or ‘academic’ in the pejorative sense of the term</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.8 My interest in the concepts of international security and gender violence is indeed motivated by a desire to see whether these concepts could be fruitfully reconceived, but </span>the article <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">also </span>considers the implications of this reconceptualisation for policy <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and academic work. I wish to provide for those undertaking such work alternative concepts with which to proceed. I identify myself as a feminist researcher, and recognise that this entails a curiosity about ‘the concept, nature and practice of gender’ (Zalewski 1995, 341). This </span>curiosity questions the ways in which gender is made meaningful in social/political interactions and the practices<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—or performances—</span>through which gender configures boundaries of subjectivity. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">I espouse a </span>feminism <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that </span>seeks to challenge conventional constructions of gendered subjectivity and political community<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while acknowledging the intellectual heritage of feminisms that seek to claim rights on behalf of a stable subject and maintain fidelity to a regime of truth that constitutes the universal category of ‘women’ (Butler 2004, 8–11). </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While a feminist project that does not assume a stable ontology of gender may seem problematic</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, I argue, along with Judith Butler, that </span>‘[t]he deconstruction of identity is not the deconstruction of politics; rather, it establishes as political the very terms through which identity is articulated<u>’</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Butler 1999, 189). </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A focus on articulation entails a further commitment to the analytical centrality of language—or, as I see it, discourse</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Elizabeth Grosz argues </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that an integral part of feminist theory is the willingness to ‘tackle the question of the language available for theoretical purposes and the constraints it places on what can be said’ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Grosz 1987, 479). To me, this aspect of feminist theory is definitive of my feminist politics. If ‘men and women are the stories that have been told about “men” and “women” ’ (Sylvester 1994, 4), and the way that ‘men’ and ‘women’ both act and are acted upon, then </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the language used to tell those stories and describe those actions is not just worthy of analytical attention but can form the basis of an engaged critique. Furthermore, </span>an approach that recognizes that there is more to the discursive constitution of gender<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—the stories that are told about ‘men’ and ‘women’—</span>than linguistic practices can enable thinking gender differently.<br />

<span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;">The devaluation of human beings because of patriarchy makes racism, classism, and other forms of oppression inevitable</span><br />

<span class="TitleChar">Part of struggling against nuclear weapons involves understanding the ways in which the oppression of particular groups of people supports militarism, makes the institutionalized system of war and violence appear &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;inevitable</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; For instance, heterosexism, or the assumption that sexual relations are only permissible, desirable, and normal between opposite sexes, justifies a system of rigid sex roles, in which men and women are expected to behave and look in particular ways, and in which qualities attributed to women are devalued. Thus, men who are not willing to be violent are not virile -- they are threatened with the real sanctions placed on homosexuality (physical violence, housing and economic discrimination) unless they behave like &quot;real men.&quot; </span>The military relies upon homophobia<span class="TitleChar"> (the fear of homosexuality) </span>to provide it with<span class="TitleChar"> willing </span>enlistees, with soldiers who are trained to kill others to prove their masculinity. Sexism, or the systematic devaluation of women, is clearly related to this<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Women have traditionally opposed war because women bear the next generation and feel a responsiblity to protect it. But feminists are not content to speak only from traditional roles as mothers and nurturers. </span><span class="TitleChar">Many activists see a feminist analysis as crucial to effectively challenging militarism</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="TitleChar">The system of patriarchy, under which men benefit from the oppression of women, supports and thrives on war</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In a sexist or patriarchal society, women are relegated to limited roles and valued primarily for their sexual and reproductive functions, while men are seen as the central makers of culture, the primary actors in history. Patriarchy is enforced by the language and images of our culture; by keeping women in the lowest paying and lowest status jobs, and by violence against women in the home and on the streets. Women are portrayed by the media as objects to be violated; 50% of women are battered by men in their lives, 75% are sexually assaulted. </span>The sexist splitting of humanity which turns women into others, lesser beings<span class="TitleChar"> whose purpose is to serve men, </span>is the same split which allows us to see our enemies as non-human<span class="TitleChar">, fair game for any means of destruction or cruelty</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In war, the victors frequently rape the women of the conquered peoples. </span><span class="TitleChar">Our country's foreign policy often seems directed by teenage boys desparately trying to live up to stereotypes of male toughness, with no regard for the humanity or land of their &quot;enemy.&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Men are socialized to repress emotions, to ignore their needs to nurture and cherish other people and the earth. Emotions, tender feelings, care for the living, and for those to come are not seen as appropriate concerns of public policy. This makes it possible for policymakers to conceive of nuclear war as &quot;winnable.&quot; </span>Similarly, racism, or the institutionalized devaluation of darker peoples, supports both the idea and the practice of the military and the production of<span class="TitleChar"> nuclear </span>weapons<span class="TitleChar">. Racism operates as a system of divide and conquer. It helps to perpetuate a system in which some people consistently are &quot;haves&quot; and others are &quot;have nots.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; Racism tries to make white people forget that all people need and are entitled to self-determination, good health care, and challenging work. </span><span class="TitleChar">Racism limits our horizons to what presently exists; it makes us suppose that current injustices are &quot;natural,&quot; or it makes those injustices invisible. For example, most of the uranium used in making nuclear weapons is mined under incredibly hazardous conditions by people of color: Native Americans and black South Africans. Similarly, most radioactive and hazardous waste dumps are located on lands owned or occupied by people of color</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="TitleChar">If all those people suffering right now from exposure to nuclear materials were white, would nuclear production remain acceptable to the white-dominated power structure? Racism also underlies the concept of &quot;national security&quot;: that the U.S. must protect its &quot;interests&quot; in Third World countries through the exercise of military force and economic manipulation. In this world-view, the darker peoples of the world are incapable of managing their own affairs and do not have the right to self-determination</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Their struggles to democratize their countries and become independent of U.S. military and economic institutions are portrayed as &quot;fanatic,&quot; &quot;terrorist,&quot; or &quot;Communist.&quot; </span>The greatest danger<span class="TitleChar"> of nuclear war </span>today lies in the likelihood of superpower intervention in Third World countries, fueled by government appeals to nationalistic and racist interests<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. All forms of discrimination are interrelated with economic discrimination, or classism. Classism justifies a system in which competition is the norm, and profit is believed to be a universal motivation. Thus, poor and working class people lack access to education, leisure time and frequently basic things like food and shelter. But a classist society blames them for their poverty, or devalues their particular way of living. Classism values certain kinds of work over others, and sets up a system of unequal rewards. Our society threatens the majority of our members with economic insecurity, forcing us to accept things the way they are for fear of losing the few things we've gained through hard work. Since most poor people are women, children and people of color, classism and other forms of discrimination work together to hide the injustice of our economic system. Poor and working class people feel the effects of the military directly, profoundly, and brutally. Vital social services have been cut to feed the Pentagon. Inflation, aggravated by the military budget, chews away at what is left after disproportionately high taxes are deducted from our pay. Poor people are prime military recruits, with historically little access to draft deferments or information about conscientious objection, forced by unemployment to think of the military as a &quot;career opportunity.&quot; Our militarized society does not support cooperative and socially productive work, but counts on unequal competition and economic deprivation to provide workers in defense industries, miners in uranium mines, and soldiers in the armed forces. No human being is born with discriminatory attitudes and beliefs. Physical and cultural attitudes are not the causes of oppression; these differences are used to justify oppression. Racist, classist, sexist, heterosexist, and all other forms of discriminatory attitudes are a mixture of misinformation and ignorance which have to be imposed on young people through a painful process of social conditioning. These processes are left unchallenged partially because people feel powerless to do anything about them. </span><span class="TitleChar">But the situation is not hopeless. People can grow and change. Many successful struggles have taken place against structures of exploitation and discrimination. We are not condemned to repeat the past. Discriminatory condition ning can be analyzed and unlearned. All people come from traditions which have a history of resistance to injustice, and every person has their own individual history of resistance to discriminatory conditioning. This history needs to be recalled and celebrated, and people need to listen to and learn from other people's histories. When people act from a sense of informed pride in themselves and their own traditions, they will be more effective in all struggles for justice and peace.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Women are the victims of widespread personal and systemic violence, the true scope and gender-specific nature of which emergy clearly when all types of violence are set in context in a collection such as this one. </span><span class="underline">The sweep of violence—over or subtle—is striking: </span>common in North America<span style="font-size: 8pt;">and elsewhere </span>are sexual assault and rape, wife battering, sexual harassment,<span style="font-size: 8pt;">prostitution, sadistic pornography, and sexual exploitation by medical personnel. Cultures beyond these shores add their own forms of violence such as dowry death and female genital mutilation as well as the disproportionate abortion of female fetuses and systematic neglect of girl children. Only recently have philosophers begun to inquire into violence against women. Yet it is striking that such an important social phenomenon did not capture philosophical attention long ago. </span><span class="underline">It cries out for conceptual analysis</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: what do we mean by “violence”, and what can we conclude about the special forms of violence directed toward women? Moreover, </span>such violence is precisely the sort of issue that ethics, political philosophy, and philosophy of law deal with<span class="underline">; so </span>how can there be<span style="font-size: 8pt;">an elaborate historical </span>discourse on<span class="underline"> just </span>war theory and no theory of rape or wife beating<span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Despite their impact on women’s lives</span><strong><u>, such practices have simply been part of the backdrop, unnoticed <span class="underline">and certainly not treated as fit subjects for serious theorizing</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. According to former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, </span>domestic violence is the top problem for American women, causing more inujuries than automobile accidents, muggings, and rapes combined<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. According to a U.S. Justice Department study, nearly 700,000 victims of violence or suspected violence treated in hospital emergency rooms in 1994 were hurt by someone they knew. Of these approximately 243,000 (or 34 percent) were injured by someone they knew intimately—a current of former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend. Of these, 203,000 (over 80 percent) were women. </span><span class="underline">One of the distinctive characteristics of violence directed toward women is that it tends, unlike violence toward men, to come from those they know (Blodgett-Ford, 1993: 510). That </span>it is rooted in asymmetrical assumptions about the nature of the two sexes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">is illustrated by the belated recognition of marital rape as a crime in most states. (Some, like Oklahoma and North Carolina, still fail to recognize it as such [Down, 1992: 569].) Sexist assumptions clearly play a role, too, in the massive exploitation of women as prostitutes. The consequences for these women may be dire, especially when, as in India, a majority are indentured slaves, many of whom are doomed to die of AIDS (Friedman, 1996: 12). The specifically sexual element in gender relations comes to the fore in pornography, especially sadistic pornography. Both the production of such materials and their </span>disproportionate consumption by males reinforce and promote the attitudes toward women that fuel the practices discussed<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> here. Such attitudes become especially apparent in war, when rape is used as a weapon against the enemy. </span><br />

Our obligation is to make the state ethical – the state is inevitable and the alternative to state ethics is the destruction of the other<br />

<br />
<strong><u>Since ‘it is impossible to escape the State</u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">’</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, 70 </span></strong><strong><u>Levinas insists that the state be made as ethical as possible.

Alongside the an-archical responsibility for the Other </span><strong><u>there is a place for the realm of the said, which includes</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> ontology, justice and </span><strong><u>politics</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Levinas’ thought is not apolitical as many have charged. </span><strong><u>His harsh critiques of the political realm refer to a politics unchecked by ethics</u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">For example, in Totality and Inﬁnity, </span><strong><u>Levinas</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>sees politics as antithetical to an ethics based on the Other</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. ‘The art of foreseeing war and winning it by every means – politics – is henceforth enjoined as the very exercise of reason. Politics is opposed to morality, as philosophy to naïveté.’ 71 </span><strong><u>Politics unrestrained</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, by necessity, </span><strong><u>totalizes the Other by reducing him or her to abstract categories</u></strong><u>.</u> <strong><u>Levinas will call for a politics that is founded on ethics and not on ontology. The state must be answerable to the an-archical relationship with the Other, it must strive to maintain the exteriority of the Other</u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Levinasian heteronomic political thought oscillates between the saying and the said, an-archy and justice, ethics and politics. The liberal state is the concrete manifestation of this oscillation. Levinas calls for a balance between the Greek and the Judaic traditions. </span><strong><u>Neither tradition should dominate</u></strong><u>.</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> The fundamental contradiction of our situation (and perhaps of our condition) . . . that both the hierarchy taught by Athens and the abstract and slightly anarchical ethical individualism taught by Jerusalem are simultaneously necessary in order to suppress the violence.<strong>0020</strong></span><strong><u>Each of these principles, left to itself, only hastens the contrary of what it wants to secure.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Ideas about gender shape, limit and distort professional and political discourses about WMD We start with a true story, told to Dr. Cohn by a member of a group of nuclear strategists, a white male physicist: &quot;Several colleagues and I were working on modelling counterforce nuclear attacks, trying to get realistic estimates of the number of immediate fatalities that would result from different deployments. At one point, we re-modelled a particular attack, using slightly different assumptions, and found that instead of there being 36 million immediate fatalities, there would only be 30 million. And everybody was sitting around nodding, saying, 'Oh yeh, that's great, only 30 million,' when all of a sudden, I heard what we were saying. And I blurted out, 'Wait, I've just heard how we're talking - Only 30 million! Only 30 million human beings killed instantly?' Silence fell upon the room. Nobody said a word. They didn't even look at me. It was awful. I felt like a woman.&quot; The physicist added that henceforth he was careful never to blurt out anything like that again. Why did he feel that way? First, he was transgressing a code of professional conduct. Expressing concern about human bodies is not the way you talk within the terms of the strategic expert discourse, which is, after all, a discourse about weapons and their relation to each other, not to human bodies. But even worse than that, he evinced some of the characteristics on the &quot;female&quot; side of the dichotomies - in his &quot;blurting</span><span class="TitleChar">&quot; </span>he was being impulsive, uncontrolled, emotional, concrete, upset and attentive to fragile human bodies.<span class="TitleChar"> Thus, </span>the hegemonic discourse of gender positioned him as feminine, which he found<span class="TitleChar"> doubly </span>threatening<span class="TitleChar">. It was not only a threat to his own sense of self as masculine, his gender identity; it also positioned him in the devalued or subordinate position in the discourse. Thus, both his statement, &quot;I felt like a woman,&quot; and his subsequent silence in that and other settings, are completely understandable. To find the strength of character and courage to transgress the strictures of both professional and gender codes and to associate yourself with a lower status is very difficult.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This story is not simply about one individual, his feelings and actions; it illustrates the role and meaning of gender discourse in the defence community. </span>The impact of gender discourse<span class="TitleChar"> in that room</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">(and countless others like it) </span>is that some things are excluded and get left out from professional deliberations.Certain ideas, concerns, interests, information<span class="TitleChar">, feelings and meanings </span>are marked in national security discourse as feminine, and devalued.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They are therefore very difficult to speak, as exemplified by the physicist who blurted them out and wished he hadn't. And if they manage to be said, they are also very difficult to hear, to take in and work with seriously. For the others in the room, the way in which the physicist's comments were marked as feminine and devalued served to delegitimate them; it also made it very unlikely that any of his colleagues would find the courage to agree with him. This example should not be dismissed as just the product of the idiosyncratic personal composition of that particular room</span><span class="TitleChar">; it is replicated many times and in many places</span><span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Women, in professional and military settings, have related experiences of realising that something terribly important is being left out but feeling constrained, as if there is almost a physical barrier preventing them from pushing their transgressive truths out into the open. What is it that cannot be spoken? First, any expression of an emotional awareness of the desperate human reality behind the sanitised abstractions of death and destruction in strategic deliberations. Similarly, weapons' effects may only be spoken of in the most clinical and abstract terms, and usually only by those deemed to have the appropriate professional qualifications and expertise. </span>What gets left out, then, is the emotional, the concrete, the particular, human bodies and their vulnerability, human lives and their subjectivity<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - all of which are marked as feminine in the binary dichotomies of gender discourse. In other words, </span><span class="TitleChar">gender discourse informs and shapes nuclear and national security discourse, and in so doing creates silences and absences</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It keeps things out of the room, unsaid, and keeps them ignored if they manage to get in. As such, </span>it degrades our ability to think well <span class="TitleChar">and fully about nuclear weapons and national security</span>, and <span class="TitleChar">so </span>shapes <span class="TitleChar">and </span>limits the possible outcomes of our deliberations<span class="TitleChar">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">With this understanding, it becomes obvious that defence intellectuals' standards of what constitutes &quot;good thinking&quot; about weapons and security have not simply evolved out of trial and error; it is not that the history of nuclear discourse has been filled with exploration of other ideas, concerns, interests, information, questions, feelings, meanings and stances which were then found to create distorted or poor thought. On the contrary, serious consideration of a whole range of ideas and options has been preempted by their gender coding, and by the feelings evoked by living up to or transgressing normative gender ideals. To borrow a strategists' term, we can say that </span><span class="TitleChar">gender coding serves as a &quot;preemptive deterrent&quot; to certain kinds of thought about the effects and consequences of strategic plans and WMD.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Consequently, also social </span>scientists<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> apply the scientific characteristics of objectivity, value-freedom, rationality and quantifiability to social life. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In this way</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, they </span>assume they can unveil universal laws about social relations, which will lead to true knowledge<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Based on this</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, connect </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">social policies can be formulated. Thus, </span>social processes are excluded, while scientific objective facts are included<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Society is assumed a static entity, where no changes are possible. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">By promoting a permanent character, </span>social science legitimizes the existing social order, while obscuring the relations of domination and subordination<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, which is keeping</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">existing power relations inaccessible to analysis. The frozen order also makes it impossible to develop alternative explanations about social reality. It </span>prevents<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> a </span>historical and political understanding of reality<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and denies the possibility for social transformation by human agency. The prevailing condition is seen as </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">an </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">unavoidable</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> fact. </span>This implies that human beings are passive and that domination is a natural force,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> for which no one is responsible. This permits the state</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> freely </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">toimplement laws and policies, which are controlling and coercive. These are seen as being correct, because they are based on scientific facts made by scientific expense. One result is that the state</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, without consulting the public</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span>engages in<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a pathological </span>pursuit<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of economic growth. Governments support the capitalist ideology, </span>which benefits the elite only, while<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> it is </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">destroying nature and </span>increasing poverty for women and lower classes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The priority on capitalism also determines other social policies. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There are </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">consequently </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">no considerations for a possible conflict between the aims of the government for social control and economic efficiency and the welfare needs of various social groups. Without having an alternative to the existing order, </span>people become dis-empowered<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ultimately, the reaction is public apathy, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">which legitimizes authoritive governments</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Thus, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">social science is an ideology, which is affinning the prevailing social, political and economic order.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Reitzes 1993: 36-39, 4|-42). In reality, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is a contradiction to apply the scientific method to social policy making. Any social policy change will alter social relations and affect the relative welfare of classes of people, which makes social decision making nonnative.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Social policy is related to politics, which is an extension of ethics. Since values and facts are different categories, one cannot apply indisputable empirical facts to social values. It is therefore impossible to legitimize political decisions with reference to scientific knowledge. Social decision-making is a political process. When science is applied to political and nonnative questions, it becomes an ideology, which supports the dominant interests. Thus, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the state reproduces conditions for domination</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In case the contradictions become too pronounced, and the power of the state is challenged, then the ideology becomes violent. The consequence is totalitarianism. It is a situation where the state sets limits to what is pennissdale to think and teach, if necessary by coercion. Conclusively social science manipulates reality to serve the vested interests of specific social groups. 'Hue result is a dominant and violent ideology masked as science.

<span style="font-family: Cambria,serif;">Gender should be included as a focal part of policy debates</span><br />

<strong><u>Gender is therefore an important component of the way in which issues are framed in policy debates</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Policy-making can be construed as a set of arguments among policy actors about what problems deserve attention, how those problems are defined and what the solutions are (John 1998; Mazur 2002). In this conflict of ideas only a few issues are taken up for action. The problem for women's advocates therefore is twofold: first, they must gain attention for their issues and the ideas they promote, and second, they must ensure that the problem is defined in terms that are compatible with movement goals. </span><strong><u>The public definition of a problem isamongst other things a frame that affects how an issue is considered and treated. Paradoxically gender issues are often framed in gender-blind terms. Historically the gendering of debates about political representation has 'been 'invisible', built on the unspoken assumption that the political actor</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(the voter, the citizen</span><strong><u>) is male.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Feminist theorists have unmasked this convention (Pateman 1988; Lister 1997) pointing out not only that women are citizens, voters and activists, but also that women in traditional gender roles have made possible the functioning and dominance of the male political actor. </span><strong><u>Historically, when issues of political representation were discussed, traditional gendering went unnoticed until the suffrage movements claimed votes for women.</u></strong><br />

While problems with auto hegemony have only recently surfaced in wealthy nations, poor nations are<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> evidently </span>experiencing immediate drawbacks<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. In describing this trend in the worldwide proliferation of the automobile</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif; font-size: 8pt;">, Peter Freund and George Martin explain </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">several reasons why </span>poor nations have “[faced] challenges in<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> their </span>attempts to adopt<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the </span>automobile culture<span style="font-family: Times,serif; font-size: 8pt;">” (226). Adopting fellow sociologist Dr. Wolfgang Sach’s terminology, Freund and Martin refer to the </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">first world countries as the global “north,” the location of the majority of industrialized nations, and third world countries as the global “south,” where most of the developing nations are located (227). </span><span style="font-family: Times,serif; font-size: 8pt;">In the south, </span>the car culture has only spread to a minority population consisting of the elite and middle class<span style="font-family: Times,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (Freund and Martin 229). Because only a small percentage of people in the global south are car owners, there is still diversity in transportation choice (Freund and Martin 229). </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Many of the southern nations are “relatively poor and debt-laden,” which makes auto transport costs less socially constructive because it drains scarce public resources</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (Freund and Martin 229-30). However, because the elite minority has the most political influence, chances are that these costs will continue to rise as the facilities needed to maintain efficient use of the automobile will most likely continue to expand at their request. South Africa serves as a viable case study. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As a result of extreme dissonance between wealth and poverty, South Africa has one of the worst traffic safety records in the world</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (Freund and Martin 232). </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The few luxury cars that are on the road are mixed in with “overcrowded trucks (used as buses), donkey carts, cows, and pedestrians to produce a deadly combination”</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (Donald McNeil qtd. in Freund and Martin 232). Freund and Martin observe that “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">black townships do not have sidewalks, adequate lighting, or pedestrian overpasses on the roads through which affluent-owned high-powered vehicles race” </span><span style="font-family: Times,serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Freund and Martin 232). </span>The residual impact of Apartheid is evident in the fact that “one out of two white South Africans owns a car [while] only one of 100 blacks do”<span style="font-family: Times,serif; font-size: 8pt;">(John Griffin qtd. in Freund and Martin 232). </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In many cities in China, along with Bombay, Jakarta, and Calcutta, </span>rickshaws are<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> starting to be </span>viewed negatively<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> because they are seen as “archaic” and impede the flow of auto traffic, </span>and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> therefore </span>have been banned<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> from the streets in several cases</span><span style="font-family: Times,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (Freund and Martin 233).

The authors also note that arable land is in scarce supply in the global south more so than those in the north (Freund and Martin 231). As Robert Smith observes, China has four times the population of the U.S. living on about the same amount of land area (qtd. in Freund and Martin 231). A large proportion of the country is either desert or mountains, so “its population is crammed into dense concentrations around river valleys” (Smith qtd. in Freund and Martin 231). As a result, China must feed its population, which makes up one-fifth of the world’s population, on less than one-fifteenth of its arable (Smith qtd. in Freund and Martin 231). Meanwhile, other southern countries such as Egypt, Bangladesh, and Indonesia face the same situation (Lester Brown qtd. in Freund and Martin 231). For Freund and Martin, this situation in the developing world begs the question, “does it make sense for [these countries] to pave over arable land or land usable for dwelling spaces?” (231). </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is evident that </span>the same inequality that exists in the U<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">tates </span>due to auto hegemony is spreading on to a global scalevia<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the ever-increasing presence of </span>the global capitalistic economy.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> However, </span>if the U<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nited </span>S<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">tates can </span>set a better example for establishing a more diversified repertoire of transportation choices, then<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> hopefully </span>developing countries<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, such as China, </span>will follow this example rather than continuing down the more conventional but hazardous path toward auto hegemony.<br />

One is Hip or one is Square (the alternative which each new generation coming into American life is beginning to feel) one is a rebel or one conforms, one is a frontiersman in the Wild West of American night life, or else a Square cell … doomed willy-nilly to conform if one is to succeed.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">That sounds weird to hear you say..</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">Yeah, I’ve never admitted that I was before. So many other hipsters are so much more ‘hipster’ than I am. They’re the ones described in news articles — with the mustaches, and the ill-fitting shorts, the home-brewing, trombone playing, annoying uber Williamsburg attitudes. I’m not like those hipsters, but I am a hipster. Hah I am falling into the trap of irony huh, speaking about my hipsterism.

<br />

I do not write for the New York Times, a publication that jumped on the lets-kick-hipsters-in-the-nuts bandwagon about 5 years ago because of this new “I think I’m so cool wearing knock-off jeans from a thrift shop and designer underwear underneath” type of hipster. I wish I wrote for them, but I don’t. The world isn’t clamoring for my opinion, so I turn inward for inspiration. I have found that if I speak to my own self-consciousness in debate I gain listeners. I also gain attention and gain opportunity. Those are important things for a fledgling writer. It’s a powerful moment for me to realize that I can build my own audience.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">What’s substantial? What about the sub – trancial? The neuromancial content dream created from a missing piece spat back out of a chokin’ person’s mouth, but things are headin’ south not looking up, we’re not thinking enough, need more depth to our breadth, more soul to our spreading, more here-and-now careful thought of where we’re heading and the message that we’re sending in a bottle is a question and a suggestion for a new way of knowing: what direction is our scholar ship really truly going? </span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">Well, we don’t really know but what we do know, is that we affirm the possibility of road trips. Our concept of driving infinitely along the highway reimagines investment as creating different ways of using infrastructure as it exists now. Travel and transportation are cool and contain vast spiritual and philosophical potential to displace power. As the beatniks ran away from society, we run away from debate norms. The deconstruction of the resolution through poetry is a road trip within debate itself.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">The topic demands outsiders and we have volunteered: the road trip is a rhizomatic or nomadic performance of thought. Our aff is an attempt to create smooth space for alternative possibilities, and our friend Jack seems to think so too!!!</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: #181818; font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10.5pt;">“the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.”</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: #181818; font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10.5pt;">Are we trees or rhizomes? Seems like a dualism, and I’m not sure I like that a whole lot, but then again paradoxes are pretty cool. What exactly is transportation? Is it physical, moving, structural? What about mental voyages? To think is to voyage…smooth space, striated space, outer space, empty space… infrastructure doesn’t determine where we go, we determine where it goes.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: #181818; font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10.5pt;">Mufasa taught me a good lesson about fearing death, but more on that later. The real importance of that movie was Simba getting over his fear of fun, our friend Mr. Bayat says that, “fear of fun, is…about the fear of exit from the paradigm that frames and upholds the mastery of certain types of moral and political authorities.” And the “departure from within this discursive space amounts to a challenge to those in authority.” He is a pretty smart guy and pretty much came to the same conclusion as Timon and Pumba—you gotta have a little fun if you wanna take down Scar. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">Sometimes I feel like I’m not really serious enough, you know?

<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">Woah woah woah! Back up, hold up, stack up your old tubs and wait a minute so I can get my head back in it </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">I’m Resolved! You’re Resolved! We’re all resolved to lack resolve, purpose, passion, and <u>[[#|play]]</u>, do you get what I’m sayin’? cuz I’m not playin’ but you can see that I am, and I’m deconstructing language as fast as I can</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">It’s transportation that governs us, weakens us, smothers </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">us with federal pathways and feral roads built in our minds that tell us where to go and it’s a damn crying shame that it’s not the reverse so we all just sit around and re-rehearse and reperform the same forms and norms we’ve always known</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">it Invests</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Courier;"> us with tests and blesses us with boringness </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">It infrallystructures and strictures us, pictures us in circles and circulates nothing </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">The “United” states a statement makes a pretty picture on the pavement of money, state, family, fate, death, fear, destruction, tears, extinction of our true selves in the pitiful state of statehood, vor realio? </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">What’s substantial? What about the sub – trancial? The neuromancial content dream created from a missing piece spat back out of a chokin’ person’s mouth, but things are headin’ south not looking up, we’re not thinking enough, need more depth to our breadth, more soul to our spreading, more here-and-now careful thought of where we’re heading and the message that we’re sending in a bottle is a question and a suggestion for a new way of knowing: what direction is our scholar ship really truly going? </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">And so… </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">We affirm the possibility of road trips. Our concept of driving infinitely along the highway reimagines investment as creating different ways of using infrastructure as it exists now. Travel and transportation are cool and contain vast spiritual and philosophical potential to displace power. As the beatniks ran away from society, we run away from debate norms. The deconstruction of the resolution through poetry is a road trip within debate itself.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">The deconstructive and playful methodology of the Beat generation is really groovy and you should vote for it – in an age of too much control, revolution is simply a question without an answer</span></strong><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">His</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>description</u></strong>, </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">in Part Four of <em>On the Road</em>, of the last journey to Mexico, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">r</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">e<strong><u>minds of the process of simulation as described by Deleuze and Guattari</u></strong>: &quot;<strong><u>Simulation</u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">does not replace reality. but rather </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">appropriates reality in the operation of despotic overcoding, it produces reality on the new full body that replaces the earth</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">.</span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;"> It expresses the appropriation and production of the real by a quasi-cause&quot; (210). For Sal and Dean, as for other &quot;old American outlaws who used to skip over the border and go down to old Monterrey,&quot; the &quot;fellah&quot; Mexico represents before crossing the border something like a &quot;Holy Lhasa,&quot; a mythical presence. &quot;We had no idea what Mexico would really be like,&quot; says Sal-the narrator but &quot;everything changed when we crossed the mysterious bridge over the river&quot; (<em>OTR,</em> 224). In many ways, their visit is supposed to be a way out of everything modern America stood for: &quot;Now, Sal,&quot; says Dean, &quot;we're leaving everything behind us and entering a new and unknown phase of things&quot; and he adds, &quot;'It's the world,' [.] 'My God!' he cried slapping the wheel. 'It's the world!... Think of it! Son-of-a-<em>bitch</em>! Gawd-<em>damn</em>!&quot; (226). But </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">this world is no more &quot;real&quot; than the one left behind</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">.</span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">Sal's sense of the Mexicans' being out of history, an echo of Spengler's view of &quot;primitive&quot; fellahs, could be the quasi-cause that abstracts from the bodies and things and events mentioned a &quot;transcendental plane of ideal identities&quot; (Massumi) and relocates everything at a different level. The &quot;mysterious bridge&quot; signals the entry into &quot;a new and unknown phase of things,&quot; where, among others, in a drug-induced episode, Sal rejoices in the mere presence of their Mexican friends whose language they do not understand but consider &quot;magnificent:&quot; For a mad moment I thought Dean was understanding everything [Victor] said by sheer wild insight and sudden revelatory genius inconceivably inspired by his glowing happiness. In that moment, too, he looked so exactly like Franklin Delano Roosevelt - some delusion in my flaming eyes and floating brain - that I drew up in my seat and gasped with amazement. In myriad pricklings of heavenly radiation I had to struggle to see Dean's figure, and he looked like God. [.] The mere thought of looking out the window at Mexico - which was now something else in my mind - was like recoiling from some gloriously riddled glittering treasure-box that you're afraid to look at because of your eyes, they bend inward, the riches and the treasures are too much to take all at once. .&quot; (<em>OTR,</em> 233) The apparently solemn spiritual dimension of the above scene whereby Dean looks &quot;like God&quot; is rendered derisive by the previous reference to Roosevelt and the narrator's ironic remark. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">The powerful deterritorializing effect of the drug engenders a zig-zag movement at various speeds, &quot;a whole rhizomatic labor of perception, the moment when desire and perception meld,</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">&quot; </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">as Deleuze and Guattari suggest in <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em> (284). &quot;All drugs fundamentally concern speeds, and modifications of speed,&quot; they add, and Sal goes on, </span><span style="font-family: Courier;">&quot;<strong><u>For a long time I lost consciousness in my lower mind of what we were doing</u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; says the narrator in recall, &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">and only came around sometime later when I looked up from fire and silence, like waking from sleep to the world, or waking from void to a dream, and they told me we were parked outside Victor's house</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">[.]&quot; (<em>OTR</em>, 234). </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">Deleuze and Guattari's have commented on the specific nature of Anglo-American writers' effort to &quot;break to the wall of the signifier:&quot;</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;"> From Hardy to Lawrence, from Melville to Miller, the same cry rings out: </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">Go across, get Out, break through, make a beeline, don't get stuck on a point. Find the line of separation, follow it or create it, to the point of treachery.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">That is why their relationship with other civilizations, to the Orient or South America, and also to drugs and voyages in place, is entirely different from that of the French. They know how difficult is to get out of the black hole of subjectivity, of consciousness and memory [.] (188) </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">Restless movement and speed compress time and give space a predominant role in <em>On the Road</em></span></u></strong><strong><em><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">. </span></u></em></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">There is simply no connection between men and time,&quot; wrote Kerouac in a 1949 diary entry, &quot;men are only involved in space and place&quot; (Brinkley, 230). In this respect, as many researchers have attested, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">Kerouac can be said to travel back and forth between</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">what Deleuze and Guattari call </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">the centered system of Western tree and the acentered rhizome system</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">described in <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">Space is central to Deleuze and Guattari. As compared to the centered system of Western tree, the acentered rhizome system is described as being made of plateaus</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">(a term drawn from Gregory Bateson) </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">that are &quot;always in the middle&quot; and of being &quot;composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion&quot;</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;"> (</span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 9pt;">Deleuze and Guattari, 21<strong><u>).</u></strong> </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">It is also presented as a being a multiple, circular system of &quot;taproots&quot;</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">(5). In spite of its not being &quot;immune from domination by trees or the search for roots&quot; (see, for example, the Americans' quest for national identity or Kerouac in search for his Breton ancestors), </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">&quot;everything important that has happened or is happening takes the route of the American rhizome: the beatniks, the underground, bands and gangs, successive lateral offshoots in immediate connection with an outside&quot;</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">(20). Actually, paraphrasing Massumi's analysis of Ridley Scott's <em>Blade Runner</em>, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">we could say that if Sal and Dean found out how to undo their &quot;pre-programmed&quot; &quot;death-in-history,&quot; they would also find a way out of the metanarrative of progress and civilization and have a choice to flee to a new vital spatial dimension &quot;to see things no human being ever has or will&quot; </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">(1987). In spite of the fact that Kerouac is seen by the two French theoreticians as failing &quot;to complete the process&quot; (&quot;The neurotic impasse again closes - the daddy-mommy of oedipalization, America, the return to the native land - or else the perversion of the exotic territorialities, then drugs, alcohol, or worse still, an old fascist dream.

Therefore, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">the key to Kerouac's success is in their view his spontaneous prose method:</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">an author is great because he cannot prevent </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">himself</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;"> from tracing flows and causing them to circulate</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">. that is what style is, or rather the absence of style - asyntactic, a grammatical: </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">the moment when language is no longer defined by what it says, even less by what makes it a signifying thing, but what causes it to move, to flow, and to explode - desire.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">For </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">literature is like schizophrenia: a process and not a goal, a production and not an expression</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">(133) One thing that definitely sets apart <em>On the Road</em> among the books of the decade and contributes decisively to its still fresh appeal is the way it was written and particularly </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">Kerouac</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">'s </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">aesthetics of spontaneity. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">He</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>discovered the power of the actual and the ordinary, the natural and the commonplace by refusing</u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">any 'literary' </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">perfection</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">, <strong><u>any craft or revision of the written text.</u></strong> <strong><u>He removed all literary, grammatical and syntactical inhibitions and the arbitrary barriers of conventional punctuation</u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;"> (in the line of Joyce) </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">and used</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">his unusual gift for sound and music to release </span><span style="font-family: Courier;">&quot;<strong><u>the unspeakable visions of the individual&quot;, the music of the body, the pure joy of the 'undisturbed flow&quot; of the mind, as he calls it.</u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">In &quot;The Essentials of Spontaneous Prose&quot; as well as in the <em>Paris Review</em>interview, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">he emphasized that his rejection of revision and selectivity helped him communicate &quot;through the sheer ignition of felt energy&quot;</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;"> (Berrigan, 554). </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">Without a resistance to the microfascist Will to Truth, dominant forms of clarity and certainty resonate together to create violence and oppression </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">The second danger, Clarity, seems less obvious. Clarity, in effect, concerns the molecular. Once again, everything is involved, even perception, even the semiotic regime, but this time on the second line. Castaneda illustrates, for example, the existence of a molecular perception to which drugs give us access (but so many things can be drugs): we attain a visual and sonorous microperception revealing spaces and voids, like holes in the molar structure. </span><span style="font-family: Courier;">That is precisely what clarity is<u>: the distinctions that appear in what used to seem full, the holes in what used to be compact: and conversely, where just before we saw end points of clear cut segments, now there are indistinct fringes, encroachments, overlappings, migrations, acts of segmentation that no longer coincide with the rigid segmentarity. Everything now appears</u> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-family: Courier;">supple, with holes in fullness, nebulas in forms, and flutter in lines. Everything has the clarity of the microscope. <strong>We think we have understood everything, and draw conclusions. We are the new knights; we even have a mission</strong>.</span></u><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <u>A microphysics of the migrant has replaced the macrogeometry of the sedentary.</u> <strong><u>But this suppleness and clarity do not only present dangers, they are themselves a danger.</u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">First,</span><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <u>supple segmentarity runs the risk of reproducing in miniature</u> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">the affections, </span><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">the affectations, of the rigid: the family is replaced by a community, conjugality by a regime of exchange and migration</span></u><span style="font-family: Courier;">; </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">worse, micro-Oedipuses crop up, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">microfascisms lay down the law</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">, </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">the mother feels obliged to titillate her child, the father becomes a mommy. A dark light that falls from no star and emanates such sadness: this shifting segmentarity derives directly from the most rigid, for which it is indirect compensation. </span><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">The more molar the aggregates become, the more molecular become their elements and the relations between their elements: molecular man for molar humanity.</span></u><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>One deterritorializes</u></strong><u>,</u> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">massifies, but</span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">only</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">in order to knot and annul the mass movements and movements of deterritorialization,</span><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>to invent all kinds of marginal reterritorializations even worse than the others</u></strong>. </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">But above all, supple segmentarity brings dangers of its own that do not merely reproduce in small scale the dangers of molar segmentarity, which do not derive from them or compensate for them. As we have seen, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">microfascisms</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;"> have a specificity of their own that <strong>can crystallize into a macrofascism</strong>, but may also float along the supple line on their own account and suffuse every little cell</span></u><u><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;"> A multitude of black holes may very well not become centralized, and acts instead as viruses adapting to the most varied situations, sinking voids in molecular perceptions and semiotics. Interactions without resonance. </span><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>Instead of the great paranoid fear, we are trapped in a thousand little mono-manias, self-evident truths, and clarities that gush from every black hole and no longer form a system</u></strong><u>, but are only rumble and buzz, blinding lights <strong>givingany and everybody the mission of self-appointed judge, dispenser of justice, policeman, neighborhood SS man. We have overcome fear, we have sailed from the shores of security, only to enter a system that is no less concentricized, no less organized</strong>: <strong>the system of petty insecurities that leads everyone to their own black hole in which to turn dangerous, possessing a clarity on their situation, role, and mission even more disturbing than the certitudes of the first line</strong>.</u></span><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">The topic demands outsiders and we have volunteered: the road trip is a rhizomatic or nomadic performance of thought. Our aff is an attempt to create smooth space for alternative possibilities</span></strong><br />
<br />

<span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">In each instance, then</span><span style="font-family: Courier;">, <strong><u>the simple opposition “smooth-striated” gives rise to far more difficult complications</u></strong>, </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">alternations, and superposition’s. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">But these complications basically confirm the distinction, precisely because they bring dissymmetrical movements into play. For now, it suffices to say that there are two kinds of voyage, distinguished by the respective role of the point, line, and space</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">. </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">Goethe travel and Kleist travel? French travel and English (or American) travel? </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">Tree travel and rhizome travel?</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>But nothing completely coincides, and everything intermingles, or crosses over. This is because the differences are not objective: it is possible to live striated on the deserts, steppes, or seas; it is possible to live smooth even in the cities, to be an urban nomad</u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">(for example, a stroll taken by Henry Miller in Clichy or Brooklyn is a nomadic transit in smooth space; he makes the city disgorge a patchwork, differentials of speed, delays and accelerations, changes in orientation, continuous variations… The beatniks owe much to Miller, but they changed direction again, they put the space outside the cities to new use). Fitzgerald said it long ago:</span><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>it is not a question of taking off for the South Seas, that is not what determines a voyage.</u></strong> <strong><u>There are not only strange voyages in the city but voyages in place:</u></strong> <strong><u>we are</u></strong> <strong><u>not</u></strong> <strong><u>thinking</u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">of drug users, whose experience is too ambiguous, but </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">of true nomads</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">. </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">We can say of nomads, following Toynbee’s suggestion: they do not move. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">They are nomads by dint of not moving</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">, not migrating, of holding a smooth space that they refuse to leave,</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>that they leave only in order to conquer</u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">and die. </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">Voyage in place: that is the name of all intensities, even if they also develop in extension. </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 14pt;">To think is to voyage</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">;</span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;"> earlier we tried to establish a teho-noological model of smooth and striated spaces. In short, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">what distinguishes the two </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">kinds of voyages is neither a measurable quantity of movement, nor something that would be only in the mind, but the mode of </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">spatialization, the manner of being in space, of being for space.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>Voyage smoothly</u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">or in striation, </span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">and think the same way</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">…</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>But there are always passages from one to the other, transformations of one within the other, reversals</u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">. In his film, Kings of the Road, Wenders intersects and superposes the paths of two characters; one of them takes a still educational, memorial, cultural, Goethean journey that is thoroughly striated, whereas the other has already conquered smooth space, and only experiments, induces amnesia in the German “desert.” But oddly enough, it is the former who opens space for himself and performs a kind of retroactive smoothing, whereas striae reform around the latter, closing his space again.</span><span style="font-family: Courier;"> <strong><u>Voyaging smoothly is a becoming, and a difficult, uncertain becoming at that. It is not a question of returning to preastronomical navigation, nor to the ancient nomads. The confrontation between the smooth and the striated, the passages, alternations and superposition’s, are under way today, running in the most varied directions</u></strong>. </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">Our spontaneous performance of fun in this debate disrupts the production of hegemonic moral and political authority</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Courier;">Bayat 2007</span></strong><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">(Asef, Prof of Sociology @ Leiden Univ., Netherlands. “Islamism and the Politics of Fun.” <em>Public Culture</em>, 19:3, p. 453)</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">Anti-fun ethics</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">, whether religious or secular, modern or premodern, bourgeois or communist — and espoused by individuals, movements, or states — <strong>are not merely doctrinal concerns; they are primarily historical-political matters</strong>.</span></u><span style="font-family: Courier;"> More immediately, <strong><u>they represent and embody a particular technique of power, a discursive shield that both legitimizes and insulates moral or political authority</u></strong> <u>by binding it to “what is not to be questioned,” to the sacrosanct, the untouchables</u> — God, the Revolution, the Resistance, the Proletariat, the Nation. <strong><u>Fear of fun</u></strong>, consequently, <strong><u>is</u></strong> <u>not necessarily <strong>about</strong> diversion from the higher powers or noble values as such but <strong>about the fear of exit from the paradigm that frames and upholds the mastery of certain types of moral and political authorities</strong>, be they individuals, political movements, or states.</u> <u>Any type of authority</u>, including Weber’s famous ideal types, <u>may be realized only within its own discursive paradigm</u> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 8pt;">— </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 7pt;">a body of consistent concepts, meanings, and understandings. Billy Graham may hold authority only among a segment of American Christians to whom his message makes sense. For the rest of Americans, or Egyptian Muslims for that matter, he holds little power. Graham’s authority not only derives from what and how he preaches but also is realized specifically within the paradigm or discursive frame that allows him to operate and communicate with his audience. This is</span><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">the “paradigm power</span></u><span style="font-family: Courier;">.” It <u>refers to the discursive space that enables those in charge within a particular paradigm to maintain their position by making them meaningful and acceptable to their subjects. Thus, any challenge from without or <strong>departure from within this discursive space amounts to a challenge to those in authority</strong></u><strong>.</strong> </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 7pt;">Because when subjects exit from the shared paradigm, by way of adhering to a different value system and way of life, they effectively leave the masters’ field of influence and in effect render them powerless. Note how an Iranian hard-line weekly expresses this apprehension of exit: “When the chants of Allah-Akbar [God is Great] are replaced by whistling and clapping hands, prayers will come to an end, God will be overlooked, and the doors of lustfulness will be wide open. In such conditions, you cannot hear the voice of God; you will commit anything in this state of unconsciousness. Even Imam Khomeini’s cries will fall on deaf ears.”94 This anxiety is basically about how </span><u><span style="font-family: Courier;">the rival paradigm (fun) may come in between the moral authority and its followers to divert the latter’s devotion to the former</span></u><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 11pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 7pt;">A powerful conservative ayatollah in Iran declares films, arts, and cultural centers “as the most dangerous thing[s] that threaten humanity” because he fears that they would push mosques, churches, prayers, supplication, and ultimately devotion to God to the sidelines.95 His feeling of threat lies not simply in people forgetting God (after all, people themselves are assumed to be responsible before God) but in undermining the “divine-driven” (</span><em><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 7pt;">khoda-mehvar</span></em><span style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 7pt;">) doctrinal paradigm that ensures his moral mastery. In a different, secular setting in July 2005, armed militants from the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades disrupted a music concert in the Palestinian town of Nablus because, they argued, the joy of love songs would divert the public’s attention from devotion to the great sacrosanct, the “resistance.” “These people [the militants] don’t want us to be happy,” protested the embattled singer Amar Hasan; “they want us to sit in the ruins and cry.”96 The brigade militias’ apprehension of “happiness” follows the same logic of power — fear from a rival frame of mind that could ultimately undercut their authority.</span><br />

CHANGE THE FOCUS they say<br />
Everybody’s chasing something<br />
Running and racing after something<br />
But nothing’s changed but the time of day<br />
And all the problems have stayed the same<br />
Some people are carrion<br />
And other folks are vultures<br />
But everything we see is a product of culture<br />
A spinoff bastard child of knowledge and power<br />
Born in the midst of a situation gone sour<br />
Everyone wants some for themselves<br />
In their crooked grasp on property, value, life, and lies<br />
Can you read between the lines?<br />
See a little bit further than the <u>[[#|next]]</u> thing you buy?<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Really care when someone from another country or color dies? </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">But all the rules are written rigged so they can keep the score </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">I’m privileged in my ability to claim a free voice to fight for a better future that’s in store </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">But I can’t speak any facts on anyone else except for the idea that they don’t have a choice ‘cause their voices get ignored </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Ironically philosophy’s got almost nothing</span> to say<br />
When it’s locked up in its twisted academic cage<br />
So maybe it’s time for a different me to speak up<br />
And let loose the rage<br />
Maybe it’s time for poetry to take the stage<br />

<strong>The Bering Strait tunnel is a unique act of imagination which recalls inspiring <u>[[#|science]]</u> fiction of the past—it’s a symbol of hope for global cooperation</strong><br />
<strong>MORRISON 2011</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Richard, “A train trip from Moscow to <u>[[#|New]]</u> York?; The proposed construction of a tunnel linking the rail networks of <u>[[#|Russia]]</u> and North America is a brave <u>[[#|new]]</u> world indeed,” The Times, August 26, lexis)</span><br />
<br />
<u>Not since Yuri Gagarin orbited the Earth</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 50 years ago </span><u>have the Russians grabbed so many headlines for their technological daring</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Last week </span><u>the Kremlin approved</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> what was described by our Russian correspondent, surely correctly, as &quot;</span><u>the greatest railway project of all time</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;. It's the construction of </span><u>a</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 65-mile </span><u>tunnel</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> connecting Asia and North America </span><u>under the Bering Strait</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and hence linking the railway networks of <u>[[#|Russia]]</u> and North America. The minor problem that, at present, neither railway network goes anywhere near the Bering Strait only adds to the excitement. On the Russian side a 500-mile link is being built from the Trans-Siberian Railway to Yakutsk, more than 3,000 miles east of Moscow. But this would have to be extended a further 2,400 miles through some of the most <u>[[#|savage]]</u> terrain in the northern hemisphere. And on the Alaskan side the challenge would scarcely be any easier, especially as Alaska's railways aren't connected to any others in North America. </span><u>Yet the Russians, Canadians and Americans seem confident that they can muster the political will, technical knowhow and massive</u> [[#|funds]]<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (£60 billion just to dig the tunnel) </span><u>to</u> [[#|complete]] <u>the project</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - though not any time soon. The year 2045 is being proposed as the finish <u>[[#|date]]</u>, which would be neatly symbolic: the 100th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Of <u>[[#|course]]</u>, all this <u>[[#|depends]]</u> on humanity not embarking on a Third World War. </span><u>Constructing a &quot;dry&quot; crossing</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> between Siberia and Alaska </span><u>would be symbolic</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for another reason. </span><u>Most experts believe that homo sapiens first reached America by walking across the Bering Strait</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - about 30,000 years ago, when sea levels were lower. </span><u>And the dream of linking Asia and America by tunnel or a series of bridges has been knocking around for over a century</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The great engineer Joseph Strauss put <u>[[#|forward]]</u> a brilliant plan as long ago as 1892. And he knew a thing or two about designing bridges; he built the Golden Gate in San Francisco. Then in 1905 Tsar Nicholas II approved a tunnel scheme. But the Russian Revolution, two world wars and the Cold War meant that the 20th century was nearly over before the necessary East-West co-operation seemed feasible. Now, however, it seems not just feasible but economically enticing. Experts say that a Siberia-Alaska rail link could carry a huge amount of the world's <u>[[#|freight]]</u> much more cheaply, quickly and cleanly than supertankers or juggernauts do. That's important. </span><u>But what really thrills romantics is the prospect of getting on a train at St Pancras and alighting 16 days later at Grand Central Station in</u> [[#|New York]]<u>, having enjoyed the journey of a lifetime through the majestic vistas fringing the Arctic Circle.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Of <u>[[#|course]]</u>, the reality is that you would probably have to change trains at Brussels, Berlin, Moscow, Yakutsk, Anchorage, Vancouver and Toronto. And if you think about all the things that go wrong every day on the British railway, and imagine them going wrong on trains passing through northeast Siberia, 1,000 miles from the nearest town, it can be a bit disconcerting. What if there's signal failure? Or the loos overflow? Or the buffet runs out of BLTs and beer? You might meet the same fate as some of those early seafarers searching for the Northeast Passage. Even so, </span><u>the <strong>sheer audacity</strong> of the project makes the <strong>heart beat faster</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One big reason for that, surely, is our growing disillusion with the mind-numbing hassles of air travel. And that's extraordinary. When I was a boy everyone thought that in the 21st century we would be whizzing to New York, Los Angeles, even Sydney, in a couple of hours - via ever-speedier supersonic aircraft or space rockets. But that dream died with Concorde. Now, </span><u>air travel appears to be stuck in a technological impasse. By contrast, it's the earthbound Victorian technology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the Brunels and Stephensons </span><u>that seems to offer the 21st century its most exciting transport initiatives</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Back in 1870 the opening of the 1,000-mile Bombay to Calcutta railway inspired Jules Verne to write Around the World in Eighty Days. It's bizarre yet delightful that, </span><u>140 years on, a great railway project still captures the imagination as no other modes of transport do</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If the Bering Strait tunnel does open in 2045, I'll buy myself a train ticket to New York as a 90th birthday treat.</span><br />

<strong>Unfortunately, American perceptions of Russia vacillate between extremes of cultural relativism and economic universalism. Current attitudes towards Russian technological projects stems from an unresolved mix of contempt and fascination</strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>ENGERMAN 2003</strong></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (David, Engerman is Assistant Professor of History at Brandeis University, Modernization from the Other Shore: American Intellectuals and the Romance of Russian Development, p. 7-11)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">American ideas about Russia's predominantly peasant population also built on indigenous Russian ones. Especially in the nineteenth century, which saw the spread of industrialization in western Europe and the rise of Romanticism, </span><u>images of the peasant played an important role in arguments about Russia's present conditions and future trajectory</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.'3 Slavophiles, conservatives who emphasized Russia's differences from the west, celebrated the peasant commune and the autocracy as cornerstones of Russian rule and incarnations of Russian character. To them, the special qualities of Russia and its peasantry deserved conservation and protection from western materialism and industrialism. Yet admiration was at a distance. Throughout the nineteenth century, educated Russians described the sharp contrasts between themselves (collectively, obshchestvo, or society) and the bulk of the population {narod, or the people). With a combination of condescension and sympathy, intellectuals saw the narod as an undistinguished mass of simple people who required the help of the obshchestvo if they ever hoped to emerge from their noble suffering. As one member of the Populists (a group of radical heirs to the Slavophiles) put it in 1880, a Populist &quot;does not love the narod only because they are unfortunate ... He respects the narod as a collective whole, constituting in itself the highest level of justice and humanity in our time.&quot; Love for the narod. however deep and sincere, was directed not at actual individuals but at an abstraction. Within two decades, though, such </span><u>positive sentiments were drowned out by critical ones</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Russian </span><u>intellectuals</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the last decades of the nineteenth century </span><u>depicted peasants as savage, helpless, and hopeless</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—not to mention unresponsive to (and even ungrateful for) the obshchestvo's best efforts. Russian intellectuals1 experiences with the peasantry are perhaps best illustrated by the Populists' effort to bring education and enlightenment &quot;to the people&quot; in 1874. &quot;The people&quot; were so uninspired by the message of the radicals that they frequently reported them to police officials. The ensuing disenchantment with the narod was hardly limited to radicals, however. In Russian art, literature, and theater of the late nineteenth century, peasants were no longer repositories of rural virtue. The figurative countryside was instead populated by kulaks, &quot;peasant bloodsucker(s],&quot; and baby, vulgar peasant women who symbolized the moral crisis of the peasantry. Peasants previously lauded as an abstract collective fared much worse (in the minds of educated Russians) as actual individuals. Russian intellectuals' views of their rural compatriots suggest that no great geographic distances are required to turn the subjects of observation into &quot;others.&quot; Although they lived close to the peasants, members of the Russian obshchestvo nevertheless remained outside the lives of those they described with such contempt. </span><u>America's Russia watchers, without local knowledge, found their suspicions about the peasantry confirmed by Russian writers</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Recent scholarship on such exterior perceptions has been aided—and, more problematically, defined around—Edward Said's elegant work Orientalism. Said documents a range of assumptions that European scholars, writers, and artists held about the &quot;Orient&quot; and &quot;Orientals.&quot; Amid his insightful readings of Flaubert and his broad generalizations about French and British policy in the Near East, </span><u>Said offers a convincing criticism of European depictions of the Orient. Europeans</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, he writes, </span><u>homogenized the Orient's inhabitants and placed them outside historical time. But Said himself pays minimal attention to the differences among depictions of the Orient, and to the ways they changed over time. Ironically enough, then, his critique of homogenization and hypostatization applies equally well to his own analysis of Orientalist discourse. Nevertheless, Said's insights about perceptions as a form of social power—and their intimate connections to imperatives of government rule—are applicable to American views of Russia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.16 Modernization from the Other Shore invokes Herzen's metaphor of distant shores to emphasize the exteriority upon which Said built his argument. But the metaphor applied across time as well as space. The &quot;far shore&quot; represented not just Herzen's distance from Russia but also the safe haven he reached as the revolutionary storms of 1848 ebbed. Like Herzen's, this book is also written from a far shore—following not the flash-floods of 1848 but the decades-long storm of Soviet rule. The Soviet collapse brings both practical and intellectual changes to the study of Russia's past, and thus to those who interpret it. The opening of once-locked archives and the desire to understand the Soviet past without Cold War blinders have led to a flourishing debate. Once-secret Soviet documents have forced reconsiderations of crucial events in modern history. </span><u>Russians' discussions of their country's past are all the more striking for the decrepit physical and desperate financial circumstances in which they take place</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Writing after the Cold War also offers an opportunity to reflect on American enthusiasm for the USSR in a new and less rancorous political context</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To take one example: previous historians have blamed intellectuals' fascination with the Soviet Union in the 1930s on misguided leftists, or on misguided leftism in general. Yet </span><u>the romance of economic development swayed American observers across the political spectrum</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Partisan politics—that is, devotion or opposition to the Communist Party—cannot fully explain this important episode in American intellectual history. </span><u>Impressed by grandiose Soviet plans and dismissive of backward Russians, many American intellectuals enthusiastically observed Soviet efforts at modernization. And western enthusiasms for the Soviet Union reverberated long after the Depression decade. They helped define McCarthyism and the early Cold War, as a generation of intellectuals viewed their own— and their friends'—Soviet enchantment with increasing disdain</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.17 Enthusiasm for Soviet industrialization did not require a Party card, either in the United States or in the Soviet Union. Many Russians who praised rapid modernization were not Bolsheviks. So-called bourgeois agricultural experts, engineers, and economists in Russia all found reasons to endorse Soviet goals of collectivization and industrialization. Other Russians leapt at the chance to turn their motherland into a modern great power, meaning an industrial one.18 Western observers, too, appreciated the Bolsheviks' claims about a rationally organized society under the guidance of specialists like themselves. Such enthusiasm also existed outside Russia. James Scott's recent synthesis. Seeing Like a State, suggests parallels between Soviet collectivization and other projects of what he calls &quot;authoritarian high modernism.&quot;19 </span><u>The idea of creating a new kind of society, organized around production and easily controlled</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Scott shows, </span><u>found adherents around the world and all along the political spectrum. The demise of the USSR and the Cold War has already opened new inquiries into the common mindsets behind these projects, past and present. Widespread excitement about universal progress still incorporates regional variations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Recent debates about &quot;Asian values,&quot; for instance, reveal the persistence of a troubled relationship between universalist and particu-larist models of development. Since the 1980s, leaders in Malaysia and Singapore have defended their combination of industrialization and political repression with references to particular Asian values. &quot;Each nation &quot; one argues, &quot;must find its own best social and political arrangements&quot;; there are no universal theories or forms of social organization. Western critics, meanwhile, base their arguments on the notion of human rights—that is, a set of rights that applies universally, transcending culture or government.20 The Asian values debate scrambles political alliances among Americans. Multiculturalists, generally on the left, see their claims of cultural particularism deployed by right-wing dictatorships. Meanwhile universalists, often accused of denigrating other nations and cultures, take the side of oppressed populations. Similarly, </span><u>scholars still argue about the relationship between Russian character and economic development in the post-Soviet era. The Soviet collapse, which might have brought down with it the edifice of universalist theories of human behavior, has instead unleashed a potent universalism in which all varieties of humankind are known only as homo economicus. This is evident in recent debates about Russian economic policy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Taking great pride that they had conquered the &quot;prejudice that 'Russia is different,'&quot; the economists Maxim Boycko, Robert Vishny, and Andrei Shleifer celebrated their own universalism. &quot;The Russian people,&quot; they preached in a widely read monograph, &quot;like the rest of the people in the world, were 'economic men' who rationally responded to incentives.&quot; Russia, therefore, did not require a special form of economic organization &quot;to compensate for its alleged cultural specificities and deficiencies.&quot;21 These economists promoted the immediate establishment of free-market institutions, creating a capitalist Russia with a single big bang. Supremely confident that economic laws applied equally well in all times and places, they were, ironically enough, heirs to Marx's universalism. </span><u>As economic &quot;shock therapy&quot; created new ailments in Russia, particu-larist critics blamed the economists' failure to account for Russia's differences from the west</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Russians, argued the longtime Russia-watcher Marshall Goldman, &quot;have almost always seemed more comfortable in a collective or communal, as opposed to an entrepreneurial, environment.&quot; Even before the anti-capitalist slogans of the Soviet era, he continued, &quot;the market ethic was never . .. deeply entrenched in the psyche&quot; of Russian peasants. Particularists with a conservative bent, meanwhile, suggested that the problem was not in the economists' methods but in their very aims. Historian Richard Pipes, for instance, lists multiple reasons that Russia has never developed the key institutions of western capitalism and democracy. While explicitly rejecting a national character argument, Pipes leaves little opportunity for Russia to evolve toward the west. In making such claims, he comes all too close to condemning Russia to its own past.22 </span><u>We have yet to resolve the tensions between universal progress and national difference</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that Herzen observed a century and a half ago. The questions addressed in this book parallel many of the age-old concerns that preoccupied Herzen. Chief among them is the question of difference. What do cultural differences mean? Are they innate or historical? How do they shape our understandings of human behavior and social change? Related to these are concerns about the universality of progress. How can each society find its own path of progress? Can a nation overcome its historical particularities? Should it? Finally, </span><u>there is the balance between present and future. Under what conditions can individuals call for collective sacrifices in the name of future welfare? And with what consequences? Russian history provided the answers to these questions—or so American experts believed. Ideas about the peculiarities of Russian character, belief in economic development, and the reconfiguration of international expertise all shaped American conceptions of Russia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the Soviet Union between 1870 and 1940. This book's organization underscores the pervasiveness as well as the significance of these themes. Chronological chapters emphasize the persistence of national-character stereotypes as well as the growing romance of economic development and the evolving structure of expertise. Within most chapters, biographical sections highlight the ubiquity of these beliefs, even among experts with discordant political views and divergent personal experiences.</span><br />

<strong>This is particularly true of the Bering Strait tunnel. Russians are depicted as irrational zealots, obsessed with dreams of gigantic megaprojects despite their backwardness and inferiority, yet even this critic feels the pull of imagination in the Bering Strait tunnel</strong><br />
<strong>WHITTELL 2001</strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (Giles, “Oh no, Ivan, spare us another big idea,” The Times, Jan 6, lexis)</span><br />
<br />
<u>...The Bering tunnel is a typical example of Russian folie de grandeur Isn't it wonderful? We'll be able to travel from London to Seattle in ten days instead of ten hours. Freightbetween America and Russia will be at the mercy of terrorists and caribou</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> instead of being locked away in dull container ships. Oh, and armies of navvies will dig up two of the least desecrated spots on earth. </span><u>The idea of an Alaska-Siberia rail tunnel under the Bering Strait</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which was floated (technically, refloated) this week by the Russian official responsible for such things, </span><u>is so crazy that it somehow <strong>defies you not to will it into being</strong>. It would cost the earth and take centuries to pay for itself, but it has its own bewitching logic</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Goodness, you realise, gazing at the map. These two continents come so close to each other up there near the Arctic that the question should be why they aren't already linked. </span><u>Russia's engineers are its most maniacal dreamers,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and this week they have been hard at it. Viktor Razbegin, the man behind the Bering tunnel plan, also stated calmly but not quite accurately that construction of another mega-tunnel, from Japan to Sakhalin, was due to start this year. Valeri Polyakov, the world record-holder for space flight longevity and deputy director of a Moscow &quot;medico-biological&quot; institute, told Tass with the confidence of one who has, indeed, spent too long in orbit that it's only a matter of time before cosmonauts colonise both the Moon and Mars. An atomic energy official from the far north unveiled fetching balsa models of floating nuclear power stations bringing warmth and light to Russia's most miserable Arctic ports. And then there are the longstanding plans to transport Russian nickel ore around the world in refurbished nuclear submarines, and to link St Petersburg to Helsinki with a series of causeways and suspension bridges. Of these, the only sensible proposal is the last one, and I made it up. The rest are real, and they reveal much about the Great Russian Pickle with which George W. Bush must soon concern himself - however little he wants to. He should not be surprised by them. </span><u>Gigantism runs in Russia's blood, and has done since long before the Bolsheviks pumped it full of steroids. This is the only country in the world whose provinces measure themselves in &quot;Western Europes&quot; as units of surface area, and the tsars' surveyors were mapping them and sketching tunnels to Alaska before the Trans-Siberian Railway was even thought of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So no surprise, please, but plenty of alarm. </span><u>Even in Russia, gigantism is ordinarily a form of fantasy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Stalin changed all that, industrialising 11 time zones in a generation and laying the groundwork for the Soviet space programme and its nuclear arsenal. But Stalin's tools were terror and forced labour on an epochal scale, and his imperative, besides his own paranoia, was the genuine threat of national annihilation in the Second World War. Mr </span><u>Putin</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has no such imperative. He </span><u>has a population of 140 million souls, numb with cold and poverty, struggling to apportion the fruits of an economy smaller than that of The Netherlands. His only possible excuse for Bering-style projects would be as an exercise in mass escapism</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This does not mean they will not happen. </span><u>Escapism, too, has deep roots in Russia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and on its old imperial fringe. In northern Uzbekistan, for instance, there is a low, brown cliff which may have killed a fine man named Yusup Kamalov on his first and final flight of fancy. When I met him his day job involved agitating for the endangered Aral Sea. His only failing was a hobby he called floppy flight. Yusup fervently believed man can fly if he straps on the right wings and flaps them hard enough. He once showed me the wings and the cliff where he would prove it, and I have not heard from him in far too long. In similar vein, The Los Angeles Times reported this week that a certain Mikhail Puchkov is still piloting a home-made mini-submarine in the Gulf of Finland 20 years after he built it, initially with pedals only, as a personal rebellion against the dead hand of Brezhnev. &quot;I was not satisfied with the fate that was laid out for me,&quot; he said. </span><u>Some organise their own distractions. Most wait to be distracted. For them, the tsars built palaces to gawp at</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Khrushchev struck lucky with Gagarin. His successors, up to and including Gorbachev, all dallied with the grandest folly of them all, a scheme that mercifully never left the drawing board to divert two of Siberia's mightiest rivers - with the help of controlled nuclear explosions - to refill the Aral Sea. </span><u>Russia has never been the home of reason. A</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Pounds 40 billion </span><u>Bering tunnel seems quite plausible</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to many here, and n</span><u>ot as a bold Keynesian route out of their 100-year economic slump, but as</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> precisely what it would be; </span><u>a piece of magnificent madness, an up-yours to the bean-counters every bit as rational as climbing Everest</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Mr </span><u>Putin has</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> so far </span><u>sold himself as unimpeachably pragmatic. Sooner or later that spell will break and his power will corrupt him</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or at least corrode him. </span><u>That is when Russia's tree-huggers and moss-watchers should assemble</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the extreme eastern tip of Chukotka </span><u>and <strong>ask</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> those of </span><strong><u>us</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> who follow them for the exotic dateline </span><u>what on earth would travel along a Bering tunnel</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>This example represents a broader trend of pitting Russia against the US which spills over into our daily lives.

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Numerous analysis have argued that </span><u>American media</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">presentations of international events tend to fall in line with the policy interests of the U. S. government (Gans 1980; Paletz and Entman 1981; Parenti 1993; Qualier 1985; Wallis and Baran 1990). From the end of World War II until 1989, the American media's role in supporting official policy resulted, at least in part, from the adoption of a conflict perspective in which the United States and Russia were seen as polarized forces. American media</span> <u>routinely defined American society in contrast to Russia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Hallin 1992). </span><u>The conflict frame fit well with the American media's game interpretation of the political world as an ongoing series of contests</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, each with a set of winners and losers (Davis 1990; Ncuman, Just, and Criglcr 1992, pp. 64-65). Al least until 1989, &quot;in normal times as well as in periods of Red scares, issues tended to be framed in terms of a dichotomized world of Communist and anti-Communist powers, with gains and losses allocated to contesting sides, and </span><u>rooting for &quot;our side' was considered entirely legitimate news practice</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; (Herman and Chomsky 1988, pp. 30-31). During the cold war, Soviet media practice mirrored that of U.S. media in adopting a conflict perspective in which Russian society was defined by way of contrast to America (Downing 1988). Russian media devoted considerable attention to the symbolic construc-tion of the United States as a nation in which there was widespread racial conflict, unemployment, homelessness, social and economic inequality, and social injustice. In international affairs, the United States was depicted as the world's leading imperialist power, driven by military-industrial interests. Russian media also constructed a contrasting image of their homeland. While far from being a worker's paradise, Russia was depicted as comparatively free from the social ills that beset America. The nation also was portrayed as the world's leading opponent of capitalist imperialism (McNair 1988; Mickiewicz 1981; Turpin 1995). The importance of the conflict perspective, adopted by U.S. and Russian media alike, is suggested by research indicating that, </span><u>while most media listeners/viewers retain <strong>little information</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">from news broadcasts,</span> <u>they</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">do tend to</span> <u>retain the <strong>generalized conceptions</strong> of the order of things embedded in the categories through which news events are presented</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Morley 1990, p. 128). </span><u>People's view of the order of things provides a frame of reference or orientation with which they can interpret objects and events as they conduct their <strong>everyday lives</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The objects and events of the world have no inherent or universal meaning apart from this imposed framework (Schutz [1932J1967). As Erving Goffman (1974) points out, the imposed meaning is limited by, and relative to, the social context in which it is created. However, </span><u>once meanings are learned</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> through the socialization process (today, an important component of which is some attention to media content), </span><u>people tend to act on them without reassessment and without awareness of the social forces that created them. They come to identify truth with a particular learned set of socially shared meanings</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Medi0a organizations construct social reality as they select and prioritize some items of information, omit or ignore others, weave accounts together, and build a &quot;story&quot; using particular types of exposition and articulating verbal discourse together to make a certain kind of sense</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Entman 1993). The interpretive structure that governs the selection, omission, prioritization, and editing processes has been termed a &quot;news frame&quot; (Gamson 1991). A given frame can be used to structure numerous stories about a variety of actors, conditions, and events (e.g., diverse political and economic conflicts throughout the world). A particular story tends to evoke in an audience a distinct pattern of judgments and opinions about the actor, condition or event that is its subject matter (Iyengar 1988, pp. 815-831). Stuart Hall (1982, p. 69) notes: </span><u>The more one accepts the principle that how people act will depend in part on how the situations in which they act are defined, and the less one can assume either a natural meaning to everything or a universal consensus on what things mean—then the more important, socially and politically, becomes the process by means of which certain events get recurrently signified in particular ways. This is particularly the case where events in the world are problematic</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (that is, when they are unexpected); when they break the frame of our previous expectations about the world; where powerful social interested are involved; or where there are starkly opposing interests at play. </span><u>The power involved here is an ideological power; the power to signify events in a particular way</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>ENGERMAN 2003</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (David, Engerman is Assistant Professor of History at Brandeis University, Modernization from the Other Shore: American Intellectuals and the Romance of Russian Development, p. 2-4)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">These questions redounded around the world in the twentieth century. </span><u>Under the spell of modernization, American intellectuals endorsed radical forms of social change everywhere except in the United States. They placed at the pinnacle of human achievement a society much like they imagined their own to be</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: industrial, urban, cosmopolitan, rational, and democratic. </span><u>Backward nations, they argued, could progress toward modernity only by implementing rapid and violent changes. Modern America, however, would be exempt from such turmoil. With America's expanding global role and intellectuals' increasingly close connections to the centers of power, these ideas shaped nations all over the world</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. New ideas of social change and national character also shaped notions of American national identity, which itself underwent significant changes after 1870—from scientific racism and assimilationist theory before World War II to celebrations of common humanity in the 1950s and the valorization of cultural differ-ences since the 1980s. </span><u>The way Americans understood the process of social change shaped the way they envisioned their own nation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, </span><u>the tensions between accepting cultural differences and promoting modernization underpinned American-Soviet conflict during the Cold War</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At the same time that scholars analyzed the conflict as one between two industrial powers with opposing ideologies, </span><u>American diplomats construed the Cold War enemy as an inherently and irredeemably different nation. These conceptions, supported by America's global reach, made—and continue to make—the American century</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>American writings on Russia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the Soviet Union were </span><u>shaped by</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> three forces, which constitute the three main themes of this book: </span><u>a longstanding belief that every nation had its own unique character; a growing enthusiasm for modernization; and the appearance of new professional institutions and norms for interpreting other nations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. First, </span><u>American experts used national-character stereotypes to explain Russian and Soviet events. Building on centuries-old notions of Russian peculiarity, western experts enumerated traits that supposedly limited the Russians' ability to function in a modern world. Americans repeated the claims of European commentators who argued that national character emerged from geography and topography: long winters made Russians passive, and endless plains made them melancholy. Russians, in these writings, exhibited instinctual behavior, extreme passivity, and a lethargy shaken only by violence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.4 </span><u>Americans argued that these characteristics—accentuating the negative—affected Russia's economic prospects. Reliance on these notions of national character crossed political boundaries; Russia's avowed enemies and ardent defenders in the United States agreed on what made Russians different</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Herzen himself illustrated the double-edged nature of such characterizations. Living in France and Italy in the 1850s, he gained new perspective on Russian character. He frequently mentioned the &quot;Slavic genius&quot; that set his compatriots apart from Europeans, focusing especially on Russians' soulful and communal natures. Yet he also took for granted that Russians^—especially the peasants who constituted the vast majority of the population—were &quot;improvident and indolent,&quot; better at &quot;passive obedience&quot; than political or economic activity.5 Difference did not necessarily mean superiority. </span><u>Americans' notions of Russian character often contained within them the idea that Russians were Asian</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—&quot;Asiatic&quot; in the language of the day. </span><u>The claim, stated as often in racial as in geographic terms, further legitimated violence in Russia. According to an oft-repeated refrain, life meant less to Asians, and therefore to Russians. Personal traits also held political implications. Asians, the argument went, could be ruled only through &quot;Oriental despotism.&quot; Writers</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from Baron Charles de Montesquieu to Karl Marx </span><u>depicted Asia as an unchanging—even unchangeable—morass of poverty, insularity, and despotism</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6 </span><u>Whether understood as Asian or Slavic, Russians consistently faced claims that they were unready to join the modern world</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Particularist views of Russia, which emphasized the nations unique traditions and character traits, dominated American writings until the 1920s.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The term ‘critical geopolitics’ had already been coined by the end of the 1980s (Dodds 2001). It usually refers to the approaches that emerged during the 1980s and which challenged traditional geopolitical theories (Dalby 1994). This stance explains why its proponents consider it critical, which according to Painter (1998, p. 144-145) “refers to a particular tradition in social sciences which questions the taken-for-granted assumptions that underpin conventional perspectives.” Ó Tuathail (1994, p. 525; 2006a) labels critical geopolitics “a heterogeneous movement of theoretical perspectives and agendas” straddling Political Geography and International Relations. It focuses on three research agendas: examining the meanings of spatial concepts, deconstructing geopolitical traditions and deconstructing contemporary discourses (Ó Tuathail 2004a). </span><u>Discourses play a key role</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">within critical geopolitics, illustrated by Ó Tuathail’s observation (2006a, p. 1) that geopolitics is commonly understood as “discourse about world politics.” Ó Tuathail and Agnew (1992) see discourses </span><u>as a collection of rules used to give meaning to communication. They do not only enable people to write and speak, but also to read, listen and act in a meaningful way</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span><u>discourses give texts, speeches and activities their meaning</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Another of their qualities is that </span><u>they are not deterministic, but leave room for a reasoning process that eventually generates meaning</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, it is worth mentioning here that discourses are neither static as human practice constantly modifies them. Most critical geopolitical research aims to “deconstruct hegemonic geopolitical discourses and to question the relationships of power found in the geopolitical practices of dominant states” (Ó Tuathail 2000, p. 166). Methodology Informed by poststructuralism, we assume that “</span><u>representations [of identity] and policy are mutually constitutive and discursively linked</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” (Hansen 2006, p. 28). Consequently, a think tank aims for consistency between its policy advice (“policy”) and its institutional context (proxy for “identity”) by using representations. this assumption is in line with the claim of Heritage (2010a) that its ideology forms the basis of its policy advice. Moreover, Brookings (Brookings, 2010b) has made it perfectly clear that its activities are meant to foster international cooperation. The second assumption is related to the first and concerns the position of the policy expert within a think tank: (Müller 2008, p. 326): “</span><u>it is not the individual</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [i.e. </span><u>policy expert] that structures and manipulates discourse but vice versa – discourses speak through the individual</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” This assumption holds that the think tank’s institutional context (structure) conditions the autonomy of its policy expert to represent (agency). Alternatively, we could say that that “[</span><u>i]n order to have their texts accepted as reasonable</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, geopoliticians [i.e. </span><u>policy experts] have to draw upon discourses already granted hegemonic social acceptance</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [i.e. based on the think tank’s institutional context]” (Sharp 1993, p. 493). Our focus on institutional context is based on Dalby’s observation (1990a) that analysing geopolitical discourses requires an examination of the political circumstances, their sources and audiences and the process by which the discourse legitimises the authority of the source. In addition, Dodds (1994) suggests that texts about foreign policy are to be examined within several contexts such as the institutional setting. When interpreting text, we must consider the hermeneutics. According to Hans-Georg Gadamer (1989, p. 298), “the discovery of the true meaning of a text or a work of art is never finished; it is in fact an infinite process.” Gadamer was instrumental in the development of philosophical hermeneutics, which seeks to investigate the nature of human understanding. In his view, someone who analyses a text must be “aware of one’s own bias, so that the text can present itself in all its otherness and thus assert its own truth against one’s own [prejudices]” (ibid, p. 271-272). Our discourse analysis focuses on representations, informed by Dodds’ observation that (1994, p. 188) “</span><u>[r]epresentational practices have</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> increasingly </span><u>been recognized as vital to the practices of foreign policy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” In addition, Agnew (2003, p. 7) argues that “certain </span><u>geopolitical representations underwrite specific policies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” Next to representations (“what is being said about Russia?”), </span><u>we assign meaning to lines of text by looking into representational practices (“how are things being said about Russia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">?”). These practices are relevant because “when something is recognized as a representational practice rather than an authoritative description, it can be treated as contentious” (Shapiro 1989, p. 20). We use a definition of discourse based on poststructuralism (Campbell 2007, p. 216): “a specific series of representations and practices through which meanings are produced, identities constituted, social relations established, and political... outcomes made more or less possible.” The usefulness of this definition also follows from its assumption that the think tanks’ representations are linked to both their institutional context (“identities”) and policy advice (“political outcomes”). Our study of discursive practices is informed by the work of three critical geopolitical scholars. First, we discuss </span><u>analogies, labels</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and</span> <u>metaphors</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Ó Tuathail 2002, 2006). Second, we search for cases of ‘</span><u>geopolitical othering</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,’ identified by Dalby (1990a, p. 22/23) as “geopolitical processes of cultural dichotomizing, designating identity in distinction from Others.” This representational practice </span><u>seeks to create a dualism in which a representation of one country means that the opposite is true for the other country</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The practice implicitly suggests that the two countries have an entirely different set of values, one being “right” and the other “wrong”. Finally, we investigate the use of</span> <u>narrative closure which could take the form of referring to common truisms and presenting the complex reality “in easy to manage chunks</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” (Sharp 1993, p. 494). </span><u>The practice leads to binary simplicity as the practice avoids complexity and problems that do not generate conclusions in terms of right or wrong. As a result, it dehistoricises, degeographicalises and depoliticises knowledge</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<u>Russophobia today is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> therefore </span><u>rooted</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not in ideological differences but </span><u>in national hatred of a kind that is sadly too common. In these architectures of hatred, selected or invented historical &quot;facts&quot; about the &quot;enemy&quot; nation, its culture, and its racial nature are taken out of context and slotted into prearranged intellectual structures to arraign the unchanging wickedness of the other side. Meanwhile, any counterarguments, or memories of the crimes of one's own are suppressed</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is no more legitimate when directed by Russophobes against Russia than when it is directed by Serb, Greek, or Armenian chauvinists against Turkey, Arabs against Jews, or Jews against Arabs. </span><u>The most worrying aspect of Western Russophobia is that it demonstrates the capacity of too many Western journalists and intellectuals to betray their own professed standards and behave like Victorian jingoists</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or Balkan nationalists</span> <u>when their own national loyalties and hatreds are involved. And these tendencies in turn serve wider needs. Overall, we are living in an exceptionally benign period in human history so far as our own interests are concerned. Yet one cannot live in Washington without becoming aware of the desperate need of certain members of Western elites for new enemies, or resuscitated old ones. This is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> certainly not the wish of most Americans-nor of any other Westerners-and it is </span><u>dangerous. For of one thing we can be sure: a country that is <strong>seen to need enemies</strong> will sooner or later <strong>find them everywhere</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<u>Ever since the Cold War ended, Western officials and commentators have been telling the Russians how they need to grow out of their Cold War attitudes toward the West and Western institutions, and learn to see things in a &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; way</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And there is a good deal of truth in this. At the same time, </span><u>it would have been good if we had subjected our own inherited attitudes toward Russia to a more rigorous scrutiny. For like any other inherited hatred, blind, dogmatic hostility toward Russia leads to bad policies, bad journalism, and the corruption of honest debate-and there is all too much of this hatred in Western portrayals of and comments on Russia</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. From this point of view, an analysis of </span><u>Russophobia has implications that go far beyond Russia. Much of the U.S. foreign policy debate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially on the Republican side, </span><u>is structured around the belief that American policy should be rooted in a robust defense of national interest-and this is probably also the belief of most ordinary Americans</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, this straightforward view coexists with another, equally widespread, view that dominat es the media. It is, in Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's words, that &quot;the United States stands taller than other nations, and therefore sees further.&quot; </span><u>The unspoken assumption here is that America is not only wise but also objective</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, at least in its perceptions: that U.S. policy is influenced by values, but never by national prejudices. The assumption behind much American (and Western) reporting of foreign conflicts is that the writer is morally engaged but ethnically uncommitted and able to turn a benign, all-seeing eye from above on the squabbles of humanity. </span><u>It is impossible to exaggerate how irritating this attitude is elsewhere in the world, or how misleading and dangerous it is for Western audiences who believe it. Not only does it contribute to mistaken policies, but it renders both policymakers and ordinary citizens incapable of understanding the opposition of other nations to those policies. Concerning the Middle East, it seems likely that most Americans genuinely believe that the United States is a neutral and objective broker</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in relations between Israelis and Palestinians-</span><u>which can only appear to an Arab as an almost fantastically bad joke. This belief makes it much more difficult for Americans to comprehend the reasons for</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Palestinian and </span><u>Arab fury at</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> both </span><u>the United States</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and Israel. </span><u>It encourages a Western interpretation of this anger as the manipulation of sheep-like masses by elites. At worst, it can encourage a kind of racism, in which certain nations are classed as irrationally, irredeemably savage and wicked</u><br />

This is not so easy to explain, but there is a sense in which </span><u>the scheme has been deconstructed before even it is constructed</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the real world, away from academic abstractions, consider this: the Black Sea-Danube Canal, first proposed in the time of King Charlemagne, was completed as recently as 1984. In this respect, </span><u>the time for the Bering Strait fixed-link has already passed</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (i.e., the transmigration corridor), </span><u>or it never was</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (De Lobcl), </span><u>or it is the post Cold War present</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Koumal), </span><u>or it is some time in the future, -or, indeed, never.

Yet</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> universalism, whether espoused by nineteenth-century European radicals or twentieth-century American social scientists, hardly resolved the tensions between cultural difference and economic progress.

The socialist-communist utopia,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as </span><u>the last</u><u>form of utopian mentality, is not only less incongruous with reality than the preceding forms, but also</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> progressively </span><u>more congruous with the actual world.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> His basic argument is that </span><strong><u>the history of utopia constitutes a gradual “approximation to real life” and therefore tolls the death knell of utopia</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in its very success at social transformation: Thus, </span><u>after a long tortuous, but heroic development, just at the highest stage of awareness, when history is ceasing to be blind fate, and is becoming more and more man’s own creation, with the relinquishment of utopias, [hu]man[s] would lose his [the] will to shape history and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> therewith his </span><u>ability to understand it.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The socialist idea, in its actualization, has the effect of reducing the utopianism of utopia and leads to the decay of utopia. </span><u>Mannheim perceives that the historical process of the dominant forms of the utopian mentality shows</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “a gradual descent and a closer approximation to real life of a utopia that at one time completely transcended history” and reveals </span><u>a “general subsidence of utopian intensity</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” (222-3). Mannheim is unsettled by his own conclusion that implies the end of utopia. He laments that “</span><u>the complete elimination of reality transcending elements from our world would lead us to a matter-of-factness which ultimately would mean the decay of human will”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (236). Quoting the prophecy of Swiss poet Gottfried Keller, Mannheim wonders whether “[</span><u>t]he ultimate triumph of freedom will be barren</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” (225). Near the end of the discussion, he suggests the symptoms of this barrenness: </span><u>The disappearance of utopia brings about a static state of affairs in which man himself becomes no more than a thing. We would be faced then with the greatest paradox imaginable,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> namely, </span><u>that man, who has achieved the highest degree of rational mastery of existence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, left without any ideals, </span><u>becomes a mere creature of impulses</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (236) If ideology is false consciousness related to dominant hut declining classes, we can imagine a society without it as “the decline of ideology represents a crisis only for certain strata” (236). However, “</span><u>the complete disappearance of the utopian element from human thought and action would mean that human nature</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and human </span><u>development would take on a totally new character”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (236). </span><strong><u>We cannot imagine the complete abandonment of utopia because a society without utopia would be a society without goals.</u></strong> <u>With the loss of illusions, humanity would lose the sense of direction when the victory of a certain matter-of-factness, or congruence, is realized. Mannheim’s typology is incomplete</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, because </span><u>he</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in fact </span><u>neglects the role played by science and technology in realizing utopia.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In the following discussion, </span><u>I will consolidate the technological utopian mentality as one of the major utopias from both the sociological and literary perspective.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The conception of science and technology as significant means to achieve utopia has a long lineage. As Nell Eurich points out in her hook Science ¡n Utopia: A Mighty Design (1967), the background for this form of utopia comes principally from Francis Bacon and his New Atlantis. Bacon’s utopia is essentially a triumph of the scientists whose ideas and innovation provide direction and ways for the realization of a technological utopia. However, </span><u>humanity’s ambivalent attitude toward science and scientists has essentially suppressed this form of utopia. In the history of civilization, humanity always faces a barrier whenever a new science or technology appears in society. The barrier can be termed the ‘Frankenstein barrier”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for the significance of Mary Shelley’s first science fiction novel Frankenstein (1818) (Slusser 5). In this work, the scientist Victor </span><u>Frankenstein arrives on the verge of giving his new creature a future</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a symbol of the future for new science as well, </span><u>when he is asked by his creature to make a bride for it.</u><u>Frankenstein cannot overcome his ambivalence and thus refuses its request</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As a result of his refusal, </span><u>the scientist is forced to retreat from his expanded search for knowledge</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the future of his creature is forsaken. </span><u>Frankenstein’s refusal signifies the persistence of a significant barrier in humanity</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which has remained deep-rooted in Western culture </span><u>and symbolizes the conflict between utilitarian technology and those who greatly doubt the role of science and scientists. In the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> late twentieth century and the beginning of the </span><u>twenty-first century, the technological utopia has become</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even </span><u>more prominent. This</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> form of utopian </span><u>mentality is best found in science fiction, which</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, at its best, </span><u>not only provides the most supple and popular means of exploring questions of diversity and difference, but also opens</u><u>up new possibilities and makes us think. In s</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">cience </span><u>f</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">iction, </span><u>we can find utopia that effectively addresses the</u><u>questions that have defined the age we live in: technology, gender, race, ideology, history</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and so on. As a genre of ideas, </span><u>science fiction has been able to portray technological utopia in vivid and popular ways.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">After analyzing eight science fiction texts from the Western and Oriental cultures, I would like to conclude this section by a discussion on the characteristics of technological utopia. </span><u>This form of utopia emphasizes the roles of intellectuals and scientists. The dominant desire of this utopian mentality is the technological utopia that embraces the power of science and technology, as well as preserving the identifying and legitimizing power of humanity</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the present status quo. </span><u>The embodiment of forces in ideology and utopia simultaneously makes the progress to technological utopia become a spiral movement.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Like the socialist-communist utopian mentality, </span><u>it is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><u>considered the best possible form to bridge the gap between the dream and the present state of things</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.23 With the progression in science and technology at different strategic moments, especially in the aspects of cyberspace, cyborg and space travel that we have discussed, humanity can realize its ago-old desire of transcending the mind, the body, and space respectively. As the discussion of the science fiction texts shows, </span><u>these technological metaphors provide both ideological and utopian functions to humanity and make the technological utopia a spiral movement to the perfect state of being. The sense of time in this form is seen as a series of strategic points in history, rather than a gradual progress in the liberal-humanist idea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Every new breakthrough in science or technology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or a Novum 24 </span><u>represents a strategic point</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in technological utopia. The technologies of cyberspace, cyborg, and space travel are most important nova, or utopian metaphors, which transcend the limitations of the mind, body and space respectively for humanity. Nevertheless, technological utopia shares with the liberal ideas that the location of a perfect world is in the future, in the time when various limiting conditions of humanity are transcended by the means of new science and technology as in the case of all the science fiction texts that I have studied. In Neuromancer and “Dream-cutting romance,” the strategic point for the advancement of the spiral movement in technological utopia is signified by the upgrade of cybernetic technology as well as the merge between humanity and technological entities. In Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, the breakthrough is represented by scientific experiment and the understanding of human mind by dream reading. Similarly, in The Positronic Man, Ghost in the Shell and The Ultimate War of Super-brains, the strategic moment for the spiral movement is embodied by the upgrade of the robotic entities to become more human, mortal and organic. Finally, the breakthrough in achieving technological utopia is shown in the transcendence of Kelvin and Bowman in Solaris and 2001 respectively. </span><br />

<strong>Our call to imagine what the government might do forces us out of our current subject position—the ability to imagine another role is the foundation of ethical engagement with the Other</strong><br />
<strong>EPSTEIN 1999</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Mikhail, Associate Professor in the Department of Russian and East Asian Languages and Cultures at Emory University, Transcultural Experiments: Russian and American Models of Creative Communication, p. 164-166</span><br />
<br />
<u>Transcultural theory needs to articulate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its own ethics, which can be called </span><u>an ethics of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>imagination</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Traditionally, imagination was considered to be the capacity least bound to ethical responsibility, incompatible with or even antagonistic to ethical imperatives. The longstanding debates between ethics and aesthetics targeted exactly this opposition between moral norms and free imagination, between duty and desire, between reason and fantasy. However, if we look at the most common and established ethical rule as it is inscribed in the heritage of many cultures—Christian, Chinese, Greek—we find an implicit call for imagination as expressed in the requirement that we &quot;do unto others as we would have them do unto us.&quot; This presupposes a kind of commonness between ourselves and others that cannot be found in actual existence and empirical experience—we are all different. </span><u>Without imagination a person would be unable to put him/herself in the position of others or to put others in his/her own position</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One has to be imaginative to be righteous. One has to imagine what other people may need, dream of, and aspire to in order to respond adequately to their needs. Percy Bysshe Shelly has expressed succinctly this link between morality and imagination in his &quot;A Defence of Poetry&quot; : &quot;A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own.&quot;1 Bur there is much more to this imaginative aspect of ethics than just identifying oneself with others. Two modifications may be added to the golden rule to embrace those aspects of ethics that are not reducible to a commonness between myself and others, between the subjects and objects of ethical actions. The first addition would refer to the uniqueness of the ethical subject as distinct from the ethical object. &quot;Do unto others as we would have them do unto us . . . but as nobody else could do unto them except for us.&quot; The uniqueness of the ethical subject would be crucial in cases when among the many needs of others are those to which the given subject is uniquely or exclusively qualified to respond. The action that will be ethically preferable is that which no one can accomplish except for me and that which no one can do better than me. Since I am different from the other, the ethical relationship between us should be based on our mutual irre-ducibility. The basic rule of differential ethics thus can be formulated in this way: Do what no other person in the same situation could do in your place. Act in such a way that your most individual abilities meet the most individual needs of the other. This is also true for our expectations from other people. Not only what we do to others, but whar we expect them to do for us, is an ethically marked position. A totalitarian politics that forced a violinist to take an ax and cut wood to provide heat during an energy shortage was ethically reprehensible though it claimed to be truly humanistic as expressing equal concern about the needs of all people. From the standpoint of the ethics of difference, the musician should not only be allowed but encouraged to respond to those specific needs of people that he is in a unique position to answer. Reduction of individual abilities to the more general needs is what underlies the crude, politically dominated ethics of &quot;mass societies.&quot; Thus </span><u>an ethical subject has to imagine not only what makes other people similar</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to him </span><u>but what makes them different</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is a more complex task for the imagination. It is easier to imagine that other people need heat and food in the same way as you do than to project their specific intentions and expectations, which might completely escape the range of your interests. This second level of ethical concern involves imagining the other as the other, in his or her irreducibility to any common model of humanness. </span><u>Finally</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the third level of </span><u>ethics involves</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not others as myself and not others as others but </span><u>myself as other. This capacity to be a stranger to oneself, to go beyond one's inborn or socially constructed identity is not just a creative possibility but also an ethical responsibility. Without being different from oneself one can never find points of commonality or dialogical interaction with people of different cultures and ways of life</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Jacques Derrida rightly observes, &quot;it is because I am not one with myself that I can speak with the other and address the other. &quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="Underline">Judeo-Christian ethics is focused on the notion of &quot;neighbor,&quot; the nearest and closest one; but what about love of, or at least responsiveness to, the distant ones? Nietzsche attempted to introduce this imperative— &quot;love to a distant one&quot;—into ethics but his anti-Christian stance caused him to ignore love for those nearest and actually grew into contempt toward his own &quot;neighbors&quot;—contemporaries, compatriots, colleagues, co-humans, and others in proximity. It is interesting that although Soviet ethical doctrines never explicitly acknowledged Nietzsche's influence, they were based on a similar principle: The distant ones were privileged over neighbors in the value hierarchy of a typical Soviet citizen. He had to love his comrades, his class brothers, and the exploited toiling masses all over the world but was required to denounce his family members on the basis of their disloyalty to the state. Soviet ethics was devoid of imagination and did not recognize the right of model citizens to multiple identities or alterations of identity. In fact, </span><span class="Underline">love for distant ones or at least the ability to interact with them depends on the capacity of a given subject to be different from himself to embrace an unlimited range of virtual or potential identities. In distinction from the ethics of commonality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as prescribed in the golden rule, </span><span class="Underline">and in distinction from the differential ethics of uniqueness, </span>the third level can be posited as an interferential ethics of multiplied identities and transformational possibilities that is certainly most appealing to the capacities of the imagination<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>EPSTEIN 1999</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Mikhail, Associate Professor in the Department of Russian and East Asian Languages and Cultures at Emory University, Transcultural Experiments: Russian and American Models of Creative Communication, p. 166-168)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Though ethics is usually presented as a set of rules and norms of behavior, this does not imply that the contents of ethics should be as normative and prescriptive as its forms are. </span><u>Ethical prescriptions include the freedom from prescriptions. This paradoxical element of ethics cannot be</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> fully </span><u>eliminated</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. When Christ said, &quot;Know the truth, and the truth will set you free,&quot; He expressed in prescriptive form the freedom from all prescriptions. If we look at the most elementary forms of ethics, such as politeness and courtesy, we find that even these most routine models of morality are based on the presumption of human freedom. </span><u>If you need</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> somebody to give you a glass of </span><u>water, the polite way to express this need will be not an imperative or a command but a suggestion</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, &quot;Would you please be so kind as to bring me a glass of water?&quot; &quot;Would it be possible for you to do this or that?&quot; </span><u>The politeness is implied in the modality &quot;would,&quot; which transforms the action from the actual or imperative modality to a subjunctive mode. My need has to be transformed into somebody else's possibility or opportunity in order to be presented ethically</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (politely). </span><u>The imperative &quot;Do this&quot; is applied only</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> between parents and children or officers and soldiers, thus </span><u>marking the relation of power or authority. But insofar as ethics challenges this power relation, it has to transform any command into a suggestion, every imperative into a subjunctive</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If this is true on the level of elementary politeness, </span><u>how much more important it must be on the level of the higher moral initiatives that are addressed to others. Even in the most fundamental and global issues of war and peace, power and freedom, authority and equality, discipline and responsibility, ethics should appeal to possibilities rather than impose necessity and constraints</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <u>Often the same person who uses the subjunctive &quot;Would you&quot; when asking for a glass of water would use a categorical imperative, demanding that humanity obey</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> his </span><u>grand ethical schemes and prescriptions. Almost all our discourses and the <strong>procedures of teaching</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and writing </span><u>are imbued with the imperative mode</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: Do as I do, do as I say, do as I write. </span><u>Every interpretation avers its conclusive truthfulness instead of suggesting itself as just a possibility, a discourse in a subjunctive mode. <strong>All disciplines of scholarship</strong> and interpretation would benefit by incorporating these zones of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> politeness, </span><u>potentiality, and imagination, which are</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not only an &quot;excess&quot; of aesthetic subjectivity but are first of all </span><u>modes of ethical responsiveness that <strong>multiply the levels of freedom</strong> in our readers, students, interlocutors, instead of forcing their minds into our own persuasions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ethics is the domain of requests rather than commands, the domain of imagination rather than obligation. The commandments pronounced by God cannot help but be obligatory if we identify ourselves with the people of God and recognize the hierarchy that connects heavenly Father and earthly children. However, if ethics should be understood as a specific domain regulating the relationship between brothers and sisrers and distinct from the religious domain regulating the relationship between Father and children, we should formulate the principles of this ethics in a noncommanding mode, as a system of requests and proposals appealing to the freedom of the other person, to his &quot;maybe or maybe not.&quot; </span><u>Certainly, this ethics &quot;in the subjunctive mood&quot; is much more favorable to the work of the transcultural imagination than an ethics that <strong>prescribes us to obey already established laws</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Thus, in addition to the golden rule of commonness, </span><u>we need a differential and interferential ethics based on imagining others as different from ourselves and <strong>imagining ourselves as possibilities for others</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<strong>GERLICZ 2009</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (By Dr. Claude Gaudeau de Gerlicz, Chair, Bioespas, Bioinformatic and Biotechnology Laboratory, France, “Great Projects as Potential Peace Engines,” March 19, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.upf.org/bering-strait-project/193-bering-strait-research/1682-great-projects-as-potential-peace-engines" rel="nofollow">http://www.upf.org/bering-strait-project/193-bering-strait-research/1682-great-projects-as-potential-peace-engines</a>)</span><br />
<br />
<u>Humanity has always sought to gather around great projects to decrease social tensions or transcend political, ethnic, or religious boundaries</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This has been particularly true since second half of the twentieth century. </span><u>More than ever, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, faced with recurring problems of wars, pollution, globalization, and energy reserves, people wonder about the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> medium- and long-term </span><u>future of our planet as a whole</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. From an economic, political, legal, and technological points of view, we will consider two great projects of world scope: the construction of a tunnel under the Bering Strait and the conquest of Mars. </span><u>The proposal of a tunnel connecting America to Asia through the Bering Strait constitutes a great project that can help bring the American and Asian countries closer together</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Already in 1902, a French explorer, Loek de Lobel, approached the Russian Imperial Technical Society with a proposal to explore a future railway line connecting Yakutsk across the Bering Strait to an existing railroad track in Alaska. In October 1906, the Russian Government Commission on the creation of the Great Northern Route held discussions attended by four Americans, a Canadian, and a French representative. It was decided to task Lobel and an American engineer, Waddel, with studying the technical parameters of the project. Construction of a tunnel was to be undertaken by a New Jersey construction company under a 90-year contract.*</span><br />

The challenges today<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are great, and the rise of China is the most obvious of them. But they </span>are not greater than the challenges the United States faced during the Cold War<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Only in retrospect can the Cold War seem easy. Americans at the end of World War II faced a major strategic crisis. The Soviet Union, if only by virtue of its size and location, seemed to threaten vital strategic centers in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia. In all these regions, it confronted nations devastated and prostrate from the war.</span> To meet this challenge, the United States had to project its own power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which was great but limited, into each of those regions. </span>It had to form alliances<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with local powers, some of them former enemies</span>, and provide them with economic, political, and military assistance<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to help them stand on their own feet and resist Soviet pressure. In the Cold War, the Soviets wielded influence and put pressure on American interests merely by standing still, while the United States had to scramble. It is worth recalling that this strategy of “containment,” now hallowed by its apparent success, struck some influential observers at the time as entirely unworkable. Walter Lippmann attacked it as “misconceived,” based on “hope,” conceding the “strategic initiative” to the Soviets while the United States exhausted its resources trying to establish “satellite states, puppet governments” that were weak, ineffective, and unreliable. Today, in the case of China, the situation is reversed</span>. Although China is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and will be much </span><u>[[#|rich]]</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">er, and will wield greater economic influence in the world than the Soviet Union ever did, </span>its geostrategic position is more difficult<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. World War II left China in a comparatively weak position from which it has been working hard to recover ever since. </span>Several of its neighbors are strong nations with <u>[[#|close]]</u> <u>[[#|ties]]</u> to the United States. It will have a hard time becoming a regional hegemon<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> so long as Taiwan remains independent and strategically tied to the United States, and </span>so long as <span style="font-size: 8pt;">strong </span>regional powers<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> such as Japan, Korea, and Australia </span><u>[[#|continue]]</u> to host <u>[[#|American]]</u> troops and bases<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>China would need at least a few allies<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to have any chance of pushing the United States out of its strongholds in the western Pacific</span>, but right now it is the United States that has the allies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>It is the United States that has its troops deployed in forward bases. It is the United States that currently enjoys naval predominance in the key waters and waterways through which China must trade<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Altogether, </span>China’s task as a rising great power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is to push the United States out of its present position</span>, is much harder than America’s task<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is only to hold on to what it has. Can the United States do that? In their pessimistic mood today, some Americans doubt that it can. Indeed, they doubt whether the United States can afford to continue playing in any part of the world the predominant role that it has played in the past. Some argue that while Paul Kennedy’s warning of imperial overstretch may not have been correct in 1987, it accurately describes America’s current predicament. </span>The fiscal crisis, the deadlocked political system, the various maladies of American society<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (including wage stagnation and income inequality</span>), the weaknesses of the educational system, the deteriorating infrastructure<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—all of these </span>are <u>[[#|cited]]</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> these days </span>as reasons why the United States needs to retrench<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> internationally, to pull back from some overseas commitments, to focus on “nation building at home” rather than try to keep shaping the world as it has in the past. Again, </span>these common assumptions require some examination<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For one thing, </span>how “overstretched” is the United States? The answer, in historical terms, is not nearly as much as people imagine.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Consider the straightforward matter of the number of troops that the United States deploys overseas. To listen to the debate today, one might imagine there were more American troops committed abroad than ever before. But that is not remotely the case. In 1953, the United States had almost one million troops deployed overseas—325,000 in combat in Korea and more than 600,000 stationed in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. In 1968, it had over one million troops on foreign soil—537,000 in Vietnam and another half million stationed elsewhere. By contrast, in the summer of 2011, at the height of America’s deployments in its two wars, there were about 200,000 troops deployed in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan combined, and another roughly 160,000 troops stationed in Europe and East Asia. Altogether, and including other forces stationed around the world, there were about 500,000 troops deployed overseas. This was lower even than the peacetime deployments of the Cold War. In 1957, for instance, there were over 750,000 troops deployed overseas. Only in the decade between the breakup of the Soviet empire and the attacks of September 11 was the number of deployed forces overseas lower than it is today. The comparison is even more striking if one takes into account the growth of the American population. When the United States had one million troops deployed overseas in 1953, the total American population was only 160 million. Today, when there are half a million troops deployed overseas, the American population is 313 million</span>. The country is twice as large, with half as many troops deployed as fifty years ago.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> What about the financial expense? </span>Many seem to believe that the cost of these deployments<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and of the armed forces generally</span>, is a major contributor to the soaring fiscal deficits<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that threaten the solvency of the national economy. </span>But this is not the case<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, either. As the former budget czar Alice Rivlin has observed, the scary projections of </span>future deficits are not “caused by rising defense spending,” much less by spending on foreign assistance<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The runaway deficits<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> projected for the coming years </span>are mostly the result of<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ballooning </span>entitlement spending<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even the most draconian cuts in the defense budget would produce annual savings of only $50 billion to $100 billion, a small fraction—between 4 and 8 percent—of the $1.5 trillion in annual deficits the United States is facing. In 2002, when Paul Kennedy was marveling at America’s ability to remain “the world’s single superpower on the cheap,” the United States was spending about 3.4 percent of GDP on defense. Today it is spending a little under 4 percent, and in years to come, that is likely to head lower again—still “cheap” by historical standards</span>. The cost of remaining the world’s predominant power is not prohibitive. If we are serious about this exercise in accounting,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> moreover, </span>the costs of maintaining this position cannot be measured without considering the costs of losing it<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Some of the costs of reducing the American role in the world are, of course, unquantifiable. </span>What is it worth to Americans to live in a world dominated by democracies rather than by autocracies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">? But some of the potential costs could be measured, if anyone cared to try. </span>If the decline of American military power produced an unraveling of the international economic <u>[[#|order]]</u> that American power has helped sustain; if trade routes and waterways ceased to be as secure, because the U.S. Navy was no longer able to defend them; if regional wars broke out among great powers because they were no longer constrained by the American superpower; if American allies were attacked because the United States appeared unable to come to their defense; if the generally free and open nature of the international system became less so—if all this came to pass, there would be measurable costs.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And it is not too far-fetched to imagine that these costs would be far greater than the savings gained by cutting the defense and foreign aid budgets by $100 billion a year. You can save money by buying a used car without a warranty and without certain safety features, but what happens when you get into an accident? </span>American military strength reduces the risk of accidents by deterring conflict, and lowers the price of the accidents that occur by reducing the chance of losing.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> These savings need to be part of the calculation, too. As a simple matter of dollars and cents, </span>it may be a lot cheaper to preserve the current level of American involvement in the world than to reduce it. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Perhaps the greatest concern underlying the declinist mood at large in the country today is not really whether the United States can afford to continue playing its role in the world. It is whether the Americans are capable of solving any of their most pressing economic and social problems. As many statesmen and commentators have asked, can Americans do what needs to be done to compete effectively in the twenty-first-century world? The only honest answer is, who knows? If American history is any guide, however, there is at least some reason to be hopeful.</span> Americans have <u>[[#|experienced]]</u> this unease before,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and many previous generations have also felt this sense of lost vigor and lost virtue: as long ago as 1788, Patrick Henry lamented the nation’s fall from past glory, “when the American spirit was in its youth.” There have been many times over the past two centuries when the political system was dysfunctional, hopelessly gridlocked, and seemingly unable to find solutions to crushing national problems—from slavery and then Reconstruction, to the dislocations of industrialization at the end of the nineteenth century and the crisis of social welfare during the Great Depression, to the confusions and paranoia of the early Cold War years. Anyone who honestly recalls the 1970s, with Watergate, Vietnam, stagflation, and the energy crisis, cannot really believe that our present difficulties are unrivaled. Success in the past does not guarantee success in the future. But one thing does seem clear from the historical evidence: </span>the American system, for all its often stultifying qualities, has also shown a greater capacity to adapt and recover from difficulties than many other nations, including its geopolitical competitors<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>This undoubtedly has something to do with the relative freedom of American society, which rewards innovators, often outside the existing power structure, for producing new ways of doing things; and with the relatively open political system of America, which allows movements to gain steam and to influence the behavior of the political establishment.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The American system is slow and clunky in part because the Founders designed it that way, with a federal structure, checks and balances, and a written Constitution and Bill of Rights—but the system also possesses a remarkable ability to undertake changes just when the steam kettle looks about to blow its lid. There are occasional “critical elections” that allow transformations to occur, providing new political solutions to old and apparently insoluble problems. Of course, there are no guarantees: the political system could not resolve the problem of slavery without war. But on many big issues throughout their history, Americans have found a way of achieving and implementing a national consensus. When Paul Kennedy was marveling at the continuing success of the American superpower back in 2002, he noted that one of the main reasons had been the ability of Americans to overcome what had appeared to him in 1987 as an insoluble long-term economic crisis. American businessmen and politicians “reacted strongly to the debate about ‘decline’ by taking action: cutting costs, making companies leaner and meaner, investing in newer technologies, promoting a communications revolution, trimming government deficits, all of which helped to produce significant year-on-year advances in productivity.” </span>It is possible to imagine that Americans may rise to this latest economic challenge as well<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is also reasonable to expect that </span>other nations will<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as in the past, </span>run into difficulties of their own. None of the nations currently enjoying economic miracles is without problems<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Brazil, India, Turkey, and Russia all have bumpy histories that suggest the route ahead will not be one of simple and smooth ascent. There is a real question whether the autocratic model of China, which can be so effective in making some strategic decisions about the economy in the short term, can over the long run be flexible enough to permit adaptation to a changing international economic, political, and strategic environment. In sum: </span>it may be more than good fortune that has allowed the United States in the past to come through crises and emerge stronger and healthier than other nations while its various competitors have faltered.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And it may be more than just wishful thinking to believe that it may do so again. But </span>there is a danger<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is that in the meantime, </span>while the nation continues to struggle, Americans may convince themselves that decline is indeed inevitable<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span>or that the United States can take a time-out <span style="font-size: 8pt;">from its global responsibilities while it gets its own house in order. To many Americans, accepting decline may provide a welcome escape from the moral and material burdens that have weighed on them since World War II. Many may unconsciously yearn to return to the way things were in 1900, when the United States was rich, powerful, and not responsible for world order. </span>The underlying assumption of such a <u>[[#|course]]</u> is that the present world order will more or less persist without American power,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or at least with much less of it</span>; or that others can pick up the slack<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; or simply that the benefits of the world order are permanent and require no special exertion by anyone. Unfortunately, </span>the present world order—with its widespread freedoms, its general prosperity, and its absence of great power conflict—is as fragile as it is unique<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>Preserving it has been a struggle in every decade, and will remain a struggle in the decades to come. Preserving the present world order requires constant American leadership and constant American commitment<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the end, the decision is in the hands of Americans. </span>Decline<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as Charles Krauthammer has observed, </span>is a choice. It is not an inevitable fate<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—at least not yet. Empires and great powers rise and fall, and the only question is when. But the when does matter. Whether the United States begins to decline over the next two decades or not for another two centuries will matter a great deal, both to Americans and to the nature of the world they live in.</span><br />

We take a lot for granted about the way the world looks today -- the widespread freedom<span class="Underline">, the unprecedented </span>global prosperity<span class="Underline"> (even despite the current economic crisis), </span>and the <u>[[#|absence]]</u> of war among great powers.In 1941 there were only a dozen democracies in the world. Today there are more than 100.<span class="Underline"> For four centuries prior to 1950, global GDP rose by less than 1 percent a year. Since 1950 it has risen by an average of 4 percent a year, and </span>billions <span class="Underline">of people </span>have been lifted out of poverty. The first half of the 20th century saw the two most destructive wars in the history of [hu]mankind, and in prior centuries war among great powers was almost constant. But for the past 60 years no great powers have gone to war. This is the world America made when it assumed global leadership<span class="Underline"> after World War II. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Would this world order survive if America declined as a great power? Some American intellectuals insist that a &quot;Post-American&quot; world need not look very different from the American world and that all we need to do is &quot;manage&quot; American decline. But that is wishful thinking. </span><span class="Underline">If the balance of power shifts in the direction of other powers, the world order will inevitably change to suit their interests and preferences.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Take the issue of democracy. For several decades, the balance of power in the world has favored democratic governments. </span>In a<span class="Underline"> genuinely </span>post-American world, the balance would shift toward the great power autocracies.<span class="Underline"> Both </span>China and Russia already protect dictators<span class="Underline"> like Syria's Bashar al-Assad. If they gain greater relative influence in the future, we will see fewer democratic transitions and more autocrats hanging on to power. What about the free market, free trade economic order? People assume China and other rising powers that have benefited so much from the present system would have a stake in preserving it. They wouldn't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. But</span> China's form of capitalism is heavily dominated by the state, with the ultimate goal being preservation of the ruling party.<span class="Underline"> Although the Chinese have been beneficiaries of an open international economic order, they could end up undermining it simply because,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as an autocratic society, </span><span class="Underline">their priority is to preserve the state's control of wealth and the power it brings. They might kill the goose because they can't figure out how to keep both it and themselves alive. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Finally, what about the long peace that has held among the great powers for the better part of six decades? Many people imagine that American predominance will be replaced by some kind of multipolar harmony. But </span>multipolar systems have historically been neither stable nor peaceful.<span class="Underline">War among the great powers was a common, if not constant, occurrence in the long periods of multipolarity in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The 19th century was notable for two stretches of great-power peace of roughly four decades each, punctuated, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">however, </span><span class="Underline">by major wars among great powers and culminating in World War I, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the most destructive and deadly war mankind had known up to that point. The era of American predominance has shown that </span>there is no better recipe for great-power peace than certainty about who holds the upper hand.Many<span class="Underline"> people </span>view the present<span class="Underline"> international </span><u>[[#|order]]</u> as the inevitable result of human progress<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a combination of advancing science and technology, an increasingly global economy, strengthening international institutions, evolving &quot;norms&quot; of international behavior, and the gradual but inevitable triumph of liberal democracy over other forms of government -- </span><span class="Underline">forces of change that transcend the actions of men and nations. </span>But there was nothing inevitable about the world that was created after World War II.International order is not an evolution; it is an imposition.It is the domination of one vision over others<span class="Underline"> -- in America's case, </span>the<span class="Underline"> domination of </span>liberal<span class="Underline"> free market principles of economics, democratic principles of politics, and a peaceful international system that supports these, over other visions that other nations and peoples may have</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline">The present </span><u>[[#|order]]</u> will last only as long as those who favor it and benefit from it retain the will and capacity to defend it.If<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and when </span>American power declines, the institutions and norms American power has supported will <span class="Underline">decline, too</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline">Or they may </span>collapse <span class="Underline">altogether as we transition </span>into<span class="Underline"> another kind of world order, or into </span>disorder<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We may discover then that </span><span class="Underline">the United States was essential to keeping the present world order together and that </span>the alternative to American power was not peace and harmony but chaos and catastrophe<span class="Underline">-- which was what the world looked like right before the American order came into being.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Even this scenario is optimistic, for </span>superpowers are by definition willing to encroach on the turf of others<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—changing the world map in the process. Much as in geology, such tectonic shifts always result in earthquakes, particularly as rising powers tread on the entrenched position of the reigning hegemon.56 </span><span class="Underline">The sole exception was the twentieth century Anglo-American transition in which Great Britain and the United States were allies and shared a common culture—and even that took two world wars to complete</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.57 </span>As the relative levels of power of <span class="Underline">the three </span>superpowers draw closer, the temptation <span class="Underline">of the number-two </span>to preemptively knock out the king on the hill grows, as does the lead power’s incentive to preventatively attack <span class="Underline">and weaken </span>its<span class="Underline"> ascending </span>rival<span class="Underline"> before being eclipsed</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.58 David Hume wrote, “It is not a great disproportion between ourselves and others which produces envy, but on the contrary, a proximity.”59 While the density of contacts among the three superpowers makes the creation of a society of states more possible than ever—all the foreign ministers have one anothers’ mobile phone numbers—the deep differences in interests among the three make forging a “culture of peace” more challenging than ever.60 China seas, hyperterrorism with nuclear weapons, an attack in the Gulf of Aden or the Straits of Malacca. </span><span class="Underline">The uncertain alignments of lesser but still substantial powers such as Russia, Japan, and India could also cause escalation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span>America’s foreign lenders could pull the plug<span class="Underline"> to undermine its grand strategy, </span>sparking economic turmoil, political acrimony, and military tension.<span class="Underline"> War brings profit to the military-industrial complex and is always supported by the large patriotic camps on all sides</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Yet the notion of a Sino-U.S. rivalry to lead the world is also premature and simplistic, for in the event of their conflict, Europe would be the winner, as capital would flee to its sanctuaries.

<strong>Carrier reductions are coming now—maintaining the fleet is key to US power</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Of course, </span><span class="Underline">today's </span>carriers<span class="Underline"> make World War Two carriers look like toys. With nuclear propulsion, supersonic fighters, and over four acres of deck space, they </span>are the biggest warships in history.

But with big bills coming from the Obama Administration and other items like healthcare costs pressuring Navy budgets, the service has repeatedly sought relief from that requirement. This year's quadrennial review is the likely venue for another such bid. </span><span class="Underline">The issue is coming to a head now because </span>the pace of new carrier commissionings is not keeping up with the rate of retirements.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Kitty Hawk, the last carrier in the fleet powered by fossil fuels, was removed from the force last summer after nearly 50 years of service. </span>The Navy plans to decommission the<span class="Underline"> nuclear-powered </span>Enterprise in November<span class="Underline"> of 2012, leaving the fleet with only the ten flattops of the Nimitz class for three years, until the next-generation Ford class of carriers debuts in September of 2015. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Going to ten isn't supposed to happen under present law, but since the service hasn't made budgetary provisions for maintaining the Enterprise and its crew until the Ford class arrives</span><span class="Underline">, </span>it looks like ten carriers will be the total number in the fleet<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the current budget environment, </span><span class="Underline">once the Navy gets used to having ten carriers, that's probably where it will stay.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Navy insiders think the service will decide to forego the refueling of the Lincoln, which is scheduled for 2012. </span><span class="Underline">And when the decision to stay at ten is formalized, the service can also move to eliminate one of its carrier wings.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> That step would cut the Navy's projected shortfall in strike aircraft by half. So billions of dollars are saved by skipping the refueling, cutting the purchase of aircraft, and eliminating the need to sustain 6,000 personnel associated with ship operations and air-wing support. </span><span class="Underline">There's only one problem with all </span>this.<span class="Underline"> It </span>reduces the nation's capacity to project power from the sea at the same time access to foreign bases is becoming doubtful.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">And why is such a move necessary? Because the Obama Administration has decided to stick with Bush-era plans to grow the size of ground forces by 92,000 personnel, and the Navy must pay part of the bill for that. Yet the administration is getting ready to depart Iraq, which was the main reason for increasing the size of ground forces in the first place. </span>There are<span class="Underline"> precious </span>few<span style="font-size: 8pt;">other </span><span class="Underline">places where </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the</span><span class="Underline"> warfighting </span>scenarios<span style="font-size: 8pt;">for the next QDR</span><span class="Underline"> suggest </span>[where] a big ground force will be needed.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">State government facilities include those owned or leased by all levels of government and can be located domestically and overseas. Many of these facilities such as courthouses, education facilities, libraries, and archives are open to the public and provide important government services. Other facilities contain highly sensitive information, materials, processes, and equipment such as military installations, embassies, and research facilities and are not open to the public. These facilities, varied in function, size, and location, are differentiated from other CIKR sectors because they are uniquely governmental. </span>The abundance of government facilities and military<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> related </span>infrastructure in Virginia coupled with their symbolic nature and past attacks on such infrastructure in the U.S. suggests this sector remains especially vulnerable to exploitation by terrorist and extremist groups.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Potential Trend(s) Impacting Sector </span>Due to the desire of most international and many domestic groups to target the U.S. government, trends of significance include terrorism tradecraft techniques of surveillance, elicitation, and security probes<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The trend of illicit entry into the U.S. also affects this sector, as many individuals will enter government facilities to obtain necessary documentation. </span>Local, state, and federal government facilities are highly interconnected, both physically and through cyber networks.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Efforts to identify, understand, and analyze interdependencies and dependencies are challenging because of the diversity and complexity of these facilities or components. Interdependencies vary widely and each has its own characteristics, whether physical, cyber, or geographic in nature. Virginia facilities may be impacted by the closure of Guantanamo Bay; a recent report by the House Armed Services Committee has recommended government sites in Quantico and Norfolk as possible transfer locations for current Guantanamo detainees. According to early February 2009 reporting, a task force has 30 days to recommend where to put the 245 remaining detainees.451 Potential Threat Group(s) Local, state, and federal </span>government facilities represent attractive targets for a wide variety of groups<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

The<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Government Buildings and </span>Military Installations sector is expected to remain an important and potentially vulnerable sector at risk for surveillance, infiltration, or attacks<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by groups with nefarious intentions. It is anticipated the VFC will continue to receive reporting of potential surveillance or probing of government and military facilities. </span>Interest as a Target: Remain High - Due to the symbolic nature and the potential operational disruption<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, facilities within this sector may be desirable, if not necessarily feasible targets for many international and domestic groups. Number of Virginia-based assets: Remain Constant – Current economic conditions make expansion unlikely, but industries that support government and military functions will not likely face the same contraction of other sectors. Interdependencies: Significant - </span>These sectors are heavily reliant on energy, IT, and telecommunications, as well as each major transportation mode. The interruption of government<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or CIKR </span>could quickly cascade and have significant impact on other sectors<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially those that are highly regulated.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) on Mayport homeporting alternatives was released in November 2008. The FEIS examined 12 alternatives for homeporting additional surface ships at Mayport. Four of the 12 alternatives involved homeporting a CVN; another four involved making Mayport capable of homeporting a CVN, but not immediately homeporting a CVN there; and the remaining four did not involve making Mayport capable of homeporting a CVN. Ten of the 12 alternatives also involved transferring additional ships other than a CVN— various combinations of cruisers, destroyers, frigates, large-deck amphibious assault ships (LHDs), and other amphibious ships (LPDs and LSDs)—to Mayport. The FEIS also assessed a 13th alternative of homeporting no additional ships at Mayport. </span>Homeporting a single additional<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ship—a </span>CVN—was Alternative 4<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The FEIS identified Alternative 4 as </span>the Navy’s preferred alternative.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The FEIS, like the January 2009 ROD, stated that a key reason for the Navy’s desire to transfer a CVN to Mayport is </span>to hedge against the risk of a catastrophic event that could damage the Navy’s CVN homeporting facilities in the Hampton Roads area<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of Virginia. The FEIS stated: Based on a thorough review of the alternatives, the Department of the Navy has determined Alternative 4 to be its Preferred Alternative. </span>Alternative 4 involves homeporting one CVN, dredging, infrastructure and wharf improvements, and construction of CVN nuclear propulsion plant maintenance facilities.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Factors that influenced selection of Alternative 4 as the Preferred Alternative included impact analysis in the EIS, estimated costs of implementation, including military construction and other operation and sustainment costs, and strategic dispersal considerations. </span>Homeporting a CVN at NAVSTA Mayport would enhance distribution of CVN homeport locations to reduce risks to fleet resources in the event of natural disaster, [hu]manmade calamity, or attack by foreign nations or terrorists. This includes risks to aircraft carriers, industrial support facilities, and the people that operate and maintain those crucial assets<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span>The aircraft carriers of the United States Navy are <strong>vital strategic assets</strong> that serve our national interests in both peace and war. The President calls upon them for their <strong>unique ability</strong> to provide <strong>both deterrence and combat support</strong> in times of crisis<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of the 11 aircraft carriers currently in service, five are assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. </span>Utilizing the capacity at<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> NAVSTA </span>Mayport<span style="font-size: 8pt;">to homeport a CVN </span>disperses critical Atlantic Fleet assets to reduce risks, thereby enhancing operational readiness.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The purpose of the proposed action is to ensure effective support of fleet operational requirements through efficient use of waterfront and shore side facilities at NAVSTA Mayport. </span>The<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review </span>(QDR) called for<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the Department of Defense (DoD) to be capable of </span>swiftly defeating aggression in overlapping conflicts<span class="Underline"> worldwide. This required the Navy to modify its operational philosophy and to ensure it was capable of providing more warfighting assets, more quickly, to multiple locations. In Navy terms, this is </span>called surge capability<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – or the ability to send trained naval battle forces in addition to those currently deployed. The Navy adopted the Fleet Response Plan (FRP) institutionalizing an enhanced naval surge capability. Under the guidance of USFF, the fleet training cycle has been adjusted with refined maintenance, modernization, manning, and training processes to enable the fleet to consistently sustain a level of at least six surge capable carrier strike groups available within 30 days, and one additional strike group able to deploy within 90 days of an emergency order. Achieving this higher level of surge capability is a difficult task requiring Navy ships and Sailors to maintain an appropriate level of training (or readiness) for longer periods of time, while continuing to achieve ship maintenance and Sailor quality of life standards. The Navy has developed plans for ashore infrastructure to ensure appropriate support of the FRP and the Navy’s required operational battle force. While budgetary decisions drive the trend to consolidate or reduce the number of Navy bases overall, </span>retaining bases in dispersed locations<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nationwide and worldwide </span>supports the FRP and the operational battle force.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Required capabilities at Navy bases are driven by strategic/geographic location and fleet operational readiness. USFF has finite berthing capacity for surface ships in the turning basin at NAVSTA Mayport. NAVSTA </span>Mayport<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span>has<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> established shore support </span>capacity<span class="Underline"> for ship maintenance and repair</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as well as military personnel support facilities, </span>not being fully utilized<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Navy will begin in 2010 to decommission frigates currently homeported at NAVSTA Mayport. The Navy needs to utilize the available facilities at NAVSTA Mayport, both pierside and shoreside, in an effective and efficient manner, thereby minimizing new construction. The CNO has directed USFF to review and assess a broad range of options for homeporting additional surface ships at NAVSTA Mayport. Consideration of NAVSTA Mayport as a homeport for any of the classes of ships being discussed in the FEIS is based on the following:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">• </span>Use of<span class="Underline"> NAVSTA </span>Mayport helps preserve distribution of homeport locations and ports to reduce the risks to fleet resources in the event of natural disaster, [hu]manmade calamity, or attack by foreign nations or terrorists<span style="font-size: 8pt;">;</span><br />

The F<span class="Underline">leet </span>R<span class="Underline">esponse </span>P<span class="Underline">lan</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, adopted in 2003, </span>calls for six of the Navy's<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 12 aircraft </span>carriers to be available<span class="Underline"> for deployment </span>within 30 daysand another two<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to be available </span>in 90<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> days. Typically, the Navy will have two carriers based in the United States deployed overseas, in addition to one carrier permanently stationed in Japan. </span><span class="Underline">The requirement </span>to be able to swiftly defeat aggression in overlapping conflicts<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> called for in the 2001 QDR </span>has necessitated a focus on developing new surge capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to complement and capitalize on our current competency in providing immediately employable forward-deployed naval forces. The recently created Fleet Response Plan (FRP) will significantly increase the rate at which we can augment deployed forces as contingencies require. Under the regular rotation approach, the training, manning, maintenance, and readiness funding practices of the Inter-Deployment Readiness Cycle (IDRC) were optimized to meet the requirements of Global Naval Forward Presence Policy. While a modest number of forward deployed units were at peak readiness, the majority of ships and associated units were not deployed and thus at a point in their IDRC that made it difficult and expensive to swiftly &quot;surge&quot; to a crisis, conflict or for Homeland Defense. </span><span class="Underline">The FRP features a change in readiness posture that institutionalizes an enhanced surge capability for the Navy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Under the guidance of Commander Fleet Forces Command (CFFC), a revised IDRC is being developed that meets the demand for a more responsive force. With refined maintenance, modernization, manning and training processes, as well as fully-funded readiness accounts, the Fleet can consistently sustain a level of at least 6 surge-capable carrier strike groups, with two additional strike groups able to deploy within approximately 90 days of an emergency order. In parallel with this, the Naval Reserve Force is embarked on a fully integrated active-reserve transformation to a more flexible unit structure. Part of this transformation is focused on providing a rapid surge capability of skilled aviators who have trained with active-duty units to reinforce them and rapidly boost their ability to generate combat sorties. </span><span class="Underline">The </span>enhanced and expanded readiness<span class="Underline"> availability delivered by the Fleet Response Plan </span>provides<span class="Underline"> the President with </span>unprecedented responsiveness.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Instead of predictable, lock-step, 6-month deployments to pre-determined regions in support of the Global Naval Forward Presence Policy, the Flexible Deployment Concept allows units that have attained high readiness to embark on deployments of varied duration in support of specific national priorities such as Homeland Defense, multi-national exercises, security cooperation events, deterrent operations, or prosecution of the Global War on Terrorism. often in multi-Carrier Strike Group formations. </span><span class="Underline">These deployments provide &quot;presence with a purpose&quot; and can also occur in less predictable patterns, thereby forcing potential adversaries to adjust to our operational timelines</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The sustained readiness created via the Fleet Response Plan will enable the Flexible Deployment Concept. Flexible Deployment Concept implementation will occur under the emerging Joint Presence Policy. Naval implementation of these new presence requirements will be carefully monitored to ensure that schedules and OPTEMPO standards are adhered to so that our unprecedented force levels will not result in uncertainties for our sailors or allies. The military build-up for and waging of Operation Iraqi Freedom dramatically impacted the IDTC and the deployment schedules of the Navy's aircraft carriers as six carriers were sent to the Persian Gulf and another carrier was sent to fill the vacuum left by the Kitty Hawk's deployment to the Persian Gulf. In some instances carriers were surged earlier than expected and in other cases carriers experienced an extended deployment, most notably the USS Abraham Lincoln, who deployed in July 2002 and did not return to the US until May 2003. Prior to OIF the Navy began to experiment with an altered IDTC that reduced the time that a carrier would spend in the yard and accelerated the ships training cycle. The USS Carl Vinson returned from a deployment on January 23, 2002 and after spending roughly 4 months in the yard began sea trials and its IDTC in September. The Vinson had completed its COMPTUEX by late November, its JTFEX in January and was deployed on February 6, 2003. In March 2003, the Chief of Naval Operations released his &quot;Culture of Readiness&quot; message to the Navy that directed Commander, Fleet Forces Command to develop IDTC processes and milestones that would improve the speed of response for the full combat power of the Navy. The CFFC convened a working group composed of fleet and TYCOM representatives and developed a fleet response concept that would make the necessary changes to attain the increased readiness and responsiveness. In May 2003, the Navy issued a message to major commands describing the Fleet Response Plan which would dramatically alter the IDTC and the way in which the Navy leadership viewed deployments. The FRP would shift the focus away from rotational deployments and presence to being capable of surging substantial forces, ideally 6 surge ready carrier strike groups and 2 carrier strike groups that would follow shortly thereafter. In addition, under FRP, eight out of 10 of the Navy's submarines are able to respond to emergent fleet requirements at any time. To meet this objective the Navy intends to extend the interval between maintenance periods and modify training and manpower processes. The Navy also adopted a mindset of &quot;R+plus&quot; (R=return) rather than &quot;D-minus&quot; (D=Deploy). The idea being that working up for a scheduled deployment was not as important as being available as quickly as possible from the end of the last deployment. Instead of the rather vague &quot;surge status&quot; or &quot;deployed status&quot; the Navy created emergency surge status, surge ready status, and routine deployable. Emergency surge assets are those that would be employed in cases of urgent need. Attaining emergency surge status occurs upon completion of the Basic phase of the IDTC. &quot;Emergency Surge&quot; status should be attained with three to four months of the completion of its maintenance period. Surge ready status are those assets that can deploy upon completion of the intermediate phase of the IDTC. Ships should attain Surge Ready status within six months of the completion of its maintenance period. Routine deployable is equivalant to completion of the current IDTC. The goal of the current new concept would be to move assets through the IDTC as quickly as possible and conducting refesher training to insure readiness. The FRP was instituted by July 1, 2003 and the 6+2 surge goals were completed by December 1, 2003. Maintaining the Fleet Readiness Plan (FRP) construct of six aircraft carriers available within 30 days plus two additional carriers available within 90 days is a difficult task. Maintenance requirements on carriers alone make satisfying the FRP a challenging scheduling problem. By increasing the average cycle time for a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) to 27 months, the FRP requirements can be met continuously, after an initial maintenance adjustment period of 62 months. </span><span class="Underline">During the summer of 2004 </span>the Navy surged some<span class="Underline"> aircraft </span>carriers from their homeports to generate as many as seven of 12 carriers on station<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for Coalition operations. </span><span class="Underline">The ability to push that kind of military capability to the four corners of the world is quite remarkable and recent.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question ‘‘Is Nuclear War Inevitable??’’ [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what </span>most terrorists<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> obviously already </span>know<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve </span>figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Moore points out, </span>all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian ‘‘dead hand’’ system, ‘‘where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,’’ it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the U<span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates’’ [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal ‘‘Samson option’’ against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even ‘‘anti-Semitic’’ European cities [10]. In that case, of course, </span>Russia would retaliate<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not </span>tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the </span>major cities<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a </span>nuclear winter<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span>could last<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as long as </span>a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> environment and fragile </span>ecosphere<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as well. And </span>what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on. Any accident, mistaken communication, false signal or ‘‘lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason could, in a matter of a few minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons, and once a weapon is used, then the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is actually less probable since </span>each country would act under the ‘‘use them or lose them’’ strategy and psychology<span style="font-size: 8pt;">; restraint by one power would be interpreted as a weakness by the other, which could be exploited as a window of opportunity to ‘‘win’’ the war. In other words, </span>once Pandora’s Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, ‘‘everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self-determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors’’ [10]. In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and </span>once even just one is used, it is very likely that many, if not all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of much of human civilization while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<strong>US naval power guarantees hegemony, prevents attacks on the US mainland, and deters potential rivals from even attempting to change the status quo</strong><br />
<strong>FRIEDMAN 7</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (George, PhD in Government @ Cornell University, Chief Executive Officer and founder of STRATFOR, “The Limitations and Necessity of Naval Power,” April 10, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/limitations_and_necessity_naval_power" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/limitations_and_necessity_naval_power</a>)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This raises a more fundamental question: What is the value of naval power in a world in which naval battles are not fought? To frame the question more clearly, let us begin by noting that </span>the United States has maintained global maritime hegemony since the end of World War II.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Except for the failed Soviet attempt to partially challenge the United States, </span>the most important geopolitical fact since World War II was that the world’s oceans were effectively under the control of the U.S. Navy. Prior to World War II, there were multiple contenders for maritime power<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as Britain, Japan and most major powers. </span>No one<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> power, not even Britain, </span>had global maritime hegemony. The United States now does<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The question is whether this hegemony has any real value at this time — a question made relevant by the issue of whether to blockade Iran. The United States controls the blue water. To be a little more precise, the U.S. Navy can assert direct and overwhelming control over any portion of the blue water it wishes, and it can do so in multiple places. It cannot directly control all of the oceans at the same time. However, </span>the total available naval force that can be deployed by non-U.S. powers<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (friendly and other) </span>is so limited that they lack the ability, <strong>even taken together,</strong> to assert control <strong>anywhere</strong> should the United States challenge their presence.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This is an unprecedented situation historically. </span>The current situation is<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of course, </span><strong>invaluable</strong> to the United States. It means that a seaborne invasion of the United States by any power is completely impractical<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Given the geopolitical condition of the United States, the homeland is secure from conventional military attack but vulnerable to terrorist strikes and nuclear attacks. </span>At the same time, the United States is in a position to <strong>project forces at will</strong> to <strong>any part of the globe</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Such power projection might not be wise at times, but </span><strong>even failure</strong> does not lead to reciprocation. For instance, no matter how badly U.S. forces fare in Iraq, the Iraqis will not invade the United States<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if the Americans are defeated there. </span>This is not a trivial fact. Control of the seas means that military or political failure in Eurasia will not result in a direct conventional threat to the United States. Nor does such failure necessarily preclude future U.S. intervention in that region. It also means that no other state can choose to invade the United States. Control of the seas allows the United States to intervene where it wants, survive the consequences of failure and be immune to occupation itself. It was the most important geopolitical consequence of World War II, and one that still <strong>defines the world</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="Underline">The issue for the United States is not whether it should abandon control of the seas — that would be irrational in the extreme. Rather, the question is whether it has to exert itself at all in order to retain that control. Other powers either have abandoned attempts to challenge the United States, have fallen short of challenging the United States or have confined their efforts to building navies for extremely limited uses, or for uses aligned with the United States. No one has a shipbuilding program under way that could challenge the United States for several generations. </span><span class="Underline">One argument, then, is that the United States should cut its naval forces radically — since they have, in effect, done their job. Mothballing a good portion of the fleet would free up resources</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for other military requirements without threatening U.S. ability to control the sea-lanes. </span><span class="Underline">Should other powers attempt to build fleets to challenge the United States, the lead time involved in naval construction is such that the United States would have plenty of opportunities for re-commissioning ships</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or building new generations of vessels to thwart the potential challenge. The counterargument normally given is that the U.S. Navy provides a critical service in what is called littoral warfare. In other words, while the Navy might not be needed immediately to control sea-lanes, it carries out critical functions in securing access to those lanes and projecting rapid power into countries where the United States might want to intervene. Thus, U.S. aircraft carriers can bring tactical airpower to bear relatively quickly in any intervention. Moreover, the Navy’s amphibious capabilities — particularly those of deploying and supplying the U.S. Marines — make for a rapid deployment force that, when coupled with Naval airpower, can secure hostile areas of interest for the United States. That argument is persuasive, but it poses this problem: The Navy provides a powerful option for war initiation by the United States, but it cannot by itself sustain the war. In any sustained conflict, the Army must be brought in to occupy territory — or, as in Iraq, the Marines must be diverted from the amphibious specialty to serve essentially as Army units. Naval air by itself is a powerful opening move, but greater infusions of airpower are needed for a longer conflict. Naval transport might well be critically important in the opening stages, but commercial transport sustains the operation. If one accepts this argument, the case for a Navy of the current size and shape is not proven. How many carrier battle groups are needed and, given the threat to the carriers, is an entire battle group needed to protect them? If we consider the Iraq war in isolation, for example, it is apparent that the Navy served a function in the defeat of Iraq’s conventional forces. It is not clear, however, that the Navy has served an important role in the attempt to occupy and pacify Iraq. And, as we have seen in the case of Iran, a blockade is such a complex politico-military matter that the option not to blockade tends to emerge as the obvious choice. The Risk Not Taken </span>The argument for slashing the Navy can be tempting. But<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> consider the counterargument. First, and most important, </span>we must consider the crises the U<span class="Underline">nited </span>S<span class="Underline">tates </span>has <strong>not</strong> experienced. The presence of the U.S. Navy has <strong>shaped the ambitions</strong> of primary and secondary powers. The threshold for challenging the Navy has been so high that few have <strong>even initiated</strong> serious challenges.<span class="Underline"> Those that might be trying to do so, like the Chinese, understand that it requires a substantial diversion of resources. Therefore</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the mere existence of </span>U.S. naval power has been effective in <strong>averting crises that</strong><span class="Underline"> <strong>likely would have occurred otherwise</strong></span>.<span class="Underline"> Reducing the power of the U.S. Navy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or fine-tuning it, </span><span class="Underline">would not only open the door to challenges but also eliminate a</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> useful, if not </span><span class="Underline">essential, element in U.S. strategy — the ability to bring</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> relatively </span><span class="Underline">rapid force to bear</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Underline">There are times when the Navy’s use is tactical, and times when it is strategic</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At this moment in U.S. history, the role of naval power is highly strategic. </span><span class="Underline">The </span>domination of the<span class="Underline"> world’s oceans </span>represents the <strong>foundation stone</strong> of U.S. grand strategy. It allows the U<span class="Underline">nited </span>S<span class="Underline">tates </span>to take risks while minimizing consequences<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It facilitates risk-taking. </span><span class="Underline">Above all, </span>it eliminates the threat of<span class="Underline"> sustained conventional </span>attack against the homeland. U.S. grand strategy has <strong>worked so well that this risk appears to be a phantom</strong>.<span class="Underline"> The dispersal of U.S. forces around the world attests to what naval power can achieve. </span>It is illusory to believe that this situation cannot be reversed<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but it is ultimately a generational threat. Just as U.S. maritime hegemony is measured in generations, the threat to that hegemony will emerge over generations. </span>The apparent lack of utility of<span class="Underline"> naval </span>forces in secondary campaigns<span class="Underline">, like Iraq, </span>masks thefundamentally <strong>indispensable role</strong> the Navy plays in U.S. national security.<br />

<strong>Naval power is critical to overall US capabilities—this allows us to deter and defeat any challenger and contain every impact</strong><br />
<strong>ENGLAND et al. 11</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Gordon England is a former secretary of the Navy. General James Jones is a former commandant of the Marine Corps. Admiral Vern Clark is a former chief of naval operations; “The Necessity of U.S. Naval Power,” July 11, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://gcaptain.com/necessity-u-s-naval-power?27784" rel="nofollow">http://gcaptain.com/necessity-u-s-naval-power?27784</a>)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The future security environment underscores two broad security trends. First, </span>international political realities and the internationally agreed-to sovereign rights of nations will increasingly limit the sustained involvement of American permanent and-based, heavy forces<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to the more extreme crises. </span>This will make offshore options for deterrence and power projection <strong>ever more paramount</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in support of our national interests. Second, </span>the naval dimensions of American power will re-emerge as the primary means for assuring our allies and partners, ensuring prosperity in times of peace, and countering anti-access, area-denial efforts in times of crisis.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We do not believe these trends will require the dismantling of land-based forces, as these forces will remain essential reservoirs of power. As the United States has learned time and again, once a crisis becomes a conflict, it is impossible to predict with certainty its depth, duration and cost. That said, </span>the U.S. has been shrinking its overseas land-based installations, so the ability to project power globally will make the forward presence of naval forces an <strong>even more essential dimension of American influence</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What we do believe is that </span><strong>uniquely responsive</strong> Navy-Marine Corps capabilities provide the basis on which our most vital overseas interests are safeguarded. Forward presence and engagement is what allows the U.S. to maintain awareness, to deter aggression, and to quickly respond to threats as they arise.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Though we clearly must be prepared for the high-end threats, such </span>preparation should be made in balance with the means necessary to <strong>avoid escalation</strong> to the high end <strong>in the first place</strong>.The versatility of maritime forces provides a truly <strong>unmatched advantage.</strong>The sea remains a vast space that provides nearly unlimited freedom of maneuver. Command of the sea allows for the presence of our naval forces, supported from a network of shore facilities, to be adjusted and scaled with little external restraint<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It permits reliance on proven capabilities such as prepositioned ships. </span>Maritime capabilities encourage and enable cooperation with other nations to solve common sea-based problems such as piracy, illegal trafficking, proliferation of W.M.D<span style="font-size: 8pt;">., and a host of other ills, which if unchecked can harm our friends and interests abroad, and our own citizenry at home. </span>The flexibility and responsiveness of naval forces provide our country with a general strategic deterrent in a potentially violent and unstable world. Most importantly, our naval forces project and sustain power at sea and ashore at the time, place, duration, and intensity of our choosing<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Given these enduring qualities, tough choices must clearly be made, especially in light of expected tight defense budgets. The administration and the Congress need to balance the resources allocated to missions such as strategic deterrence, ballistic missile defense, and cyber warfare with the more traditional ones of sea control and power projection. The maritime capability and capacity vital to the flexible projection of U.S. power and influence around the globe must surely be preserved, especially in light of available technology. Capabilities such as the Joint Strike Fighter will provide strategic deterrence, in addition to tactical long-range strike, especially when operating from forward-deployed naval vessels. </span>Postured to respond quickly, the Navy-Marine Corps team integrates sea, air, and land power into adaptive force packages spanning the entire spectrum of operations, from everyday cooperative security activities to unwelcome — but not impossible — <strong>wars between major powers</strong>. This is exactly what we will need to meet the challenges of the future<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

 <strong><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">The Affirmative's view of death through its harms is obscured by the fright of death. Death and misfortune are inevitable. They are ignoring the reality that things die everyday. They view it as pure silence and nothingness. Death is a part of our life and is part of a never-ending cycle. Life is death. If we desire to avoid death, we desire to avoid life. Life then looses all of it's value. The joy of life comes in accepting things <em>as they are</em>. The aff has no impact- vote neg on presumption.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">The alternative is to take a new stance on the idea of life and therefore the idea of death.
