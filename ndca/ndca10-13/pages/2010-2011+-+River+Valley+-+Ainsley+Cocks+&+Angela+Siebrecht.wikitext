**Animal Soldiers Affirmative:**
**Observation 1: Inherency**
**The U.S. military is exploiting thousands of animals a year forcing them to work in some of** **the most dangerous combat situations seen by the military.**
**Plourde 2004,** (Shawn is a writer and animal rights activist, ‘What Did You Do in the War Fido?’,

**Military exploitation of animals is grounded in widely held beliefs that animals are** **property and only exist as disposable tools of war.**

**Animal soldiers are not a relic of the past. Troop surges in Afghanistan and de-mining** **missions in Kuwait, Iraq, and South Korea have lead to a substantial increase in the** **presence of military dogs.**
**LA Times 2010,** (‘Along with troop surge in Afghanistan, a dog surge. Along with dog surge, a dog food dilemma’, January 25th)

**Thus we present the following plan:**
**The United States federal government should end the military deployment of animals in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, and South Korea.**
**Advantage 1: Animal Rights**
**Actions like the plan are vital to the success of the animal rights movement. Enacting legislation attacking specific forms of animal exploitation like military use strikes at the heart of institutionalized animal exploitation.**
**Francione 1996,** (Gary is a professor at The Rutgers University School of Law, ‘Animal Rights: The Future’, World Prat
Assembly, DLD: June 24th 2010, [[http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2005/04/animal_rights_t.html]])

**This makes animal liberation a moral imperative, because a free and peaceful will never be possible until we demand the end of human domination over animals.**
**Steven Best,** Chair of Philosophy at UT-EP, no date given

**Only the animal liberation movement is capable of overcoming the worst aspects of the capitalist and ecological crisis.**
**Steven Best, Chair Philosophy at UT-EP 2006**
[The International Journal of INCLUSIVE DEMOCRACY, vol.2, no.3, (June 2006)]
**Advantage 2: Ethics**
**Viewing animals as property is intrinsically wrong and must be rejected because animals are not objects lacking dignity or feelings.**
**Bartlett 2002,** (Steven J. completed his undergraduate work at the University of Santa Clara, received his master's degree fromthe
University of California, Santa Barbara, and his doctorate from the Université de Paris.,‘Roots of Human Resistance to Animal Rights:
Psychological and Conceptual Blocks’
[[http://www.animallaw.info/articles/arussbartlett2002.htm]])
**You have an ethical obligation to vote for the plan. The logic reducing animals to objects is the same logic that has justified the slaughter of millions of humans. Earth is doomed until we stop viewing living beings as property. Rejecting the militaries use of animals rejects the utilitarian logic driving animal exploitation in the status quo.**

[[http://www.animallaw.info/articles/arussbartlett2002.htm]])

**You are not voting for the plan, because it magically solves every instance of animal** **exploitation. Instead, vote for our policy, because it is intrinsically good. Reject the** **negatives future based disadvantages, because their utilitarian and consequential rational** **will always recreate human domination over the non-human.**
