<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The United States federal government should develop and deploy single purpose polar class icebreakers. The United States federal government should maintain and deploy current icebreakers.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Advantage 1 is the North</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Scenario 1 is Russia</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">AND</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">not hard to conjure up the prospect of an Arctic race building up.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The plan reverses this trend – a clear signal is key to avert Arctic war.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Russia, as it stands could make the largest territorial gain from the Arctic,</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">AND</span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Russian export market and fundamentally the Russian itself, may depend on it.</span>
