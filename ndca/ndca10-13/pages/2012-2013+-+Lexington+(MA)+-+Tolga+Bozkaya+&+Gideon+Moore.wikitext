Government agencies rarely use rigorous economic tools such as benefit-cost analysis when considering investment decisions – this directly results in poor policy outcomes

=====Capitalism Kritik 1NC===== 
Transportation infrastructure investment is the crux of the “spatial fix”. It expands capitalism’s borders and is the node by which economic imperialism and colonialism are accomplished

Instilling the drive for Capital within processes of economic geography proliferates conflict and gives teeth to panoptic structures of order.

Marxist political economy should be understood...and take distinctive geographical forms

The alternative is to reject the affirmative to create a space for the metaphoric condenstation of communism within spaces of economic geography.

The``glocalization''of the economy...socioeconomic and political order (see Harvey, 2000)

Assuming the role of the legislator lets us off the hook for our own responsibility in shaping social change and reinforces powerlessness.
Kappeler, 95 (Susanne, The Will to Violence, p. 10-11)

`We are the war' does not mean that the responsibility...structures and the values of war and violence.

The role of the ballot is to confront capitalism - We have an a prior ethical responsibility to resist it.
