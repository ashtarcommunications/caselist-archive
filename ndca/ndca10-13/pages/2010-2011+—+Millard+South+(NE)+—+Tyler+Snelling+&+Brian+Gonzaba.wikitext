1AC / 1NC
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">We are here to speak in memory of Dr. Vicki Kaspar.</span>
Today is January 8th 2011.
We are here to remember the events of January 5th 2011.
We want to be upfront about things because we know that what we are about to do is an enormous responsibility. We know how sensitive this is and we know that this is going to provoke anxiety, fear and a variety of other reactions. We understand this but also know that this is something we must do. It would be dishonest for us to come here and read Van Gogh and act like everything is normal. Things are not normal…we cannot come here and separate the debates we have from the lives we live that are dramatically changed because of the events of January 5th. Debate is what we do. To withdraw and not come would only cut us off from the very people that we need to get us through this situation. We are here because you are our people. You are the ones that we share our lives with…you are our friends and mentors…teachers and collaborators…our dark little corner of shared humanity that others may not understand but we do. And on Saturday January 8th 2010 The Millard North Mustang Debate Invite is where we belong. This is something we must do…but we also know that it would be unfair at this time to make this discussion a question of competition…we know that it is not for any of us to answer for what happened on January 5th. In the spirit of this feeling we want you to sign the ballot for the other team in order to make sure that this debate distances itself from the trivial consideration of winning and losing and simply take this time to grieve…to morn…and to ask for your thoughts and prayers. And more important than your feelings for us we ask you to remember those whose lives have been affected in a far more profound way than ours. Particularly, Dr. Vicki Kaspar who gave her life to education and was taken far too soon doing what she loved which was being involved in the daily lives of young people. We ask you to have Dr. Case in your thoughts who was also seriously injured attempting to protect his friend and colleague and the school that he loves and will thankfully return to as soon as his health permits. We want to collectively thank the four uninjured administrators that have been fearless in their leadership and every teacher and staff member in our school who were witness to this awful act and have carried on for the sake of themselves and the school and students that they equally love…and the students…well here we are…we are one voice from the multitude of students affected by this situation in myriad ways…remember them…finally we want you to remember Robert Butler Jr. who despite his actions is a human being and has a family that is also mourning.
We will begin shortly…but we are not up to the task…
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">“First day of school, First day of school!!!”</span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">This was my status in the morning. I was excited to go back to school for a couple reasons. The first reason was to see all my friends and get back into the loop of my social life at school, but the main reason was so that I could get into the debate room and prepare for the tournament today. </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">In a few hours Robert Butler Jr.’s Facebook status will read:</span>
//<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">"Everybody that used to know me I'm sorry but Omaha changed me and fucked me up. And the school I attend is even worse you’re gonna here about the evil shit I did but that fucking school drove me to this. I wont you guys to remember me for who I was before this I know. I greatly affected the lives of the families ruined but I'm sorry. Goodbye."</span>//
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">My day started off pretty easy, the first new class for this semester I got was civics, and I enjoyed the fact that I got to freak out the rest of my class and my new teacher with my views about the current American society. To my surprise they didn’t mind it for once and they actually thought I sounded smart… at least my description of my political views was better than the generic “I’m an anarchist” rant that this other kid gave. There’s always that kid. After we got through all of that we had a pretty good in class discussion about the evolution of the pledge of allegiance. </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">My next class was pretty easy and it was a continuation of last semester. Consumer’s Math, pretty much the easiest class in school. We had some new kids, and two work sheets to do which gave us time after class so I could get a pass from my teacher to go to the debate room for the remaining class time. I usually find every opportunity I can to get out of class and hang out in the squad room. </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">I am thinking about debate and somewhere else in Millard at an undisclosed time from a cell phone a Facebook status is updated:</span>
//<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">"Everybody that used to know me I'm sorry but Omaha changed me and fucked me up. And the school I attend is even worse you’re gonna here about the evil shit I did but that fucking school drove me to this. I wont you guys to remember me for who I was before this I know. I greatly affected the lives of the families ruined but I'm sorry. Goodbye."</span>//

<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;"> It’s third block now, the block I’m supposed to be in my new weight training class. I noticed something I didn’t like on my schedule print out, it said that I had last lunch. I wasn’t going to accept that… it’s pretty apparent that I’m not normally one to miss a meal, nor am I the kind of person to wait til after one o’clock. It was after this that I added in my head the fact that it was also a gym class so I decided to skip. Normally I hang out in the squad room and eat my lunches in there, so I thought I would be sneaky and tell my coach that I had first lunch so he wouldn’t get after me for skipping. I don’t like lying to him… but I also don’t like last lunch and forced physical activity. The weird thing is that I ended up not eating, because I got caught up in reading Nietzsche’s Will To Power. After first lunch got done to kill time I just went to the library to kill the rest of class until it was time for advanced debate to start. </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">In the library,</span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;"> got caught up reading a pretty interesting Derrida essay, when the shots went off… although the truth is that I wasn’t able to hear them. I couldn’t hear them, but the fact is that they were still there. Nolan Byers the activities Director got on the intercom with an unusual urgency in his voice.</span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">“Attention staff and students we are now entering into a code red…” </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">There was a pause and I was thinking to myself “why the fuck are we doing this now”</span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">“This is not a drill” </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">My initial thought, wasn’t anything close to how it really was, I just figured someone got into a bad fight, or maybe someone just got mad and started breaking crap or something. But they had all of us in the library go to this cramped backroom. I wasn’t bout to sit through this without bringing my computer, when I whipped it out and looked up what’s going on, Twitter said that there was a shooting, and the person has yet to be found. I was the one who gave to everyone including the teachers the news about what was going on. It was then when we heard the sirens of maybe four more police cars coming up to the front of the school. I checked for another update and it said a swat team has set up a perimeter around the school. I also saw that the “suspect” had fled the school before the cops got there, and they are out looking for the car. The news said that two people were injured… who? Was it students?... teachers?,,, they hadn’t disclosed. This was where I first saw real signs of panic around the room. </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">We heard a helicopter in the distance; someone had to be air lifted to the hospital. </span>
The next update I got was that one of the victims was my principal Dr. Case, and they have yet to Identify the other victim, but they knew for sure that it was not a student.
Maybe this might be said too soon, but the real thought that went through my head was oh shit someone actually did it this time…
Another update came in telling me that the car was discovered and they had an ambulance for the shooter… about ten minutes later the shooter was confirmed already dead…we pretty much assumed it was self inflicted… that’s pretty much the way these things go down, “this is tragic” I was thinking to myself.
After another two hours of waiting in the library bored as hell, I get the final update for about the next four hours. The other victim was Dr. Vicky Kaspar, and that she was in critical condition… Dr. Case was now in stable condition whatever that means.
So many thoughts where running through my head, but finally the police men came to the library to escort us to the church next to the school… we were out…
<span style="line-height: normal;">I’m finally at home, and the first thing I do is hug and kiss my Mima, this was the first time of the day where I actually shed a tear. I couldn’t hold it any longer and as soon as I got in her arms I just had to break down. I turned on the news and listen to it constantly to see how things were going yet the story just wasn’t changing at all. The same old stuff, the same story I heard before I left school. My sister came up to the room and told me we should go out to eat. It was there when we someone called to tell us the news… <span style="color: black;">8:52 PM Jan 5, 2011 Dr</span>. Kaspar was dead, I lost my appetite… smoked a cigarette… went home and once again I cried. </span>
<span style="line-height: normal;">**Dr. Vicki Kaspar Huge Loss For Millard South, "She Cared"**</span>
//Posted: Jan 06, 2011 6:43 PM CST//
**Omaha, NE - Doctor Vicki Kaspar was a key player in students lives. Students placed flowers, candles and wrote messages for the assistant principal at a memorial right outside the school. "I would always talk to her in the hallways and I would always say hi to her. I could just tell she really loved what she was doing," said Millard South 2010 graduate Naomi Merrill.**
**One after another, the people Kaspar loved continue to love her back. "It's a huge loss for the school and all we can really do is keep her family in our prayers," said Millard South senior Nate Fowler.**
**Students remember Kaspar roaming the halls trying to get students to and from class. "She was definitely a hard worker and she cared," said Millard South senior Andrew Keohane.**
**Kaspar's peers know her on a personal and professional level. Board of Education President, Mike Pate mourns, "Vicki would never give up on a child," he said.**
**With 23 years working with students as an English teacher and then as assistant principal, she leaves behind a wonderful legacy and at the same time a heartbreaking hole at Millard South. "She wanted all students to succeed," said Merrill.**
**Visitation for Dr. Vicki Kaspar is scheduled for Monday from noon to 8 p.m. at Braman Mortuary which is located at 6505 S. 144th St. in Omaha. A vigil service will be held at 7 p.m. at the mortuary.**
**Kaspar's funeral Mass is set for Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. at St. Wenceslaus Catholic Church near 153rd and Pacific Streets.**

At some point during this the debater inside of you is going to ask “What the hell am I supposed to say to this…what should I read…what answer do I have in my tub that is going to be able to respond to such an event? “ We will clear things up now. Ask yourself another question. What was anyone supposed to do about the situation? How were all of the people who were in our school supposed to react? What was there to say afterwards? Are there any words, or answers, or actions that if taken could have protected us enough or heal our wounds enough or give us enough agency to change this fucked up situation? The answer is probably no…there was nothing to say or do except crowd around a computer in the dark looking at an image of the school we never thought we would see on the news above a ticker that said “Breaking News…School Shooting.” There is no acceptable response.
Hug your loved ones and listen to the wisest among them… “there was nothing you could do…this isn’t anyone’s fault…mourning will take time and the ones you love…”
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%;">Ask yourself again…what should you say? Say nothing if you want. Ask questions if you need clarification. But realize first and foremost that this is not an argument and that there is not adequate response. Be the people we need you to be…our friends…our family… and our community. </span>

200 students for a prayer vigil at noon
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Published Friday January 7, 2011</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">By Joe Dejka</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">WORLD-HERALD STAFF WRITER - http://www.omaha.com/article/20110106/NEWS01/701079896/1100</span>
About 400 students and alumni of Millard South High School sang songs and yelled school cheers during a candlelight vigil Thursday night for their slain assistant principal.
They huddled in the cold by the parking lot, around a makeshift memorial piled with fresh flowers, <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">notes and candles for Vicki Kaspar, who was shot to death Wednesday by a student.</span></span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">In their hands, tiny candles flames burned brightly, giving their faces a warm glow and making the night air smell sweet and oily.</span>
There was no official program. People just came together.
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Now and then, a song would start somewhere in the crowd, soft and low. Then it would grow as more joined in.</span>
They sang “Amazing Grace,” “Let It Be” and “Lean On Me.” Sometimes their voices trailed off when they forgot the words, and the kids laughed, <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">a welcome sound after the week they've had.</span></span>
They released seven white helium balloons that climbed rapidly before disappearing into the black sky.
They sang “Happy Birthday” for Kaspar, who would have celebrated her 59th birthday Thursday.
A few girls clinging to candles talked of Kaspar's big heart, how she came off as stern and professional, but softened as you got to know her. She got troubled kids on the right track, they said.
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">“She was meant to do that job,” a former student said.</span>
Cheers of school spirit,<span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the kind kids yell at football games</span></span>, erupted from the crowd: “I am Millard South! You are Millard South! We are Millard South!”
It was a show of solidarity, a buttress of defiance against the gloom.
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">“It just shows once you're a Patriot, once you're a part of it, you always are,” said Jessica Vazquez, a 2009 Millard South graduate,</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Heather Werthmann, class of 1989, brought her daughter, Emily, a sophomore at Millard West High School.</span>
“We're all one big Millard family,” Heather Werthmann said. “I went to this school. This is my school. It breaks my heart.”
One-by-one, students placed their candles at the memorial, at the foot of two trees, and slipped away. Some stuck around and chatted in groups. One student played guitar, while students in a circle around her sang.
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Within an hour, most had drifted away to their cars and driven off. </span>

Debate
Oh debate
This debate
Decisions ..
My instincts say don’t auto-lose … why would you do that …
Why did we do that?
We’ll be very simple right here – our advocacy for this debate was a discussion of the events that happened at Millard South. We’ll continue this through our remaining speeches. However, we in no way endorse tying the catastrophic events of that day down to some ballet. We honestly don’t care what happens with the decision,
We want to give the other team the ballet. We won’t answer any of the arguments/flows that they make in their speeches that are reasons why we lose. We agree … we don’t think any member of the community should feel as though a series of unpredictable events caused them to lose a debate round. We made a choice. Ryan Wash, a debater for Emporia is also choosing to read an affirmative like ours at a college tournament. This discussion is larger then us. We thank you for listening to what we have to say, we realize this might not be what you expected to hear or even want to hear. But the absence of this discussion would be to allow the violence that happens in our communities to remain invisible.

Debate Tournament
Time to enjoy an activity that we all love and enjoy.
Also Time to remember the events that happened on Wednesday.
He was popular with students and seemed real pleasant," said Southwest Principal Rob Slauson, who described Butler as "a fairly normal, average" student
Average?
Predictable?
Normal?
I ask myself what those three words mean.
How can someone who felt the need to take another human beings life and his own be normal?
But then I realize …
Had I talked to Robert before?
At first I think no. No way.
But then I realize that I was apart of the same homeroom that Robert was called down from.
The teacher said Dr. Kasper was in a good mood.
(moment of silence)
That’s my connection to the events that took place on Wednesday. As a senior, we get open campus.
12:45 PM
I sat eating lunch away from the events that happened.
This “debate” … this discussion … is something me and gonzaba feel should resonate in a community taught to be active in our community.

Kaspar ‘just an awesome woman'
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">http://omaha.com/article/20110105/NEWS97/701069871/0#kaspar-just-an-awesome-woman</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt;">By </span><span style="color: blue; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt;">[[mailto:joe.dejka@owh.com|Joe Dejka]]</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 10pt;"> WORLD-HERALD STAFF WRITER </span>

Friends and students gushed with praise Wednesday for Vicki Kaspar, 58, the Millard South High assistant principal fatally shot by a student at school.
“Just a wonderful woman, a great neighbor, terrific school administrator. Just so sad that she should get caught up in this,” said the Rev. Glen Thomas, <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">pastor of St. Matthew Lutheran Church at 1725 S. 60th St. in Omaha, who has two sons at Millard South.</span></span>
Kaspar, who would have celebrated her birthday Thursday, died Wednesday night at Creighton University Medical Center.
She is survived by her husband, Ron.

Kaspar's son, also named Ron, teaches science at the school, <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Millard Public Schools spokeswoman Amy Friedman said. Students said he rushed from his classroom after staff notified him of the shooting.</span></span>
Friedman said Kaspar was “a dynamo.”
“She was just an awesome woman. I can't believe she's gone,”<span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Friedman said.</span></span>
The district hired Kaspar in 1988 to teach English. She was promoted to assistant principal in 1998.
Jean Stothert, a former Millard school board member, recalled Kaspar frequenting student activities, from football games to plays. She described her as smart, knowledgeable about curriculum, experienced and respected by students.
Pierce Dageforde,<span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a 16-year-old junior on the school newspaper staff</span></span>, said Kaspar wasn't content to sit in the office all day.
“She wanted to get involved in the lives of all the students around her,” he said.
Kaspar sent e-mails to the student reporters complimenting them <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">on their work.</span></span>
<span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In an e-mail to Dageforde</span></span>, Kaspar wrote:
“I loved your newspaper article so much that I read it twice. It was exquisitely well written in the true sense of satire, poking fun and using humor to bring about change,” Kaspar wrote, adding. “I am so glad you are a Millard South student. Kudos!”
Rick Kolowski, a retired Millard principal, described her as a “consummate professional” and an “excellent, excellent teacher.”
Kolowski was principal at Millard South from 1970 to 1983 and most recently served as Millard West principal.
Millard South junior Hailey Bedore, 16, said Kaspar was a hard worker.
Bedore said she interviewed Kaspar's son for a question-and-answer feature about what it was like working in the same school with his mom. Ron told her he liked to have his mother just a call or a short walk away.
Goodbye Dr. Kaspar.
Rest in peace.
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">This is in the 1AC but we think it needs to be said once again: **Kaspar's funeral Mass is set for Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. at St. Wenceslaus Catholic Church near 153rd and Pacific Streets.** </span>

2AR/ 2NR

Upon returning to school on Friday, The students of Dana Christensen’s Advanced debate class were asked to write a response to the events that happened on Wednesday. That’s what this speech will consist us. This discussion is larger then me and Gonzaba and our perspectives.
We’ll begin with Sammi Nihsen:
In the dark corner of the room, door locked, everybody huddled together for more then an hour of speculation. A little after 1 pm, texts and calls began to fly. “are you ok?” “what happened?” There was a shooting! Somebody died? We all tried to keep our heads, keep our cool. In my head, panic was rising. I didn’t know where anybody was, if they were ok or not. My mother was texting me to tell me what was going on. We were all on edge despite the jokes being made to keep us all calm and in high spirits. When there were cops checking the doors, it took every last ounce of self-control not to scream. Too afraid to cry, but trying to be calm. When we were finally released room by room, the feeling of urgency was heightened. We needed to get out. When our room was released, we practically ran out. My legs were stiff, I was shaking and scanning the crowd for my mother or father. I almost gave up when I saw her beside the car where they were announcing names to reunite parents and students. I have never seen my mother happier, I ran to her and she hugged me tight and began to cry, telling me she loved me and she was worried. “ Thank God my baby’s ok” I held her hand the whole way home, still texting my friends to be sure of their safety. On the outside, I was calm, but inside I was crying and thanking God. I’d been taking life for granted. No more. Nobody is the same since the shooting itself. But when we found out that Dr. Kasper had died form her injuries … that was when the real grief and anger took hold. An innocent and amazing women was gunned down. It wasn’t fair. She was an amazing woman that died for her students. We should all be proud to have known her and knowing her was an honor. She did anything that she could to help students succeed. Thank God that Dr. Case is recovering. Now we have been told that the Westburo Baptist Church is going to protest Dr. Kaspars funeral. My only statement to that is this: They will face a wall of loyal, sympathetic subtends. They are attacking a large family of Patriots. They will not succeed and they will not break us. We are Millard South.
And Shelby Waldmann:
I walk into my English class right on time. Accompanying me are two great friends, Sophie and Caprice. Our seats had been rearranged. We’re angry. Our assignment is to read and answer questions about __Shooting Dad__ by Sarah Voewll. It’s 12:40. Time for lunch. Sophie, caprice and Aly make our way to the Cafeteria. It’s always super crowded, so we wait a few minutes before going to purchase our repulsive “food”. Three of us have blue trays. One has red. We head to the back of the Cafeteria, on the north side. Nearing the stairs to the stage, Mr. Brad Millard enters. His face is pale. His actions are animated. “Get in the kitchen.” He yells. We continue to our table. “Everyone, now.” Get in the kitchen. He repeats. We leave our trays and walk lazily over. It’s either a drill, or it’s drug dogs. A large mob is trying to filter through the door. There’s probably about 300 people in total. We’re right at the back in front of Mr. Millard. A constant buzz of conversation lingers. “Everyone, Get in the Kitchen.” He urges. Loud bangs. It sounds as if someone slammed a table on the floor. “Run,” He states, his face is ghost white and dead serious. “Run,” He states. His face is ghost white and dead serious. ”Run.” He says a bit louder and he pushes us around to a different entrance. We’re ushered into the hot, crowded kitchen. No one knows what’s going on. We wait and look to Mr. Millard for instruction. He’s trying to keep his composure, but the terror is apparent. Minutes pass, rumors are flying. Everyone’s on their phones attempting to make sense of the situation. We learn someone’s been shot. One adult male and one student? Two adult males? A principle and a student? No, a male and a female principal. Through process of elimination we figure one’s Dr. Case. The shooter’s dead. An hour or so passes. We’ve found a radio. We sing ‘I’m Yours’ and “This Love” while waiting for news they pass out food. I don’t eat. I can’t eat. I feel sick.
It’s 2:35. They’ve called our parents. They’re awaiting our return at Devine Shepherd. Two police officers enter. We’re to leave one at a time. We must give them our name as we enter the cafeteria. I sit at a table and wait. We’re to be escorted to the church. There’s national guard everywhere. I’m in the first ground to leave. We pass the office. Police Tape. We walk through the school. Silent. We exit the building. “Stay in the tape!” One man yells. A helicopter circles overhead. People in uniforms line the tape, wielding large guns. We walk calmly through the parking lot. A crowd is waiting. We pass reporters. The parents are in sight. They begin to cheer. It’s over. We’re safe.
Still, Dr. Millard’s face haunts me. When discussed, I tremble. I am on the verge of tears. This day will never be forgotten. My life has been changed. Rest in peace Dr. Kaspar. Your memory will live on.

We now conclude the 2AR … Thank you for joining in our discussion, tolerating our presence, and letting us remember the tragic events that happened at our school on Wednesday.

**WE** **BEGIN** **OUR DISCUSSION OF THIS** **’S RESOLUTION IN, OR MORE APPROPRIATELY AT, THE WAKE OF FINNEGAN. THIS WAKE IS ANYTHING BUT CONVENTIONAL. WHILE FINNEGAN DIED IN A CONVENTIONAL ENOUGH WAY, FALLING FROM A SCAFFOLD, THE REMAINDER OF THE WAKE DEFIES ALL EXPECTATIONS. FINNEGAN LAUGHS IN THE FACE OF HIS OWN DEMISE BY INITIATING THE IMPOSSIBLE MOVE OF DRINKING AT HIS OWN WAKE. THE REVIVAL OF FINNEGAN SIGNALS THE MOVE FROM A WORLD OF REASON AND LIGHT TO THE DARK NIGHT OF UN-KNOWLEDGE; A FALL FROM THE HEIGHTS OF THE DIVINE INTO THE WORLD OF DECAY AT STREET LEVEL. THE SACRIFICE OFFERED BY THE FALL OF FINNEGAN PROVIDES US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE INTO A SLIDING WORLD WHERE WE CAN CALL ALL LIMITS INTO QUESTION.**

//For Georges Bataille, sovereignty and sacrifice are inextricable….. a foretaste of the world of non-being.//

**WE WILL USE THIS DESTABILIZING MOMENT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE WORK OF LITERATURE ITSELF. OUR INCLUSION OF FINNEGANS WAKE MIRRORS THE NOTIONS OF SACRIFICE PRESENT IN THE WAKE OF FINNEGAN. WE DO NOT READ THIS LITERATURE IN AN ATTEMPT TO ENFRAME IT, PROVIDE IT WITH NARRATIVE FORCE, OR LIMIT IT BY CRITIQUE. WE INSTEAD APPROACH THIS WORK AT THE MOMENT OF ITS WAKE. LITERATURE HAS BEEN PUT TO DEATH BY A CONFRONTATION WITH ITS OWN EXCESSIVE MEANING. THE FALL OF LITERATURE, LIKE THE FALL OF FINNEGAN, IS NOT WITHOUT A SURREAL MOMENT OF RETURN. IT IS ONLY WHEN THE STERILE LABORATORY OF LITERATURE AS MEANING MEETS ITS DEATH THAT THE “LITERARINESS” OF THE WORK SPRINGS BACK FROM ITS COFFIN. BY CONNECTING LITERATURE WITH ITS FALL THROUGH DEATH WE PUT THE SHIT BACK INTO THE SACRED. THIS VIRULENCE BURSTS AND OVERFLOWS ALL FOUNDATIONS CLEARING THE WAY FOR THE MOVEMENT OF THE HETEROLOGICAL.**

Botting and Wilson ‘01 (Fred and Scott. Bataille. P. 50-52)

//As writing expands its heterological horizon, to fold back on the death, the abyss at its heart, literature, it seems, is rendered more than redundant….. From literature’s dead remains and criticism’s non-productive dispense, then, heterology rises to activate the silent recalcitrance of heterogeneity, forcing it to pose// questions.

**THIS DARK UNDERSIDE OF EXPERIENCE WHICH IS BOTH REPELLING AND NECESSARY IS NOT NEW OR UNEXPLORED. JEAN BAUDRILLARD IN HIS WORK THE TRANSPERENCY OF EVIL DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF THE ACCURSED SHARE.**
[[code]]
Baudrillard 1993 (Jean, The Transparency of Evil; Essays on Extreme Phenomena.  Translated by James Benedict. Verso  London – New York.  Page 106)

[[code]]
//The uninterrupted production of positivity has a terrifying consequence. .….Anything that purges the accursed share in itself signs its own death warrant. This is the theorem of the accursed share.//

**WHILE BAUDRILLARD DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF THE ACCURSED SHARE IN RELATION TO THE HUMAN BODY, GEORGES BATAILLE PROVIDES US WITH A LINK TO THIS YEAR’S RESOLUTION BY CONNECTING THE SAME CONCEPT TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE PLAY OF ENERGY ON THE GLOBE. THE EXCESS WILL BE EXPENDED EITHER GLORIOUSLY OR CATASTROPHICALLY.**
[[code]]
Bataille ‘91 (Georges. The Accursed Share. P. 21. Translated by Robert Hurley)

[[code]]
//Man's disregard for the material basis of his life still causes him to err in a serious way. ….. it must necessarily be lost without profit; It must be spent, willingly or not, gloriously or catastrophically.//

**BATAILLE’S DISCUSSION OF THE ACCURSED SHARE RELATIVE TO ENERGY PROVIDES US WITH A MOMENT WHERE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE OUTSIDE THE LIMIT OF THE SIMPLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF FOSSIL FUELS. MIRRORING THE FALL OF LITERATURE AND OUR DRUNKEN HERO THE CLOSED ENERGY ECONOMY IS CONFRONTED BY ITS OWN EXCESS AT THE MOMENT OF ITS FALL. THIS PLAY OF EXCESS REQUIRES US TO ABANDON TRADITIONAL NOTIONS OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND IN EFFECT BECOME PART OF THE EXCESS. WE DO THIS IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, BY AFFIRMING THE HETEROLOGICAL FORM LITERATURE AS A MODE OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND SECOND BY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MODE OF COMMUNICATION WE USE IS ALWAYS IN EXCESS OF THE MESSAGE WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE. WE ARE UPFRONT ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THIS EXCESSIVE MEANING. WE WILL NEVER EXPUNGE OUR EXCESS, INSTEAD WE USE OUR FABRICATION OF EXCESS AS A MODEL FOR MIRRORED PRODUCTION WITHIN OTHER SYSTEMS.**

**BEFORE WE CAN FINALLY AFFIRM THE RESOLUTION WHICH STATES: RESOLVED: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD SUBSTANTALLY INCREASE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY INCENTIVES IN THE UNITED STATES. WE MUST CONSIDER TWO OTHER WAYS BATAILLE OFFERS US TO APPROACH SYSTEMS OF KNOWLEDGE: THE UNIVERSAL AND THE FORMLESS.** THE UNIVERSAL IS THAT MONSTOROUS WAY OF BEING WHICH ATTEMPTS TO PLAY WITH FORM AGAINST THE VOID. THE UNIVERSAL ONLY ACHEIVES ITS MOMENT OF BRILLIANCE WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE NOTHINGNESS AT ITS FOUNDATION.'
[[code]]
Bataille ‘85 (Georges. Visions of Excess. The Labyrinth. Translated by Allan Stoekl)

[[code]]
//THE UNIVERSAL resembles a bull….. nothingness had not totally opened beneath its feet.// (177; see also Bataille 1988b, 92)

**THE FORMLESS IS THAT MODE OF BEING THAT DENIES THE NEED FOR SYSTEMS OF KNOWLEDGE TO ASSUME A FORM. THE WORK OF ALL PHILOSOPHY ATTEMPTS NOTHING OTHER THAN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS LOGIC. THE AFFIRMATION OF A UNIVERSE WITHOUT FORM, AS IN CALLING IT SPIT, DENIES THIS ALL ENCOMPASSING DESIRE.**
[[code]]
Bataille ‘96 (Georges. Encyclopedia Acephalica: Comprimising the Critical Dictionary and Related Texts. Translated by Iain White)

[[code]]
//FORMLESS--A dictionary ……amounts to saying that the universe is something akin to a spider or a gob of spittle.//

**IT IS WITH ALL OF THIS BEHIND US THAT WE ARE ABLE TO AFFIRM THE RESOLUTION. NOT AS A WAY OF NAILING THE RESOLUTION DOWN TO THE LIMITS IT ATTEMPTS TO ENFORCE, OR BY CONTINUING THE CLOSED ENERGY ECONOMY THAT IT IMPLIES, BUT BY CONFRONTING THOSE NOTIONS OF FORM WITH THEIR EXCESS. WE READ LITERATURE AND AFFIRM IT AS A FORM OF ENERGY THAT PLAYS OUTSIDE THE NEAT BOUNDRIES ASSUMED BY THE RESOLUTION. WE FOLLOW THE FALL OF LITERATURE’S MEANING BY TRACING THE FALL OF FINNEGAN FROM GRACE TO GROUND LEVEL. WE FURTHERMORE UNDERSTAND THAT ALL SYSTEMS OF KNOWLEDGE OR FORM ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME KIND OF FALL. IT IS IN THAT SPIRIT, THE SPIRIT OF THE ACCURSED SHARE, THAT WE AFFIRM A FORMLESS VERSION OF THE RESOLUTION; ONE THAT REMAINS ALWAYS FALLEN, AND ALWAYS PRESENT IN ITS EXCESS.**

**WE WILL NOT OFFER TRADITIONAL SOLVENCY FOR SUCH AN AFFIRMATION WE INSTEAD RETURN TO FINNEGANS WAKE, NOT TO RECONNECT WITH FINNEGAN (NOW REFERRED TO AS HCE), BUT RATHER TO USE HIS CHILDREN, SHEM AND SHAUN, AS A MIRROR TO THE RESOLUTION. SHEM, THE REPRESENTATION OF THE AUTHOR, IS THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF THE ACCURSED SHARE. HIS GROTESQUE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, RADICAL ALTERITY, AND PROXIMITY TO EXCESS MAKE HIM THE IDEAL FIGURE OF THE FORMLESS. ALL ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE SHEM FALL SHORT…ONLY JOYCE’S MYSTERIOUS LANGUAGE OF THE DARK CAN CAPTURE HIS GROSS OTHERNESS. *WARNING* THIS PASSAGE MAY CONTAIN THE ANSWER TO A RIDDLE ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE…THEN AGAIN IT MAY BE FULL OF SHIT.**
[[code]]
Joyce ‘39 (James, Finnegan’s Wake)

[[code]]
//Shem is as short for Shemus as Jem is joky for Jacob. …..s walk on the / spot.//

**SHAUN ON THE OTHER HAND ABHORS HIS BROTHER’S CONNECTION TO FILTH AND DECAY. SHAUN, AS A FORCE OF HOMOGENEITY, SEEKS TO KEEP THE HETEROLOGICAL WORLD OF SHEM AT BAY; TO FABRICATE A WORLD OF HOLINESS AND CLEAN DIVISIONS. THIS DESIRE, HOWEVER, FAILS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF SHEM’S REPEATED DENIALS. SHAUN’S FAILURE IN ENFORCING HIS DIVINE LAW ONTO HIS BROTHER IS REPLACED BY THE DISCOVERY OF EXCESS IN HIMSELF. SHEM AND SHAUN IN ESSENCE BECOME ONE; THE FORMLESS AND THAT WHICH IS DESTROYED BY THE VOID. THEIR RELATIONSHIP, ECHOING THE FALL OF LITERATURE, REVEALS THE DUAL MEANING OF SACER, BOTH SOILED AND SAINT.**

//Like the priest who condemns Stephen's debauchery in A Portrait, Shaun, "of increate God the servant" ……resound with the dangerous ambiguity of the heterological.//

**SHEM AND SHAUN REVEAL THE IMPOSSIBLE WORK OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL ENFRAMING OF THE WORLD. THE DIVINE IS ALWAYS PERCHED ON THE PRECIPICE OF THE FALL. THE CLEAN IS ALWAYS ALREADY CONFRONTED BY SHIT. AND FINALLY, THE MOVEMENT OF CURSED ENERGY CONFRONTS ALL SYSTEMS THAT ATTEMPT TO INSULATE THEMSELVES FROM EVIL. THIS IS THE WORK OF THE HETEROLOGICAL…THIS IS THE THEOREM OF THE ACCURSED SHARE.**

**Burke 08**, (Adam, Writer for NPR) December 4, 2008 “Sucked into the tunnels underneath Las Vegas” [[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97800190]]
__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">It would be easy to go a whole weekend on the Las Vegas Strip without spotting a sign of a crisis. Never mind that more than 14,000 people are living on the streets</span>__ — and that __Nevada ranks second in the nation in homeless population per capita. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Seeing evidence of this is a matter of knowing — or perhaps choosing — where to look</span>__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span> One __might begin with the slot machines on a busy casino floor — tourists, blackjack tables, cocktail waitresses in impossibly tiny outfits__. And __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">if one were willing to pay</span> the price of admission, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">an elevator could transport</span>__ the seeker __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">to a more vice and excess upstairs</span>__ __— rooftop pools and lavish suites__. But the __homeless still wouldn't be found__.__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">But what if there were an elevator that went downward</span>__? Let's __say that you could descend below the sunken lounges, past kitchens and utility closets, through layers of concrete.__ __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">It is here that Las Vegas' truly gritty underbelly can be found; a hidden matrix of tunnels beneath the Strip, another version of the city born out of storm drains</span>__. Matt __O'Brien, a Las Vegas writer, has been__ exploring this underworld for several years. On one particular evening, he's outfitted sort of like a commando, with heavy boots, backpack and an industrial-sized flashlight that could double as a weapon."I've been __exploring these storm drains for more than five years,"__ he says sloshing through muck and gravel that blanket the tunnel floor. "I think __I know these storm drains better than anyone who doesn't actually live in them__. And __I know the__ storm drain __system__ probably — and this is nothing to brag about — better than anyone else."No reason to doubt him. __In 2007, O'Brien published a book, //Beneath the Neon,// <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">about</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">300 miles of underground tunnels</span> that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">crisscross beneath the city</span>__. "So, yeah, now __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">we're moving underneath Caesar's Palace. Walking underneath kind of the main property there. This is one of the creepier areas of the storm drain system.</span>__ __Very remote, wet … extremely dark."It's__ after __9 p.m. on a weekday night__. __The__ Vegas __Strip is bustling above__. __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The stage shows are under way</span>____<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">. </span>____<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">In the tunnels, there is stale air and utter darkness</span>__. At one point, the tunnel __widen__s __to form a chamber. Above is a metal grate and, somewhere beyond__ that, __the sky__. The plump, almost __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">illegible cursive of graffiti lettering covers the walls — beautiful colors and designs</span>__ __— that can be seen by flashlight.__ "__This is__ one of __the underground art galleries that I discovered down in the storm drains.__ Basically, __you walk in__ about a __half-mile in pitch dark, and you have artwork going down the walls__ that goes down for about a half-mile," O'Brien says. __Ahead, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the tunnel devours the flashlight beam. Noises make him stop and shine the light back in the other direction</span>.__ O'Brien offers something like reassurance. __"There's always the butterflies.__ There's always that apprehension when you walk into a storm drain. Just because you've been in the drain the day before, that doesn't mean it's going to be the same environment [when you come] down the next day," he says. "I've met people down in the drains — you'll come down the next day, and all of a sudden, you know, they'll tell you to screw off. They'll kind of reach for their shank or their self-defense weapon and make it clear they don't want to talk to you today."Over the years, __O'Brien has met more than a hundred people who live in the tunnels.__ They're scattered in pockets across the city.He leads ahead, away from the trickling water, down a side channel that stays dry most of the time. __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The ceiling gets lower, the corridor narrower and the air becomes stale with the faint scent of body odor and human waste. There's an encampment, a kind of cardboard lean-to."Yo! Anyone here?,"</span>__ O'Brien says.__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">No one</span>__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">. __Soon there are signs of life. The forms of two men show in the glow of candlelight. One of them, with a shag of greasy hair, is slumped on a couch. In front of him, on a makeshift coffee table, there are a few__</span> hypodermic __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">needles. The other man is better groomed, and wearing a button-down shirt and a decent pair of slacks</span>____.__ They greet O'Brien enthusiastically. __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Their names are Brian and Steve</span>.__ They haven't seen O'Brien since he was down here last Thanksgiving. Steve talks about how they returned to their camp that day to find O'Brien had left them Thanksgiving dinner. "Big turkey and stuffing. It was pretty good," he says. __Steve is the well-dressed one__. He's 42 and grew up in Las Vegas. And he makes his living at casinos around town, doing what's known as "silver mining," which means he looks for credits left behind on slot machines."You know, __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">I'll start at Harrah's. And depending on how I feel, I'll go to either the Venetian and the Mirage</span>__. A lot __depends on how I look, because those are two very hard places. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">If you don't look right, they'll stop you and watch you</span>__. It's always busy at Harrah's, so you're able to walk through the casino without drawing much attention to yourself."__To blend in, they__ need to __dress the part. That explains the rack of button-down shirts and slacks.__ He shows off __his quarters, defined by cardboard walls: a queen-sized bed, a dresser, even a makeshift shower. Steve says__ his luck varies. The night before, he'd visited several casinos, and things hadn't been going well."Then __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">I went to the Bellagio. I was walking through and turned the corner in one area of the casino, and there on the machine was $116. Nobody around, so I hit the cash-out button. Took it, cashed it out, and that was the end of my night. Helped me out today. I ate very well today</span>____. I had a late breakfast last night. And I still have about 50 bucks left,"__ he says__. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">But Steve is addicted to methamphetamine and gambling</span>,__ so __holding on to money can be difficult.__"That's what I'm trying not to do is gamble my money away any more. And as far as the drugs, I'm trying to slowly get myself to where I don't crave it. Tonight, I'm taking it easy. I figure I'll just call it an early night and see what I can do tomorrow," he says.After a while __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">in the Las Vegas storm drains, it's easy to lose one's bearings — to forget that directly above is a very different world</span>____. O'Brien is often struck by the contrast.__"You can be in the Hard Rock Casino, which is one of the hipper, kind of younger, richer casinos in town, kind of celebrity-watching people, people watching, betting thousand dollars per hand in a game of blackjack. And right __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">underneath</span>__ __the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Hard Rock</span> is one of the worst Skid Rows I've ever seen in my life__," he says.__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> There are broken bottles, hypodermic needles strewn all over the tunnel floor and people passed out.</span>__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">"</span>And last time I was down there, __I actually saw some blankets and teddy bears and stuff, which gave me the impression that a young kid was living down in there with a mom or dad, or both."That contrast is what keeps O'Brien coming back to the tunnels, long after the book was finished. He brings food and clothing to people like Brian and Steve. And the tunnels have become a kind of refuge for him from the city.__"When work wasn't going all that great, or my relationship with my girlfriend wasn't that great, I would strap on the boots and grab my flashlight, my gear in the trunk. And a lot of times I would just gear up and walk a tunnel. In some ways, there are certain things about underground Vegas that I prefer to aboveground Vegas."A long tunnel leads out to the dark recesses of a parking structure. A few more steps, and it's back in a crush of pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip. O'Brien looks a little out of place, with his dark clothing, knit cap and muddy boots, still clutching that heavy-duty flashlight. Studying O'Brien, decked out in his tunnel gear, an idea hits: Maybe he should become the official guide to the storm drains. __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Visitors could explore the underbelly of Las Vegas; they would meet real live human casualties of a city that trades on excess. Then again, that might just be too much reality in a town that prides itself on artifice. And besides — glancing around at all the tourists, no one's checking out the gutters. They're all looking up, at the flicker and pulse of the lights</span>____.__
In some sense, we are all tourists … The flash of the resolution… The call for reduction of troops in South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey … but where does it end? When do we plunge into the sewer to find the foundations out of which we enjoy modern SOCIETY?

The role ballot for this debate represents a step away from the ideologies that continue to justify masking over and ignoring wide ranging structural violence and oppression within our discussions of the resolution, the ballot acts as an endorsement for discursive action by including And hearing those who often become invisible to us in our discussions especially in times of war and destruction.

Now we will attend to the pieces of the topic through Mathew O’Brian interview with Mike, a Vietnam Veteran that lived in the tunnels below las vegas.
<span style="color: black;">“Yeah</span>__<span style="color: black;">. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">I had an apartment, but I ran out of money last month. Now I got to get my wife to love me again. Every time I call her, she hangs up on me. I moved into this end of the tunnel, because you got to hunch down to get here. Most people are too lazy to come this far under the road and they don’t want to climb in and out of the channel. They do too much dumb shit that I don’t want to be involved with. Hell, I do enough dumb stuff on my own.”</span></span>__<span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;">“But you hang out with them?” “I don’t invite them in here. If they show up, they show up. But I usually throw people out pretty quickly. They make a mess. I know this isn’t a house, but it is where I live. They disrespect it. They leave all their trash and crack bags all over the place. They don’t care where they piss and shit. I got a bucket for that. I got toilet paper. If I have to take a dump, I roll it up in a newspaper, put it in a garbage bag, and carry it out of here. You go down to the other end of the tunnel and it stinks like hell. You got to live somewhere, so why disrespect it? “I’m not saying I’m innocent or anything,” he continued. “I do some drugs, but I don’t live on them. If it stops being recreational for me, I’m not going to keep doing it.” “What’s your drug?” “If I had my choice and I had to do something all the time, it’d probably be</span></span><span style="color: black;"> __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">speed. It’s</span>__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> __what I used to do in the old days, in Vietnam and shit__</span>. I’ve tried every drug there is at least once. I’ll try anything just to see if I like it. I tried heroin once and I couldn’t understand why anybody would want to take something that’s going to make them puke and go to sleep. Hell, I could eat my wife’s cooking and do that.” Smiling, I surveyed the camp. An ottoman was pushed against the far end of the couch and a plastic cooler served as a coffee table. A stack of milk crates topped with a videocassette recorder stood in the middle of the tunnel. A TV that was powered by a generator, explained Mike, once accompanied the VCR – but it washed away during the recent rainstorm. </span>
<span style="color: black;">“Where’d you get all this stuff?” I asked Mike, who was dressed in faded blue jeans and dirty white socks. </span>
<span style="color: black;">“Mainly out of dumpsters and from other people on the streets.”</span>
<span style="color: black;">“How’d you get it down here?”</span>
<span style="color: black;">“Over the top of the chain-link fence. Then I just lowered it into the channel and dragged it in here.”</span>
<span style="color: black;">“At night?”</span>
<span style="color: black;">“No. In broad daylight. I’m not trying to hide anything.”</span>
<span style="color: black;">I laughed. “You’re crazy, man. That must’ve given the tourists a jolt.” </span>
<span style="color: black;">“Nobody has ever come down here and said anything to me. The cops were down here yesterday. They didn’t say anything. If they ever do, I’ll tell them that I’m homesteading under the Civil Rights Act as a veteran.”</span>
<span style="color: black;">“How’d you end up on the streets?”</span>
<span style="color: black;">“Me and my wife own a Freightliner truck. Well, I pissed her off just before I went into a casino to use the bathroom. We were getting ready to leave town and she just drove away. I came out of the casino and my blanket and pillow were lying on the ground. She was gone.”</span>
<span style="color: black;">Grimacing, Mike lifted his right hand and set it on the arm of the couch. It was red and swollen from his wrist to his fingertips. </span>
<span style="color: black;">“What happened?” I asked him.</span>
<span style="color: black;">“I don’t know,” he said, picking at a scab on top of the hand. “Something bit me, I think. It hurts like hell. It hurts all the way up to my fingertips. It hurt so bad yesterday I couldn’t climb out of here to go get water. I was so dehydrated I was thinking about taking a rag, dipping it into that dirty rainwater, and sucking on the end of it. Last night, I actually cried it hurt so bad.</span>
<span style="color: black;">“It almost feels like a break or a fracture. It constantly burns. It hurts to even move my fingers. I can feel a fly landing on the damn thing and walking around on it. But last night I just laid here and kept my hand elevated against the wall. I think that helped a lot. If it gets any bigger, I’ll probably lance it. If it’s not better after that, I’ll visit the doctor.</span>
<span style="color: black;">“__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">I’m supposed to have hernia surgery soon anyway. You can see how my stomach’s busted right here.” He pointed at a lump next to his navel. “I have a rip in my stomach line. But when I went to the hospital last week, they said they didn’t have any beds available for people who don’t have insuranc</span>e__. So I guess I’ll have to go back some other time.”</span>
<span style="color: black;">While Mike spoke, I studied his facial features. He had gray-green eyes, which brought life to his otherwise dead and dirty face. His nose was flat and off-center – not from sanctioned boxing, I assumed, but from barroom brawls. A scar ran down his right cheek, showing through the dirt and stubble “That’s my Clint Eastwood,” he said, when I asked about the scar. “I was at a bar in Dallas. I had to piss and there was a really long line for the bathroom, so I went outside to pee. When I came out of the bar, two guys were robbing this one guy in the parking lot. The dumb-ass that I am, I tried to help the guy. One of the guys took a screwdriver and stuck it right in my stomach.” He pointed at a circular scar. “I could actually feel it hit my backbone. Then he went for my head and I put my left arm up to block the screwdriver.” He extended the arm, revealing a crooked scar. “The other guy came at me with a razor blade and sliced me on my face. And then they robbed me. I guess that’s what I get for butting into other people’s business.” “When did that happen?” “Probably fifteen, twenty years ago. I was bleeding so bad that blood was shooting out of my veins. They hit an artery in my arm. I still got a plastic bloodline in there. I tried to open the door of the bar, but I fell flat on my face. I woke up in the hospital.” “Sounds like you’re lucky to be alive.” “I don’t know. All I know is the nurse who put the catheter in me had really big breasts.” Noticing movement along the bottom of the wall, I turned away from Mike. A trail of ants weaved in and out of the camp. I followed the trail until it disappeared in the sunlight, then looked out across the interstate. Luxor and Mandalay Bay shimmered in the light. I turned back toward Mike. “You’re a veteran?” “Yeah. __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">I did three years in ’Nam beginning when I was seventeen years old</span>__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span> I was there in ’67, ’68, ’69 and a little bit of ’70. I was in the Army. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">“__I didn’t plan on going to Vietnam__</span>,” continued Mike, propping his feet up on the cooler. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">“__I went into the Army to get away from home. My dad was a violent bastard and I was always a big guy from the time I was really young. I don’t remember ever being small. I could kick his ass, so there was always shit going on around the house. I went into the service to get away from all that.__</span> “Well, my dad followed me to basic training, to AIT [Advanced Infantry Training], and we’d get into fights. So __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">I went to my company commander and said, ‘I want to get away from all this fighting. Send me somewhere else.’ The smart-ass sent me to Vietnam.</span>”__</span>
<span style="color: black;">“What was that like?”</span>
__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; color: black;">“It ain’t John Wayne. It ain’t like the movies. It’s different, much different. There ain’t no heroes – except the dead, I guess – and anybody who tells you they weren’t scared is lying their ass off. I pissed in my pants more than once. I’ll be the first to admit it</span>__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; color: black;">. __It’s really hard to take that first step when you don’t know if you’re walking right into it. But after a while, you get used to it. It’s survive or die. You just do it.__</span>__<span style="color: black;">”</span>__
__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">O’Brien asked him if he saw a lot of action</span>__
__<span style="color: black;">“</span>__<span style="color: black;">Did you see much action?”</span>
<span style="color: black;"> “__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Sex or violence?”</span>__ he deadpanned. __“<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Oh, I don’t know. A little bit, I guess. But that’s a question I don’t like to answer. I’ve actually had people ask me how many people I killed. I hate that question. I really do. It’s</span>__ not something you want to talk about.“__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Obviously, you’re going to see some action in Vietnam. Something’s going to happen at some point or another. You’re in a country where you don’t know who the enemy is. They talk about baby killers and women killers – but when they got a grenade taped to their body and they’re coming at you, what are you supposed to do?</span>__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> __“I don’t know. All I know is that I’d //never// fight for this country again. It didn’t do nothing for me. It used me, then left me hanging. I’ll just defend myself and my friends from now on, nobody else.”__</span> “Were you a tunnel rat?” During the Vietnam War, Viet Cong guerrillas utilized a network of tunnels that stretched from Saigon to the Cambodian border. The network – dug in the 1940s to fight off colonial landlord France and expanded over the years – connected villages, districts, and provinces. The typical tunnel complex included a storage room, conference room, sleeping chamber, kitchen, and hospital. Punji-stake traps protected the trap-door entrances. As U.S. soldiers high-stepped through the jungles, the guerrillas – dressed like peasants in cone-shaped hats, silk pajamas, and truck-tire sandals – waited behind trees and in spider holes. They opened fire on the lead column, then scurried into the underground. Anxious for revenge, the Americans returned fire and advanced – but found no trace of “Charlie.” Their sweeps also proved fruitless. It was as if the enemy had melted into the foliage. It was as if they were fighting ghosts.Once aware of the underground network, U.S. troops tried a variety of tactics. They dropped grenades through the trap-door entrances, which – of course – did little damage. They dynamited tunnels, destroying Viet Cong documents and equipment that should’ve been seized. They pumped poisonous gas into the ventilation shafts – but trap doors prevented the gas from spreading throughout the multi-level complexes. Finally, the U.S. military decided the complexes needed to be explored before they were destroyed. A special unit was formed to carry out this task. The unit was volunteer; there are some things that even the military can’t make a man do. Typically, the soldiers were small (many of the tunnels were too narrow to turn around in) and introverted. They seemed to have something to prove to their commanders, fellow soldiers, and themselves. Their basic gear: a knife, a pistol, and a flashlight. Their basic rules: There’s no rank in the underground; never hold the flashlight close to your body (that makes for an easy target); and always whistle “Dixie” as you exit the network, so you’re not mistaken for the enemy by aboveground troops. Their nickname: tunnel rats.“I’m a fool,” said Mike, still picking at the scab, “but I’m not an idiot. Those guys would go in there with a knife between their teeth, a forty-five tied around their neck, and a flashlight in their hand. That was it. They didn’t have anything else. This tunnel here is the Hilton compared to what they were crawling around in. Hell, they’d probably pay twelve hundred dollars a month for this – plus utilities. See, those guys never knew what they were coming up on. Sometimes the tunnels were empty. Sometimes there were whole battalions down there.” Indeed, sometimes the complexes were inactive or “cold.” Nonetheless, the tunnel rats had to deal with booby traps and poisonous snakes and spiders … the darkness, claustrophobia, and all their worst fears. Sometimes the complexes were active or “hot.” Tunnel rats often found that out the hard way – the flash of a gun, a bayonet to the groin, hand-to-hand combat in the narrow passageways. Some rats crawled and crawled and crawled, surfacing miles away in a straw hut or pigpen, hands and knees bleeding. Some were injured or killed in the complexes, then dragged out by the rope conveniently tied to their ankle. Some never surfaced at all. </span>__<span style="color: black;">“<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Have you followed the war in Iraq?”</span></span>__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; color: black;"> __Matt asked Mike. “Yeah,”__</span><span style="color: black;"> he said. __“<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">A little bit.

I would’ve voted for JFK. But after that, there hasn’t been anybody worth voting for. Since I came back from Vietnam, there hasn’t been anyone worth a damn. Anyway, my vote ain’t going to make a difference. This country ain’t run by the voters. It’s run by the businessmen. They’re going to put whoever they want in the White House – and the president doesn’t make that much of a difference anyhow. He’s just a figurehead.

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Destructors by Graham Greene; published January 27, 2004 found at http://www.sangam.org/articles/view/?id=183</span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">It was on the eve of August Bank holiday that the latest recruit became the leader of the Wormsley Common Gang.</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> No one was surprised except Mike, but Mike at the age of nine was surprised by everything. ‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">If you don’t shut your mouth,’ somebody once said to him, ‘you’ll get a frog down it.’ After that Mike had kept his teeth clamped except when the surprise was too great</span>. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">The new recruit</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> had been with the gang since the beginning of the summer holidays, and there were possibilities about his brooding silence that all recognized. He <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">never wasted a word even to tell his name until that was required of him by the rules. When he said ‘Trevor’ it was a statement of fact</span>, not as it would have been with the others a statement of shame or defiance. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The gang met every morning in an impromptu car park, the site of the last bomb of the first blitz. The leader, who was known as Blackie, claimed to have heard it fall</span>, and no one was precise enough in his dates to point out he would have been one year old and fast asleep on the down platform of Wormsley Common Underground station. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">On one side of the car park leant the first occupied house, No.3. T, whose words were almost confined to voting ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to the plan of operations proposed each day by Blackie, once startled the whole gang by saying broodingly</span>, </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Wren built that house, father says.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Who’s Wren?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘The man who built St.Paul’s.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Who cares?’ Blackie said. ‘It’s only Old Misery’s.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Old Misery – whose real name was Thomas – had once been a builder and decorator. He lived alone in the crippled house, doing for himself. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Been to the loo’</span>, one of the boys said, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">for it was common knowledge that since the bombs fell something had gone wrong with the pipes of the house and Old Misery was too mean to spend money on the property</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The loo</span> was a wooden shed at the bottom of the narrow garden with a star-shaped hole in the door: it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">had escaped the blast which had smashed the house next door and sucked out the window-frames of No.3.</span> </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The next time the gang became aware of Mr.Thomas was more surprising. Blackie, Mike and a thin yellow boy, who for some reason was called by his surname Summers, met him on the common coming back from the market. Mr.Thomas stopped them. He said glumly, ‘You belong to the lot that play in the car park?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Mike was about the answer when Blackie stopped him. As the leader had responsilities, ‘Suppose we are?’ he said ambiguously. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘I got some chocolates</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">,’ Mr. Thomas said. ‘Don’t like ‘em myself. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Here you are. Not enough to go round, I don’t suppose, There never is</span>,’ he added with sombre conviction. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">He handed over three packets of Smarties. </span></span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">The gang were puzzled and perturbed by this action </span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">and tried to explain it away. ‘Bet someone dropped them and he picked ‘em up,’ somebody suggested. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Pinched ‘em and then got in a bleeding funk,’ another thought aloud. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘It’s a bribe,’ Summers said. ‘He wants us to stop bouncing balls on his wall.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">We’ll show him we don’t take bribes,</span>’ Blackie said, and they sacrificed the whole morning to the game of bouncing that only Mike was young enough to enjoy. There was no sign from Mr Thomas. </span>
<span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Next day T astonished them all. He was late at the rendezvous, and the voting for that day’s exploit took place without him. At Blackie’s suggestion the gang was to disperse in pairs, take buses at random and see how many free rides could be snatched from unwary conductors (the operation was to be carried out in pairs to avoid cheating)</span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri; text-decoration: none;">.</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;"> They were drawing lots for their companions when T arrived. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘Where you been, T?’ Blackie asked. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘I’ve been //there//’ T said. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘Where?’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘At Old Misery’s.’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘At Old Misery’s?’ Blackie said. He had a sensation that T was treading on dangerous ground. He asked hopefully, ‘Did you break in?’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘No. I rang the bell.’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘And what did he do?’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘He showed it me.’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘Pinch anything?’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘No’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘What did you do it for then?’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">T said, ‘It’s a beautiful house.’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘What do you mean, a beautiful house?’ Blackie asked with scorn.</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘It’s got a staircase two hundred years old like a corkscrew. Nothing holds it up.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘What do you mean, nothing holds it up. Does it float?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘It’s to do with opposite forces, Old Misery said.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘What else?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘There’s panelling.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Like in the Blue Boar?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Two hundred years old.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Is Old Misery two hundred years old?’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">Mike laughed suddenly and then was quiet again. The meeting was in a serious mood. For the first time since T. had strolled into the car park on the first day of the holidays his position was in danger. It only needed a single use of his real name and the gang would be at his heels. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘What did you do it for</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">?’ Blackie asked. He was just, he had no jealousy, he was anxious to retain T in the gang if he could. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">It was the word ‘beautiful’ that worried him</span> – that belonged to a class world that you culd still see parodied at the Wormsley Common Empire by a man wearing a top hat and a monocle, with a haw-haw accent He was tempted to say, ‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">My dear Trevor, old chap,’ and unleash his hell bounds. ‘If you’d broken in,’ he said sadly – that indeed would have been an exploit worthy of the gang.</span> </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘This was better,’ T said. ‘I found out things.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘What things?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Old Misery’s going to be away all tomorrow and Bank Holiday</span>.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Blackie said with relief, ‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">You mean we could break in?</span>’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">And pinch things?</span>’ somebody asked. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘I don’t want to pinch anything,’ T said. ‘I’ve got a better idea.’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘What is it?’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">T raised eyes; ‘We’ll pull it down.’ – ‘We’ll destroy it.’</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Midnight is upon us. All is dark and the time of selection has come. Only that which affirms and is affirmed will see the dawn, all else will remain in the abyss of the night. The eternal return is not the assurance that we will see the same day again, but that the sun will rise and fall again, that becoming, chance and multiplicity all occur within the same unity of existence, the same plane of immanence. The thought of the eternal return is a revaluation of all knowable values. There are two kinds of values – those known and those not known. All known values are a product of //ressentiment// and can never see the dawn, can never bring about the return. They are intrinsically linked to negation. We deny life in their name, we act to bring about their existence and cage life within their bounds. These are the values of the government and the imperialists. However, affirmation brings about new values, unknowable values, values that are created by affirmation, not adhered to or strived towards. These values know no boundaries; they come into being through action itself. This round is about ethics, not policy, not action, not advocacy. We ask for your ballot as an endorsement of our ethical stance. Because our very act of debating and the action it entails is active and creative. Vote affirmative as an act of joyous destruction. Vote as an affirmation of the beauty of life, even that which causes us pain, vote to burn their morals to ash and baptize the Overman in them. All suffering is transmuted into joy, all that is heavy becomes light and our spirits become free. We return with the dawn to live a new day.</span>

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We know what</span></span> **__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">transmutation</span> or transvaluation <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">means</span>__** <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… </span></span>**__only here is it completed.__**</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">We continue with the story from Graham Greene, “The Destructors.”</span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Blackie gave a single hoot of laughter and then, like Mike, fell quiet, daunted by the serious implacable gaze</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. ‘</span><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">What’d the police be doing all the time?’</span> he said</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span></span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">‘</span><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">They’d never know. We’d do it from inside. I’ve found a way in. We’d be like worms, don’t you see, in an apple. When we came out again there’d be nothing there – nothing but just walls, and then we’d make the walls fall down</span> – somehow.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">’ </span></span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘We’d go to jug,’ Blackie said. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Who’s to prove? And anyway we wouldn’t have pinched anything.’ He added without the smallest flicker of glee, ‘There wouldn’t be anything to pinch after we’d finished.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘I’ve never heard of going to prison for breaking things,’ Summers said. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘There wouldn’t be time,’ Blackie said. I’ve seen housebreakers at work.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘There are twelve of us,’ T said. ‘We’d organize.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘None of us know how…’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘I know,’ T said. He looked across at Blackie. ‘Have you got a better plan?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Today,’ Mike said tactlessly, ‘we’re pinching free rides…’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Free rides,’ T said. ‘You can stand down, Blackie, if you’d rather…’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘The gang’s got to vote.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Put it up then.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Blackie said uneasily. ‘It’s proposed that tomorrow and Monday we destroy Old Misery’s house.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Here, here,’ said a fat boy called Joe. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Who’s in favour?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">T said, ‘It’s carried.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘How do we start?’ Summers asked. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">He’ll tell you.’ Blackie said. It was the end of his leadership.</span> He went away to the back of the car park and began to kick a stone, dribbling it this way and that. There was only one old Morris in the park, for few cars were left there except lorries; without an attendant there was no safety. He took a flying kick at the car and scaraped a little paint off the rear mudguard. Beyond, paying no more attention to him than to a stranger, the gang had gathered round T; Blackie was dimly aware of the fickleness of favour. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">He thought of going home, of never returning, of letting them all discover the hollowness of T’s leadership, but suppose after all what T proposed was possible – nothing like it had ever been done before</span>. The fame of the Wormsley Common car park gang would surely reach around London. There would be headlines in the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">papers. Even the grown-up gangs who ran the betting at the all-in wrestling and the barrow-boys would hear with respect of how Old Misery’s house had been destroyed. Driven by the pure, simple and altruistic ambition of fame for the gang,</span> Blackie came back to where T stood in the shadow of Misery’s wall. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">T was giving his orders with decision; it was as though this plan had been with him all his life, pondered through the seasons now in his fifteenth year crystallized with the pain of puberty. ‘You,’ he said to Mike, ‘bring some big nails, the biggest you can find, and a hammer. Anyone else who can better bring a hammer and a screwdriver. We’ll need plenty of them. Chisels too. We can’t have too many chisels. Can anybody bring a saw?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘I can,’ Mike said. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Not a child’s saw,’ T said. ‘A real saw.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Blackie realized he had raised his hand like any ordinary member of the gang. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Right, you bring one, Blackie. But now there’s a difficulty. We want a hacksaw.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘What’s a hacksaw?’ someone asked. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘You can get’em at Woolworth’s.’ Summers said. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The fat boy called Joe said gloomily, ‘I knew it would end in a collection.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘I’ll get one myself,’ T said. ‘I don’t want your money. But I can’t buy a sledge-hammer.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Blackie said, ‘They are working on No.15. I know where they’ll leave their stuff for Bank Holiday.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Then that’s all,’ T said. ‘We meet here at nine sharp.</span>’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘I’ve got to go to church,’ Mike said. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Come over the wall and whistle. We’ll let you in.’ </span>
**<span style="font-family: Calibri;">2</span>**
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">On Sunday morning all were punctual except Blackie, even Mike. Mike had had a stroke of luck. His mother felt ill, his father was tired after Saturday night, and he was told to go to church alone with many warnings of what would happen if he strayed. Blackie had had difficulty in smuggling out the saw, and then in finding the sledge-hammer at the back of No.15. He approached the house from a lane at the rear of the garden, for fear of the policeman’s beat along the main road. The tired evergreens kept off a stormy sun; another wet Bank Holiday was being prepared over the Atlantic, beginning in swirls of dust under the trees. Blackie climbed the wall into Misery’s garden. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">There was no sign of anybody anywhere. The loo stood like a tomb in a neglected graveyard. The curtains were drawn. The house slept. Blackie lumbered nearer the saw and the sledge-hammer. Perhaps after all nobody had turned up; the plan had been a wild invention; they had woken wiser. But when he came close to the back door he could hear a confusion of sound hardly louder than a hive in swarm; a clickety-clack, a bang bang nbag, a scraping, a creaking, a sudden painful crack. He thought; it’s true, and whistled. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">They opened the backdoor to him and he came in. He had at once the impression of organization, very different from the old happy-go-lucky ways under his leadership. For a while he wandered up and down stairs looking for T. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Nobody addressed him; he had a sense of great urgency, and already he could begin to see the plan. The interior of the house was being carefully demolished without touching the outer walls</span>. Summers with hammer and chisel was ripping out the skirting-boards in the ground floor dining room; he had already smashed the panels of the door. In the same room Joe was heaving up the parquet blocks, exposing the soft wood floor-boards over the cellar. Coils of wire came out of the damage skirting and Mike sat happily on the floor clipping the wires. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">On the curved stairs two of the gang were working hard with an inadequate child’s saw on the banisters – when they saw Blackie’s big saw they signalled for it wordlessly. When he next saw them a quarter of the banisters had been dropped into the hall. He found T at last in the bathroom – he sat moodily in the least cared-for room in the house, listening to the sounds coming up from below. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">You’ve really done it.’ Blackie said with awe. ‘What’s going to happen?’ </span></span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘We’ve only just begun.’</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> T said</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. He looked at the sledge-hammer and gave his instructions</span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">. ‘You stay here and break the bath and the wash-basin. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Don’t bother about the pipes. They come later.</span>’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Mike appeared at the door. ‘I’ve finished the wire, T,’ he said. </span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">‘</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Good. You’ve just got to go wandering round now.</span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar">The kitchen’s in the basement. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Smash all the china and glass and bottles you can lay hold of. Don’t turn on the taps – we don’t want a flood – yet</span>. Then go into all the rooms and turn out drawers. If they are locked get one of the others to break them open.</span> <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Tear up any papers you find and smash all the ornaments. Better take a carving-knife with you from the kitchen. The bedroom’s opposite here. Open the pillows and tear up the sheets. That’s enough for the moment. And you, Blackie, when you’ve finished in here crack the plaster in the passage up with your sledge-hammer.</span></span></span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘What are you going to do?’ Blackie asked. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘I’m looking for something special.’ T said. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">It was nearly lunch time before Blackie had finished and went in search of T. <span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">Chaos had advanced</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">. The kitchen was a shambles of broken glass and china</span></span>.</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;"> The dining room was stripped of parquet, the skirting was up, the door had been taken off its hinges, and the destroyers had moved up a floor. Streaks of light came in through the closed shuters where they worked with the seriousness of creators – and destruction after all is a form of creation. A kind of imagination had seen this house as it had now become. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">Mike said, ‘I’ve got to go home for dinner.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">‘Who else?’ T asked, but all the others on one excuse or another had brought provisions with them. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">They squatted in the ruins of the room and swapped unwanted sandwiches. Half an hour for lunch and they were at work again. By the time Mike returned, they were on the top floor, and by six the superficial damage was completed. The doors were all off, all the skirtings raised, the furniture pillaged and ripped and smashed – no one could have slept in the house except on a bed of broken plaster. T gave his orders – eight o’clock next morning, and to escape notice they climbed singly over the garden w</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">all, into the car park. Only Blackie and T were left; the light had nearly gone, and when they touched a switch, nothing worked – Mike had done his job thoroughly. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Did you find anything special?</span>’ Blackie asked. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">T nodded. ‘Come over here.’ He said, ‘and look’. Out of both pockets he drew bundles of pound notes. ‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Old Misery’s savings</span>.’ He said. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘What are you going to do? Share them?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘We aren’t thieves.’ T said ‘Nobody’s going to steal anything from this house. I keep these for you and me – a celebration.’ He knelt down on the floor and counted them out – there were seventy in all. ‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">We’ll burn them</span>,’ he said, ‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">one by one,’</span> and taking it in turns <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">they</span> held a note upwards and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">lit the top corner, so that the flame burnt slowly towards their fingers. The grey ash floated above them and fell on their heads like age</span>. ‘I’d like to see Old Misery’s face when we are through,’ T said. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘You hate him a lot?’ Blackie asked. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Of course I don’t hate him,’ T said. ‘There’d be no fun if I hated him</span>.’ </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The last burning note illuminated his brooding face. ‘All this hate and love,’ he said, ‘it’s soft, it’s hooey. There’s only things, Blackie,’ and he looked round the room crowded with the unfamiliar shadows of half things, broken things, former things. ‘I’ll race you home, Blackie,’ he said</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">3</span>**</span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span class="ReadingTextChar">Next morning the serious destruction started</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Two were missing – Mike and another boy whose parents were off to Southend and Brighton in spite of the slow warm drops that had begun to fall and the rumble of thunder in the estuary like the first guns of the old blitz</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. ‘</span><span class="ReadingTextChar">We’ve got to hurry’ T said</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span></span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Summers was restive. ‘Haven’t we done enough?’ he said. ‘I’ve been given a bob for slot machines. This is like work.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘We’ve hardly started,’ T said. ‘Why, there’s all the floors left and the stairs. We haven’t taken out a single window. You voted like the others. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">We are going to destroy this house. There won’t be anything left when we’ve finished</span>.’ </span>
<span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">They began again on the first floor picking up the top floor-boards next the outer wall, leaving the joists exposed. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Then they sawed through the joists and retreated into the hall, as what was left of the floor healed and sank</span></span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">.</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> They had learnt with practice, and the second floor collapsed more easily. By the evening an odd exhilaration seized them as they looked down the great hollow of the house. They ran risks and made mistakes; when they thought of the windows it was too late to reach them. ‘Cor,’ Joe said, and dropped a penny down into the dry rubble-filled well. It cracked and span amongst the broken glass. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Why did we start this?’ Summers asked with astonishment; T was already on the ground, digging at the rubble, clearing a space along the outer wall. ‘Turn on the taps,’ he said. ‘It’s too dark for anyone to see now, and in the morning it won’t matter.’ The water overtook them on the stairs and fell through the floorless rooms. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">It was then they heard Mike’s whistle at the back. ‘Something’s wrong.’ Blackie said. They could hear his urgent breathing as they unlocked the door. </span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">‘</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The bogies?’ Summers asked. </span></span></span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">‘</span><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Old Misery,’ Mike said. ‘He’s on his way.’He put his head between his knees and retched. ‘Ran all the way</span>,</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">’</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> he said with pride. </span></span></span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘But why?’ T said. ‘He told me…’ He protested with the fury of the child he had never been. ‘It isn’t fair.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">T stood with his back to the rubble like a boxer knocked groggy against the ropes. He had no words as his dreams shook and slid. Then Blackie acted before the gang had time to laugh. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘He was down at Southend.’ Mike said, ‘and he was on the train coming back. Said it was too cold and wet.’ He paused and gazed at the water. ‘My, you’ve had a storm here. Is the roof leaking?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">How long will he be?’ </span></span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘Five minutes. I gave Ma the slip and ran.’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘We better clear,’ Summers said. ‘We’ve done enough, anyway.’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘Oh no, we haven’t. Anybody could do this’ – ‘this’ was the shattered hollowed house with nothing left but the walls. Yet walls could be preserved. Facades were valuable. They could build inside again more beautifully than before. This could again be a home. He said angrily, ‘We’ve got to finish. Don’t move. Let me think.’</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘There’s no time,’ a boy said. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘There’s got to be a way,’ T said. ‘We couldn’t have got thus far…’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘We’ve done a lot,’ Blackie said. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘No. No, we haven’t. Somebody watch the front.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘We can’t do any more.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘He may come in at the back.’ </span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">‘</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Watch the back too.’ T began to plead.</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> ‘</span><span class="ReadingTextChar">Just give me a minute and I’ll fix it. I swear I’ll fix it.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">’ </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But his authority had gone with his ambiguity. He was the only one of the gang. ‘Please,’ he said.</span></span></span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">‘</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Please,’ Summers mimicked him, and then suddenly struck home with the fatal name.</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> ‘</span><span class="ReadingTextChar">Run along home, Trevor</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.’ </span></span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span class="ReadingTextChar">T stood with his back to the rubble like a boxer knocked groggy against the ropes. He had no words as his dreams shook and slid.</span> <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Then Blackie acted before the gang had time to laugh, pushing Summers backward. ‘I’ll watch the front, T’ he said, and cautiously he opened the shutters of the hall. The grey wet common stretched ahead, and the lamps gleamed in the puddles. ‘Someone’s coming, T. No, it’s not him. What’s your plan, T?’</span></span></span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Tell Mike to go out to the loo and hide close beside it. When he hears me whistle he’s got to count ten and start to shout.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Shout what?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Oh, Help, anything.’ </span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">‘</span><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">You hear, Mike’ Blackie said. He was the leader again. He took a quick look between the shutters. ‘He’s coming, T</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">’ </span></span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Quick, Mike. The loo. Stay here, Blackie, all of you till I yell.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Where are you going, T?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Don’t worry, I’ll see to this, I said, I would, didn’t I?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Old Misery came limping off the common. He had mud on his shoes and he stopped to scrape them on the pavement’s edge. <span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He didn’t want to soil his house which stood jagged and dark between the bomb sites, saved so narrowly, as he believed, from destruction</span></span>. Even the fan light had been left unbroken by the bomb’s blast. Somewhere somebody whistled. Old Misery looked sharply round. He didn’t trust whistles. A child was shouting: it seemed to come from his own garden. Then a boy ran into the road from the car park. ‘Mr.Thomas,’ he called ‘Mr.Thomas.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">What is it?’ </span></span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘I’m terribly sorry, Mr.Thomas. One of us got taken short, and we thought you wouldn’t mind, and now he can’t get out.’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘What do you mean, boy?’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘He’s got stuck in your loo.’</span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘He’d no business…Haven’t I seen you before?’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘You showed me your house.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘So I did. So I did. That doesn’t give you the right to…’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Do hurry, Mr.Thomas. He’ll suffocate.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Nonsense. He can’t suffocate. Wait till I put my bag in.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘I’ll carry your bag.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Oh no, you don’t. I carry my own.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘This way, Mr.Thomas.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">I can’t get in the garden that way. I’ve got to go through the house.’ </span></span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘But you //can// get in the garden this way, Mr Thomas. We often do</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘You often do?’ He followed the boy with a scandalized fascination. ‘When? What right?…’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Do you see…? The wall’s low. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘I’m not going to climb walls into my own garden. It’s absurd.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘This is how we do it. One foot here, one foot there, and over.’ </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The boy’s face peered down, an arm shot out, and Mr Thomas found </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt; text-decoration: none;">his bag taken and deposited on the other side of the wall</span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">‘Give me back my bag,’ Mr Thomas said. From the loo a boy yelled and yelled. ‘I’ll call the police.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">‘Your bag’s all right, Mr Thomas. Look. One foot there. On your right. Now just above. To your left.’ Mr Thomas climbed over his own garden wall. ‘Here’s your bag, Mr Thomas.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">‘I’ll have the wall built up,’ Mr Thomas said, ‘I’ll not have you boys coming over here, using my loo,’ He stumbled on the path, but the boy caught his elbow and supported him. ‘Thank you, thank you, my boy,’ he murmured automatically. Somebody shouted again through the dark. ‘I’m coming. I’m coming,’ Mr.Thomas called. He said to the boy beside him, ‘I’m not unreasonable. Been a boy myself. As long as things are done regular.’ I don’t mind you playing round the place Saturday mornings. Sometimes I like company. Only it’s got to be regular. One of you asks leave and I say Yes. Sometimes I’ll say No. Won’t feel like it. And you come in at the front door and out at the back. No garden walls. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">‘Do get him out, Mr.Thomas.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">He won’t come to any harm in my loo,</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">’ Mr.Thomas said, stumbling slowly down the garden. ‘Oh, my rheumatics,’ he said. ‘Always get’em on Bank Holiday. I’ve got to go careful. There’s loose stones here</span></span>. Give me your hand. Do you know what my horoscope said yesterday? ‘Abstain from any dealings in first half of week. Danger of serious crash.’ That might be on this path,’ Mr Thomas said. ‘They speak in parables and double meanings.’ He paused at the door or the loo. ‘What’s the matter in there?’ he called. There was no reply. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Perhaps he’s fainted.’ The boy said. </span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">‘</span><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Not in my loo. Here, you, come out.’ Mr.Thomas said, and giving a great jerk at the door he nearly fell on his back when it swung easily open</span>. A hand first supported him and then pushed him hard. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">His head hit the opposite wall and he sat heavily down</span>. His bag hit his feet. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">A hand whipped the key out of the lock and the door slammed. ‘Let me out,’ he called, and heard the key turn in the lock</span>. ‘A serious crash</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,’ he thought, and felt dithery and confused and old. </span></span></span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">A voice spoke to him softly through the star-shaped hole in the door. ‘Don’t worry, Mr.Thomas’ it said, ‘We won’t hurt you, not if you stay quiet.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">Mr.Thomas put his head between his hands and pondered. He had noticed that there was only onle lorry in the car park and he felt certain that the driver would not come for it before the morning. Nobody could hear him from the road in front, and the lane at the back was seldom used. Anyone who passed there would be hurrying home and would not pause for what they would certainly take to be drunken cries. And if he did call ‘Help’, who, on a lonely Bank Holiday evening, would have the courage to investigate? Mr Thomas sat on the loo and pondered with the wisdom of age. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">After a while it seemed to him that there were sounds in the silence – they were faint and came from the direction of his house. He stood up and peered through the ventilation hole – between the cracks in one of the shutters he saw a light, not the light of a lamp, but the wavering light that a candle might give. Then he thought he heard the sound of hammering and scaraping and chipping. He thought of burglars – perhaps they had employed the boy as a scout, but why should burglars engage in what sounded more and more like a stealthy form of carpentry? Mr.Thomas let out an experimental yell, but nobody answered. The noise could not even have reached his enemies. </span>
**<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">4</span>**
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">Mike had gone home to bed, but the rest stayed. <span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The question of leadership no longer concerned the gang.</span></span> With nails, chisels, screwdrivers, anything that was sharp and penetrating they moved around the inner walls worrying at the mortar between the bricks. They started too high, and it was Blackie who hit on the damp course and realized the work could be halved if they weakened the joints immediately above. It was a long, tiring, unamusing job, but at last it was finished. The gutted house stood there balanced on a few inches of mortar between the damp course and the bricks. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 7pt;">There remained the most dangerous task of all, out in the open at the edge of the bomb site. Summers was sent to watch the road for passers-by, and Mr Thomas sitting on the loo, heard closely now the sound of sawing. It no longer came from his house, and that a little reassured him. He felt less concerned. Perhaps the other noises too had no significance. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">A voice spoke to him through the hole. ‘Mr.Thomas.’ </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘Let me out,’ Mr.Thomas said sternly. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘Here’s a blanket,’ the voice said, and the long grey sausage was worked through the hole and fell in swathes over Mr.Thomas’s head. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">‘There’s nothing personal</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">,’ the voice said. ‘We want you to be comfortable tonight.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Tonight,’ Mr.Thomas repeated incredulously. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Catch’ the voice said. ‘Penny buns – we’ve buttered them, and sausage balls. We don’t want you to starve, Mr.Thomas.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Mr.Thomas pleaded desperately. ‘A joke’s a joke, boy. Let me out and I won’t say a thing. I’ve got rheumatics. I got to sleep comfortable.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘You wouldn’t be comfortable, not in your house, you wouldn’t. Not now.’ </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘What do you mean, boy?’But the footsteps receded. There was only the silence of night; no sound of sawing. Mr.Thomas tried one more yell, but he was daunted and rebuked by the silence – a long way off an owl hooted and made away again on its muffled flight through the soundless world. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Security, establishes all that is contingent and unknown as Evil. However, life is intrinsically unknowable and attempts to rationalize it only serve to negate it and find their end in mass violence. Everything different becomes threatening, something to be violently ordered and abolished. Everything is made possible when we condemn as guilty that which threatens the way things are. We must instead affirm difference as beautiful and accept the inevitability of suffering, destruction and change. Only by doing this can we redeem life.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Destructors by Graham Greene; published January 27, 2004 found at http://www.sangam.org/articles/view/?id=183</span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">At seven next morning the driver came to fetch his lorry.</span> He climbed into the seat and tried to start the engine. He was vaguely aware of a voice shouting</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">but it didn’t concern him. At last the engine responded and he backed the lorry until it touched the great wooden shore that supported Mr.Thomas’s house. That way he could drive right out and down the street without reversing. The lorry moved forward, was momentarily checked as though something were pulling it from behind, and then went on to the sound of a long rumbling crash<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span></span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The driver was astonished to see bricks bouncing ahead of him</span>, while stones hit the roof of his cab. He put on his brakes. When he climbed out the whole landscape had suddenly altered. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">There was no house beside the car park, only a hill of rubble</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">He went round and examined the back of his car for damage, and found a rope tied there that was still twisted at the other end round part of a wooden strut. </span></span></span>
<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The driver</span> again <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">became aware of somebody shouting</span>. It came from the wooden erection which was the nearest thing to a house in that desolation of broken brick. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The driver climbed the smashed wall and unlocked the door. Mr.Thomas came out of the loo.</span> He was wearing a grey blanket to which flakes of pastry adhered. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">He gave a sobbing cry. ‘My house,’ he said. ‘Where’s my house</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 10pt;">?’</span></span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘Search me,’ <span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">the driver</span></span> said. His eye lit on the remains of a bath and what had once been a dresser and he <span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: Calibri;">began to laugh</span></span>. There wasn’t anything left anywhere. </span>
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">How dare you laugh?’ Mr. Thomas said. ‘It was my house. My house</span>.’ </span>

How it feels to be ignored is something we all know in some way or another, however the privilege has been granted to us in this debate round to bring to the table what has become forgotten or ignored in the status quo methodology of political projects, in the case of the people of Fallujah they never had the opportunity to be included in the discussions of the American invasion of Iraq… maybe it’s time we think about them for once.
We advocate these voices along with others must be brought into discussion as we debate this year’s resolution which states
<span style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">**Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and police presence in one or more of the following: South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey.**</span>

We recognize the value of traditional debate however, our affirmation doesn’t prescribe to a traditional impact calculus where probability, magnitude and timeframe are arbitrarily determined. It is absolutely necessary to enter into a dialogue with the oppressed because political engagement absent this awareness leads to failure of our politics. This means stepping back from our flows and “expert authors” to change oppressive dialectical structures in political decision making taking us to a more personalized brand of politics. Understanding this year’s resolution not in individual compartments that we can manage but as a means of building personalized relations with those we have come to debate about.
Paulo Friere gave us insight to why our personalized brand of politics acts as a counter hegemonic means of confronting oppression in the face of such situations. politics minus this dialogue will keep our practices hollow.
Paulo Friere, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Chapter 1, educator and director of the Department of Cultural Extension of Recife University,1970
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For the truly humanist educator and …. . Such a program constitutes cultural invasion,[11]good intentions notwithstanding</span>

Our affirmation of the resolution escapes the politics of business as usual - opening up agency that resists the sovereigns command of life and beauty.

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">But such a political program has far reaching consequences, ….. may be found in the animal life shared by both entities.</span>

we should ground our discussion this round in alternative relationships to the resolution, we should aim the discussion to the plight of systematic violence that oppresses us while stepping away from ideologies that ignore the many forms of violence within the policies we construct.
<span style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">**Mumia Abu-Jamal 1998** [“A QUIET AND DEADLY VIOLENCE,” 9/19/98, <span style="color: windowtext;">[[http://www.mumia.nl/TCCDMAJ/quietdv.htm]]</span>]</span>

The role ballot for this debate represents a step away from the ideologies that continue to justify masking over and ignoring wide ranging structural violence and oppression within our discussions of the resolution, the ballot acts as an endorsement for discursive action by including And hearing those who often become invisible to us in our discussions especially in times of war and destruction.
Paulo Freire explains how our discussions that emphasizes turning our discourse and activism into true action is an important part of revolutionary goals when he said

==2AC Framework== 

Traditional debate practices controlled by this framework reinforce disinterested scholarship reducing debate to a point scoring game. These practices create a breeding ground for neoconservative politicians akin to those found in the bush era of politics. Our argument is a criticism of the normal functioning of debate designed to better understand the way our practices oppress others.

<span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Colin Powell's presentation to the Security Council was to be followed by a press conference.</span></span>
<span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> And then</span></span><span style="line-height: 115%;">, at the last minute,</span>
<span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">someone noticed something inconvenient about the location.</span></span>
<span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> There was a tapestry reproduction of Guernica hanging on the wall.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">Let us begin with information provided in this year's Project Censored book, </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">"Censored 2006", that lists civilian suffering in Fallujah as the second biggest story ignored by the Establishment media in 2005</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">. The following is recounted from the book's report, Media Coverage Fails on Iraq: Fallujah and the Civilian Death Toll, and addresses, among other things, American house-to house searches: "</span><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Burhan Fasa'a, an Iraqi journalist, said</span> Americans grew easily frustrated with Iraqis who could not speak English. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">'Americans did not have interpreters with them, so they entered houses and killed people because they didn't speak English.

We include these Iraqi voices primarily because they need to be heard - in THIS community and as a part of THIS discussion. These voices, like the painting hanging behind me, pull our discussion of war back into the realm of humanity, they take us out of the cockpit and into the midst of the streets as the bombs falls and the tanks roll.
These stories also lead us to believe that Guernica’s connection to modern warfighting is not strictly the ideology of killing to save, nor do we accept that the censoring of Guernica in the drive to invade Iraq was purely an aesthetic decision. So when confronted with the call of this year’s resolution to substantially reduce military and or police presence in one of six nations we are reminded that we are present in at least one of those nations, Iraq, with imperial motive, without a full understanding of our actions, and under false pretenses. We should never have begun, and we should not now be pursuing this particular errand in the wilderness. Our project attempts to use the lesson of Guernica to remember the role of the United States in Iraq because of the remarkable interrelation of those two instances - not because either example is singular but precisely because they do not stand alone in the nightmarish history of violence… Chefchaouen… Warsaw…Dresden… Megiddo… Mai…Lai…Grozny…Fallujah…Afghanistan…Japan…South Korea… Kuwait… Turkey… Iraq… open for cross-x.





=Waving Flag 1AC= 
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag 
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back,

When I get older, I will be stronger 
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag 
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back,

Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
A violent prone, poor people zone 
But it's my home, all I have known 
Where I got grown, streets we would roam  
Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival 
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat

When I get older I will be stronger 
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag 
And then it goes back, and then it goes back 
And then it goes back,

When I get older, I will be stronger 
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag 
And then it goes back, and then it goes back 
And then it goes back,

Let me take you back to where I come from. I come from a family that’s not so typical. My Mom’s side is full blooded Filipino and Mexican. It is from the Philippines that I draw my relation to this year’s resolution. My Grandma used to talk a lot about where she grew up…

She would speak of her sadness walking down the streets after it rained (most people think of rain as cleansing)…no pavement, just dirt or in the case of rain thick mud. In her town you had to walk because vehicles were reserved to two groups of people…the rich and the soldiers. She would speak about their reckless driving…reckless even to the point of children being run down in the streets without second thought by military Jeeps. My Grandmother’s son, my uncle Carlos met the Jeep of his fate at the age of six.

Seven day funerals, seven days of seeing a whole family and community stay in a cramped church for twelve hours a day, from seven in the morning to seven at night. You realize how much your life is worth living after you attend a funeral in the Philippines. It would seem every time I travel there there’s always a funeral to attend. In this instance it was a moment for reflection upon my whole family, to the military however the uncle I never had… and the child my grandmother never saw grow up would remain invisible. Not good enough to make it on some paper report, not even good enough for a bouquet of flowers sent to my grandmother.

In Manila there was a military base, in fact the community surrounding it became economically dependent upon it to the point where they forced you to learn English in schools so you can interact with the military better.

The base is where many young and beautiful Filipino women made their income to help support their families. Communities Indoctrinated by the U.S. military presence into careers like prostitution and drug dealing. My grandmother had firsthand experience with these issues forced to watch her less fortunate friends raped and beaten by soldiers on what she called nearly a daily occurrence.

She says that some of her best friends where prostitutes and that she herself had never participated, however when you’re the oldest in your and the parents are all out of the job…aunts, uncles, her mother and father all out of the job, living in that two bedroom no bathroom house we visit and cry in front of every time we visit there…

I know even if she ever participated she wouldn’t be any less of a person in my eyes. Even today she represents herself as that strong Filipino woman supporting my family, my out of work grandfather, my brother, my sister, two twin cousins and even me. I jumped at the opportunity to talk about this resolution, to stand up with those of us who remain invisible in the eyes of most conceptions of the resolution; the innocent women of Okinawa, the children whose fathers have been displaced in Iraq or Afghanistan, my unknown uncle Carlos, even my grandmother who works hard every day with the remembrance of her experience of military presence where she was from. Thus our interpretation for this debate is that we should be able to discuss the systematic violence that is present in times of war and include the voices of those who are often forgotten. Doing so provides us with the opportunity to stand in solidarity with the oppressed through our revolutionary way of speaking while we debate this year's resolution which states:
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and/or police presence in one or more of the following: South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey.

So many wars, settling scores
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
I heard them say 'love is the way' '
Love is the answer,' that's what they say
But look how they treat us, make us believers 
We fight their battles, then they deceive us
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us 
'Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers

My grandma always told not to forget people, and to always remember that we can make a huge difference even if only in our own lives
Now that we know we should discuss our own relationships to the resolution in the community in which we live in and the community in which we debate in, we should aim the discussion to the plight of systematic violence that oppresses us while stepping away from ideologies that ignore the many forms of violence within the policies we construct.
//Mumia Abu-Jamal 1998 [“A QUIET AND DEADLY VIOLENCE,” 9/19/98, [[http://www.mumia.nl/TCCDMAJ/quietdv.htm]]]//
__It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation … or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world."__

She still tells me to this day and it echoes in my mind constantly that if something seams wrong I should take a step away from it and take a step toward resolving it

Thus, the role ballot for this debate represents a step away from the ideologies that continue to justify masking over and ignoring wide ranging structural violence and oppression within our discussions of the resolution, the ballot acts as an endorsement for discursive action by including And hearing those who often become invisible to us in our discussions

Paulo Freire in 1970 gives us insight to how our discussions that emphasizes turning our discourse and activism into true action is an important part of our revolutionary goals – one that is work, that is praxis necessary to transform the ways in which we approach our views based upon this resolution

The affirmative begins with a smokestack; an ominous depiction of the negativity of the modern world. The stack raises high into the sky spewing from its mouth the ashes from a world they imagine will burn. Dark clouds fill the sky…dark black rain falls…puddles of sludge blacken the ground surrounding the stack. This is the sewer of a dead god; the refuse from the modern world’s fascination with its own annihilation. The affirmative confronts its own depiction of itself…looks upon its own reflection in the pools of standing water and ignores the omnipresent anguish the smokestack provokes…in its place of the realization that humanity can never clean this stain the affirmative finds work. The factory cranks into motion…another product…another policy…another plan…another attempt to manage the world despite the fact that the smokestack itself is the product of management…endless reproduction…sameness…the death of difference. The affirmative dawns the technical frockcoat and goes about its ugly business. But the smokestack is not of a wholly mechanical order...the eyes of the technician fail to see what a child cannot miss…horror…awe…anguish…death and decay…no salvation…no god…humanity must live in the shadow of the smokestack. This is Bataille.

The blind technician obeys the vision of the smokestack…it stirs up nothing in its soul anymore. The smoke has become a fixture in the sky…the technician lowers its eyes to the tortured ground and trudges off to its place in the assembly line. The technician has entered the trap of life. It is made insignificant in relation to others…everywhere it sees those who look identical to itself but the limits that make them all march in step also remind them of their own loneliness…the technician curses death and accepts its limits…but the trap is double…while the child presses its face up against the streaked glass of revelation death approaches…fortunately art creates the escape from the trap…it affords us with the proximity to death without the physical act of dying creating a rupture in our notions of ourselves as objects strictly trapped within our limits of the world.

we begin with bataille’s solar anus as the sight of transgression of the sun as a figure of illumination and knowledge and the knowing gaze. bataille presents us instead with a sun that blinds the gaze, loves its inverse, and discovers its own impotence. it is precisely at the moment that the sun, knowledge, attempts to assert its dominance over the dark mysteries of night that it must have its throat slashed, must be rendered the black solar anus.

<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: 7.5pt;">·</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> When it comes to the role of audition in the sensorial triangle of clinical experience, Foucault's argumentation takes quite an interesting turn: </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: 7.5pt;">·</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> "But </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">one must not loose sight of the essential. The tactile and auditory dimensions did not purely and simply come to be added to the domain of vision. The sensorial triangulation indispensable to anatomo-clinical perception remains under the dominant sign of the visible</span>//<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> (sous le signe dominant du visible)</span>//<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;">: firstly, </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">because this multi-sensorial perception is nothing but a manner of anticipating that triumph of the gaze</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> (//ce triomphe du regard//), which will be //the autopsy//; //the ear and hand are nothing but temporary substitute organs (des organes provisoires de remplacement) anticipating for the death to render to the truth the luminous presence of the visible (la présence lumineuse du visible)//. . . And above all, the alterations discovered by anatomy concern 'the shape, the size, the position and the direction' of organs or their tissues. . . that is, //spatial data (des données spatiales) that belong by right of origin (par droit d'origine) to the gaze//." </span>[[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn13|13]]
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: 7.5pt;">·</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> As it comes out in this passage, Foucault argues that one should not let the appearance of the sensorial triangulation lead to any illusions about the //equality// between the three senses at play. Even if touch and audition //did// have a role in the formation of clinical perception, it was actually limited to their function as nothing but vision's temporary substitutes or "representatives", ones that were in the end reducible to visual experience</span><span class="ReadingTextChar">. In other words, Foucault's strong thesis is that in the formation of clinical perception – in the first opening of the individual body to medical knowledge and intervention – touch and audition did not have any irreducible, indispensable or autonomous significance, the sort of significance reserved for the gaze and visual experience. In stead, the only place left for audition was a position of dependency and submission – a subservient position – under the dominant sign of the visible.</span>
<span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> The passage quoted shows also that</span></span> in Foucault's understanding, the //truth// constituted in the clinical-medical discourse was still determined <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">(in rather classical sense, we could add) </span></span>utterly by the interrelated terms of //visibility, luminosity// and //presence,// <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">accomplished (in practice) only in the opening of the dead corps in autopsy.</span></span> This means that **auditory perception** (hearing and the ear) as such **did //not// strictly speaking participate directly to the medical truth and knowledge**, the truth of health/pathology, normality/abnormality of an individual body. The clinical-medical truth was constituted by the visible presence of the body to the gaze, //not// to auditory experience. The only possible "legitimate" contribution of audition to the formation of truth in the clinical discourse was that of a **subservient instrument or a temporary, dispensable substitute for vision**, one that itself was lacking the capacity of "luminous presence" of truth. The fate of audition in the clinical form of knowledge was to become in the end **extinguished in the true goal and fulfillment of medical examination: i.e., in the //final triumph of the gaze//**, in the grasping of the visible truth, where auditory experience no longer has anything to contribute. Thus, the **"sensory hierarchy**" organizing the triangle becomes quite clearly stated: **audition remains firmly submitted under the pre-eminence of vision. In the hierarchic setting, the fate of audition is to become subjugated under, reduced to and in the end extinguished in and by the dominant sign of the visible**.
<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">2. The //"Right-of-Origin"-// Argument and the Empire of the Gaze</span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: 7.5pt;">·</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> There is still one turn in Foucault's argumentation on the role of audition in clinical experience – one that becomes articulate in the quotation already discussed – in need of particular emphasis here. </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">As the quotation already shows, Foucault presents an argument concerning what belongs by right of origin</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> (//par droit d'origine//) </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">to vision and not to hearing. The capacity to collect spatial facts or spatial data</span>//<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> (des données spatiales)</span>//<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;">, </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">the capacity to discover spatial objects are capacities that belong "by right of origin" to vision, not audition. As it comes to the anatomo-clinical perception and experience, this means that the capacity to locate "the being of the disease with its causes and effects in a three-dimensional space", [[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn14|14]] as also the capacity to grasp "the shape, the size, the position and the direction of organs or their tissues", [[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn15|15]] in other words the central functions determining clinical experience, belong by right of origin to sight, not to hearing. It is in this irreparable lack, in the incapacity to form spatial-objective experience, that we find the actual reason why audition did not and cannot make any "equal" or symmetrical, irreducible, autonomous and dispensable contribution (but only as a temporary, subservient, indispensable substitute operating under the dominance of vision and gaze) to clinical-medical knowledge or, as it seems logical, to any form of knowledge determined by the spatial-objective form</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;">. We should notice, that although auditory perception is defined by the non-spatiality, Foucault doesn't argue that auditory perception would be defined by //temporality.// Only the //lack, the incapacity// of spatiality becomes the defining characteristic of audition distinguishing it from vision. </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: 7.5pt;">·</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> The reader should notice that Foucault does //not// in fact develop this //right-of-origin – argument// by any reference to the corpus of historical documents he otherwise uses in the study (the works of Laënnec and others). The argument is //not// actually presented as an interpretation of historical sources at all. It is Michel Foucault himself, who argues here on the right-of-origin difference between vision and audition. It is Foucault himself who states the difference, the juxtaposition of "audio" and "visual", in terms of the unique capacity of vision and the essential //incapacity// of audition, when it comes to spatial-objective experience. Foucault's argument might come as a surprise, for it is hardly //archaeological// (in the sense Foucault gives to this term) in character: It is not about the //historical conditions of possibility//, the difference in capacity/incapacity between vision and audition in the context of a specific historical discursive formation. To argue what vision can and what audition cannot do by right of origin – that is, irrespective of any historical-discursive context – seems to come close to arguing on the //conditions of possibility as such//, on the //trans-historical// limits of experience and on the difference between faculties in the strong (transcendental) Kantian sense.</span>[[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn16|16]]
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: 7.5pt;">·</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> It is by relying on the idea of audition as the essentially non-spatial and non-objective sense, as opposed to the spatial-objective capacities of vision, not on the basis of historical analysis that Foucault can //deny the possibility// of audition's equal/indispensable/autonomous contribution and significance to the birth of the clinic and argue for the necessity of audition's reduction to and subjugation under the domination of the gaze. If this is the case, how can one avoid reaching the conclusion that in presenting the right-of-origin- argument, Foucault commits himself to what he first of all consistently set out to dismantle in his archaeologies (and subsequently in his genealogies): the conception of the //subject// as the possessor of different faculties, with a given, trans-historical coherence and a permanent structure? </span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: 7.5pt;">·</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> As we know, the formation of clinical experience – making the individual subject/body into the object of medical knowledge and intervention – is a thoroughly political event for Foucault (this is the case already in //The Birth of the Clinic//). </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">The birth of the clinical experience –bringing to knowledge and truth the normality/pathology of the individual/singular body – was intrinsically interrelated to the development of the modern form of power and politics. It is through the development of clinical experience that the exercise of this modern form of power, surveying and taking charge of the health/normality of each singular living body and of the social body as a whole, took a decisive step forwards.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> As we know, in his later works as well, </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">Foucault recurrently comes back to the formation of clinical-medical perception, observation and surveillance, still giving these a central political significance in the modern disciplinary, normative and bio-political dispositive or governmentality. In its operation, the medical power means the traversal and penetration of the whole social space by the clinical perception and experience. Thus, the issue of "audio-visual" difference, their right-of-origin juxtaposition, turns out to be a deeply political issue as well.[[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn17|17]]</span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: 7.5pt;">·</span> <span class="ReadingTextChar">Inasmuch as Foucault argues (this we have already seen) audition to be, by right of origin, without any independent, irreducible significance in the formation of clinical experience (remaining firmly submitted under the dominant sign of the visible), it follows that audition cannot have any significance in the medicalized form of power- and politics either. In the last instance, the meaning of medicalization is brought back to the circulation of the medical gaze (le regard médical). It is the gaze, not audition, which exercises "in the entire space, all the time, a mobile and differentiated surveillance." [[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn18|18]] Foucault concludes his analysis of medicalized power/politics in rather categorical terms, well in line with the right-of-origin- argument: "the gaze that sees is a gaze that dominates</span> <span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;">(//le regard qui voit est un regard qui domine//)", </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">making the modern society as such the "empire of the gaze without partitions</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 7.5pt;"> (//l'empire sans cloison du regard//)." </span>[[http://muse.jhu.edu.leo.lib.unomaha.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v011/11.1siisiainen.html#_edn19|19]]

Within the last few decades, matters of state sovereignty in the new world order have been retheorized so as to provide a range of theoretical insights about the relationship between power and politics, the political nature of social and cultural life, and the merging of life and politics as a new form of biopolitics. While the notion of biopolitics differs significantly among its most prominent theorists, including Michel Foucault (1990, 1997), Giorgio Agamben (1998, 2002, 2003), and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (2004), what these theorists share is an attempt to think through the convergence of life and politics, locating matters of “life and death within our ways of thinking about and imagining politics” (Dean 2004, 17).Within this discourse, <span class="ReadingTextChar">politics is no longer understood exclusively through a disciplinary technology centered on the individual body—a body to be measured, surveilled, managed, and included in forecasts, surveys, and statistical projections. Biopolitics points to new relations of power that are more capacious, concerned not only with the body as an object of disciplinary techniques that render it “both useful and docile” but also with a body that needs to be “regularized,” subject to those immaterial means of production that produce ways of life that enlarge the targets of control and regulation</span> (Foucault 1997, 249). This shift in the workings of both sovereignty and power and the emergence of biopolitics are made clear by Foucault, for whom biopower replaces the power to dispense fear and death <span class="ReadingTextChar">“with that of a power to foster life—or disallow it to the point of death. . . . [Biopower] is no longer a matter of bringing death into play in the field of sovereignty, but of distributing the living in the domain of value and utility. Its task is to take charge of life that needs a continuous regulatory and corrective mechanism” </span>(Ojakangas 2005, 6). As Foucault insists, the logic of biopower is dialectical, productive, and positive 178 College Literature 33.3 [Summer 2006] (1990, 136).Yet he also argues that biopolitics does not remove itself from “introducing a break into the domain of life that is under power’s control: the break between what must live and what must die” (1997, 255). Foucault believes that <span class="ReadingTextChar">the death-function in the economy of biopolitics is justified primarily through a form of racism in which biopower “is bound up with the workings of a State that is obliged to use race, the elimination of races and the purification of the race, to exercise its sovereign power”</span> (258).


//“When I was a little kid my mother told me not to stare into the sun. So once when I was six, I did. The doctors didn't know if my eyes would ever heal. I was terrified, alone in that darkness.”*// FOR THE ALTERNATIVE WE TURN ONCE AGAIN TO GEORGES BATAILLE. bataille’s notion of the blind, uprooted eye IN THE STORY OF THE EYE implodes the cartesian underpinings of the modern understanding of vision that attempts to perfectly see and thus perfectly know the world. Bataille does this through TRANSGRESSION, WHICH is pushing a concept to its limit until it explodes. in terms of visuality then bataille presents an eye that is torn out and blinded. THE STORY OF THE EYE FURTHERMORE SIGNALS MOMENT WHEN LANGUAGE EXPLODES AND RADICALLY CHALLENGES ITSELF BY DISCOVERING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DEATH AND LANGUAGE IN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LIMIT AND BEING. THE REPULSIVE NATURE OF BATAILLE’S STORY IS ESSENTIAL TO IT’S TRANSGRESSION.

Essentially the product of fissures, abrupt descents and broken contours, this misshapen and craglike language describes a circle; it refers to itself and is folded back on a questioning of its limits – as if it were nothing more than a small night lamp that flashes with a strange light, signaling the void from which it arises and to which it addresses everything it illuminates and touches. Perhaps, it is this curious configuration which explains why Bataille attributed such obstinate prestige to the Eye. Throughout his career (from his first novel to //Larmes d’Eros//), the eye was to keep its value as a figure of inner experience: ‘When at the height of anguish, I gently solicit a strange absurdity, an eye opens at the summit, in the middle of my skull’. This is because the eye, a small white globe encloses its darkness, traces a limiting circle that only sight can cross. And the darkness within, the sombre core of the eye, pours out into the world like a fountain which sees, that is, which lights up the world; but it is transformed into the bright night of an image. The eye is mirror and lamp: it discharges its light into the word around it, while in a movement that is not necessarily contradictory, it precipitates this same light into the transparency of its well. Its globe has the expansive quality of a marvelous seed – like an egg imploding towards the centre of night and extreme light, which it is and which it has just ceased to be. <span class="ReadingTextChar">It is the figure of being in the act of transgressing its own limit</span>.
The eye, in a philosophy of reflection, derives form its capacity to observe the power of becoming always more interior to itself. Lying behind each eye that sees, there exists a more tenuous one, an eye so discreet and yet so agile that its all-powerful glance can be said to eat away at the flesh of its white globe; behind this particular eye, there exists another, and, then, still others, each progressively more subtle until we arrive at the eye whose entire substance is nothing but the transparency of vision. This inner movement is finally resolved in a non-material centre where the intangible forms of truth are created and combined, in this heart of things which is the sovereign subject. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Bataille reverses this entire direction: sight, crossing the globular limit of the eye, constitutes the eye in its instantaneous being; sight carries it away in this luminous stream</span> (an outpouring fountain, streaming tears and, shortly, blood), <span class="ReadingTextChar">hurls the eye outside itself, conducts it to the limit where it bursts out immediately extinguished flash of its being. Only a small white ball, veined with blood, is left behind, only an exorbitated eye to which all sight is now denied. And in the place from which sight had once passed, only a cranial cavity remains, only this black globe which the uprooted eye has made to close upon its sphere, depriving it of vision, but offering to this absence the spectacle of that indestructible core which now imprisons the dead glance. In the distance created by this violence and uprooting, the eye is seen absolutely, but denied any possibility of sight: the philosophizing subject has been dispossessed and pursued to its limit; and the sovereignty of philosophical language can now be heard from the distance, in the measureless void left behind by the exorbitated subject</span>__.__
<span class="ReadingTextChar">But perhaps the eye accomplishes the most essential aspect of its play when, forced from its ordinary position, it is made to turn upwards in a movement that leads it back to the nocturnal and starred interior of the skull and it is made to show us its usually concealed surface, white and unseeing: it shuts out the day in a movement that manifests its own whiteness (whiteness being undoubtedly the image of clarity, its surface reflection, but for this very reason, it cannot communicate with it, nor communicate it); and the circular night of the iris is made to address the central absence which it illuminates with a flash, revealing it as night. The upturned orb suggests both the most open and the most impenetrable eye: causing its sphere to pivot, while remaining exactly the same and in the same place, it overturns day and night, crosses their limit, but only to find it again on the same line and from the other side; and the white hemisphere that appears momentarily at the place where the pupil once opened is like the being of the eye as it crosses the limit of its vision – when it transgresses this opening to the light of day which defined the transgression of every sight. ‘If man did not imperiously close his eyes, he would finally be unable to see the things worth seeing’</span>.
But what we need to see does not involve any interior secret or the discovery of a more nocturnal world. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Torn from its ordinary position and made to turn inwards in its orbit, the eye now pours its light only into a bony cavern</span>. <span class="ReadingTextChar">This turning up</span> of its globe may seem a betrayal of ‘la petite mort’, but, more exactly, it simply <span class="ReadingTextChar">indicates the death that it experiences in its natural location, in this springing up in place which causes the eye to rotate. Death, for the eye, is not the always elevated line of the horizon, but the limit it ceaselessly transgresses in its natural location, in the hollow where every vision originates, and where this limit is elevated into an absolute limit by an ecstatic movements which allows the eye to spring up from the other side. The upturned eye discovers the bond that links language and death at the moment that it acts out this relationship of the limit and being; and it is perhaps from scenes that interrupt Bataille’s stories invariably concern the spectacle of erotic deaths, where upturned eyes display their limits and rotate inwards in gigantic and empty orbits</span>. //Bleu du ciel// gies a singularly precise outline of this movement: early in November, when the earth of German cemetery is alive with the twinkling lights of candles and candle stubs, the narrator is lying with Dorothy among the tombstones; making love among the dead, the earth around him appears like the sky on a bright night. And the sky above forms a great hollow orbit, a death mask, in which he recognizes his inevitable end at the moment that pleasure overturns the four globes of flesh, causing the revolution of his sight.
The earth under Dorothy’s body was open like a tomb, her belly opened itself to me like a fresh grave. We were struck with stupor, making love on a starred cemetery. Each light marked a skeleton in a grave and formed a wavering sky as perturbed as our mingled bodies. I unfastened Dorothy’s dress, I dirtied her clothes and her breast with the fresh earth which was stuck to my fingers. Our bodies trembled like two rows of clattering teeth.
But what might this mean at the heart of thought? What significance has this insistent eye which appears to encompass what Bataille successively designated the //inner experience, the extreme possibility, the comic process,// or simply //meditation//? It is certainly no more metaphoric than Descartes’s phrasing of the ‘clear perception of sight’ or this sharp point of mind which he called //aceis mentis//. In the point of fact, the upturned eye has no meaning in Bataille’s language, can have meaning since it marks its limit. <span class="ReadingTextChar">It indicates the moment when language, arriving at its confines, overlaps itself, explodes and radically challenges itself in laughter, tears, the overturned eye of ecstasy, the mute and exorbitated horror of sacrifice, and where it remains fixed in this way at the limits of its void, speaking of itself in a second language in which the absence of a sovereign subject outlines its essential emptiness and incessantly fractures the unity of its discourse. The enucleated or upturned eye marks the zone of Bataille’s philosophical language, the void into which it pours and loses itself, but in which it never stops talking </span>– somewhat like the interior, diaphanous and illuminated eye of mystics and spiritualists that marks the point at which the secret language of prayer is embedded and choked by a marvelous communication which silences it. Similarly, but in an inverted manner, the eye in Bataille delineates the zone shared by language and death, the place where language discovers its being in the crossing of its limits: the non-dialectical form of philosophical language.
This eye, as the fundamental figure of the place from which Bataille speaks and in which his broken language finds it uninterrupted domain, <span class="ReadingTextChar">establishes the connection, prior to any form of discourse, that exists between the death of God (a sun that rotates and the great eyelid that closes upon the world), the experience of finitude (springing up in death, twisting the light which is extinguished as it discovers that the interior is an empty skull, a central absence), and the turning back of language upon itself at the moment that it fails</span> –a conjunction which undoubtedly has no other equivalent than the association, well known in other philosophies, of sight to truth or of contemplation to the absolute. Revealed to this eye, which in its pivoting conceals itself for all time, is the being of the limit: ‘I will never forget the violent and marvelous experience that comes from the will to open one’s eyes, facing what exists, what happens’.
Perhaps in the movement which carries it to a total night, the experience of transgression brings to light this relationship of finitude to being, this moment of the limit which anthropological thought, since Kant, could only designate from the distance and from the exterior through language of dialectics.

<span class="ReadingTextChar">It really was totally out of the question for Simone to lift her dress and place her bare behind in the dish of raw balls</span>. All she could do was hold the dish in her lap<span class="ReadingTextChar">. I told her I would like to fuck her again before Granero returned to fight the fourth bull, but she refused, and she sat there,</span> keenly involved, despite everything, <span class="ReadingTextChar">in the disembowelments of horses,</span> followed, as she childishly put it, by "death and destruction,” namely the cataract of bowels. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Little by little, the sun's radiance sucked us into an unreality that fitted our malaise-the wordless and powerless desire to explode and get up of our behinds. We grimaced, because our eyes were blinded </span>and because we were thirsty, our senses ruffled, and there was no possibility of quenching our desires. We three had managed to share in the morose dissolution that leaves no harmony between the various spasms of the body. We were so far gone that even Granero's return could not pull us out of that stupefying absorption. Besides, the bull opposite him was distrustful and seemed unresponsive; the combat went on just as drearily as before. <span class="ReadingTextChar">The events that followed were without transition or connection, not because they weren't actually related, but because my attention was so absent as to remain absolutely dissociated. In just a few seconds: first, Simone bit into one of the raw balls, to my dismay; then Granero advanced towards the bull, waving his scarlet cloth; finally, almost at once, Simone, with a blood-red face and a suffocating lewdness, uncovered her long white thighs up to her moist vulva, into which she slowly and surely fitted the second pale globule-Granero was thrown back by the bull and wedged against the balustrade; the horns struck the balustrade three times at full speed; at the third blow, one horn plunged into the right eye and through the head. A shriek of unmeasured horror coincided with a brief orgasm for Simone, who was lifted up from the stones eat only to be flung back with a bleeding nose, under a blinding sun; men instantly rushed over to haul away Granero's body, the right eye dangling from the head. Thus, two globes of equal size and consistency had suddenly been propelled in opposite directions at once. One, the white ball of the bull, had been thrust into the "pink and dark" cunt that Simone had bared in the crowd; the other, a human eye, had spurted from Granero's head with the same force as a bundle of innards from a belly.</span> This coincidence, tied to death and to a sort of urinary liquefaction of the sky, first brought us back to Marcella in a moment that was so brief and almost insubstantial, yet so uneasily vivid that I stepped forward like a sleepwalker as though about to touch her at eye level.
__The story continues a bit later...__

<span class="ReadingTextChar">"Sir Edmund," she said, rubbing her cheek gently on his shoulder, "I want you to do something.""I shall do anything you like," he replied</span>. <span class="ReadingTextChar">She made me come over to the corpse: she knelt down and completely opened the eye</span> that the fly had perched on. "Do you see the eye?" she asked me. "Well?""It's an egg," she concluded in all simplicity. "All right," I urged her, extremely disturbed, “what are you getting at?" <span class="ReadingTextChar">"I want to play with this eye."</span> "What do you mean?" "Listen, Sir Edmund," she finally let it out, "you must give me this at once, <span class="ReadingTextChar">tear it out at once</span>, I want it!" Sir Edmund was always poker-faced except when he turned purple. Nor did he bat an eyelash now; but the blood did shoot to his face. <span class="ReadingTextChar">He removed a pair of fine scissors from his wallet, knelt down, then nimbly inserted the fingers of his left hand into the socket and drew out the eye, while his right hand snipped the obstinate ligaments. Next, he presented the small whitish eyeball in a hand reddened with blood</span>. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Simone gazed at the absurdity and finally took it in her hand, completely distraught; yet she had no qualms, and instantly amused herself by fondling the depth of her thighs and inserting this apparently fluid object.</span> The caress of the eye over the skin is so utterly, so extraordinarily gentle, and the sensation is so bizarre that it has something of a rooster's horrible crowing. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Simone meanwhile amused herself by slipping the eye into the profound crevice of her ass, and after lying down on her back and raising her legs and bottom, she tried to keep the eye there simply by squeezing her buttocks together. But all at once, it spat out like a stone squeezed from a cherry</span>, and dropped on the thin belly of the corpse, an inch or so from the cock. In the meantime, I had let Sir Edmund undress me, so that I could pounce stark naked on the crouching body of the girl; my entire cock vanished at one lunge into the hairy crevice, and I fucked her hard while Sir Edmund played with the eye, rolling it, in between the contortions of our bodies, on the skin of our bellies and breasts. For an instant, the eye was trapped between our navels." <span class="ReadingTextChar">Put it up my ass, Sir Edmund," Simone shouted. And Sir Edmund delicately glided the eye between her buttocks. But finally, Simone left me, grabbed the beautiful eyeball from the hands of the tall Englishman, and with a staid and regular pressure from her hands, she slid it into hers lobbery flesh, in the midst of the fur.</span> And then she promptly drew me over, clutching my neck between her arms and smashing her lips on mine so forcefully that <span class="ReadingTextChar">I came without touching her</span> and my come shot all over her fur. Now I stood up and, while Simone lay on her side, <span class="ReadingTextChar">I drew her thighs apart, and found myself facing something I imagine I had been waiting for in the same way that a guillotine waits for a neck to slice. I even felt as if my eyes were bulging from my head, erectile with horror; in Simone's hairy vagina, I saw the wan blue eye of Marcelle, gazing at me through tears of urine. Streaks of come in the steaming hair helped give that dreamy vision a disastrous sadness. I held the thighs open while Simone was convulsed by the urinary spasm, and the burning urine streamed out from under the eye down to the thighs below…</span>

<span style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">Let me, then, take a closer look at <span class="underline">Laclau’s narrative</span> which <span class="underline">runs from Marxist essentialism</span> the proletariat as the universal (lass whose revolu­tionary mission is inscribed into its very social being and thus discernible via ‘objective’ scientific analysis) <span class="underline">to the ‘postmodern’ recognition of the contingent</span>, tropological, metaphorico-metonymic, <span class="underline">link between a social agent and its ‘task’. Once this contingency is acknowledged, one has to accept that there is no</span> direct, ‘natural’ correlation between an agent’s social position and its tasks in the political struggle, no <span class="underline">norm of devel­opment by which to measure exceptions</span> say because of the weak political subjectivity of the bourgeoisie in Russia around 1900, the work­ing class had to accomplish the bourgeois-democratic revolution itself. My first observation here is that <span class="underline">while this</span> standard post— modern Leftist <span class="underline">narrative of the passage from ‘essentialist’ Marxism with the proletariat as the unique Historical Subject</span>, the privileging of economic class struggle, and so on, <span class="underline">to the postmodern</span> irreducible <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">plu­rality of struggles</span></span> undoubtedly <span class="underline">describes an actual historical process, its <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">proponents</span></span>, as a rule, <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">lease out the resignation at its heart the accept­ance of capitalism as ‘the only game in town’</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">,</span> <span class="underline">the renunciation of any real attempt to overcome the existing capitalist liberal regime</span>. This point was already made very precisely in Wendy Brown’s perspicuous observation that ‘<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the political purchase of</span></span> contemporary American <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">identity politics would</span></span> seem to <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">be achieved</span> </span>in part <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">through</span></span> a certain <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">renaturalization of capitalism’</span></span>. The crucial question to be asked is thus: to what extent a <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">critique of capitalism is foreclosed by the current con­figuration of oppositional politics</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">,</span> and not simply by the ‘loss of the socialist alternative’ or the ostensible ~triumph of liberalism’ in the global order. In contrast with the Marxist critique of a social whole and Marxist vision of total transformation, to what extent do <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">identity politics require a standard internal to existing society against which to pitch their claims</span></span>, a standard <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">that not only preserves capitalism from critique, but sustains the invisibility and inarticulateness of class</span></span> <span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%;">— not incidentally, but endem­ically? Could we have stumbled upon one reason why class is invariably named but rarely theorized or developed in the multiculturalist mantra, ‘race, class, gender, sexuality’?1 One can describe in very precise terms this reduction of class to an entity ‘named but rarely theorized’: one of the great and permanent results of the so-called ‘Western Marxism’ first formulated by the young Lukics is that the class-and-commodity structure of capitalism is not just a phenomenon limited to the particular ‘domain’ of economy, but the structuring principle that overdetermines the social totality, from politics to art and religion. This global dimension of capitalism is sus­pended in</span> <span class="underline">today’s</span> multiculturalist progressive politics: its ‘<span class="underline">anti-capitalism’ is reduced to the level of how today’s capitalism breeds sexist/racist oppression</span>, and so on. Marx claimed that <span class="underline">in the series production—distribution —exchange—consumption, the term ‘production’ is doubly inscribed: it is</span> simultaneously <span class="underline">one of the terms in the series and the structuring principle of the entire series</span>. In production as one of the terms of the series, production (as the structuring principle) ‘encounters itself in its oppositional determination’,’2 as Marx put it, using the pre­cise Hegelian term. And <span class="underline">the same goes for the postmodern political series class—gender—race…: in class as one of the terms in the series of particular struggles, class qua structuring principle of the social totality encounters itself in its oppositional determination’</span>.3 In so far as <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">post­modern politics</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> <span class="underline">promotes</span>,</span> in effect, a kind of ‘<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">politicization of the economy’</span></span>, is not this politicization similar to the way our supermarkets <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">which fundamentally exclude from their field of visibility the actual production process</span></span> <span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%;">(the way vegetables and fruit are harvested and packed by immigrant workers, the genetic and other manipulations in their production and display, etc.) — stage within the field of the dis­played goods, as a kind of ersatz, the spectacle of a pseudo-production (meals prepared in full view in ‘food courts’, fruit juices freshly squeezed before the customers’ eyes, etc.)?’5 An authentic Leftist should therefore ask the postmodern politicians the new version of the old Freudian question put to the perplexed Jew: ‘Why are von saving that one should politicize the economy, when one should in fact politicize the economy?’ So: in so far as postmodern politics involves a ‘[t]heoretical retreat from the problem of domination within capitalism’, it is here. in this silent suspension of class analysis, that we are dealing with an exemplary case of the mechanism of ideological displacement:</span> <span class="underline">when class antagonism is disavowed, when its key structuring role is suspended. ‘other markers of social difference may come to hear an inordinate weight;</span> indeed, they may hear all the weight of the sufferings produced by capitalism in addition to that attributable to the explicitly politicized marking”7. In other words, <span class="underline">this displacement accounts for the</span> somewhat <span class="underline">’excessive’ way the discourse of postmodern <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">identity politics insists on the horrors of sexism, racism, and so on -- this ‘excess’ comes from the fact that these other ‘-isms’ have to hear the surplus-investment from the class struggle whose extent is not acknowledged</span></span>.’</span>

Along these same lines, Veit Harlan, the Nazi film director, spoke despair­ingly in the 1950s about the fact that Jews in the USA did not show any comprehension of his defence for making The Jew Siiss, claiming that no American Jew could really understand his situation in Nazi Germany — far from exonerating him, this obscene (factual) truth is the ultimate lie.

For D. W. Griffith, Intolerance was not a way to exculpate himself for the aggressive racist message of The Birth of a Nation: quite the contrary, he was smarting at what he considered “intolerance” on the part of groups which attempted to have The Birth of a Nation banned because of its anti-Black thrust. In short, when Griffith complains about “intolerance”, he is much closer to today’s fundamentalists decrying the “Politically Correct” defence of the universal rights of women as “intolerant” towards their specific way of life than to today’s multiculturalist assertion of differences.</span>

Reflexivity is primordial here: <span class="underline">there never was an originary ‘innocent’ moment when each stratum wore its ‘proper’ clothes </span>(the lower strata stonewashed jeans; the upper strata well-pressed black trousers); <span class="underline">from the very beginning, the class opposition was displaced, caught in the reflexivity of pre-emptive strikes and displacements</span>.</span>

Our alternative is an embracement of the fantasy of hegemony and imperialism. It is through over identification with the system of control that we are able to overcome it. The affirmative reverses this process through their questioning and thus denial of hegemony.

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span class="underline">The fact that the September 11 attacks were the stuff of pop­ular fantasies long before they actually took place provides</span> yet <span class="underline">another case of the twisted logic of dreams</span>: it is easy to account for the fact that poor people around the world dream about becoming Americans — so what do the well-to-do Americans, immobilized in their well-being, dream about? About a global catastrophe that would shatter their lives — why? This is what psychoanalysis is about: to explain why, <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">in the midst of well-­being, we are haunted by nightmarish visions of catastrophes. This</span></span> paradox also <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">indicates how we should grasp</span> Lacan’s notion of ‘<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">traversing the fantasy’</span> as the concluding moment of the psy­choanalytic treatment</span>. This notion may seem to fit perfectly the common-sense idea of what psychoanalysis should do: <span class="underline">of course it should liberate us from the hold of idiosyncratic fan­tasies, and enable us to confront reality as it really is!</span> However, this, precisely, is what Lacan does not have in mind — what he aims at is almost the exact opposite. <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">In our daily existence, we are immersed in ‘reality’</span> (structured and supported by the fan­tasy), and this immersion is disturbed by symptoms which bear witness to the fact that another, repressed, level of our psyche resists this immersion. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">To ‘traverse the fantasy’</span></span> therefore, par­adoxically, <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">means fully identifying oneself with the fantasy</span></span> — namely, with the fantasy <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">which structures the excess that resists our immersion in daily reality</span></span>; or, to quote a succinct formulation by Richard Boothby: <span class="underline">‘Traversing the phantasy’</span> thus <span class="underline">does not mean that the subject somehow abandons its involvement with fanciful caprices and accommodates itself to a pragmatic ‘reality,’ but pre­cisely the opposite: the subject is submitted to that effect of the symbolic lack that reveals the limit of everyday reality. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">To traverse the phantasy</span></span> in the Lacanian sense <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">is to be more profoundly claimed by the phantasy than ever, in the sense of being brought into an ever more intimate relation with that real core of the phantasy that transcends imaging</span></span>.10 Boothby is right to emphasize the Janus-like structure of a fantasy: <span class="underline">a fantasy is simultaneously pacifying, disarming (pro­viding an imaginary scenario which enables us to endure the abyss of the Other’s desire) and shattering, disturbing, inas­similable into our reality. The ideologico-political dimension of</span> this notion of ‘<span class="underline">traversing the fantasy’ was clearly revealed by the unique role the rock group</span> Top lista nadrealista (<span class="underline">The Top list of the Surrealists) played during the Bosnian war in</span> the besieged town of <span class="underline">Sarajevo: their ironic performances</span> — <span class="underline">which</span>, in the midst of war and hunger, <span class="underline">satirized the predicament of Sarajevo’s population — acquired a cult status</span> not only in the counterculture, but also among citizens of Sarajevo in general (the group’s weekly TV show went on throughout the war, and was extremely popular). Instead of bemoaning the Bosnians’ tragic fate, <span class="underline">they daringly mobilized all the clichés about the ‘stupid Bosnians’ which were commonplace in Yugoslavia, fully identifying with them</span> — <span class="underline">the point</span> thus made <span class="underline">was that the path of true solidarity leads through direct confrontation with the obscene racist fantasies which circulated in the symbolic space of Bosnia, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">through playful identification with them, not through the denial of these obscenities because they do not represent people as they ‘really are’</span></span>.</span>

Irony has been commodified in service of the dominant ideology, it's attempt to “see through” betrays a misunderstanding of signification

Bewes '97 <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;">[Timothy, Literature and Cultural History Post-doctoral Research Fellow @ Liverpool John Moores, Cynicism and Postmodernity, New York City: Verso, 1997, 41] </span></span>

There is a second, more obviously `dangerous' way in which __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">irony functions as a kind of ideological sophistry. `The greatest advantage that irony gives to those who possess it</span>__ [sic]' writes Toby Young, __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">is `the ability to resist passionate political movements'. The extent to which irony, or laughter, might be harnessed by forces of political reaction is obvious</span>__. Slovenian critic Slavoj Zizek provides perhaps the most lucid account of this in the opening chapter of his The Sublime Object of Ideology. With reference to Peter Sloterdijk's distinction between `cynicism' and `kynicism', __cynicism as irony__, says Zizek, __has replaced the classical Marxist notion of `false con- sciousness' as the dominant operational mode of ideology__. The ruling ideology is no longer even meant to be taken seriously, according to Zizek. __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Irony as an end in itself represents the rapid commodification of a strategy that once provided a legitimate means of challenging the dominant ideology</span>. Kynicism, by taking itself too seriously, becomes vulnerable to precisely its own critical processes - the moment when__, as Sloterdijk says, `__critique changes sides', and cynicism is perversely reconstituted as a "negation of the negation" of the official ideology__'.66 Toby Young's version of i__rony is__ a psychic reification, __<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">a critique that no longer has an object, that exists solely and absurdly as an assertion of superiority over all conditions of representation. Since in principle nothing escapes its invective, enlightened cynicism is in effect a disabled critique that mistakes its own absence for a kind of universalized rigour.</span>__

<span style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">**Identifying with the explicit promises of a power structure is the most effective means of subverting it.**</span>

<span style="line-height: 11.9pt; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Slavoj </span>**Zizek**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies in Ljubljana, </span>**2000**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, p. 220</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0.2in 0.0001pt;">My response to this is triple. First, on the level of exegesis, **__Foucault__** is much more ambivalent on this point: his thesis on the immanence of resistance to power **__can also be read as asserting that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">every resistance is caught in advance in the game of the power it opposes</span>__**. Second, **__my notion of ‘inher­ent transgression’__**, far from playing another variation on this theme (resistance reproduces that to which it resists), **__makes the power edifice even more vulnerable: in so far as power relies on its ‘inherent transgression then__** — sometimes, at least — **__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">overidentifying with the explicit power discourse</span>__**<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> —**__ignoring this inherent obscene underside and simply taking the power dis­course at its (public) word, acting as if it really means what it explicitly says (and promises__**) — **__can be the most effective way of disturbing its smooth functioning__**</span>. Third, and most important: far from constraining the subject to a resistance doomed to perpetual defeat, **__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Lacan allows for a much more radical subjective intervention than Butler</span>__**: what **__the__** **__Lacanian__** notion of ‘**__act’ aims at__** is **__not a mere displacement/resignification of the symbolic co­ordinates__** that confer on the subject his or her identity, **__but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the radical transformation of the very universal structuring ‘principle’ of the existing symbolic order</span>__**. Or - to put it in more psychoanalytic terms **__the Lacanian act, in__** its dimension of ‘**__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">traversing the</span>__** fundamental **__<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">fantasy’ aims</span>__** radically **__to disturb the very ‘passionate attachment’ that forms__**, for Butler, **__the ulti­mately ineluctable background of the process of resignification__**. So, far from being more ‘radical’ in the sense of thorough historicization, Butler is in fact very close to the Lacan of the early 1950s, who found his ultimate expression in the rapport de Rome on ‘The Function and the Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis’ (1953) — to the Lacan of the permanent process of retroactive historicization or resymbolization of social reality; to the Lacan who emphasized again and again how there is no directly acces­sible ‘raw’ reality how what we perceive as ‘reality’ is overdetermined by the symbolic texture within which it appears.</span>

<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.5pt;">It's </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">stuff of webby fantasy and urban legend: a reader who takes an Onion story seriously</span></span>. Last week, a speedy and vicious blogosphere watched its collective wet dream made real when <span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.5pt;">"</span><span class="ReadingTextChar">Pete," proprietor of antiabortion blog March Together for Life, posted "Murder Without Conscience," a furious excoriation of a 7-year-old fake column in the Onion titled "I'm Totally Psyched About This Abortion!"</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.5pt;"> [</span>Ed. Note: The original "Murder Without Conscience" entry has been altered since its publication and now includes some graphic images.] The Onion is a satirical newspaper founded in 1988 by University of Wisconsin students and is these days published weekly from New York. <span class="ReadingTextChar">The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">piece that inspired Pete's July 6 </span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"><span class="ReadingTextChar">extended smack-down was a 1999 Op-Ed by fictional columnist "Caroline Weber." Pete did not realize that the Onion traffics in satire, and that the piece was a send-up of the notion that pro-choice activists are actually "pro-abortion</span></span><span class="ReadingTextChar">." Weber's outrageous claims that she "seriously cannot wait for all the hemorrhaging and the uterine contractions" and that "<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">this abortion is going to be so amazing" did not tip off Pete. In an utterly unironic retort, he cited lines like, "It wasn't until now that I was lucky enough to be pregnant with a child I had no means to support," and "I just know it's going to be the best non-anesthetized invasive uterine surgery ever</span>!" to illustrate his disgust with the author. </span> On his blog, Pete expressed his rage at Weber's claim that if her HMO hadn't bowed to pressure not to cover her oral contraceptives, she never would have gotten pregnant to begin with. "Sorry ma'am," Pete responded. "If you hadn't had sex you wouldn't have gotten pregnant, it's not the HMO's fault for not supporting your promiscuity while not married." And <span class="ReadingTextChar">in case it wasn't already clear where he stood on the issue of satirical abortion, Pete added, "Miss Weber, you have killed your child, which you admit is a baby/human being, intentionally. That does make you an admitted murderer." </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.5pt;">Remarkably, </span><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">this isn't the first time that an Onion parody has been treated as straight news</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.5pt;">. </span><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">In 2002, China's </span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"><span class="ReadingTextChar">Beijing Evening News reported that members of the United States Congress were threatening to move operations from Washington D.C. to Memphis, Tenn., because the shabbiness of the Capitol building created "problems attracting top talent." A Chinese reporter had picked up the story wholesale from the Onion and filed it as his own</span></span><span class="ReadingTextChar">.</span> It was funny. But 2002 was eons ago. Before everyone had a blog, and before viral linkage meant that a private humiliation, like not getting a joke, could become an instant spectacle that spread like a nasty and very noticeable rash. Reached by phone at his Virginia home a week after his initial post about the Onion story, Pete said, "You write some article off the cuff and throw it out there and you never know what's going to happen. The next thing I know there are people calling me from all over the world and telling me what an idiot I am!" It was surely the most public of embarrassments, an example of how the intersection of varied voices and ideologies and sensibilities in the brutal wild West of the new, new blogosphere can go tragically wrong. Or right. Depending on your sense of humor. Pete's sense of humor, at least in conversation, was surprisingly -- and unnervingly -- unrelenting. He did ask that Salon not print his last name or his hometown given the threats his family has been receiving (his full name has been revealed on other sites), but the 45-year-old Internet communications consultant chortled steadily throughout an hour-long phone interview. "I've pretty much been laughing off the whole thing," he said. "When thousands and thousands of people are coming after you, if you took it seriously, you'd have a heart attack." Indeed, it wasn't long after his first post that some helpful online critics pointed out to Pete that he had been tilting at windmills. "There were 1,400 comments on the blog," said Pete. "A bunch of them [were from people] wishing that I had been aborted, and who used lots of curse words -- probably tens of thousands of curse words." The comments, which have now been removed from March Together for Life but as of Thursday could still be found on some archived sites, included an impressive array of epithets directed at Pete, including "Dumbshit," "Asshat" and "Honkknob," and, perhaps not unreasonably, an equally impressive host of insults to Pete's intelligence. Pete also said he received more than a dozen calls at home, mostly from heavy breathers. Four days after his initial Onion entry, Pete posted a follow-up, acknowledging that he now understood that the piece had been a joke. "Needless to say, a few people wanted to let me know that I was a dolt for thinking that her article was real," Pete wrote. "As a matter of fact, call me a dolt, because in the beginning I really did think it was real. Why? Because I meet women like her in the field all the time. Anyway, I wrote the blog in a way that was meant to point out how psychotic the pro-abortion movement is." Pete eventually wrote five entries about the Onion piece and its aftermath, each trying out a slightly different approach to defusing the issue. "I think I did a good job of turning the 'satire' right back at them, don't you?" he wrote on Monday. On Wednesday, he floated this: "My article was a joke, which obviously thousands of you didn't get, all the while accusing me of being the stupidest person on the planet." But even as he copped to initial misapprehension, and then attempted to convince readers that he'd been yukking it up all along, <span class="ReadingTextChar">Pete seemed not quite ready to let the Onion go without a fight. "We are talking about a woman who supports the murder of over 3,000 babies/human beings every single day," he wrote on Monday. And then, returning to "Weber's" link between contraception and pregnancy: <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">"Do you see how they slip their agenda into a 'satirical' piece? Oral contraceptives cause abortions too, just at an earlier stage than hospital abortions."</span> </span>

"I was just trying to crack up Frist and some of the other guys," Allen said. "Everyone's been on edge lately</span></span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, what with the Katrina situation, and</span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar">I thought we could use a good laugh.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.5pt;">" </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Added Allen: </span></span><span class="ReadingTextChar">"<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Looks like the joke's on me</span>. And, I suppose, the American citizens</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">." S. 1718, also known as</span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the Preservation Of Public Lands Of America Act, authorized a shift of $138 billion from the federal Medicare fund to a massive landscaping effort that, over the next five years, will transform Yellowstone National Park into a luxury private golf estate</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">"I thought it was pretty damn funny when I read over the draft of the thing,"</span></span> <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">said Allen, who</span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">said he struggled to keep a straight face when he introduced the law. "Especially the part about how it would create over 10,000 caddy and drink-girl jobs. But I guess it went over people's heads."</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The bill passed with a vote of 63-37. Allen said he thought the Senate bill clerk was "playing along" when he forwarded the bill to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works</span>.</span> <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">"At the close of the day Monday,</span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar">I went over </span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.5pt;">to thank </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Committee Chairman] Jim [Inhofe (R-OK)], </span></span><span class="ReadingTextChar">and told him how I hoped 'the bill' got 'a fair hearing,'" Allen said. "He got real earnest on me, saying how it's his job to give every bill a fair hearing. I said to myself, 'My God, he thinks it's for real.'" The 18-member committee sent the bill to the Senate floor the next day with an approval vote of 14-4. "I mean, Obama didn't vote for it,"</span> <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Allen said, referring to Illinois Democrat Sen. Barack Obama, who is often at ideological odds with his fellow Republican committee members.</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;"> "</span><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I was like, 'Okay, one guy gets the joke,' but then I talked to him later and I realized he had no idea. When I explained the whole thing, he brought out that chestnut about how 'it's **not funny if you have to explain it.'**"</span></span> <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Allen added: "He's usually good for a laugh. I don't know what's up." According to Allen, the Committee on Environment and Public Works not only took S. 1718 seriously, it inadvertently made it funnier. </span></span><span class="ReadingTextChar">"<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">I was still sort of frustrated that no one was catching on, but I couldn't help but chuckle a little when the newly amended bill returned to the Senat</span>e,"</span> <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Allen said.</span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar">"The thing where they were calling the water hazards 'ecological conservation areas' was pure comedy genius." The only senator to suspect that the act was a joke was Sen. Joe Biden</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.5pt;"> (D-DE</span><span class="ReadingTextChar">), who said he later overcame his suspicions, reasoning that "if it got this far, it must be valid<span style="font-size: 8pt;">." "Now, the bankruptcy reform bill that passed in April, I thought for sure that was meant to be ironic,</span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 8pt;">" </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Biden said. "</span></span><span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">I actually voted for it out of total sarcasm. My mistake, obviously</span>." After passing overwhelmingly with very little deliberation on Tuesday, the "obvious put-on" traveled to the House, where once again representatives approved it with a vote of 409-26. The experience left Allen puzzling for an explanation.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.5pt;"> "</span><span class="ReadingTextChar">Maybe my idea was too dry</span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">," Allen said. "Maybe</span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar">I should have introduced a bill that was even crazier, like mandating tracking collars for all American taxpayers. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Then again, seeing how things turned out, it's probably just as well I didn't." Once Allen found out that Bush would be signing the bill into law in a special Rose Garden ceremony, he decided to let the matter drop, saying that he was "in too deep to start explaining things now."</span> "I respect our commander-in-chief greatly,"</span> <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Allen said.</span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar">"But unless Gallagher himself stuck the bill in a watermelon and bashed it with his Sledge-O-Matic, there's no chance [Bush] would catch on."</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 10.5pt;"> Following the </span><span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Rose Garden ceremony,</span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the news that the newly minted law was conceived as a lark confused some senators. "Are we talking about the same bill here?" said Sen. Arlen Specter</span></span> <span class="SmallTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(R-PA),</span></span> <span class="ReadingTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">who voted for the act.

Counterplan Text: The United States Federal Government Should bomb the houses of Angelica Mercado and Ricki Ledesma.
It’s competitive – the affirmative makes a choice to bomb the people that have continually been excluded and marginalized from society already. We think their choice is a racist choice that makes the counterplan competitive. Continued orientalist oppression will compound the genocidal effects ending in extinction

Nonetheless, this otherwise natural process was dramatically altered by colonization. These<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> colonizing efforts were accomplished by force and often with great speed, producing dramatic changes within Indigenous societies and interfering with the natural process of adaptation and change. This disruption has had a genocidal effect</span></span>; groups of Indigenous peoples that existed 500 years ago no longer exist. <span class="underline">There should be no doubt that their extinction was not an accident – </span>it was the product of a concerted effort to subjugate and eliminate the native human population in order to allow for the pursuit of wealth and manifest destiny. As a result, <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">extinction is the most dramatic effect of colonization. Allowed to run its full course, colonization will disrupt and destroy the natural evolutionary process of the people being colonized to the point of extinction.</span></span>
The counterplan also solves case better because it’s funnier then their affirmative.

We begin with a mirror…but not just any mirror. This mirror does not reflect things as they appear at first glance, but reflects things as they are. Much like Freud’s reflection in the mirrored glass of a train car, the image is not one of beauty and virility but instead one of decline, decay, and ultimately violence. Like Freud the affirmative will be tricked by the eye…they will not see themselves in the mirror but rather be disgusted by the images that stare them in the face. Rational society is built upon this fundamental misapprehension: the denial of the dark underbelly of our existence. We turn away from polite society in an attempt to see humanity and our politics for what they are…we turn to Vincent Van Gogh in an attempt not to resist the darkness present just under the surface of reality, but rather to plunge into it. It is this destructive moment of chaos that certifies our mortality and turns to a life stripped from all utopianism and finds consolation in it…even in our madness, our violence, our joy, and ultimately our death.

The Annales medicao-psychologiques presents the following facts on the subject of “<span class="ReadingTextChar">Gaston F. . .,age 30, embroidery designer, admitted to the Saint-Anne Hospital on January 25, 1924</span>. . .” <span class="ReadingTextChar">On the morning of December 11</span>, he was walking on the Boulevard de Menilmontant, and having arrived at the Pere-Lachaise cemetery, <span class="ReadingTextChar">he stared at the sun, and, receiving from its rays the imperative to tear off his finger,without hesitation, without feeling and pain, he seized between his teeth his left index finger, successively broke through the skin, the flexor and extensor tendons, and the articular ligaments at the level of the phalangeal articulation; using his right hand, he then twisted the extremity of the dilacerated index finger, severing it completely.</span> He tried to flee from several policemen, who nevertheless succeeded in overpowering him, and took him to the hospital. . . <span class="ReadingTextChar">The young automutilator</span>, beyond working as an embroidery designer, <span class="ReadingTextChar">was a painter in his spare time.</span> There are few details concerning the tendencies revealed in his painting, but we know that he had read the art criticism of Mirbeau. His anxieties also led him to such subjects as Hindu mysticism and the philosophy of Fredrich Nietzsche. In the days that preceded the automutilation, he drank several glasses of rum or cognac. <span class="ReadingTextChar">He</span> still <span class="ReadingTextChar">suspects</span> that <span class="ReadingTextChar">he was influenced by</span> the biography of <span class="ReadingTextChar">Van Gogh</span>, in which he has read that <span class="ReadingTextChar">the painter, during a spell of madness</span>, had <span class="ReadingTextChar">cut off his ear and sent it to a girl in a house of prostitution</span>. <span class="ReadingTextChar">It was then that</span>, walking along the Boulevard de Menilmontant on December 11, <span class="ReadingTextChar">he “asked the sun for advice, got an idea into his head, stared at the sun to hypotnize himself, guessing that its answer was yes.”</span> He thereby seemed to receive approval. <span class="ReadingTextChar">“Lazy man, get out of your sorry state” it seemed to be telling him</span>, through thought transmission. <span class="ReadingTextChar">“It did not seem very hard,” he added, “after contemplating suicide, to bite off a finger. I told myself: I can always do that.”</span> The fact that Gaston F. was influenced by Van Gogh is worth noting only for the sake of completeness. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Once a decision is reached with the violence necessary for the tearing off of a finger, it entirely eludes the literary suggestions that may have preceded it; the order that the teeth had to carry out</span> so brusquely <span class="ReadingTextChar">must appear as a need that no one could resist</span>. Moreover, <span class="ReadingTextChar">the coincidence of the two painters’ gestures regains its strange freedom at the moment when the same external force</span>, independently chosen on both sides, <span class="ReadingTextChar">intervenes in the activity of teeth or razo</span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">r</span></span>: no biography of Van Gogh should induce the Pere-Lachaise mutilator’s absurd recourse to the blinding rays of the sun, in order to carry out a sacrifice no one could bear to see without screaming. . . <span class="ReadingTextChar">It is</span> relatively <span class="ReadingTextChar">easy to establish the extent to which Van Gogh’s life was dominated by the overwhelming relations he maintained with the sun</span>, yet this question has never before been raised. <span class="ReadingTextChar">The sun paintings by the Man with the Severed Ear are sufficiently well known and sufficiently unexpected to have disconcerted many; they only become intelligible when they are seen as the very expression</span> of the personality (or, as some would say, <span class="ReadingTextChar">of</span> the <span class="ReadingTextChar">sickness) of the painter</span>. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Most were done after Van Gogh’s mutilation</span> (on Christmas night, 1888). The obsession, however, appears in two sketches (La Faille, 1374, 1375) done during the Paris period (1886-88). The period of Arles is represented by the three Sowers (La Faille, 422, June 1888; 450 and 451, August 1888), but these three paintings still show only the sunset. <span class="ReadingTextChar">The sun appears “in all its glory: only</span> in 1889, <span class="ReadingTextChar">during the painter’s stay in the mental hospital</span> in Saint-Remy, in other words, after his mutilation (see La Faille, 617, June 1889; 628, September 1889 and 710, 713, 720, 729, 736, 737—all without an exact date). <span class="ReadingTextChar">The correspondence of this period indicates that the solar obsession had finally reached its high point. It is at this time that he uses the expression “the sun in all its glory” in a letter to his brother and that he probably practiced staring at this blinding sphere from his window</span> (which certain doctors in the past held to be a sign of incurable madness). <span class="ReadingTextChar">After the departure from Saint-Remy</span> (January 1890) an until his suicide (July1890) <span class="ReadingTextChar">the sun disappears almost entirely from the paintings</span>. But<span class="ReadingTextChar"> in order to show the importance and the</span> development of Van Gogh’s <span class="ReadingTextChar">obsession</span>, <span class="ReadingTextChar">it is necessary to link suns with sunflowers</span>, whose large disk haloed with short petals recalls the disk f the sun, at which it ceaselessly and fixedly stares throughout the day. This flower is also simply known (in French) by the name “the sun”; in the of painting it is linked to the name of Van Gogh, who wrote that he had a little of the sunflower (in the same way that Berne “has” the bear, or Rome “has” the she-wolf). As early as the Paris period, he had depicted a sunflower elevated on its stalk, isolated in a tiny garden; if most of the vases of sunflowers were painted at Arles in August 1888 was living with him, had just completed a portrait that shows Van Gogh painting sunflowers. It is probable that at this time Van Gogh was working on a variant of one of the paintings of August (he was working, as he often did, from memory, following Gauguin’s example). <span class="ReadingTextChar">The close association between the solar flower obsession and the most exasperated torment becomes all the more expressive when the heightened fancy of the painter sometimes leads to representation of the flower as withered and dead</span> (La Faille 452, 453 and fig. 1, p. 10). No one else, it seems, has ever painted wilted flowers, and Van Gogh himself painted all other flowers as fresh. <span class="ReadingTextChar">This double bond uniting the sun-star, the sun-flower, and Van Gogh can</span> moreover <span class="ReadingTextChar">be reduced to</span> normal <span class="ReadingTextChar">psychological theme in which the star is opposed to the withered flower, as are the ideal term and the real term of the ego</span>. This is what appears fairly regularly, it seems, in the different variants of the theme. Speaking in a letter to his brother about a painting he liked, he expressed the wish that it be placed between two vases of sunflowers, like a clock between two candelabra. <span class="ReadingTextChar">It is possible to see the painter himself as an overwhelming incarnation</span> of the candelabrum <span class="ReadingTextChar">of sunflowers, attaching to his hat a crown of lighted candles and going out under this halo at night in Arles</span> (January or February 1889), under the pretext, as he said, of painting a countryside at night. <span class="ReadingTextChar">The very fragility of this miraculous hat of flames</span> without a doubt <span class="ReadingTextChar">expresses the striving for dislocation that Van Gogh obeyed each time he came under the influence of a fiery focal point.</span> For example when he represented a candlestick placed on the seat of Gauguin’s empty chair. . . A letter from the painter to his brother, dated December 1888 (Brieven aan zijn Broeder, no. 563) mentions for the first time “Gauguin’s armchair, red and green night effect, walls and floor red and green again, on the seat two novels and a candle. . .” Van Gogh adds in a second letter, written on January 17, 1890 (Brieven aan zijn Broeder, no. 571): “I should like De Haan to seek a study of mine of a lighted candle and two novels (one yellow, the other pink) lying on an empty armchair (really Gauguin’s chair), a size 30 canvas, in red and green. I have just been working again today on its pendant, my own empty chair, a white chair with a pipe and a tobacco pouch. [This is the the painting reproduced in La Faille as no. 498.] In these tow studies, as in others, I have tried for an effect of light by means of color. . . “ These two paintings are especially significant in that they date from the period of the mutilation. One need only look at the reproductions of the paintings to see that they represent not just an armchair or a chair, but the virile personae of the two painters. Due to a lack of information, it is difficult to interpret these paintings with perfect certainty; one cannot, however, fail to be struck by a contrast to Gauguin’s advantage: an unlit pipe (an extinguished and suffocating hearth) is opposed to a lit candle, a tawdry pouch of tobacco (a dessicated and calcified substance) is opposed to two novels coverd with brightly colored paper. The difference is all the more charged with the troubling elements in that it corresponds to the period in which Van Gogh’s feelings of hatred for his friend were so extreme that they led to a definitive break, but the hatred directed against Gauguin is only one of the most bitter forms of an inner rending whose theme is generally found in all of Van Gogh’s mental activity. Gauguin played for his friend the role of an ideal assuming the most exalted aspirations of Van Gogh’s ego, even to the point of its most insane caonsequences: hateful and despairing humiliation, with its disconcerting counterpart, the close identification of the one who humiliates with the one who is humiliated. Even the ideal carries within itself something of the deformities of which it is the exasperated anthesis: the candle does not solidly adhere to the armchair, where its position is precarious and even shocking; <span class="ReadingTextChar">the sun in its glory is doubtless opposed to the faded sunflower, but no matter how dead it may be this sunflower is also a sun</span>, and <span class="ReadingTextChar">the sun is in some way deleterious and sick</span>: it is sulfer colored [il a la couleur d soufre], the painter himself writes twice in French. <span class="ReadingTextChar">This equivalence of opposing elements still characterizes</span>, in the Armchair of Gauguin, <span class="ReadingTextChar">the return of the theme in a new system of relations</span>: in relation to the illuminated gas jet the unfortunate candle plays the same humiliating role that the dead pipe plays in relation to the candle; the upturned gas jet only elevates a little more a break that is, fundamentally, <span class="ReadingTextChar">the sign of irreducible heterogeneity of the lacerated (and unrestrained) elements of Van Gogh’s personality. The relations between this painter</span> (identifying himself successively with fragile candles and with sometimes fresh and sometimes faded sunflowers) <span class="ReadingTextChar">and an ideal, of which the sun is the most dazzling form, appear to be analogous to those men that maintained at one time with their gods, at least so long as these gods stupefied them; mutilation normally intervened in these relations as sacrifice: it would represent the desire to resemble perfectly an ideal term, generally characterized in mythology as a solar god who tears and rips out his own organs</span>. In this way the theme connects with Gaston F.’s mutilation, and its meaning can be emphasized through a third example, in which a man of fire orders a woman to off her ears in order to offer them to him. A 34 year old woman, seduced and made pregnant by her employer, gave birth to an infant who died a few days after its birth. After this the unfortunate woman suffered from a persecution mania accompanied by uncontrollable body movements and religious hallucinations. She was placed in a mental hospital. One morning, a guard found her tearing out her right eye: the left ocular globe was completely removed, and in the empty socket shreds of conjunctiva and cellular tissue could be seen, as well as adipose tissues; on the right there was a very pronounced exophtalmos. . . When interrogated as to the motive for her act, the patient stated that she had heard the voice of God and, some time later, had seen a man of fire: “Give me your ears, split open your head,” the phantom told her. After hitting her head against the walls, she tried to tear off her ears, then decided to gouge out her eyes. The pain caused by her first efforts was extreme, but the voice urged her to overcome the pain and she did not give up. She claims to have lost consciousness at that point and cannot explain how she managed to completely tear out her left eye. . . This case is especially meaningful in that the substitution of eyes for ears, due to the lack of a sharp instrument, leads from the mutilation of relatively unimportant parts (such as a finger or an ear) to the Oedipal enucleation, in other words to the most horrifying form of sacrifice. But <span class="ReadingTextChar">how is it possible that gestures incontestably linked to mental disorder</span> (even if they can never be seen as the symptions of a specific mental illness<span class="ReadingTextChar">) may be spontaneously designated as the adequate expression of a veritable social function, of an institution as clearly defined, as generally human as sacrifice?</span> The interpretation cannot, however, be contested when it is considered as an immediate association, entirely lacking any scientific elaboration. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Even in antiquity, the insane were known to have characterized their mutilations in this way: Areteus writes of sick people he saw tearing off their own limbs because of religious feelings and in order to pay homage to gods who demanded this sacrifice</span>. But it is no less striking that, <span class="ReadingTextChar">in our day, with</span> the custom of <span class="ReadingTextChar">sacrifice in full decline</span>, <span class="ReadingTextChar">the meaning of the word</span>, to the extent that it implies a drive revealed by an inner experience, <span class="ReadingTextChar">is still as closely linked as possible to the notion of a spirit of sacrifice, of which the automutilation of madmen is only the most absurd and terrible example. It is true that this demented part of the sacrificial domain</span>, the only one that has remained accessible to us, to the extent that it belongs to our own pathological psychology, <span class="ReadingTextChar">cannot simply be opposed to its counterpart, religious sacrifices</span> of men and animals: the opposition even exists within religious sacrifices of men and animals: the opposition even exists within religious practice, which itself confronts classic sacrifice with the most varied and insane forms of automutilation. In this respect it is the bloody orgies of Islamic sects that appear at the present time with the most dramatic and significant forms: the participants, collectively raised to the height of religious frenzy, end up at the horrible omophagous sacrifice, as well as at direct or indirect mutilations, smashing each other on the head with clubs or axes, throwing themselves on swords, or gouging out their eyes. Whatever the role played by acquired skills, for example in enucleation, <span class="ReadingTextChar">the necessity of throwing oneself or something of oneself out of oneself remains the psychological or physiological mechanism that in certain cases can have no other end than death. The celebrations held by fanatics moreover only reenact in an attenuated from</span>, sometimes in the same regious, the gallinitiation right of the priests of Cybele who, overcome by a fit of fury, where delirious for three days at a time, performing wild leaps and dances, brandishing weapons and cups, striking each other mercilessly, and arriving, while in an incredible exaltation, at the sacrifice of their own virility through the use of a razor, a shell, or a stone. The circumcision rite, in most cases, does not result in such sense of delirium; it represents a less exceptional from of the religious ablation of a part of the body, and even though the patient himself does not act, this rite can be seen as a kind of collective automutilation. We know that it is practiced in more or less all parts of the world, but the Israelites, by Muslims, and by a very large number of the indigenous populations of Africa, Oceania, and America. It is sometimes accompanied by real tortures that can result in death, as, for example, among the Becwanas of southern Africa. Of course, any practice as difficult to explain rationally as this has given rise to numerous interpretations: the best known, which attributes a desire for hygiene to the primitive peoples who developed this innovation, has long since been discarded; on the other hand the one that presents this mutilation as sacrifice, even if such a generalization is debatable, is incontestably based on a number of positive examples. Besides, whatever may be the sacrificial nature of circumcision, it must be seen above all as an initiation rite, and as such it must be rigorously assimilated to other mutilations carried out in the same circumstances. In particular, the tearing out of a tooth replaces circumcision in certain parts of New Guinea and Australia. <span class="ReadingTextChar">The rupture of personal homogeneity and the projection outside the self of a pert of oneself with their rage and pain, appear thus to be linked regularly to the expiations, periods of mourning, or debaucheries that are openly evoked by the ceremony marking</span> the <span class="ReadingTextChar">entry into</span> adult <span class="ReadingTextChar">society.</span> Less widespread that circumcision, the practice of the ablation of a finger is also much less well known; each example is quickly passed over by the different authors, who limit themselves in general to the indication, in a sentence, of the habitual occasions for the mutilation. It is fairly frequently a matter of death and the manifestations of despair that follow it; however in India one finds it connected, for the woman, to the birth of a child, and sickness play the same role in the Tonga Islands. Among Blackfoot Indians, the finger is offered to the morning star in a propitiation sacrifice. In the Fiji Islands the propitiation could even be addressed to a living man: when a subject gravely offended his chief, he cut off his little finger and presented it to the chief in a hollowed-out piece of bamboo, in order to obtain his pardon. It is surprising that this form of mutilation is found in most parts of the world: in Australia, in New Guinea, in the Tonga and Fiji Islands; in Paraguay, in Brazil, and on the northwestern coast of North America; in Africa among the Pygmies of Lake Ngami, the Hottentots, the Bushmen. In Greece as well a stone finger set up over tumuli in the countryside indicated that even in the second century A. D. the custom might not have always been unknown there. “As you go from Megalopolis to Messene,” writes Pausanias, after advancing about seven stades, there stands on the left of the highway a sanctuary of the goddesses. They call the goddesses themselves, as well as the district around the sanctuary, Maniae (Madnesses). In my view this is a surname of the Eumenides; in fact they say that it was here that madness overtook Orestes as punishment for shedding his mother’s blood. Not far from the sanctuary is a mound of earth, of no great size, surmounted by a finger made of stone; the mane, indeed, of the mound is the Tomb of the Finger. Here, it is said, Orestes on losing his wits bit off one finger of one of his hands. Adjoining this place is another, called Ace (Remedies) because in it Orestes was cured of his malady. Here too there is a sanctuary for the Eumenides. The story is that, when these goddesses were about to put Orestes out of his mind, they appeared to him black; but when he had bitten off his finger they seemed to him again to be white and he recoverd his senses at the sight. The strange practice of the ablation of the finger seems to be particularly frequent in a region as archaic as Australia, which does not know sacrifice in the classic sense of the word. And this fact is doubtless all the more remarkable in that it is difficult to deny the existence of the same rite in the Neolithic period: in the had-patters obtained in caves by applying the hand to the wall and surrounding it with paint, one or several phalanges are missing. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Analogous practices found at the present time among the insane would thus appear to be not only generally human, but also very primitive; madness would only remove normal obsticles to an impulse as basic as its opposite, the impulse to eat</span>. Even if there is an egoism that accompanies the appropriation of food and wealth, <span class="ReadingTextChar">the movement that pushes a man</span> in certain cases to give himself (in other words<span class="ReadingTextChar">, to destroy himself) not only partially but completely, so that a bloody death ensues, can only be compared, in its irresistible and hideous nature, to the blinding flashes of lightning that transform the most withering storm into transports of joy.</span> In ritual forms of communal sacrifice, in any case, and animal can be substituted for the victim—a cowardly gesture. Only a pitiful, substituted victim “penetrates into the perlous domain of sacrifice; it dies there,”according to Hubert and Mauss, “and indeed it is there in order to die. The sacrifice remains protected.” <span class="ReadingTextChar">The freedom from “all selfish calculation,” from all reserve, remains nevertheless as the limit of these efforts to remain outside sacrifice, to the extent that nightmare creatures, such as gods, are charged with carrying to the very end of what ordinary men are happy to dream about: “the god who sacrifices himself gives himself irrevocably.”</span> Write Hubert and Mauss. “<span class="ReadingTextChar">This time all intermediaries have disappeared. The god, who is at the same time the sacrifice, is one with the victim and sometimes even with the sacrifice. All the differing elements that enter into ordinary sacrifice here enter into each other and become mixed together</span>. But such mixing is possible only for mythical, that is ideal beings.” Hubert and Mauss neglect here examples of the “sacrifice of a god” that they could have taken from cases of automutilation—and through which alone sacrifice loses its character as a mere performance. <span class="ReadingTextChar">There is</span>, in fact, <span class="ReadingTextChar">no reason to separate Van Gogh’s ear or Gaston F.’s finger from Prometheus’s famous liver</span>. <span class="ReadingTextChar">If one accepts the interpretation that identifies the purveying eagle</span> (the aetos Prometheus of the Greeks) <span class="ReadingTextChar">with the god who stole fire from the wheel of the sun, then the tearing out of the liver presents a theme in conformity with the various legends of the “sacrifice of god.</span>” <span class="ReadingTextChar">The roles are normally shared between the human form of a god and his animal avatar; sometimes the man sacrifices the animal, sometimes the animal sacrifices the man, but each time it is a case of automutilation because the animal and the man form a single being. The eagle-god who is confused with the sun by the ancients, the eagle who alone among all beings can contemplate while staring at “the sun in all its glory,” the Icarian being who goes to seek the fire of the heavens is, however, nothing other than an automutilator, a Vincent Van Gogh, a Gaston F. All the wealth he derives from the mythical delirium is limited to the incredible vomiting of the liver, ceaselessly devoured and ceaselessly vomited by the gaping belly of the god. If one followed these associations</span>, the use of the sacrificial mechanisms for various ends, such as propitiation or expiation, would be seen as secondary, and <span class="ReadingTextChar">one would only retain the elementary fact of the radical alteration that suddenly arises in collective life: for example, the death of a relative, initiation, the consumption of the new harvest. . .such an action would be characterized by the fact that it would have the power to liberate heterogeneous elements and to break habitual homogeneity of the individual, in the same way that vomiting would be opposed to its opposite, the communal eating of food. Sacrifice considered in its essential pahase would only be the rejection of what had been appropriated by a person or by a group. Because everything that is rejected from the human cycle is altered in an altogether troubling way, the sacred things that intervene at the end of the operation—the victim struck down in a pool of blood, the severed finger or ear, the torn-out eye—do not appreciably differ from a vomited food. Repugnance is only one of the forms of stupor caused by a horrifying eruption, by the disgorging of a force that threatens to consume</span>. <span class="ReadingTextChar">The one who sacrifices is free—free to indulge in a similar disgorging, free, continuously identifying with the victim, to vomit his own being just as he vomited a piece of himself or a bull, in other words free to throw himself suddenly outside of himself, like a gall or an aissaouah</span>. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Still, one can doubt that even the most furious of those who have ever torn and mutilated themselves amid screams and to the beat of a drum have abused this marvelous freedom to the same extent of Vincent Van Gogh, who carried his severed ear to the place that most offends polite society</span>. It is admirable that in this way <span class="ReadingTextChar">he both manifested a love that refused to take anything into account and in a way spat in the faces of all those who have accepted the elevated and official idea of life that is so well known. Perhaps the practice of sacrifice has disappeared from the earth because it was not able to sufficiently charged with this element of hate and disgust, without which it appears in our eyes as servitude. The monstrous ear sent in its envelope, however, abruptly leaves the magic circle where the rites of liberation stupidly aborted. It leaves along with the tongue of Anaxarcus of Abdera, bit off and spat blood in the face of the tyrant Nicoreaon, and with the tongue of a zeno of Elea spat in the face of Demylo</span>s. . .both of these philosophers have been subjected to atrocious tortures, the first crushed while still alive in a mortar.
And, our project of sacrificial doubling marks the boundary where the coherence of political criticism breaks down. We confront rational existence with its opposite in the form of avant-garde literature in order to enact a sacrificial death of the 1AC. This death should not be viewed as an execution but rather as a self-mutilation. This process of auto-mutilation or self-destruction creates in its wake a subversiveness that denies the will to positivist utopianism present in the 1AC placing us in the center of a struggle between productive political action and the inescapable negativity that prefigures all of our associations with the world. You can’t learn this shit in school…only debate provides us with the space to deny the law of the land by reading the very texts that our law makers would have burned…

Avant-garde textual practice in some way fundamentally disrupts the quotidian usefulness and precision of language; behind the facade of utility we find another language, which is the real realm of modernity. </span><span class="underline">Language becomes a universe unto itself, an absolute realm that refers to the senselessness of its own origins.

Thus both Roussel and Leiris, for example, attempt to see the fundamental statements of language as functions of puns: their writing is, at least to a certain extent, generated out of phonic similarities between words, similarities that might then uncover rather bizarre links between the meanings of words. Others, like Blanchot and Ponge, see a profound silence or death at the heart of writing, and write what amounts to a silencing of language as we know it. These projects tend to cross over: thus Roussel and Leiris are concerned, in one way or another, with the silence of their language, just as Blanchot and Ponge are occupied with the phonic or written configurations of the words they use, and with the multiple meanings—and problems—that lie behind each word. </span><span class="underline">It is not hard to see these avant-garde realms of language as Utopias</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: they are realms where language as it should be—not as it is—is displayed. Marxist critics, among them Lukacs, were quick to point out that the apparent disruptions of modernism were in fact an admission of sterility, the carrying out of a revolution on an abstract ideal plane, where risks— and benefits—amounted to zero. </span><span class="underline">In this view, avant-garde practice is restricted to an elite social sphere, since it can have little to say to people confronted with the problems of everyday life</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; it finally becomes a reactionary tool—its formal disruptions are merely reflections of bourgeois decay and are eminently appropriable by certain forces of order.1 </span><span class="underline">Other critics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as Julia Kristeva, </span><span class="underline">argued that avant-garde formal subversion was inherently revolutionary</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not reactionary: they held that the </span><span class="underline">disruptions of language were the product of a</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> predenotative "semiological flux"—that is, of a </span><span class="underline">state of language outside the repressive strictures of logic and signification</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—and that </span><span class="underline">the avant-garde text returned to liberate these forces in language and society</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this view, the most important avant-garde texts brought off a dialectical union between logic/denotation and the liberated flux of a subversive force of signification. But on the other hand, Kristeva maintained, certain writers, such as Louis- Ferdinand Celine, fundamentally misunderstood the revolutionary implications of their language practice and mistakenly associated it with fascism.2 </span><span class="underline">There may</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in fact, </span><span class="underline">be a third possibility</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As we read these five authors, </span><span class="underline">we will attempt to see not only the Utopian denial or denegation of various political problems, but their return as well. Modernist texts may be the locus of an irresolvable struggle between different ideological forces, rather than the repository of a single one: we will attempt to read the space where that struggle occurs, where it is denied, and, conversely, where it can be read, perhaps through its very denial</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">To read a space between political positions and political rewritings, one need not be "neutral" oneself</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Yet, as we shall see, </span><span class="underline">the violence of inward conflict in the texts</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> we propose to read </span><span class="underline">cannot</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> simply </span><span class="underline">be exiled from critical consideration</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These five authors, in different ways, focus on the problem of automutilation and sacrifice. </span><span class="underline">This phenomenon of inner sacrifice is by no means a dead letter for criticism itself today: in fact it may be the most important one that we as readers of "literature" face</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The inner violence of major characters (on a thematic level) mirrors the self-directed violence of language (in silence, in wordplay, in writing) in the modernist novels, autobiography, and poetry we propose to examine. Thus </span><span class="underline">the models of a Utopian future depicted in these writings double the Utopias of language worked out by the writings on a formal level. The Utopian future that is most explicitly prefigured by Bataille</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">— but that also lurks under the surface, so to speak, in the other writers—</span><span class="underline">is one which would attempt to imagine, somehow implemented in society, the radical negativity and unrecoverable </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(but crucial) </span><span class="underline">violence that occurs between sacrificer and victim, or ultimately, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">as we shall see in our reading of Bataille</span><span class="underline">, between two opposing ideological forces that collide head on</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But </span><span class="underline">the question always returns: what will be the political manifestation of the squandered energy of sacrifice in society? Can fiction or poetry, as Utopian texts, somehow foresee it? The irony here is that the critic who would read these writings closely and perhaps dismiss their Utopian desire for strategic destruction is inescapably formed by a method of interpretation that was itself the result of the intervention</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (proposed by our authors) </span><span class="underline">of sacrifice/doubling/automutilation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">This method is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of course, </span><span class="underline">deconstruction</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. By </span><span class="underline">calling these writings "urtexts of deconstruction"</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> we do not wish to imply that there are not other' 'urtexts'' as well: Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and Heidegger are a few names that come to mind as authors of such "urtexts." But these authors are (in a different way) authors of "urtexts" of existentialism as well, whereas the authors treated in this book were totally unacceptable to larger literary and philosophical movements (such as existentialism),3 and they constitute a specific and crucial moment in contempory French literature and philosophy s out of which appeared the writings of critics who, in the United States at least, have come to be called "poststructuralists" (Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, to cite three names). </span><span class="underline">It</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at first </span><span class="underline">seems strange to</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> attempt to </span><span class="underline">place in literary history</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (or in the history of philosophy) </span><span class="underline">critics who are engaged in the critique of a history</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (or histories) </span><span class="underline">based on metaphysical or dialectical models of causation, production, or presence</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As is by now well known, the very model of literary influence has been put into question by these influential writers. But this (non)influence extends back in time as well: the interest in the model of sacrifice that is exhibited in the "urtexts of deconstruction" is much more than a quirk of 1930s or 1940s intellectual life; instead </span><span class="underline">it is an affirmation of a dualist view of historical progress, in which productive history is itself opened out at key junctures by a negativity that escapes appropriation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We face the somewhat paradoxical situation, then, of considering a group of authors whose "influence" has been to point toward the impossibility of a coherent theory of influence. There are other "influences" as well: the privileging, in one way or another, of writing or inscription over speech, of force over dialectical articulation, of writing referring to its own status as anterior heterogeneous force. Perhaps </span><span class="underline">the</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> very </span><span class="underline">critique of history that comes out of a reading of these "urtexts" has condemned them to exile from established histories of twentieth-century</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> French literature. Of course (as we all know), symbolism came first, then surrealism, then existentialism, then the New Novel. </span><span class="underline">Necessarily falling between the cracks</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of this history are the authors we shall read in this book. </span><span class="underline">There is a certain logic to this: one simply cannot teach Bataille's obscenity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or Blanchot's opacity </span><span class="underline">in a high school</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These then, as well as others (Celine, Artaud, Klossowski) are necessarily minor authors, not because they lack "importance" but </span><span class="underline">because of a subversiveness that can never be erected and displayed as a law of the land. Yet, ironically</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, each of these authors </span><span class="underline">would join his subversion to a view of a transformed society: this Utopian vision is one of the impossible establishment of a subversive principle</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Bataille's expenditure, Blanchot's silence, Roussel's textual machine, etc.) </span><span class="underline">in conjunction with a society or social experience that somehow embodies this subversion</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">It is that Utopian instant of conjunction, the violent meeting of irreconcilable forces, that is the moment of sacrificial death</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (the conjunction of sacrificer and sacrificed), </span><span class="underline">as are also those doubles of sacrificial doubling</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the "difference and repetition" of Deleuze, the "differance" or "dissemination" of Derrida. </span><span class="underline">Thus the minor subversion of the "urtexts" that we mentioned a moment ago is soon transformed into the inescapable subversion of our contemporaries. (They in turn reflect back on their urtexts and reveal them to be inescapable as well</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.)</span>
This process of struggle and continual sacrifice denies the statement of a political system that sees itself as morally superior in any way. The denial of the double nature of our existence, of the inherent negativity present in all things forces the affirmative to suture over the wounds created by our auto-mutilation proposing a position that is violently innocent. This process of moral superiority and denial of negativity leads to fascism. Only the process of continual auto-destruction staves off this fate.
<span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stoekl in 1986</span></span> <span class="SmallTextChar">(Alan, Politics, Writing, and Mutilation: The Cases of Bataille, Blanchot, Roussel, Leiris, and Ponge. Pg. xi-xix)</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">We have examined texts of this sort in this book, and our method of reading owes much to (and perverts much of) Marin's method in Utopiques. </span><span class="underline">It is degenerate avant-garde writing that attempts to explode the pure rationalism of a future society with all that escapes it</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: the result may often be sinister (as in the case of Celine's pamphlets).5 </span><span class="underline">But the position or vantage point from which we write cannot offer any political or moral superiority</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is not more "human" than another position. </span><span class="underline">The State that recognizes and would inevitably rationalize excess is sundered, and must</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (in spite of itself) </span><span class="underline">face its own self-betrayal. It cannot establish itself in a region of pristine omniscience, and in this way it is different from a simple knowledge at the end of history. At the end of history</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as foreseen by Bataille, </span><span class="underline">dialectically nonrecuperable negativity is "recognized"— but that recognition itself is liable to be betrayed by what it impossibly recognizes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.6 In the same way</span><span class="underline">, the intellectual who would "utilize" this sundered absolute knowledge will be unable to definitively lose his or her guilt.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> To that extent the gap between our Bataillean metatext and the avant-garde texts we read is less than the gap between Marin's Marxism and the utopianism of More. Strictly speaking </span><span class="underline">our double bind rigorously repeats the one faced by these avant-garde Utopias, these urtexts of deconstruction. The "ideology" we read, however, in these works comes from their refusal to recognize their own doubled positions, the betrayal and guilt of inherent negativity, and the repetitious necessity of analysis</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This Utopian ideology is the unwriteable space in the text that embraces types of silence (Blanchot, Ponge), or loquacity (Leiris), or various repressive fictional alternatives—the mechanization of corpses and language, for example (Roussel). These are the </span><span class="underline">alternatives to selfmutilation that in the end are even more guilty than that mutilation itself, because they would suture over the mutilation and substitute a position that is violently innocent. Fascism is always the most extreme example of this tendency</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span><span class="ReadingTextChar">**there the most aggressive destruction and self-destruction**</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (on the part of the executioner or writer) is covered over or repressed by an utterly banal and finally irrational justification. (The most extreme example of this is, again, the pamphleteering of Celine, which conceals an irresolvable struggle between Marxism and an orgiastic violence behind an insipid but hallucinatory harangue.) </span>**__Yet to think that we could ever simply leave behind any guilty ideology is as Utopian as the espousal of that ideology__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, because Marxism (or a rationalized model of any type, including Bataille's Utopia, at the end of La Part maudite, where negativity is somehow, in the future, recognized) </span>**__will always see what defies it as an irrational, fascistic betrayal__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—and there is no higher vantage point from which we could prove Marxism wrong and argue for our own "human" perspective. Even though our viewpoint might be "dialectically" an "advance" over Marxism, it ultimately lacks the recuperative stability of the "Aufhebung." </span><span class="underline">It is a dialectical advance that recognizes</span>**__, by rewriting the dialectic, a radically defiant or unrecuperable negativity__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To that extent, it is both a dialectical advance over Marxism, and there fore a continuation of the rationalizing tendency of Marxism (in theory and practice), and a defiant betrayal of Marxism (as well as of itself) in a repetitious dyadic struggle whose negativity cannot be simply integrated or put to work. </span><span class="underline">In the same instant, at a crucial point, our viewpoint is both a dialectical move and a subversion of all dialectic. At that moment, as critical doubles of Bataille, we incessantly betray our own methodology (and thus we betray Bataille). In and out of the text. </span>
Finally, we return to Bataille. Van Gogh is not just some Dutch painter who cut off his ear, but rather a person who reached the boiling point where the proposed stability of the world explodes rousing us from sleep putting us into contact with the very chaos that makes life worth living.
<span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bataille and Michelson in 86</span></span> (Van Gogh as Prometheus Author(s): Georges and Annette Source: October, Vol. 36, Georges Bataille: Writings on Laughter, Sacrifice, Nietzsche, Un- Knowing (Spring, 19), pp. 58-60 Published by: The MIT Press Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/778550)
<span class="ReadingTextChar">**Vincent Van Gogh belongs not to art history, but to the bloody myth of our existence as humans. He is of that rare company who, in a world spellbound by stability, by sleep, suddenly reached the terrible "boiling point" without which all that claims to endure becomes insipid, intolerable, declines. For this "boiling point" has meaning not only for him who attains it, but for all, even though all may not yet perceive that which binds man's savage destiny to radiance, to explosion, to flame, and only thereby to power.**</span>

First, the State's vision of sovereign power commands all and claims legitimacy for all, providing the State the ability to determine the conduct of living for all within its domain. Also, this same State is one that often creates a brand of politics that is caught inextricably in the web of sovereign power.
Wadiwel in 02 Dinesh Joesph, “Cows and Sovereignty: Biopower and Animal Life” Borderlands E-Journal Vol.1 #2)
But such a political program has far reaching consequences, both for Western sovereignty, and the way that the business of politics is conducted. The living population of the earth has inherited a vision of sovereign power, which has spread cancerously into even the most seemingly inaccessible aspects of everyday life. This vision commands all, claims legitimacy for all, and determines the conduct of living for all within its domain. Politics ‘as we know it’ is caught inextricably in the web of sovereign power, in such a way that it seems that modern political debate cannot help but circulate around the same, routine issues: "What is the appropriate legislative response?"; "Is it within the State’s powers to intervene in this particular conflict?"; "How can we ensure the citizen’s rights are maintained in the face of the state?". To challenge such an encompassing and peremptory political discourse — where every question implies the sovereign absolutely, and every decision made refers to life itself — would require the most intensive rethinking of the way in which territory, governance and economy are imagined. In this sense, whilst Agamben’s analysis of' bare life, and Foucault’s theory of bio-power, provide a means by which to assess the condition of non-human life with respect to sovereign power, the political project must reach beyond these terms, and embrace an intertwining of the human and the non-human: an intersection which may be found in the animal life shared by both entities.

THE WATER RUNS AND MOMMA'S ALWAYS THERE SO WHO SEPARATES THE WORLD FROM THE START. WHERE SUCH WORDS WOULD COME AND SUCH THOUGHTS WOULD CAUSE A SHOT HEARD ROUND THE WORLD. OR JUST AS SAD NEVER HEARD AT ALL.

Thus the State's politics have and will always prioritize things like the collapse of our economy or fictitious WMDs in Iraq over other pressing issues such as poverty or oppression. These issues constantly pushed down to the bottom of our society and our debate discussions are known to us as systematic violence. The State and the Affirmative continue to mask over various forms of systematic violence, damning the oppressed to a life of absolute invisibility. Mumia Abu-Jamal explains that:

Mumia Abu-Jamal 1998 [“A QUIET AND DEADLY VIOLENCE,” 9/19/98, http://www.mumia.nl/TCCDMAJ/quietdv.htm]

It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation, as shown by the thousands of cases of social and communal violence that occurs daily in the nation. Every year, some 20,000 people are killed by others, and
additional 20,000 folks kill themselves. Add to this the non lethal violence that Americans daily
inflict on each other, and we begin to see the tracings of a nation immersed in a fever of violence. But, as remarkable, and harrowing as
this level and degree of violence is, it is, by far, not the most violent feature of living in the midst of the American empire. We live, equally
1NC (2/4)
immersed, and to a deeper degree, in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging "structural" violence, of a kind that destroys human life with a breathtaking ruthlessness. Former Massachusetts prison official and writer, Dr. James Gilligan observes;"By `structural violence' I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted by those who are above them. Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) are a function of the class structure; and that structure is itself a product of society's collective human choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting `structural' with `behavioral violence' by which I mean the non-natural deaths and injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide, suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on." -- (Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New York: Vintage, 1996), 192.) This form of violence, not covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected media, is invisible to us and because of its invisibility, all the more insidious. How dangerous is it -- really? Gilligan notes: "[E]very fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths; and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews over a six-year period. This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year, of every decade throughout the world.

COMING UP STRONG READY TO BEGIN TO OBLITERATE THE WORD FROM THE START WHERE SUCH WORDS WOULD COME AND SUCH THOUGHTS WOULD CAUSE A SPARK THAT'LL SET A BLAZE AND LEAVE THE EMBERS RED UNTIL THE END OF DAYS.

In order for us to focus on systematic violence, there are two crucial steps we must take:

First, we must create space for both us and the oppressed to participate in an epistemological shift by becoming the subject of the debate community's and the world's transformation. Our role of the ballot represents a step away from violent discourse within our discussions to do this. Paulo Friere goes on to say:

Paulo Friere, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Chapter 1, educator and director of the Department of Cultural Extension of Recife University,1970

It is absolutely essential that the oppressed participate in the revolutionary process with an increasingly critical awareness of their role as Subjects of the transformation. If they are drawn into the process as ambiguous beings, partly themselves and partly the oppressors housed within them – and if they come to power still embodying that ambiguity imposed on them by the situation of oppression – it is my contention that they will merely imagine they have reached power. Their existential duality may even facilitate the rise of a sectarian climate leading to the installation of bureaucracies which undermine the revolution. If the oppressed do not become aware of this ambiguity during the course of the revolutionary process, they may participate in that process with a spirit more revanchist that revolutionary. They may aspire to revolution as a means of domination, rather than as a road to liberation.

Second, we must escape the suppressive ideology that controls our discussions of the resolution that leads to masking over and ignoring the wide ranging structural violence incorporated in the status-quo. Our alternative provides us the opportunity to participate with the march against oppressive ideologies that control the sociology of our relations.

Silva in 08 Zuberi and Bonilla-Silva, Zuberi is a professor and chairman of sociology at the university of pennsylvania, bonilla-silva is a preofessor of sociology at duke university, 2008 [white logic,white methods, pg.331]

But sociology and the social sciences have always had their discontents.4 Women such as Ida B. Wells and Jane
Addams, men of color such as W. E. B. Du Bois, and a few White men such as W. I. Thomas (see Bonilla-Silva, Baiocchi, and Horton
forthcoming), challenged White supremacist standards early on and offered more nuanced
interpretations of inequality (racial and otherwise) in society (Zuberi 2006). And almost all the sociological
dissidents of yester years as well as those of today (Essed and Gold- berg 2002) have been connected to
larger causes and movements.8 Their specific confrontations in sociology derived from the intellectual foundations of the social
movements they were part of, such as the antilynching campaigns (Ida B. Wells), the suffragist and feminist movement (Ida B. Wells and Jane Addams),
Pan-Africanism (Du Bois), and many other movements in the early part of the twentieth century. The critique of what has been known as "the sociology of race relations" has thus been intrinsically connected to the politics of resistance and decolonization projects. Whereas mainstream sociology has advocated, since the work of Robert Park"assimilation" as the solution to America's (and the world's) racial "problems,"7 critical minority sociologists have insisted on fundamental changes to the social order as the only way to eliminate "the color line" (Du Bois 1903; Crenshaw 1988); whereas sociology and the social sciences have offered at best a slow, piecemeal, evolutionary process of radical change, analysts of color have insisted on the need for radical or revolutionary change.8 African and African Diaspora scholars such as W. E. B. Du Bois (1934) and Oliver Cox (1948), for instance, long held that only by understanding decolonization and deracialization could one understand the
development of capitalism and modern society. Rather than "civilization" (the language of sociology in the early years),
"modernity" (the language of sociology from the 1940s to the 1960s), or "development" (the language of sociology since the 1960s), people of
color enduring colonial, neocolonial, or internal colonial domination have historically demanded
1NC (4/4)
freedom, equality, and respect as the way out of the bubbling racial cauldron. Therefore, we position our efforts as part of the long (and still woefully incomplete) march for racial redemption and propose that what is needed to uproot the White logic that has organized the sociology of relations is an epistemology of liberation (Moya 1997; Feagin and Vera 2001; De Sousa Santos 2006). We advocate for a new epistemology expressive of the movement to abolish White supremacy and liberate us all- White and nonwhite- from the racial prison we have inhabited for 500 years. Such epistemology is corrective to the Tarzani logic that has inspired sociological inquiry into the racial matters that made Whites into heroes and Blacks into primitives, villains, and criminals. Below we provide an outline of such an epistemology fully aware that the precise content of any epistemology of social change will ultimately be shaped by the politic, values, and emotions of the movement it embodies- in this case, the movement to end White supremacy once and for all and, hopefully, achieve in the process “social emancipation”

Thus our interpretation for this debate is that we should be able to discuss systematic violence amongst our peers in our debate community to prove through in round discourse that we have the potential to remove violent representations from our criticisms and provide ourselves with the opportunity to stand in solidarity with the oppressed through our revolutionary way of speaking while discussing this year's resolution.

Our alternative is a rejection of the 1AC's use of the State that ignores wide ranging structural violences. Doing so opens space for discussions about the violence and oppression that is pushed to the bottom of our debate space and to the bottom of our world.

First, macro-political fear mongering is replicated with horrible consequences on a geopolitical scale when confronted with the affirmatives impact claims …
The affirmative’s scenarios of catastrophic destruction are merely a thinly veiled attempt to engage in the politics of fear. It is this fear that leads to authentic disaster; the same fear that beset the colonizer when confronted with the Native; the fear that flowed in the blood of white slave masters, the fear of 9/11 that Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld transformed into the war in Iraq, and lastly here the affirmative feeds into fear that will lead us to continue in a brand of racist politics that lives up to its forefathers.

As Russian writer, Svetlana Alexisvitch has noted, "</span><span class="underline">We are turning into a civilization of fear. Because what is a disaster? A disaster is a high concentration of fear. The commodity that our civilization creates in the largest quantity is fear."* For the English and Spanish colonizers of this land, fear of the far more numerous Indians was a constant. That fear was met by a ubiquitous campaign of virtual genocide against red people that lasted for generations. When Indian populations were sufficiently reduced, and there were too few to efficiently labor as slaves, white colonies began the infamous transatlantic slave trade, which brought millions of Africans to these shores. With this change of conditions came a change in the focus of the object of the politics of fear: Black people. Anyone who has studied southern politics from the 17th to the 20th centuries has seen masters of these politics at work. Today, that same politics has considerable potency, as we utilize codes that disguise our meaning, while still tapping into the deep American well of fear. Post 9/11, we have seen most of that traditional fear transmuted into a dread of brown people</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (as in Arabs, and occasionally, Mexicans). </span><span class="underline">Today, we are awash in political shorthand that sufficiently communicates loads in little more than a word: illegal immigration; borders; crime; and the phrase that has come to define our era </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(even as it has lost a good deal of its juice of late</span><span class="underline">), the so-called 'Global War on Terror</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.) </span><span class="underline">The corrosive politics of fear continues, as long as politicians ply that set of wares.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- (c) '07 maj </span> </span>

Furthermore, fear feeds upon itself until it can only produce chaos and more fear…if we give into this vicious cycle we abandon hope and the chance for real change with it.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is increasingly difficult to watch TV or listen to the radio these days, for the airwaves and cable outlets are thick with political ads. At the cost of millions of dollars, </span><span class="underline">politicians are trying to sell the psychic poison of fear</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I never knew that San Francisco's Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D.-Ca.) was so feared by so many right-wing pols. Perhaps the only politician getting more play nationally is President George Bush, whom many Democrats are running with, and many Republicans are running from. </span><span class="underline">For</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> many </span><span class="underline">campaigns</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><span class="underline">the common denominator is fear; fear of Al Qaeda; fear of Osama; fear of so-called extremists. Fear of being seen, or perceived, as weak, soft on the so-called war on terror. Isn't it strange that no one fears being stupid?</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Several days ago, a low level US diplomat said, during an interview with Al Jazeera, that the U.S. had been both "arrogant" and "stupid" in its Iraq adventure. Within hours he was forced to retract his comments, suggesting they were 'taken out of context,' 'badly translated' and the like. </span><span class="underline">In the U.S. Empire, it seems, diplomats may not speak the truth. In the U.S. Empire, truth is treason ... And while truth is outlawed, fear is a common sentiment.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Several years ago, a Yale senior researcher, Immanuel Wallerstein, in his provocative article, "The Eagle has Crash Landed," noted: "Other nations are afraid or unwilling to stand up to Washington directly, but even their foot-dragging is hurting the United States. Yet the U.S. response amounts to little more than arrogant arm-twisting. Arrogance has its own negatives. Calling in chips means leaving fewer chips for next time, and surly acquiescence breeds increasing resentment. Over the last 200 years, the United States acquired a considerable amount of ideological credit. But these days, the United States is running through this credit even faster than it ran through its gold surplus in the 1960s." </span><span class="underline">Fear allowed the Iraq War to become a reality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; fear among Democrats who didn't want to appear weak; and fear among the media that didn't want to appear unpatriotic</span><span class="underline">. Fear led, not to the illusion of safety, but to the certainty of chaos; or ruinous war; of disaster. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And now we are on the brink of mid-term elections, where it's likely one party, or the other, will emerge victorious. But no matter who wins, Iraq yet looms large as the insoluble Gordian Knot, that neither side can, or will, untie. Many Democrats voted for the war, and are loathe to admit error, again, for fear of seeming weak. You can hope all you wish, but history dashes such thoughts. Democrats voted for the war, and recently, over a dozen Democrats in the Senate voted for the so-called Military Commission Act, a law granting immunity to the executive branch for torture, and --- oh, yes --- the right of President Bush to *define* torture. </span><span class="underline">All of this -- fear, feeding on fear, feeding on fear. This political class can only give birth to fear; for hope is foreign to them. And this fear</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, born of the will to keep their offices </span><span class="underline">has led to this present sad state of affairs</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Isn't it time for *real* change?</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Source: Wallerstein, Immanuel, "Pax Americana-The Eagle has Crash Landed," *Foreign Policy Magazine* (July/August 2002); or: .] Copyright 2006 Mumia Abu-Jamal </span>
Finally, don’t believe the hype. The politics of fear is a tactic well practiced by the privileged and the powerful to line their politics and push their agenda. Their politics are no different…all of their scenarios for destruction are grossly hyperbolic constructions designed to distract us from an authentic opportunity for liberation.

<span class="underline">If Congress has shown us anything, it is that when they are scared, they'll do anything. Seven years ago, in the twilight after 9/11 and in the wake of the anthrax attacks, Congress passed sweeping authorizations to the White House for war on a whim, and signed the so-called Patriot Act in record time. Some members admitted that they didn't even read the bill before voting "aye." One </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">man, a prominent and even </span><span class="underline">legendary congressman admitted, "We were afraid; they told us we had to pass the Patriot Act -- so we did it." Fear. That same dank, semi-sweet smell is radiating through the halls of Congress, thicker than the clouds of cigar smoke. This time it's financial fear. Politicians are once again dancing to the tune of others, to the Masters of the Universe on Wall Street</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, who need another bailout, bringing it to nearly a trillion bucks ($1,000,000,000,000!) in less than a month! And just like last time, </span><span class="underline">Congress is being suckered into coughing up the public's money--quickly--or else! The Iraq War was a shell game that exploded into a debacle</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Remember how the media initially tried to link anthrax attacks to Al Qaeda? When the source is nailed to an apparently mad American scientist</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (question: was he really mad, or a scientist following government orders?), </span><span class="underline">it's too late. The damage is done. The bills are passed. Powers are transferred. Hundreds of billions are spent and wasted?</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Right? </span><span class="underline">Congress has defied the common knowledge that we learn from our mistakes; because here we go again. The administration yells, "Boo!", and Congress answers, "How much do you want?"</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This is not to suggest (to paraphrase former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt) that the only thing to be feared is fear. There really is a disaster looming in the financial world. And Congress knew about it years ago (or certainly should have). Why else would they've passed the amended Bankruptcy Act several years ago? Why would they pass a bill making it harder to file bankruptcies--unless they saw a tidal wave of it coming down the river? They knew it was coming, as certainly as autumn follows summer. Congress is poised to, once again, transfer public wealth to private businesses, in a mad dash to re- wrap bad loans as new instruments, so that these securities could be peddled to new buyers. Who'll buy? Will Wall Street? Don't bet on it. Will you? Probably not. Perhaps China will buy up these new instruments --but don't hold your breath! -(c) '08 maj </span>

Folks, we're here to sell the only thing worth selling or buying and that's immortality. Now here is the simplest solution and well on the way. Just replace the worn-out parts and keep the old heap on the road indefinitely."
<span class="ReadingTextChar">As transplant techniques are perfected and refined, the age-old dream of immortality is now within the grasp of mankind. But who is to decide out of a million applicants for the same heart? </span>There simply aren't enough parts to go around. You need the job lot once a year to save 20 percent, folks. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Big executives use a heart a month just as regular as clockwork. Warlords, paying off their soldiers in livers and kidneys and genitals, depopulate whole areas. Vast hospital cities cover the land from the air-conditioned hospital palaces of the rich, radiating out to field hospitals and open-air operating booths. The poor are rising in mobs. They are attacking government warehouses where the precious parts are stored. Everyone who can afford it has dogs and guards to protect himself from roving bands of parts hunters, like the dreaded Wild Doctors, who operate on each other after the battle, cutting the warm quivering parts from the dead and dying. Cut-and-grab men dart out of doorways and hack out a kidney with a few expert strokes of their four-inch scalpels. People have lost all shame. Here's a man who sold his daughter's last kidney to buy himself a new groin-appears on TV to appeal for funds to buy little Sally an artificial kidney and give her this last Christmas. On his arm is a curvaceous blond known apparently as Bubbles. She calls him Long John; now isn't that cute?</span>
A flourishing black market in parts grows up in the gutted cities devastated by parts riots. In terrible slums, scenes from Brueghel and Bosch are reenacted; misshapen masses of rotten scar tissue crawling with maggots supported on crutches and cains, in wheel-chairs and carts.…Brutal-as-butchers practitioners operate without anesthetic in open-air booths surrounded by their bloody knives and saws…the poor wait in parts lines for diseased genitals, a cancerous lung, a cirrhotic liver. They crawl towards the operating booths holding forth nameless things in bottles--that they think are usable parts. Shameless swindlers <span class="SmallTextChar">who buy up operating garbage in job lots</span> prey on the unwary.
<span class="ReadingTextChar">And here is Mr. Rich Parts. He is three hundred years old. He is still subject to accidental death, and the mere thought of it throws him into paroxysms of idiot terror. For days he cowers in his bunker, two hundred feet down in solid rock, food for fifty years. A trip from one city to another requires months of sifting and checking computerized plans and alternate routes to avoid the possibility of an accident. His idiotic cowardice knows no bounds. There he sits, looking like a Chimu vase with a thick layer of smooth purple scar tissue. Encased as he is in this armor, his movements are slow and hydraulic. It takes him ten minutes to sit down. This layer gets thicker and thicker right down to the bone-the doctors have to operate with power tools. So we leave Mr. Rich Parts and the picturesque parts people their monument, a mountain of scar tissue.</span>
<span class="ReadingTextChar">Mr. Hubbard, said: "The rightest right a man could be would be to live infinitely wrong." I wrote "wrong" for "long" and the slip is significant--for the means by which immortality is realized in science fiction, which will soon be science fact, are indeed infinitely wrong, the wrongest wrong a man can be, vampiric or worse.</span>
<span class="ReadingTextChar">Improved transplant techniques open the question whether the ego itself could be transplanted</span> from one body to another, and the further question as to exactly where this entity resides. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Here is Mr. Hart, a trillionaire dedicated to his personal immortality. Where is this thing called Mr. Hart? Precisely where, in the human nervous system, does this ugly death-sucking, death-dealing, death-fearing thing reside…? Science gives only a tentative answer: the "ego" seems to be located in the midbrain at the top of the head. Well he thinks couldn't we just scoop it out of a healthy youth, throw his in the garbage where it belongs, and slide in MEEEEEEEE?</span> So he starts looking for a brain surgeon, a "scrambled egg" man, and he wants the best. When it comes to a short-order job old Doc Zeit is tops. He can switch eggs in an alley.
<span class="ReadingTextChar">Mr. Hart embodies the competitive, acquisitive, success-minded spirit that formulated American capitalism. The logical extension of this ugly spirit is criminal. Success is its own justification. He who succeeds deserves to succeed; he is RIGHT. The operation is a success.</span> The doctors have discreetly withdrawn. When a man wakes up in a beautiful new bod, he can flip out. It wouldn't pay to be a witness. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Mr. Hart stands up and stretches luxuriously in his new body. He runs his hands over the lean young muscle where his potbelly used to be. All that remains of the donor is a blob of gray matter in a dish. Mr. Hart puts his hands on his hips and leans over the blob.</span>
<span class="ReadingTextChar">"And how wrong can you be? DEAD."</span>

<span class="ReadingTextChar">He spits on it and he spits ugly.</span>

<span class="ReadingTextChar"> The final convulsions of a universe based on quantitative factors, like money, junk, and time, would seem to be at hand.

The 1AC constructs presence as a problem of quantity. They assume that there is some amount action or criticism that will alleviate the conditions of the world. This is a false dream. Capitalism, language, and the subject trap us in the politics of time. The time for business as usual is up. In place of the plan we offer a moment of rupture, a moment that resists the politics of business as usual and prepares us for space travel.

<span class="SmallTextChar">The reversibility and flexibility of</span><span class="ReadingTextF6"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> the cut-up text suggests the possibility of a flight, of **continual evolution** and **change**. Instead of condensed liquefaction into a single image, Burroughs creates </span></span><span class="SmallTextChar">in his experimental writing- particularly in the cut-up narratives-</span><span class="ReadingTextF6"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> a **random** and **infinite** variety of **implosions** and **explosions**, the pulsing rhythm of life itself.</span></span><span class="SmallTextF4"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Medical experiements in //Naked Lunch// amuse themselves by arresting or cutting off the life cycle of “tension discharge rest” at the moment of extreme tension: “what would be result of administering curare plus iron lung during acute mania? Possibly the subject, unable to discharge his tensions in motor activity, would succumb on the spot like a jungle rat. Interesting cause of death, what?” (NL 131). </span></span><span class="ReadingTextF6"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The cut-up </span></span><span class="SmallTextChar">texts </span><span class="ReadingTextF6"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">offer[s] an **antidote** to </span></span><span class="SmallTextChar">this </span><span class="ReadingTextF6"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">terminal paralylsis in metonymic condensations that **always** lead to **explosion, dissemination, expansion**. </span></span><span class="SmallTextChar">The cycle is always recharged: “You in the Word and the Word in You is a word-lock […] the word-lock that is You, Stop, Change. Start again. Lighten your own life sentence” (TM 61). On a most concrete and obvious level, Burroughs’ own texts resist finality by being constantly reissued in different versions, fragments large and small surfacing in new works and new contexts. The original publication dates of three cut-up novels- The Soft Machine (1961), The Ticket That Exploded (1962) and Nova Express (1964)- suggest a sequence in which the critic might discover some coherent progression or development. Burroughs’ habit of substantially revising manuscripts for each new edition, however, makes any rigid adherence to such a linear model rather awkward. Thus, in addition tot eh common base of fictional material which feeds all the cut-up novels and thus blurs their boundaries, each individual text is subject to the indeterminancy of continual revision. Beyond his challenge to the limitations of conventional linear narrative, Burroughs also attacks the equally restrictive linearity of literary history. A bibliography of Burroughs’</span><span class="SmallTextF4"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> work reads rather like Borges’ catalogue of the writings of the apocryphal Pierre Menard, whose technique of “deliberate anocronism” turns history inside out. The trilogy of cut-up novels has been described by Philippe Mikriammos as a false trilogy, a single book completed in three versions, under three different angles (//William Burroughs// 77). As we shall see in examining th three novels, the prose itself reflects this resistance to closure. Burroughs’ style tends to “anamorphosis,” “It rubs itself out and rewrites itself” (Lemaire 23). The Method: Vigilance and the Risks of Chance. </span></span><span class="ReadingTextF6"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Released from the burden of subjectivity</span></span><span class="SmallTextChar">, of authorship and ownership</span><span class="ReadingTextF6"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the cut-up text opens up possibilities for what Burroughs calls “space/time travel.” </span></span><span class="SmallTextChar">Such futuristic journeys call for detachment, for scientific rigor and control. While </span><span class="SmallTextF4"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Burroughs had already brought literature and science together in //Naked Lunch//, in the cut-up narratives he makes this connection even more explicit. He insists, for example, that </span></span><span class="SmallTextChar">his cut-up techniques are not arguments or “positions” but scientific experiments. The practical work of the writer is a continuous experiment; daily life is transcribed by Burroughs into scrapbook mosaics of word and image, into notebooks and diaries where clippings and photographs are accumulated and coordinated with a variety of texts.</span>
With this in mind we offer the following:

**We return to Burroughs’s discussion of capitalism run amuck:**
<span class="ReadingTextChar">I postulate that true immortality can only be found in space.</span> Space exploration is the only goal worth striving for. Over the hills and far away.<span class="ReadingTextChar"> You will know your enemies by those who block your path.

Immortality is prolonged future, and the future of any artifact lies in the direction of increased flexibility capacity for change and ultimately mutation. Immortality may be seen as a by-product of function: "to shine in use." Mutation involves changes that are literally unimaginable from the perspective of the future mutant. Coldblooded, non-dreaming creatures living in the comparatively weightless medium of water could not conceive of breathing air, dreaming, and experiencing the force of gravity as a basic fact of life. There will be new fears like the fear of falling, new pleasures, and new necessities. There are distinct advantages to living in a supportive medium like water. Mutation is not a matter of logical choices.
The human mutants must take a step into the unknown, a step that no human has taken before.
"We were the first that ever burst into that silent sea."
“We are such stuff as dreams are made on.”
Recent dream research has turned up a wealth of data but no one has assembled the pieces into a workable field theory.
By far the most significant discovery to emerge from precise dream research with volunteer subjects is the fact that dreams are a biological necessity for all warm-blooded animals. Deprived from REM sleep, they show all the symptoms of sleeplessness no matter how much dreamless sleep they are allowed. Continued deprivation would result in death.
All dreams in male subjects except nightmares are accompanied by erection. No one has proffered an explanation. It is interesting to not that a male chimpanzee who did finger dab paintings, and was quite good too, went into a sexual frenzy during his creative acts.
Cold-blooded animals do not dream. All warm-blooded creatures including birds do dream.
John Dunne discovered that dreams contain references to future time as experienced by the dreamer. He published his findings An Experiment With Time in 1924. Dream references, he points out, relate not to the event itself but to the time when the subject learns of the event. The dream refers to the future of the dreamer. He says that anybody who will write his dreams down over a period of time will turn up precognitive references. Dreams involve time travel. Does it follow then that time travel is a necessity?
I quote from an article summarizing the discoveries of Professor Michel Jouvet. Jouvet, using rapid eye movement techniques, has been able to detect dreaming in animals in the womb, even developing birds in the egg. He found that animals like calves and foals, who can fend for themselves immediately after birth, dream a lot in the womb and relatively little after that. Humans and kittens dream less in the womb and are unable to fend for themselves at birth.
He concluded that human babies could not walk or feed themselves until they had enough practice in dreams. This indicates that <span class="ReadingTextChar">the function of dreams is the train the being for future conditions. I postulate that the human artifact is biologically designed for space travel. So human dreams can be seen as training for space conditions. Deprived of this vital link with our future in space, with no reason for living, we die. </span>
<span class="ReadingTextChar">Art serves the same function as dreams. Plato’s Republic is a blueprint for a death camp. An alien invader, or domestic elite, bent on conquest and extermination, would rapidly immobilize the earth by cutting dream lines, just the way we took care of the Indians.</span> I quote from Black Elk Speaks by John Neihardt (Pocket Books):
“<span class="ReadingTextChar">The nation’s hoop is broken and scattered like a ring of smoke. There is no center any more. The sacred tree is dead and all its birds are gone.”</span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn2|[2]]]</span>
Finally,
<span class="ReadingTextChar">However the cut-up alone only shows us the door. To achieve immortality we must be prepared to take a step into the unknown. Burroughs’ //Immortality// represents the moment when ART LEAVES THE FRAME </span>AND MAPS ITSELF ONTO THE WORLd. this implosion of the boundry between realtiy and fiction unwrites STATIC NOTIONS OF TRUTH PERPETUATED BY THE MASTERS AND COLONIZERS.

<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Murphy 97</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Timothy S., U of CA, “Wising Up The Marks: The Amodern William Burroughs”)</span>
<span class="ReadingTextChar">Burroughs's literary career is defined by the</span> central <span class="ReadingTextChar">challenge</span> he sets himself: <span class="ReadingTextChar">to find an escape route from the linked control systems of capital, subjectivity, and language.</span> His early novels, from Junky (J, 1953) to Naked Lunch (NL, 1959), address the accelerating dialectic of capitalist control of American society, a form of control that functions by transforming the individual into the "addict agent" who is the mirror image of the controller. These novels also articulate a critique of the "administered life" that parallels Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment. He examines the reversibility of hostile social relations and the symmetry of opposed political factions, and he articulates his theory that language, which is a virus that uses the human body as a host, constitutes the most powerful form of control. In these works Burroughs, like Horkheimer and Adorno, cannot yet imagine a form of revolutionary practice to counter these forms of control; <span class="ReadingTextChar">society appears trapped between the horns of capitalism's constitutive dialectic, which liquidates the singularity of the individual as well as the connections of community in order to produce the false universality of profit.</span> As Burroughs writes later, money "eats quality and shits out quantity" (Burroughs and Odier 74), a situation that the writer cannot change but can only reveal. These works constitute what we might call the modernist subset of his writing. In the aleatory Nova trilogy (196167), however, Burroughs recognizes the sterile form of the dialectic itself as his primary enemy and attempts to escape it by destroying the linguistic control system of syntax and by simultaneously abolishing the dialectical form of the Law. All of his subsequent texts can be understood as increasingly systematic and sophisticated attempts to evade the dialectic, which continually returns in unexpected forms to reinscribe Burroughs's revolutionary enterprise within despotic capital and language; in this, Burroughs's development quite strongly resembles that of Deleuze. 6 In their formal and thematic focus on language, however, the novels of the trilogy abet the postmodern turn away from historical potential and toward structural foreclosure. The "cut-up" experiments eventually lead him out of the cynicism of the Nova trilogy's reflexive postmodernism, however, and toward a renewed commitment to social change; in The Wild Boys and his recent works, Burroughs seeks ways to organize resistance to the new forms of control in the construction of revolutionary fantasies that can produce new social groups. In The Wild Boys (WB, 1971), these countercultural fantasies are still conceived as dialectically destructive forces that negate the given social order but refuse to offer new forms of social organization; thus their failure, like the failure of the radical student movements that inspired them, follows from the persistence of the dialectic. The trilogy Cities of the Red Night (C), The Place of Dead Roads (P), and The Western Lands (WL; 198187) continues this destructive task, but it also offers affirmative ways to reorganize society in order to avoid the powerful dialectics of social and linguistic control. Such reorganization, finally, necessitates a change of terrain for Burroughs's work. He concludes The Western Lands with the admission that "he had reached the end of words, the end of what can be done with words. And then?" (WL 258) The open question suggests that something more is still to be done once language is abandoned. Deleuze uses very similar terms to describe what he sees as the task of revolutionary literature: "This modern literature uncovers a 'strange language within language' and, through an unlimited number of superimposed grammatical constructions, tends towards an atypical form of expression that marks the end of language as such (here we may cite such examples as Mallarmé's book, . . . Artaud's breaths, the agrammaticality of Cummings, Burroughs and his cut-ups and fold-ins, as well as [Raymond] Roussel's proliferations . . . and so on)."7__<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The labor of eliminating the dialectic, and with the dialectic its handmaidens language, capital</span>____<span style="font-size: 11pt;">,</span>__ __<span style="font-size: 12pt;">and the human subject</span>__ __<span style="font-size: 12pt;">must take us into different realms</span>__; accordingly, this study will conclude by tracing the extension of Burroughs's literary project into film and recording to suggest what can happen after "the end of words." This entire project is contained, potentially, in Burroughs's proclamation that "Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted." This phrase is his famous battle-cry against social and personal control, a slogan explicitly cribbed from the legendary Ismâ'îlî holy man-cum-terrorist Hassan i Sabbah. The phrase is quoted in most of Burroughs's books from the Nova trilogy onward, and it serves to conclude the "Invocation" that opens his most recent trilogy (C xviii). In the 1989 text "Apocalypse" (written as the introduction to a Keith Haring exhibition catalog and read by Burroughs on his first compact disc, Dead City Radio), Burroughs offers his own gloss on the phrase:
<span class="ReadingTextChar">Consider an apocalyptic statement: "Nothing is true, everything is permitted"</span>Hassan i Sabbah, the Old Man of the Mountain. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Not to be interpreted as an invitation to</span> all manner of <span class="ReadingTextChar">unrestrained</span> and <span class="ReadingTextChar">destructive behavior</span>; that would be a minor episode, which would run its course. <span class="ReadingTextChar">Everything is permitted because nothing is true. It is all make-believe, illusion, dream, art. When art leaves the frame, and the written word leaves the page, not merely the physical frame and page, but the frames and pages of assigned categories, a basic disruption of reality occurs. The literal realization of art. Success will write "apocalypse" across the sky. </span> It is a question of causality and condition: if something is true, then something else must be maligned and prohibited by the Law as false, but<span class="ReadingTextChar"> if nothing is true</span> - which is to say if there is no such thing as essential truth - <span class="ReadingTextChar">then there can be no prohibition, no Law, and everything is permitted. And it is permitted precisely in the form of creative art, whose only condition and referent is itself. The "basic disruption of reality"</span> which Burroughs demands is neither the modern disruption of traditional structures of value, nor the postmodern disruption of modernist mythologizing; rather, it <span class="ReadingTextChar">is the "literal realization of art," a realization which simultaneously requires the destruction of art as a separate category, as a mirror to nature and life. "[A]rt leaves the frame, and the written word leaves the page" in order to change material reality, not by asserting some essential truth that they alone could preserve against the ideological falsity of reality, but by multiplying and disseminating the creative power of the false, the untrue, the forgery.</span> Art is falsehood or lie because it does not find its proof outside itself, through a process of truthful representation, but within itself, as Friedrich Nietzsche and Oscar Wilde argued. In much the same spirit, Deleuze specifies that <span class="ReadingTextChar">the apocalyptic project of art is "not simply to eliminate fiction but to free it from the model of truth which penetrates it, and on the contrary to rediscover the pure and simple story-telling function </span>[fonction de fabulation] which is opposed to this model. <span class="ReadingTextChar">What is opposed to fiction is not the real; it is not the truth which is always that of the masters or colonizers, it is the story-telling of the poor, in so far as it gives the false the power which makes it into a memory, a legend or a monster"</span> (Deleuze, Cinema-2150). <span class="ReadingTextChar">Such a memory or monster acts as a catalyst that precipitates a fused, revolutionary force out of the atomized subjects of oppression. </span>This powerful story-telling or fabulatory function is the goal to which Burroughs in his novels and Deleuze in his philosophy spire.
