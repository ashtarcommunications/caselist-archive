===1ac plan=== 
The President of the United States should issue an executive order to substantially increase transportation infrastructure loans in the United States commensurate with establishment of an independent government-owned National Infrastructure Bank.


===1ac growth=== 

Advantage One is Growth:

Slow growth will persist now – only creating an NIB before pursuing deficit reduction can increase growth rates and insulate the economy from crisis in Europe and China
Schwenninger 10-29 (Sherle R. Schwenninger, Director, Economic Growth Program and American Strategy Program, and co-founder, New America Foundation, founding editor of World Policy Journal, and Senior Fellow at the World Policy Institute, former Senior Program Coordinator for the Project on Development, Trade, and International Finance at the Council on Foreign Relations, “The Missing Economic Debate,” The Nation, 10-29-2012, http://newamerica.net/publications/articles/2012/the_missing_economic_debate_72715)
Barack Obama and Mitt Romney agree on at least one thing: that this election
AND
of a major public investment program for creating jobs and supporting stronger growth.

Alternative mechanisms fail
Cooper 9-12 (Donna Cooper, Senior Fellow with the Economic Policy team at the Center for American Progress, former deputy mayor for policy for the city of Philadelphia, former secretary of policy and planning for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; Kristina Costa, Research Assistant in Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress; Keith Miller, intern with the Economic Policy team at the Center for American Progress, student at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute; “Creating a National Infrastructure Bank and Infrastructure Planning Council: How Better Planning and Financing Options Can Fix Our Infrastructure and Improve Economic Competitiveness,” Center for American Progress, September 2012, [[http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/InfrastructureBankReport.pdf]])
Infrastructure forms the foundation of the U.S. economy. Without highways,
AND
past time for us to stop neglecting the very foundation of our economy.


Slow growth makes nuclear conflict and all transnational threats more likely
Silk 93 (Leonard Silk, Distinguished Professor of Economics at Pace University, Senior Research Fellow at the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and former Economics Columnist with the New York Times, “Dangers of Slow Growth,” Foreign Affairs, 72(1), 1992/1993, pp.167-182, JSTOR)
Global Productivity's Long Decline ¶ Slow growth of the world economy and rising unemployment in
AND
countries has become vital to the economic well-being of all nations.



===1ac elections=== 

Advantage Two is Elections:
Obama will win – consensus of statistical models, polls, and betting markets
Nyhan 10-30 (Brendan Nyhan, assistant professor of government, Dartmouth College, Ph.D. political science, Duke University, “Pundits versus probabilities,” Columbia Journalism Review, 10-29-2012, http://www.cjr.org/swing_states_project/pundits_versus_probabilities.php)
Who will win the presidential election next Tuesday? Until recently, the market for
AND
bettors translate that evidence into probabilities, not with Silver or his methods.

And, structural advantages like electoral college, ground game and demographics
Schultz 10-28 (David Schultz, Professor, School of Business, Hamline University, Senior Fellow at the Institute on Law and Politics, University of Minnesota Law School, “The Road to the White House: How Obama could lose it,” 10-28-2012, http://schultzstake.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-road-to-white-house-how-obama-could.html)
From a political science perspective Obama is strategically positioned to win the presidency on November
AND
economy over the last weekend where the news will key in on that.

Passing an infrastructure bank gives him an economic mandate – perceived as prioritizing job creation over austerity
Jones 12 (Forrest Jones, citing Robert Reich, economist, former U.S. Secretary of Labor, and professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, “Reich: Obama’s Campaign Message Falling Short,” Money News, 4-23-2012, http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/Reich-Obama-Campaign-Message/2012/04/23/id/436699)
President Barack Obama can lose to likely challenger Mitt Romney if he sticks with his
AND
Buffett who championed the idea, failed to push through in the Senate.

Only Obama using executive power to bypass GoP obstructionism in Congress allows Democrats to win – presents a contrast between Democratic and Republican lawmaking
Savage 12 (Charlie Savage, NYT reporter, Shift on Executive Power Lets Obama Bypass Rivals, 4/22/12, http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/us/politics/shift-on-executive-powers-let-obama-bypass-congress.html?pagewanted=all)//RD
One Saturday last fall, President Obama interrupted a White House strategy meeting to raise
AND
and not exercise all the powers that have accrued to it over time.”


No risk of offense – any backlash merely helps re-election
The Nation 11 (editors, “Go Big, Mr. President,” 9-7-2011, [[http://www.thenation.com/article/163179/go-big-mr-president]])
In the wake of a grim August jobs report showing zero job creation, and
AND
If Republicans are against this, it becomes fodder for the 2012 election.


This contrast is the ONLY way to capitalize on both the popularity of job-creating investments in transportation infrastructure and the unpopularity of obstruction
Poole 12 (Isaiah Poole, Campaign for America’s Future, “Jobs Report: Challenge Congress to Act, Obama to Fight,” Nation of Change, 7-7-2012, [[http://www.nationofchange.org/jobs-report-challenge-congress-act-obama-fight-1341639797]])
Today's unemployment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will be closely watched for its
AND
reward only lies in support of an authentic middle-class jobs agenda.

And, it’s the only way to frame the election as a referendum on Congress’ record – key to translate popular policies into Congressional seats
Rothenberg 12 (Stuart Rothenberg, editor, Rothenberg Political Report, “Toxic Congress: Dose of Electoral Uncertainty,” Roll Call, 1-20-2012, http://www.rollcall.com/features/Welcome-Back-Congress_2012/welcome_back/toxic-congress-dose-of-electoral-uncertainty-211631-1.html)
Earlier this year, a CBS News poll showed Congress’ job approval at 12 percent
AND
, by contrasting his performance with Congress’. Just don’t bet on it.

This is the only strategy which can win over working-class whites – specifically key to post-election agenda
Teixeira 8-21 (Ruy Teixeira, “Obama’s White Working Class Problem, and Ours,” The New Republic, 8-21-2012, http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/106370/obama-isnt-the-only-candidate-whos-got-problems-the-white-working-class)
As has been widely noted, Obama’s weakest voter group by far is the white
AND
gets re-elected, will continue to be the white working class.

Mandate is key to Obama’s leverage in deficit reduction negotiations – all other election outcomes end in gridlock
Becker 9-21 (Bernie Becker and Erik Wasson, “GOP fears reelected Obama would have the upper hand on taxes,” The Hill, 9-21-2012, http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/domestic-taxes/251095-gop-fears-reelected-obama-would-have-leverage-to-raise-taxes)
House Republicans are increasingly concerned that a victory by President Obama in November would back
AND
LaTourette, who has also pushed back against Norquist’s no-tax pledge.

Specifically, campaigning on the infrastructure bank is key – Obama needs a strong bargaining position to prevent delay and push his plan for deficit reduction
Newmyer 9-3 (Tory Newmyer, writer, Fortune Magazine, “Obama: A president ready for a showdown,” Fortune, 9-3-2012, online 8-16-2012, http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/16/obama-election-economy/)
President Obama started his first term with a bang, simultaneously engineering an auto industry
AND
than conciliation -- and we won't have to wait long to find out.

That’s key to adopt a deterrence posture which can accommodate inevitable post-hegemonic transition – sooner rather than later is key to prevent multiple scenarios for nuclear conflict
Kallberg & Lowther 8-20 (Dr. Jan Kallberg, assistant professor in Homeland Security at Arkansas Tech University and a researcher at Cyber Security Research and Educational Center, Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas; and Dr. Adam B. Lowther, member of the faculty at the U.S. Air Force's Air University; “The Return of Dr. Strangelove,” The Diplomat, 8-20-2012, http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/20/the-return-of-dr-strangelove/?all=true)
How fiscal austerity will push the United States towards nuclear arms and cyber-warfare
AND
will depend upon the United States realizing its position sooner rather than later.

Independently, delay guts the effectiveness of nuclear posture – budget uncertainty triggers deterrence failures in the face of current proliferators
McCorkle 12 (Sherman McCorkle, President and Chief Executive Officer of Technology Ventures Corporation, member of the Technology Triangle Advisory Board, Founder and Charter Director of New Mexico Bank & Trust, Honors Graduate of the Colorado Graduate School of Banking at the University of Colorado, “Budget Dithering Puts U.S. Defense System in Jeopardy,” Albuquerque Journal Online Edition, 7-22-2012, [[http://www.abqjournal.com/main/2012/07/22/opinion/budget-dithering-puts-us-defense-system-in-jeopardy.html]])
The administration and Congress are playing chicken with our national security. The refusal to

. The administration and Congress must act to avoid the harm of sequestration.


==NIB - round 1 - umich== 

new elections 1ac cards - otherwise same as UMich RR

Obama will win – models, polls, and momentum – assumes your warrants
Silver 11-2 (Nate Silver, statistician and political analyst, editor of FiveThirtyEight.com, accurately predicted 49 of 50 states in the 2008 presidential election, named one of the World’s 100 Most Influential People in 2009 by Time Magazine, studied at the London School of Economics, A.B. economics, University of Chicago, former high school debater, “Nov. 1: The Simple Case for Saying Obama Is the Favorite,” November 2, 2012, [[http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/nov-1-the-simple-case-for-saying-obama-is-the-favorite/]] //RD)
If you are following some of the same people that I do on Twitter,
AND
the polls, but simplicity is on its side, in this case.

Structural advantages like better swing-state campaigning, ground game and demographics provide a firewall against unexpected losses – but only attracting more white working-class voters can boost his margin of victory
Metzler 11-1 (Rebekah Metzler, “Path to Victory: How Obama Wins,” U.S. News & World Report, 11-1-2012, http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/ballot-2012/2012/11/01/path-to-victory-how-obama-wins)
President Barack Obama is on the verge of winning re-election in what will

==NIC aff - round 2 - NFLs== 

===1ac plan=== 

The President of the United States should issue an executive order substantially increasing national infrastructure planning council and bundling entity transportation infrastructure investment in the United States.


===1ac intermodality=== 


Advantage 1 is intermodality

Transportation infrastructure is collapsing due to systematic underinvestment and lack of rigorous evaluation methods
American Society of Civil Engineers 13 (American Society of Civil Engineers, oldest engineering society in America, “Executive Summary,” 2013, http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/a/#p/overview/executive-summary)//RDa
Every family, every community and every business needs infrastructure to thrive. Infrastructure encompasses
AND
reality – an American infrastructure system that is the source of our prosperity.

Only the plan overcomes the institutional and political barriers to intermodality
Cooper 9-12 (Donna Cooper, Senior Fellow with the Economic Policy team at the Center for American Progress, former deputy mayor for policy for the city of Philadelphia, former secretary of policy and planning for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; Kristina Costa, Research Assistant in Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress; Keith Miller, intern with the Economic Policy team at the Center for American Progress, student at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute; “Creating a National Infrastructure Bank and Infrastructure Planning Council: How Better Planning and Financing Options Can Fix Our Infrastructure and Improve Economic Competitiveness,” Center for American Progress, September 2012, [[http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/InfrastructureBankReport.pdf]])
Infrastructure forms the foundation of the U.S. economy. Without highways,
AND
past time for us to stop neglecting the very foundation of our economy.

Intermodality is key to supply chain effectiveness
Jackson 7 (Colonel Donald E. Jackson, Jr., United States Army, M.A. Strategic Studies, U.S. Army War College, USAWC Strategy Research Project, “Leveraging the Strategic Value of the U.S. Inland Waterway System,” 3-30-2007, http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a469583.pdf)
Finally, effectively integrating the capabilities of road, rail, and waterway maximizes the
AND
bottlenecks, focusing resources to developmental infrastructure at¶ existing intermodal connectors.47

Effective intermodal supply chains are key to logistics ((rapid deployment and effective sustainment)) – vital to deterrence
USMA 9 (U.S. Maritime Administration, “America’s Ports and Intermodal Transportation System,” January 2009, http://www.mtsnac.org/docs/2009/America's%20Ports%20and%20Intermodal%20Transportation%20System%20(Jan%2009).pdf)
The lifeblood of America’s economy passes through our ports – everyday, trains, trucks
AND
at the port and the economic security of our homeland are inextricably linked.

Effective logistics is key to conventional deterrence – uniquely prevents conflict initiation and escalation
--local conventional balance of power trumps global or threat of nuclear use (i.e. troops key)
Gerson 9 (Michael S. Gerson, research analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses, “Conventional Deterrence in the Second Nuclear Age,” Parameters, Autumn 2009, http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/parameters/Articles/09autumn/gerson.pdf)
Deterrence is once again a topic of discussion and debate among US defense and policy
AND
retaliate. The pertinent question is how costly that response will be.47

===1ac adaptation=== 

Advantage 2 is adaptation:

Federal leadership on climate adaptation is lacking – the plan is key to coordination and effectiveness
Cooper 12-12 (Donna Cooper, Senior Fellow with the Economic Policy team at the Center for American Progress, former deputy mayor for policy for the city of Philadelphia, former secretary of policy and planning for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; “Cooper: Sandy shows that we need a national infrastructure council,” Newsday, 12-24-2012, http://www.newsday.com/opinion/oped/cooper-sandy-shows-that-we-need-a-national-infrastructure-council-1.4371892)
Two of the nation's most powerful governors, New York Gov. Andrew M.
AND
now and establish as its first charge the support of Secretary Donovan's efforts.

And, transportation is key – the only sector private investors won’t adapt on their own
Neumann 9 (James Neumann, Principal, Industrial Economics, Incorporated, “Adaptation to Climate Change: Revisiting Infrastructure Norms,” Resources for the Future, Issue Brief 09<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span>15, December 2009, http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/RFF-IB-09-15.pdf)
Policy Recommendations¶ The main threats presented by climate change to infrastructure assets include damage

National leadership is key to spur pro-active adaptation – re-active measures fail
Repetto 8 (Robert Repetto, senior fellow of the United Nations Foundation, former professor of Economics and Sustainable Development, School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, Yale University, former associate professor in economics and public health, Harvard University, former vice president of the World Resources Institute, “The Climate Crisis and the Adaptation Myth,” Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, Working Paper Number 13, Fall 2008, http://www.climateneeds.umd.edu/pdf/ClimateCrisisAdaptationMyth.pdf)
Despite a half century of climate change that has significantly affected temperature¶ and precipitation
AND
to climate change does not imply that the¶ United States will adapt.

Proactive analysis-based infrastructure adaptation uniquely prevents warming-driven conflicts
King 12 (Dr. Marcus King, research analyst, Center for Naval Analyses Environment and Energy Team, adjunct professor of environmental security and globalization planning fellow, Office of the President, Georgetown University, former research director of the Sustainable Energy Instistute, former member of the U.S. delegation for the negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol, Ph.D. and MALD degrees in international relations from the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a BS in Foreign Service from Georgetown University, “Climate Change Adaptation and National Security,” World Resources Report, 2012, http://www.worldresourcesreport.org/responses/climate-change-adaptation-and-national-security-0)
I largely agree with the authors who find that current decision-making practices used
AND
assessment techniques familiar to the national security community may play a significant role.

Can happen any time and go nuclear
Read 9 (Peter Read, Center for Energy Research, Massey University, New Zealand, “22: Policy to Address the Threat of Dangerous Climate Change: A Leading Role for Biochar,” in Biochar for Environmental Management: Science and Technology, eds. Johannes Lehmann and Stephen Joseph, 2009, p.393-394, googlebook)
The tipping point threat The fact that anthropogenic climate change is occurring is no longer
AND
multilateral environmental agreements and of the Millennium Development Goals (L’N, 2005).

Reactionary adaptation triggers ecological collapse and extinction – effective planning is key
Walsh 10 (Bryan Walsh, senior writer and former Tokyo bureau chief for Time magazine, covering energy and the environment, “Climate Change: How Adapting to Warming Could Make It Worse,” Time, 8-5-2010, http://science.time.com/2010/08/05/climate-change-how-adapting-to-warming-could-make-it-worse/)
Positive feedback cycles—they’re what keeps climatologists up at night. The term describes
AND
us live to fight another day—or simply lead to greater catastrophe.

===1ac plan=== 

The United States federal government should substantially increase transportation infrastructure loans in the United States provided by an independent, government-owned National Infrastructure Bank.

===1ac investment=== 

Advantage 1 is investment

Two scenarios: first is austerity

Fiscal austerity in the face of slowing economic recovery creates long term slow growth
Gongloff – chief financial writer at the Huffington Post 6-6-13 (Mark Gongloff, chief financial writer, Huffington Post, former reporter, Wall Street Journal and CNN/Money, “Austerity To Cost U.S. Economy 2 Million Jobs By 2019: Study,” 6-6-2013, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/06/austerity-us-economy_n_3397586.html)
Austerity isn't just hurting the U.S. economy right now -- the damage
AND
and factories will continue to wither, and our future along with it.

Only plan solves
Marshall President of the Progressive Policy Institute 4-25-13 (Will Marshall, President and Founder, Progressive Policy Institute, “'Cut and Invest' vs. Austerity,” 4-25-2013, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/will-marshall/austerity-obama-budget_b_3117732.html)
President Obama's new budget attempts to define a progressive alternative to conservative demands for a
AND
. and European progressives build economies big enough to support their social aspirations.

Otherwise, continued slow growth makes multiple scenarios for global conflict inevitable
Duncan former financial sector specialist at the World Bank 12 (Richard Duncan, chief economist at Blackhorse Asset Management, former financial sector specialist at the World Bank, global head of investment strategy at ABN AMRO Asset Management, studied literature and economics at Vanderbilt University and international finance at Babson College, Chapter 8, in The New Depression: The Breakdown of the Paper Money Economy, 2-24-2012, googlebook)
And This Time? What, then, would be the consequences should the world
AND
is invulnerable to a similar fate. This crisis should not be underestimated.


Second is foreign direct investment:


Inbound FDI is low and falling – investors are sitting on the sidelines
Larson at Agence France Presse 1-24-13 (Nina Larson, Agence France Presse, “Global FDI plunges 18% in 2012, developing nations take investment lead — UN agency,” 1-24-2013, http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/291714/economy/business/global-fdi-plunges-18-in-2012-developing-nations-take-investment-lead-un-agency)
Developing countries overtook their traditionally wealthier counterparts in attracting foreign direct investment for the first
AND
pre-crisis level of some $2.0 trillion in investments.

That’s because of perceived political risk – the plan is key to signal commitment and overcome information and expertise
Lynch the senior consultant at Woods Bagot global firm 10-18-12 (Matthew Lynch, senior consultant, leads global research team at Woods Bagot, global architecture firm, adjunct professor at Melbourne University, former professor at Columbia University, “Private investment key to social infrastructure,” 10-18-2012, [[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_T9AvWuAh9wJ:blog.woodsbagot.com/2012/10/18/private-investment-key-to-social-infrastructure/+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us]])
** “SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE” IS ACTUALLY REFERRING TO TRANSPORTATION – SEE ALL EXAMPLES USED**
The ROI proposition of social infrastructure development is solid. The EDHEC-Risk Institute
AND
this will be dependent on future market transparency and decreasing perceived political risk.

Increasing FDI via the bank is key to economic alliance-building with BRICS economies
Hormats Secretary for Economic, Energy, and Agricultural Affairs for the US department of State 10 (Robert D. Hormats, Under Secretary for Economic, Energy and Agricultural Affairs, U.S. Department of State, “New Patterns of Investment in the Global Economy: Implications for U.S. Leadership,” Peterson Institute for International Economics, 10-6-2010, http://www.state.gov/e/rls/rmk/2010/149187.htm)
It is a great pleasure for me to be here at the Peterson Institute today
AND
all actively engaged in explaining the attractions of investment in the United States.

That solves extinction – makes inevitable post-heg transition smooth
Aliu strategy expert at the Institute for Political Sciences at Heidelberg University 12 (Armando Aliu, strategy expert and DAAD Scholar at the Institute for Political Sciences, Heidelberg University, “The BRICs Hegemony In A Post-American World Era – Analysis,” Eurasia Review, 3-5-2012, http://www.eurasiareview.com/05032012-the-brics-hegemony-in-a-post-american-world-era-analysis/)
The Grand Strategy of the United States has been shaped between of Isolationism / Parochialism
AND
transforming problems to opportunities in favour of states’ sustainable development and incremental growth.



===1ac intermodality=== 


Advantage 2 is intermodality
The American transportation system relies on connecting different modes of transportation such as ships, planes, trains and trucks. These connections, known as intermodal connectors, are collapsing.

American Society of Civil Engineers Report Card, released in March 2013, reports that America’s infrastructure is failing across the board (American Society of Civil Engineers, oldest engineering society in America, “Executive Summary,” 2013, http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/a/#p/overview/executive-summary)//RDa
Every family, every community and every business needs infrastructure to thrive. Infrastructure encompasses

==Critiques== 

===Zupancic=== 

Their appeal displaces a personal ethical obligation onto the state – the question becomes not how we can change ourselves but rather how we can change our institutions in order to change ourselves – divorces social responsibility from social location
Philippe ‘4 (Cecile philippe holds a doctorate in economics from the University Paris-Dauphine and a desuper in business management in developing countries and is executive director of molinari economic institute-a think tank on economy in policy. “Precautionary principle is a non-starter”. June 6, 2004. [[http://www.institutmolinari.org/editos/20040713.htm]])
It was rather a surprise to see the right wing parties in the “Assemblée
AND
are no longer connected, thereby substituting the precautionary principle to natural caution.


This orientation makes ethics impossible and violence inevitable – externalizing ethics onto institutions exonerates individuals of responsibility for their relationship with the other which is a prerequisite to the worst forms of institutional violence
Rozo ‘4 (Diego Rozo, M.A. Philosophy and Cultural Analysis, Forgiving the Unforgivable: On Violence, Power, and the Possibility of Justice, 2004, p.19-21)
Within the legal order the relations between individuals will resemble this logic where suffering is
AND
– the law infiltrates into and seeks to rule our most private conflicts.


Ethics is a personal decision – institutionalization to compel moral action obviates any personal choice, negating any ethical value to their advocacy
Thurschwell 3 (Adam Thurschwell, Asst. Prof. of Law, Cleveland State University. 24 Cardozo L. Rev 1193 l/n)
[*1202] Thus, as Deriida puts it, “ethics enjoins a politics

Dennis Fox (Emeritus Associate Professor, Legal Studies University of Illinois at Springfield) 1991 "Law Against Social Change" http://www.dennisfox.net/papers/law-against.html
Third, and most important, the very success of legal solutions makes things worse
AND
are not capable of being good unless we are forced to be good.

And risks genocide – surrendering to the ethical state precludes individual responsibility to make moral choices – this is the same dynamic which has empirically enabled mass murder
Zupancic 2000 (Alenka, Researcher, Institute of Philosophy, Ljubljana, Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, March, pg.96-97)
Another problem still remains, however: the question of the possibility
AND
as something that is ‘essentially by-product’ of our actions.

The U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM), The National League of Cities (NLC) and the National Association of Counties (NACo) today called on Congress and the Administration to reject any proposals to hamstring the financing of local infrastructure projects by changing the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds. <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Municipal bonds provide </span>a low-cost and efficient way for cities and counties to finance much of America's <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">critical infrastructure</span>, including schools, hospitals, airports, water and sewer systems, and roads and bridges.¶ During a roundtable at the National Press Club held for reporters by mayors, county and local leaders of all three non-partisan organizations released a report (http://www.nlc.org/Documents/Influence%20Federal%20Policy/Advocacy/Legislative/bonds-report-feb2013.pdf) to highlight the broad use of municipal bonds in more than thirty locales around the country. Municipal bonds are <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the</span> country's <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">most important source of financing for vital infrastructure</span> and are used to finance everything from multibillion transportation projects to school expansions in communities large and small.¶ "Municipal bonds are essential financing tools used by mayors and local officials in their communities," said USCM Vice President Mesa, AZ Mayor Scott Smith. "Municipal bonds allow communities to build the streets, bridges, water lines, and police and fire stations that not only serve the needs of citizens, but also create jobs and <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">drive the economy.</span> Without them, our communities will suffer."¶ The joint report also shows in the last decade, state and local governments financed over $1.65 trillion of infrastructure investment using tax-exempt bonds – nearly all in just six categories:¶ •$514 billion in primary and secondary schools;¶ •$288 billion in hospitals; ¶ •$258 billion in water and sewer facilities;¶ •$178 billion in roads, highways and streets;¶ •$147 billion in public power projects and;¶ •$106 billion in mass transit.¶ If the proposed 28-percent cap had been in effect during that time, the borrowing costs to states and localities of these bonds would have increased by $173 billion and would have prevented many infrastructure projects from moving forward. In 2012 alone, more than 6,600 tax-exempt municipal bonds financed over $179 billion worth of infrastructure projects – the bulk of which were primary and secondary education, water and sewer facilities, and hospitals.¶ Of the cap proposal, NACo President Chris Rodgers, Commissioner, Douglas County, Nebraska said, "Counties build, maintain and pay for much of America's infrastructure including schools, roads, water and sewer systems, airports, bridges and hospitals. Counties own and maintain 44 percent of the nation's roadways, 228,026 bridges and almost one third of the nation's transit systems and airports. Counties own 964 hospitals and 677 nursing homes. <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Tax-exempt municipal bonds are the single most important tool </span>that counties use<span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> for financing </span>our <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">critical infrastructure</span>. Any change to the taxation status of often voter-approved debt issued by counties risks local public works projects that benefit communities and puts into question the nature of the U.S. federalist partnership."¶ In effect, the 28 percent cap on tax-exempt interest would be borne almost exclusively by state and local governments in the form of higher interest rates on their borrowing. Market analysts have estimated that this proposed tax on municipal bond interest would raise state and local borrowing costs by up to 70 basis points (0.70 percentage point) or more. Because the tax would apply not only to new state and local borrowing, but also to all outstanding bonds, investors would be taxed on investment which they reasonably expected would be tax-exempt as long as they are outstanding -- an unprecedented form of retroactive taxation.¶ "Talk of eliminating the tax exemption on municipal bonds is more about politics—on both sides—than economics," says NLC representative Houston City Controller Ronald Green. "No one can argue about how cities, counties and states have utilized municipal bonds to great effect to finance their capital projects such as roads and highways, water projects, schools, libraries, fire stations and, while doing this, saving on interest costs with tax exempt 'muni' bonds. The yield from taxable bonds—if that was the only option for municipalities—would pale in comparison to the increased taxes residents would have to pay to fund infrastructure projects. Or, the alternative, simply to postpone needed projects."¶ Finally, local leaders explained that municipal bonds represent a partnership among the federal government, state and local governments, and private investors in contributing to public infrastructure, which creates jobs and improves economic efficiency. Tax-exempt bonds maintain decision-making and project selection at the state and local level, where citizens and elected officials can best determine where needs are greatest and where investments will generate the maximum return.¶ Tim Firestine, Chief Administrative Officer for Montgomery County, MD, President-elect of the Government Finance Officers Association and NACo representative, elaborated on the impact that uncertainty would create, "Our county has about $2.1 billion of general-obligation bonds outstanding at this time, on which we pay interest of $93 million a year. Eliminating or even capping the tax exemption on investors would cause them to look for higher-yielding investments and we would have to offer more interest to lure them back. This simply drives up the county cost to local taxpayers to maintain our infrastructure. [And] the burden will be transferred to the property tax."¶ The report concludes that curtailing or <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">eliminating </span>the tax-<span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">exemption </span>would raise costs for financially strapped state and local governments, and <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">would result in less investment in infrastructure, </span>particularly at a time <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">when</span> jobs are scarce and the physical state of public works and <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">infrastructure is deteriorating</span>.

But the real kicker in all this is that the power grid will be destroyed nearly everywhere. What happens when there's no electricity? Imagine a world without electricity. Even for just a week. Imagine New York City with no electricity, or Los Angeles, or Sao Paulo. Within 72 hours, most cities around the world will devolve into total chaos, complete with looting, violent crime, and runaway fires. But that's not even the bad news. Even if all the major cities of the world burned to the ground for some other reason, humanity could still recover because it has the farmlands: the soils, the seeds, and the potential to recover, right? And yet the real crisis here stems from the realization that <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">once there is no power grid, all the nuclear power plants</span> of the world suddenly go into "emergency mode" and are forced to rely on their on-site emergency power backups to circulate coolants and prevent nuclear meltdowns from occurring. And yet, as we've already established, these facilities typically <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have only a few hours</span> of battery power available, followed by perhaps a few days worth of diesel fuel to run their generators (or propane, in some cases). Did I also mention that half the people who work at nuclear power facilities have no idea what they're doing in the first place? Most of the veterans who really know the facilities inside and out have been forced into retirement due to reaching their lifetime limits of on-the-job radiation exposure, so most of the workers at nuclear facilities right now are newbies who really have no clue what they're doing. There are 440 nuclear power plants operating across 30 countries around the world today. There are an additional 250 so-called "research reactors" in existence, making a total of roughly 700 nuclear reactors to be dealt with (http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/i...). Now imagine the scenario: You've got a massive solar flare that knocks out the world power grid and destroys the majority of the power grid transformers, thrusting the world into darkness. Cities collapse into chaos and rioting, martial law is quickly declared (but it hardly matters), and every nation in the world is on full emergency. But that doesn't solve the really big problem, which is that you've got 700 nuclear reactors that can't feed power into the grid (because all the transformers are blown up) and yet simultaneously have to be fed a steady stream of emergency fuels to run the generators the keep the coolant pumps functioning. How long does the coolant need to circulate in these facilities to cool the nuclear fuel? Months. This is also the lesson of Fukushima: You can't cool nuclear fuel in mere hours or days. It takes months to bring these nuclear facilities to a state of cold shutdown. And that means in order to avoid a multitude of Fukushima-style meltdowns from occurring around the world, you need to truck diesel fuel, generator parts and nuclear plant workers to every nuclear facility on the planet, ON TIME, every time, without fail, for months on end. Now remember, this must be done in the middle of the total chaos breakdown of modern civilization, where there is no power, where law enforcement and emergency services are totally overrun, where people are starving because food deliveries have been disrupted, and when looting and violent crime runs rampant in the streets of every major city in the world. Somehow, despite all this, you have to run these diesel fuel caravans to the nuclear power plants and keep the pumps running. Except there's a problem in all this, even if you assume you can somehow work a logistical miracle and actually deliver the diesel fuel to the backup generators on time (which you probably can't). The problem is this: Where do you get diesel fuel? Why refineries will be shut down, too From petroleum refineries. Most people don't realize it, but petroleum refineries run on electricity. Without the power grid, the refineries don't produce a drop of diesel. With no diesel, there are no generators keeping the coolant running in the nuclear power facilities. But wait, you say: Maybe we could just acquire diesel from all the gas stations in the world. Pump it out of the ground, load it into trucks and use that to power the generators, right? Except there are other problems here: How do you pump all that fuel without electricity? How do you acquire all the tires and spare parts needed to keep trucks running if there's no electricity to keep the supply businesses running? How do you maintain a truck delivery infrastructure when the electrical infrastructure is totally wiped out? Some countries might be able to pull it off with some degree of success. With military escorts and the total government control over all fuel supplies, a few nations will be able to keep a few nuclear power facilities from melting down. But here's the real issue: There are 700 nuclear power facilities in the world, remember? Let's suppose that in the aftermath of a massive solar flare, the nations of the world are somehow able to control half of those facilities and nurse them into cold shutdown status. That still leaves roughly 350 nuclear facilities at risk. Now let's suppose half of those are somehow luckily offline and not even functioning when the solar flare hits, so they need no special attention. This is a very optimistic assumption, but that still leaves 175 nuclear power plants where all attempts fail. Let's be outrageously optimistic and suppose that a third of those somehow don't go into a total meltdown by some miracle of God, or some bizarre twist in the laws of physics. So we're still left with <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">115</span> nuclear power <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">plants</span> that "<span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">go Chernobyl</span>." Fukushima was one power plant. Imagine the devastation of 100+ nuclear power plants, all going into meltdown all at once across the planet. It's not the loss of electricity that's the real problem; it's <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the global tidal wave of</span> invisible <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">radiation</span> that <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">blankets the planet</span>, permeates the topsoil, irradiates everything that breathes <span style="background-color: yellow; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and delivers the final crushing blow to human civilization</span> as we know it today. Because if you have 100 simultaneous global nuclear meltdowns, the tidal wave of radiation will make farming nearly impossible for years. That means no food production for several years in a row. And that, in turn, means a near-total collapse of the human population on our planet. How many people can survive an entire year with no food from the farms? Not one in a hundred people. Even beyond that, how many people can essentially live underground and be safe enough from the radiation that they can have viable children and repopulate the planet? It's a very, very small fraction of the total population.
