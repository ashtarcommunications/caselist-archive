The regime of torture implemented in the name of the War on Terror has not ended with the Bush administration—as Guantanamo is being closed, new torture chambers such as the secret prison at Bagram Airbase in Afghanistan are being created outside all regimes of legality

__Gebauer et al__<span style="font-weight: normal;">, journalist at Der Spiefel, </span>__2009__<span style="font-weight: normal;"> [Matthias, John, Britta, “Prisoner Abuse Continues at Bagram Prison in Afghanistan,” 9/21, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,650242,00.html</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">] </span>


And despite gestures toward reform, Obama’s commitment to a contrived battlefield exception to habeas corpus has lead to secret prisons metastasizing throughout Afghanistan

Today, the tortured body of the prisoner in the dark chamber at Bagram is the most extreme example of biopolitics—here, life is totally captured by politics and the distinction between totalitarianism and democracy becomes indiscernible

And, torture is the crucial internal link between the slide from a benign biopolitics of life to necropolitical extermination of dangerous populations—torture is where biopolitics draws the line between who must be made to live and who can be left to die

Stephen Morton and Stephen Bygrave, p. 192-194] </span>


Ultimately, this slide into the dark side of biopolitics makes possible the worst forms of global violence—total warfare, genocide, and nuclear annihilation

__<span style="font-size: 16pt;">Thus </span>__

the United States federal government should close all secret detention centers in Afghanistan and remove their assigned personnel from the country.

This demand exposes the dark chambers where torture is hidden from public view—the very act of speaking out challenges the everyday logic of policymaking that relies on keeping these atrocities visible to justify violence on a global scale

__Gorelick__<span style="font-weight: normal;">, Ph.D candidate at SUNY Buffalo, </span>__2008__<span style="font-weight: normal;">, [Nathaniel, “Imaginary Renditions: Terror, Torture and the Possibility of an Excessive Ethics in Literature,” //Theory & Event// 11:2 | Project Muse] </span>


Torture must be opposed absolutely—ethics requires the rejection of any compromise between torture and the law

__Zizek__<span style="font-weight: normal;">, Senior Researcher at the Institute of Social Studies, Ljubljana, </span>__2002__<span style="font-weight: normal;"> [Slavoj, //Welcome to the Desert of the Real!//, p. 102-106] </span>


Our demand against Bagram and other secret prisons is necessary to challenge the logic of exception governing black sites where prisoners are disappeared and tortured

__Keenan__<span style="font-weight: normal;">, Interim Dean and Professor of Law at Suffolk University,</span> __2009__ <span style="font-weight: normal;">[Bernard, “Secret prisons and sovereignty,” The Guardian, August 22, http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/ libertycentral/2009/aug/22/secret-prisons-bagram-sovereignty] </span>


Finally, this demand against torture interrupts the ability of the state to reproduce violence on a global scale—our act is a necessary starting point for any broader politics of progressive change
