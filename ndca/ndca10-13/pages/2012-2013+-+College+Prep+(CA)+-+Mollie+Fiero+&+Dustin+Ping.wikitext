<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 17.3333px;">The impact is extinction, the refusal to engage in traditional politics is an abdication of social responsibility that makes social crises inevitable</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">The decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century America poses a series of great dilemmas and challenges. Many ideological currents are scrutinized here – localism, metaphysics, spontaneism, post-modernism, Deep Ecology – intersect with and reinforce each other. While these currents have deep origins in popular movements of the 1960s and 1970s, they remain very much alive in the 1990s. Despite their different outlooks and trajectories, they all share one thing in common: a depoliticized expression of struggles to combat and overcome alienation. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved – perhaps even unrecognized – only to fester more ominously in the future</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">And such problems (ecological crisis, poverty, urban decay, spread of infectious diseases</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">, technological displacement of workers) cannot be understood outside the larger social and //<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">global</span>// context of internationalized markets, finance, and communications. Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or sidestep these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impotence. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to the increasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions. 74 In the meantime, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">The unyielding truth is that, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the United States, it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">This last point demands further elaboration. The shrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehow disappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people’s lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact befilled by authoritarian and reactionary elites – an already familiar dynamic in many lesser-developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world,not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 8px;">. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a //<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow';">reassertion</span>// of politics in more virulent guise – or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collective interests that had vanished from civil society. 75</span>
