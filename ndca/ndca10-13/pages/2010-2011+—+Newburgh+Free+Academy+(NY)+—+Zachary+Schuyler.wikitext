==Affirmative== 
===Stock Affirmative=== 
I affirm.
Observation 1: Look to Consequentialism.
Nuclear weapons imagery and fear mongering associated with nuclear weapons make it a heated and passionate debate. Furthermore religions, moral systems, and ethical codes present the “truth” of the issue and cripple the topic. Jacobson explains
Lieutenant Ron G. Jacobson, United States Navy, MORALITY OF NUCLEAR DETERRENCE AND MISSILE DEFENSE, February, 1999 [[http://nsa.nps.navy.mil/Publications/]] Micewski/Contents.html
If disputable values... in morality arguments.
Therefore you should prefer a consequentialist analysis of the topic. Furthermore this is a legitimate interpretation because one definition of ought includes: “Used to indicate desirability.” (freedictionary.com)

The value premise is Global Welfare. The system of Consequentialism analyzes the risk with any given action and prompts policy makers to take the actions that maximize benefits and minimize harms. Therefore the standard should be: Maximizing Net-Benefits.
Contention 1: India/Pakistan
India and Pakistan won’t be affected by deterrence. The probability of a nuclear war between these two countries is extremely likely. Natural Resources Defense Council explains;
NRDC; “The Consequences of Nuclear Conflict between India and Pakistan”; 6/4/2002; NRDC.org; [[http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/southasia.asp]]
After India and Pakistan… tempting targets as well.



And NRDC calculates the deadliness of such an attack.
NRDC; “The Consequences of Nuclear Conflict between India and Pakistan”; 6/4/2002; NRDC.org; [[http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/southasia.asp]]
NRDC calculated that… this radius of destruction.
Any of the small confrontations between India and Pakistan could turn into a nuclear incident. Carnegie Middle East Center explains;
Joseph Cirincione and Hussein Haqqani; Joseph Cirincione is a senior associate and director of the Non-Proliferation Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Husain Haqqani, a former ambassador and advisor to Pakistani prime ministers Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, Nawaz Sharif, and Benazir Bhutto, is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment; Los Angeles Times, September 29, 2003; “Nukes Endanger Asia’s Future”;
But we can't continue… escalate into nuclear confrontation.

Contention 2: Iran
Iran acquiring nuclear weapons would destabilize the Middle East. GlobalSecurity explains;
GlobalSecurity.org; “Nuclear Weapons”; 6/29/2010; [[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/nuke.htm]]
Iran does not currently… instabilities in the region.
Note that any of these conflicts could potentially go nuclear and cause an incident.
Iran acquiring nukes would cause massive proliferation and would force Saudi Arabia to go nuclear. Kate Amlin explains;
Kate Amlin; James Martin Center for Non-proliferation Studies; Monterey Institute of International Studies; August 2008;
“Many analysts hypothesize… attack Saudi Arabia directly.” Contention 3: Nuclear Accidents
The presence of nuclear weapons means that nuclear accidents will continue to occur. David Karl explains;
David Karl, Ph.D. International Relations at the University of Southern California, “Proliferation Pessimism and Emerging Nuclear Powers,” International Security, Winter, 1996/1997, p. 111-112
Having found the superpowers’… accidents waiting to happen.

===Deontology=== 

I affirm; States ought not possess nuclear weapons.

Ought: used to express duty or moral obligation. (Dictionary.com)

Furthermore you should prefer this interpretation.
1: The resolution doesn’t interpret as “should” rather it specifically uses the term ought differentiating it from a policy resolution. The resolution thus can’t be looked towards as policy making.
2: All desirable objects are determined as such because normative objective standards. For example a diamond is better than gold because of rarity.
3: Even in the realm of international politics ethics are important.

Nye, Joseph; Sultan of Oman, Professor of International Relations, JFK School of Government, Harvard; Nuclear Ethics; 1986

<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">Philosophers often say... albeit unpleasant ones! </span>
4: Morality is the central concern to the debate on nuclear weapons.

Observation 1: is the Negative Burden. The negative must prove; If states ought possess nuclear weapons, then nuclear weapons should have been created.

1: This forces the negative to defend nuclear weapons for the initial purpose they were created. If nuclear weapons are good but they shouldn’t have been created that means they have some positive benefit but were originally intended for a bad purpose. This would prove the affirmative thesis that nuclear weapons are immoral.

2: The question of whether states ought to possess nuclear weapons is based on the assumption that nuclear weapons exist. If the assumption is proven false then nuclear weapons should not have been developed in the first place. Thus to logically prove the resolution false the negative must meet this burden.

Observation 2: The Affirmative’s Burden: The affirmative will disprove this statement by proving the contra-positive: If nuclear weapons should not have been created, then states ought not possess nuclear weapons. This means you compare the negative world to one where nuclear weapons weren’t created.

Theory standards:

-Reciprocal Burdens: The affirmative and negative burdens set up by this affirmative are fair. Fair burdens allow equal ground on each side and allows for optimal clash. This framework gives the negative and affirmative an equal chance of winning and allows for a lot of clash on the issue of whether nuclear weapons should have been created. Reciprocal burdens are key to fairness because it allows both sides an equal chance at victory and alleviates topic bias.

-Depth: The framework set-up by the affirmative allows for a deeper level of discussion by taking the topic a step further. It now analyzes the original purpose of nuclear weapons and the intention for creating them. This level of depth allows for more education, another theory voter.

Observation 3: Affirmative’s Choice: The affirmative should be allowed to choose the framework and definitions for the round.

Theory Standards:

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">-Time Skew: The affirmative has a time disadvantage when it can’t choose the framework. If you allow for the negative to choose the framework the affirmative only has four minutes to adapt to the negative’s framework. This wastes minutes of the 1ACs time and makes the 1AR horrible. Time is key to fairness because time determines a debater’s ability to make arguments and win the round. Even a period of 30 seconds could be 3-5 arguments meaning any amount of time skew is enough to vote off theory. </span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">-Strategy Skew: Without affirmative choice the negative has an unfair advantage. They can nit-pick any part of the framework and win the round. The negative can ruin the entirety of the 1AC just by changing the definition of ought. With affirmative choice the negative must take on the entirety of the affirmative, allowing some affirmative strategies to be effective. This would allow both sides an equal chance of winning the round. Strategy skew is key to fairness because it allows for affirmatives to have a fighting chance against the nit-picky negatives. This prevents negatives from winning a majority of rounds because of luck. </span>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">-Substantive Education: The “affirmative choice” method allows for more discussion on resolution relative literature. It allows the debaters to discuss nuclear weapons and its intents instead of an argument on which ethical theory would be best to evaluate nuclear weapons with one or two mentions of nuclear weapons. Substantive Education is the core of the Education voter because it is what the topic wishes to educate us about. </span>

The value is Morality as dictated by ought. Morality does not look to the consequences of an action but rather examines the intent of an action. Kant explains;

<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Immanuel Kant “Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals” ( from The European Philosophers from Descartes to Nietzsche pg 471) 1785 </span>

**__“__****__<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Think of it like...</span>__**<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"> **__was his intent.”__** </span>

<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">Furthermore we can’t always understand the ramifications of a plan therefore we should evaluate intent. </span>

Journal of Contemporary Health Law & Policy, 2001 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Winter, 18 J. Contemp. Health L. & Pol’y 95, p. 117) </span>

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">**__“The utilitarian principle...__** conjectural, future **__outcome__.”**</span>

When we discuss international politics the consequences are even more difficult to predict. There are multiple actors and tons of actions each could take. Therefore the criterion is: Preventing actions made with bad intentions. In terms of morality a “bad intention” is one that you take even though you recognize that the means are immoral or even though it will probably have bad consequences. Therefore all I need to prove is the intention behind producing nuclear weapons was bad to win.

My sole contention is that nuclear weapons were built with bad intentions. Nuclear weapons when first developed were intended to destroy entire cities. ThinkQuest explains;

ThinkQuest; “Manhattan Project”; http://library.thinkquest.org/17940/texts/timeline/manhattan.html

**__Since 1945, when...__** various types of rockets.

The intent of nuclear weapons was to destroy the filthy Japanese. Even though the first dropped nuclear bombs ended the war, they ended the war by destroying entire cities. They dropped two bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, destroying those cities. This massive annihilation was intended, which proves nuclear weapons should never have been created.

This is bad intent for 3 reasons.

1: After the tests conducted by the Manhattan Project they knew the deadliness and yet still dropped it on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

2: The tests of nuclear weapons were run over Indian reserves and were tested on the indigenous peoples to see the effects on humans. They were creating these for the purpose of using them on humans.

3: They specifically dropped them on cities instead of a military base. This means they were targeting innocent civilians.

The atrocities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki not only prove the devastating results that could result from nuclear weapons being used but they also elucidate on the bad intentions when nuclear weapons were created. Therefore I affirm.

===Technooooooooo.=== 

Joel Kovel once said; “<span style="color: black;">the child of technocratic care is the neutron bomb.” Therefore </span>I affirm; States ought not possess nuclear weapons.

Ought: used to express duty or moral obligation. (Dictionary.com)

Furthermore you should prefer this interpretation.
1: The resolution doesn’t use the term “should,” rather it specifically uses the term “ought” differentiating LD from policy. The resolution can’t be looked towards as policy making.

5: Morality is a prescriptive term, which does not connote desirability. Adler writes;

<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">**__<span style="font-family: Cambria;">“A prescriptive statement... ought to be desired.”</span>__** </span>

<span style="color: black;">Therefore the value is Morality. Morality requires the correct treatment of humans. Any moral system requires the respect of human worth. This is true for two reasons. </span>

<span style="color: black; margin-left: 37pt; text-indent: -19pt;">(A) It is a reason why morality is valued and why so many call for moral judgments.</span>
<span style="color: black; margin-left: 37pt; text-indent: -19pt;"> (B) This is the reason moral judgments attempt to restrict action. “You ought not kill a man” creates a prohibition because killing a man would treat that person as less than you or as less then human. </span>

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Berube explains how the dispensability of people generates moral atrocities.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 0in;">Michael Berube; PhD, Studies American Literature and Culture Studies; 1997</span>

<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">Assuming we are__**...**__ **__most powerful weapon.__** </span>

<span style="color: black;">The inviolability thus must be respected for any moral code to exist. Thus the standard is: Respecting the inviolability of humans. </span>

<span style="color: black;">My sole contention is the possession of nuclear weapons is a unique nightmare that threatens the inviolability of humans. Nuclear weapons are impersonal which causes the victim to seem alien. </span>

<span style="color: black;">Because of the impersonality of nuclear weapons there is less to prevent us from violence. Deterrence doesn’t exist when we don’t care about others. KOVEL 1; </span>

Joel Kovel; Politician, Philosopher, Academic, Writer, Eco-Socialist; “Against the state of nuclear terror”; South End Press; 1984

<span style="color: black;">Weapons, of course__**...**__ **__decision of omnicide.__** </span>

<span style="color: black;">And this type of technocracy is integral to possession of nuclear weapons. The creation of “cleaner” weapons or weapons with safety devices such as DALs or PALs is one of the unique problems with nuclear programs. KOVEL 2; [IBID] </span>

<span style="color: black;">Thus, **__the child of...__** the power we face. </span>


<span style="color: black;">Nuclear weapons are a unique technological nightmare. The impersonal, alienated human power is the same kind of alienation that creates racism, classism, and masochism. KOVEL 3; [IBID] </span>

**__<span style="color: black;">The atomic bomb... </span>__**<span style="color: black;"> all be intertwined. </span>

<span style="color: black;">This violence and exclusion is a unique link to morality because the fragmentation and alienation causes us to ignore that person’s inviolability and harm them. If you don’t buy that link the impersonality of nuclear weapons destroys moral systems. </span>

<span style="color: black;">The impersonality of nuclear weapons destroys any moral systems because it distances us from morality. KOVEL 4; [IBID] </span>

**__<span style="color: black;">The machine expands... </span>__**<span style="color: black;"> **__but another machine.__** </span>

<span style="color: black;">This gives independent reasoning as to why nuclear weapons are immoral. Therefore I affirm. </span>

<span style="color: black; margin: 0.1pt 0in;">Therefore the value is **__Morality.__** Morality whether viewed as a system of obligations or prohibitions sets to inhibit some action and promote a “better” action. However we deem an action as better through human care, the connection to the other. Without recognizing the other as a human, someone that deserves respect we cannot have morality. </span>

Morality constrains action through self-sanctioning based on moral standards that must be internalized. In constructing morality we must avoid dissociation in order to ensure that the internalization of norms is a positive force. Rationalizing evil actions through justification, euphemism, and self-distancing from events and political actors enable this dissociation. Zimbardo explains;

Zimbardo, Philip. The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil. Random House, 1st Edition. March 27, 2007.

Therefore when we disengage others’ moral status as a human we no longer take moral actions. This dissociation is especially dangerous in the modern military context in which death and destruction are becoming progressively more and more faceless.

===I AM ABSURD (Bronx R3)=== 

<span style="font-family: Calibri; line-height: 115%;">Oh hey, did you catch the new episode of Jersey Shore this week? Oh sorry, I got distracted by The Situation's abs and forgot that this was a debate round. Let me read this case my coach gave me.</span> “Your love is teaching me hooooooooooooooow, how to feel.” Because I agree with The U2s the best indie rock and roll band that ever existed I affirm. This is LD so the value has to be morality and the value criterion is something else to do with morality. And this doesn’t matter because I’m going to read extinction anyways.
Oh by the way negative debater, please put away that theory shell I just saw you pulling out because I will be providing a method for disarming
Observation 1: Plan Text (yes I know that policy debate takes place in another room, my partner was sick today): <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">States ought not possess nuclear weapons and ought to use U2’s method of dismantling atomic bombs. </span>
Observation U2: The Advantage : Nukes will make the whole world go boom causing massive extinction. In fact, I think I just saw a mushroom cloud outside. No, never mind that was just a smokestack.
Observation How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb: Bono knows the secret to dismantling an atomic bomb!!! Who is Bono you ask? Only the best rock star ever. He fronts the U2s and wrote an entire album about the topic a few years ago so that lders would use it today. McGee writes
Matt McGee; @U2.com; “Did U2 Plan to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb?”; July 12, 2004;
Adding further intrigue__**...**__ **__"Love. With love.__**
Dismantling these weapons of mass destruction is priority number one! Mucho importante! Once we dismantle these weapons with love we learn how to feel and care for the others. This really important.
Bono understands that saving the world is a chore but can still empathize with us through music, making his method a great way to save the world AND PREVENT EXTINCTION. Pitchfork Media, a hipster culture website writes

<span style="line-height: 115%;"> Observation Catorce: or THE WAKING.</span>
<span style="line-height: 115%;"> Hop to your feet and grab your ballot because we’re going to utilize the gift of debate.

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt; margin: 0.1pt 0in;"> 2) Role of the ballot: Vote affirmative to accept poetic revolts based on absurdity as a legitimate framework. Revolt allows individuals to begin recognizing the self and become ethically mature. Sagi 94; </span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt; margin: 0.1pt 0in;"> 3) Language necessitates constant shifts and redefinitions over time. Without the poetic revolution from the affirmative, language dies. Furthermore this metaphoric revolt allows us to describe and contrast with reality, therefore better understanding reality.

Observation 2: Burdens
The affirmative represents a change in the status quo, providing a solution to a potential problem. Therefore the negative must defend the status quo. The framework to evaluate theory is Proof of Abuse. You cannot simply prove that one interpretation isn’t as good as another interpretation to win on theory, theory is suppose to be a deterrent to bad practices. Furthermore this is the preferable framework because it prevents theory from becoming abusive in itself. For example in policy topicality is run almost every round even though most cases aren’t abusive. This means you should raise your threshold for theory.
Predictability: This interpretation creates a stable set of limits for what the negative must do. This means it should be expected for the negative to prove good in the status quo. Most negatives on this topic such as Prevents War and Sovereignty fall within this interpretation. My opponent should have ample evidence and arguments to defend the status quo. Thus this proves my interpretation isn’t abusive.
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Topic Literature: Most topic literature falls within the discussion of the real world. Almost every article discusses the status quo and if there is problem in the status quo. There is also a huge amount of literature on whether we should abolish nuclear weapons. This means this interpretation grants both debaters large access to topic literature. This means my interpretation isn’t abusive. They need to prove I deny them access to topic literature for you to pull the trigger on theory. If they have access to topic lit then they have equal access to create and formulate arguments meaning we are on an equal plane.</span>

Contention 1: Complaceny Currently the status quo is focused on restriction instead of abolishment. Treaties such as START, CBCT, and INF simply try to control nuclear weapons and make them manageable but the endorsement of an arms control approach to nuclear weapons ensures that the world will never get to a world free of nuclear weapons. Complacency is fostered on two levels: -
First – for the governmental decision-makers, who fail to re-orient their ways of thinking and come to believe that nuclear weapons can be made safe. -
Second – for disarm movements, which are kept at bay because they are unable to sound the alarm about nuclear catastrophe.

Arms Controls agreements have minimum effect and generate this complacency. __Schwartz and Derber explain;__

Contention 3: Nuclear Abolition
Only this alternative solves – it shifts the grounds of the debate over nuclear weaponry. A grounding in a logic of security, national interest, and preservation of the status quo permanently forecloses the possibility of disarmament for both levels of the link: nuclear elites don’t change their minds; and they continue to mobilize population in the defense of nuclear arsenals. A shift in frame is required: the case for abolition must be made in dispositive terms. Nuclear weapons must be outlawed. Only this approach reverses course and changes the minds of both the elites and the citizens.

//George Dvorsky. “The perils of nuclear disarmament: How relinquishment could result in disaster.” Institute for Emerging Ethics & Responsibilities. Mar 31 2009. [[http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/2985/]]//

//**__During disarmament, for... nuclear blackmail or attack.__**//

//1: This means without a specific method of disarmament planned and laid out disarmament will be ineffective. If the affirmative doesn’t offer a method of disarmament in the 1AC you can vote of this turn. Furthermore don’t let them give you a disarmament method in the 1AR because this skews my ability to sufficiently respond to it. I cannot fully develop a disadvantage or a counter-plan if he gives the method in the 1AR.//

//2: Delinking from this is proof of abuse!//

//3: Furthermore discussing the morality without proving a way to get there is useless because we don’t know how to get to the moral world.//


===//Where is the Sovereign?//=== 

//NC CASE//

//I negate Resolved: States ought not possess nuclear weapons. To clarify I offer the following definitions… (from FreeDictionary.com)//

//State is defined as: The supreme public power within a sovereign political entity.//

//Ought: Used to indicate obligation or duty. Since the resolution questions what states ought to do I value: State’s Obligations. Governments must follow their obligations or their purpose is nullified. For example if a democratic government doesn’t follow the will of the people then it loses all value. Breaking government obligations could also lead to backlash as proven in several historical instances. Therefore a state that follows its obligations is also a good thing.//

//The value criterion is: Preserving State Sovereignty. There are 4 justifications.//

//1: An important aspect of every state is providing security to its people. This is one of the fundamental obligations of a state. Sovereignty is necessary for states to be able to protect their citizens. Without the right to make decisions for itself it would be over-run and be at the mercy of larger states.//

//2: Sovereignty is central to the treatises of international law including the UN Charter and other documents. This means all relationships between two states are based on the fundamental understanding that states have the right to make their own decisions.//

//3: Sovereignty is the belief of equality between all powers. It shows one state respecting the decision making of another. Any theory of morality or justice would respect and preserve the equality the sovereignty stands for.//

//Please Observe: Morality does not have the same application to states as it does on persons. Most ethical theories center around one human and their relationships and obligations to another. My opponent must prove their ethical theory is specific to states because ethical theories regarding states are significantly different than those regarding humans. Furthermore this means you should prefer the sovereignty framework because it is specific to what states ought to do.//

//Contention: Possession of nuclear weapons is seen as critical to preserving sovereignty.//

//Nuclear weapons are seen as a sure fire way to protect yourself from the abuse of stronger nations because of deterrence.//

//1: Nuclear accidents are rare. The IAEA released a report saying radiation accidents, which are composed of radiological and nuclear accidents, are rare. Between 1944 and 2001 there were only 420 accidents, which led to the significant overexposure of one person. These only totaled to 133 fatalities. Only 1% of the accidents between 1945 and 2000 were military. This proves that accidents from nuclear weapons are extremely rare. Don’t grant them any extra probability.//

//2: Most of these accidents aren’t high-consequence. Don’t listen to their talk of nuclear accidents because most of them are just radiation leaks. They will point out Chernobyl and Three Mile Island and how they were deadly. Those are the most wide know because they are deadly. Other accidents aren’t well known because nothing happened. This means don’t grant them any magnitude. This is no reason to get rid of an important military option.//

//3: Alternative Causalities: Nuclear energy power plants still exist which means accidents will still occur. If this doesn’t take out their harms it at least shrinks their benefit significantly.//

===//Harms Reduction AC//=== 

//I affirm; The abuse of illegal drugs ought to be treated as a matter of public health, not of criminal justice. To clarify I will explain the burdens.//

//First the resolution discusses states as the actors, because it questions what policies should be used to treat the abuse of illegal drugs. Furthermore this is textually backed by the resolution. Both public health and criminal justice are policy-making paradigms, to evaluate how governments take actions. The actor is therefore a policy-making government.//

//Ought is “Used to express duty or obligation” [Freedictionary.com]. This is also a better definition because state’s obligations always come before their moral concerns. While states attempt to follow morals their own obligations come first. They justify breaking moral codes to promote their own interests and protect their citizens.//

//Please observe the following: public health and criminal justice are not polar opposites. There is no way to have a completely exclusive policy of public health or criminal justice. Forcing the affirmative to defend only public health policies would be impossible without the legalization of drugs. This means you shouldn’t let the negative nit-pick at affirmatives. The affirmative and the negative should thus defend a focus on their specific sides. Furthermore this interpretation is best because it doesn’t allow debaters to pick specific plans or advocacies. We will actually debate the resolution, which both sides are prepared for.//

//The value is Governmental Legitimacy. The resolution questions what the governments should do. Therefore we should look towards how governments work and their legitimacy to evaluate which policy is best.//

//The value criterion is protection of citizens.//
//1: The government has an obligation to protect its citizens. If it ignores its citizens then it breaks its part of the social contract. Therefore the government is purposeless.//
//2: Even if the people deserve punishment because they break the law the government still has an obligation to give reciprocal punishment. Therefore government can never ignore the obligation to protect citizens. When it comes to the life of the citizens then the government must protect its citizens.//

//The thesis of the affirmative is that governments should prioritize public health because it is better for protecting citizens.//

//My first contention is Harm Reduction. Public health policies use a method called “harm reduction” where instead of focusing on minimizing drug use they focus on minimizing the consequences of drug use.//

//Harm reduction protects both the individual and the community, because it creates alternatives to punishment. Drislane 2010;//

//Robert Drislane, is a professor of sociology at Thompson Rivers University, and Parkinson, Gary, Ph.D, Online Dictionary of the Social Sciences, Athabasca University, accessed 7/13/10, http://bitbucket.icaap.org/dict.pl?alpha=H//

//**__A term often … to the community.__**//

//The criminal justice mindset focuses on “ridding the world of those evil substances and preventing people from using them.” Criminal justice has created mindsets such as the war on drugs where they focus on abolition.//

//The conceptual shift to harm reduction is critical to reducing the harms of drug abuse. Macmaster 2004;//

//Samuel A. Macmaster, is Associate Professor of College of Social Work at University of Tennessee Knoxville, “Harm Reduction: A New Perspective on Substance Abuse Services,” Social Work, 49.3, 2004.//

//**__Harm reduction is a… social work perspective.__**//

//When there are risks to drug abuse you can’t just accept adherence to strict standards of punishment. If you don’t allow for multiple options then you just accept the addict’s death.//

//Samuel A. Macmaster, is Associate Professor of College of Social Work at University of Tennessee Knoxville, “Harm Reduction: A New Perspective on Substance Abuse Services,” Social Work, 49.3, 2004.//

//**__A recent development… addicts don't recover"__** (Vail & Stokes, 1999).//

//Contention 2 is the failure of criminal justice.//

//Any idea of “justice” recognizes that there needs to be reciprocal punishment. However the idea “criminal justice” doesn’t apply to the Draconian laws on drugs. These laws are so strict that they are unjust. Most drug offenses don’t involve significant harm to others. For example the possession of 3 grams of cocaine is a felony, which means you are permanently disenfranchised and get a large number of years in prison.//

//This punishment is too strict since most of the harms of illicit drugs are directed on the self. My opponent in their defense of the criminal justice system must defend either why this is reciprocal or why reciprocity doesn’t matter.//

//I would argue that reciprocity in the legal system is actually vital to government legitimacy and protection of its citizens. If reciprocity is ignored then governments could offer the death penalty for failure to pay taxes. Not only does this disrespect the citizens and harm them, but also it makes governments purpose irrational and thus illegitimate. Furthermore reciprocity is good because it ensures everyone is treated equally and gets equal punishment. Governments cannot prioritize one citizen over another. Therefore for governments to be legitimate they must give reciprocal punishments.//




===//Stabbing is always better than prison//=== 
//I affirm; The abuse of illegal drugs ought to be treated as a matter of public health, not of criminal justice.//

//The resolution is a question of policy framing. The resolution asks the debate to focus on whether illicit drugs should be a matter of public health or criminal justice. This means the resolution talks about the specific framing. Both sides are justified in discussing specific policies under each of these frameworks to weigh impacts and prove their side. And this is theoretically justified.//

//Ought is best defined as; “Used to indicate duty or moral obligation” [Freedictionary.com].//

//<span style="color: black;">We conducted a computerized literature review using the keyword `needle exchange' for English language articles published from 1993 through to the end of 1997. We examined the references in articles identified by our literature search and contacted NSEP experts to identify additional articles. Books with articles on NSEP were also included, but abstracts from conferences were not. Articles that were only available in abstract form at the time of our previous report were included if they presented at least some new data. </span>//
//<span style="color: black;">We included only articles that addressed the impact of NSEP upon drug use rates, injection-risk behaviors, hepatitis and HIV (Table 1) [12-35]. Serial cross-sectional studies addressing the impact of NSEP upon the IDU community were included as this a key question about the effect of NSEP Otherwise cross-sectional studies were excluded, as they cannot address trends over time and serial cross-sectional studies of particular cities were included only if the data for NSEP participants and nonparticipants were analyzed separately. All changes reported are statistically significant at P < 0.05. If there was more than one statistically significant finding, representative findings are reported. Some studies appear more than once in Table 1 because they addressed more than one outcome or used more than one analytic approach; each is considered a separate study. Studies of cost-effectiveness, changes in sexual risk behavior (there were few of these), and the impact upon referrals to drug treatment were not included. We assumed that successful publication was a rough proxy for quality and did not use a quality scale as in our previous report. </span>//
//<span style="color: black;">We identified a total of 24 articles that have been published since our previous report. The impact of NSEP on drug use rates was addressed in 10 articles, on injection risk behaviors in 12 articles, on hepatitis B and C in one article, and on HIV in 11 articles. The studies were generally of a higher quality than those available in 1993 with a wider range of evaluation designs. In particular, ecological and case-control designs were more common, and prospective studies of HIV incidence had greater statistical power and were therefore analyzed using more sophisticated methods than was possible with the small prospective studies that were available in 1993. Control groups were more often used in the studies measuring NSEP impact upon injection risk behaviors and blood- borne pathogen transmission. Half of the studies were conducted in the USA. </span>//
//<span style="color: black;">The results of the studies are summarized in Table 2 with the different study designs combined. Of the 10 studies</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> diseases</span> <span style="color: black;">rates, four serial cross-sectional studies examined the impact of NSEP on drug use rates in the IDU community and the remaining six assessed NSEP impact on drug injection rates of IDU using the NSEP Some studies used mean IDU age to investigate whether young people had begun injecting as a result of the NSEP Seven studies reported reductions in measures of drug use, two reported no change, and one an adverse effect associated with NSEP The latter finding, in a drug treatment cohort, was a greater decline in the percentage of IDU who never used the NSEP and who continued to inject, compared to IDU who ever used the NSEP This observation has been made once before [36], and likely represents self-selection: IDU who expected to continue injecting drugs may have been more likely to select NSEP use. In any event, the number of studies with beneficial or neutral effects of NSEP upon drug use measures greatly exceeds this single study. </span>//

//<span style="color: black;">Eleven out of 12 studies examining injection risk behaviors reported improvements, generally decreases in syringe sharing rates. None showed an increase in injection risk behavior. By comparison, in our 1993 study [37],16 out of 23 studies showed a beneficial NSEP effect, six showed a mixed or neutral effect, and one showed an adverse effect (which was not apparent in subsequent studies [38]). </span>//
//<span style="color: black;">Of the 12 studies examining the impact of NSEP upon blood-borne infections, six reported beneficial effects for NSEP, four reported neither a beneficial nor an adverse effect, and two reported an adverse effect. The adverseeffects were reported from a single study in Montreal that used two different methods to analyze the same data set [33,39]. </span>//
//<span style="color: black;">Although substantially more studies reported beneficial or neutral effects of NSEP upon blood-borne pathogen transmission, the Montreal study has attracted significant attention from USA policy makers and merits special mention [40].The study followed 974 HIV-negative drug users prospectively; IDU who attended the NSEP at the intake interview were almost twice as likely to acquire HIV as those not attending the NSEP, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Similar findings were apparent in the nested case-control analysis. However, the Montreal authors demonstrated clearly that IDU who attend NSEP in Montreal are systematically different than other local IDU: NSEP participants are much less likely to be enrolled in drug treatment and much more likely to inject frequently, borrow injection equipment from other IDU, attend shooting galleries. and share injection equipment with HIV-positive IDU. It is not surprising that a group of that description would have higher seroincidence rates. </span>//
//<span style="color: black;">The on-the-ground realities of syringe availability in Montreal suggest why high-risk IDU may be more likely to attend the NSEP. First, Montreal public-health officials </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">maintained </span><span style="color: black;">provision of sterile syringes. Second, for most of the study period, CACTUS, the major Montreal NSEP was only' open from 21:00 to 04:00 h and annually exchanged fewer than 200 ()00 syringes, not a large number for a city, of that size Finally, CACTUS is located in an area noted for commercial sex work. The NSEP was therefore likely to serve IDU who could not obtain syringes from pharmacies and who were in the streets in the early morning. </span>//
//<span style="color: black;">The Vancouver study [35] has also attracted the attention of NSEP opponents, even though we rate the study as demonstrating neither an adverse nor a beneficial effect for NSEP That study demonstrated that a significant HIV epidemic occurred despite the presence of an NSEP (this does not mean that the NSEP was ineffective, only that it was not perfectly effective) and, like the Montreal study, that the highest-risk IDU attend the NSEP The number of incident HIV infections was only 24 and almost all used the NSEP, so it was impossible to say whether NSEP users were more likely to contract HIV infection than those not using the program or whether the epidemic would have occurred sooner or been larger had there not been an NSEP </span>//
//<span style="color: black;">It is critical to recall that, by the authors' own descriptions, neither study was designed to evaluate NSEP But both the Montreal and the Vancouver studies suggest that NSEP, because they attract high-risk IDU, would be excellent places to implement behavioral risk-reduction programs. It is significant that public-health officials in both Montreal and Vancouver, rather than curtailing these programs, have responded to these findings by expanding the availability of NSEP services in their cities. </span>//
//<span style="color: black;">In summary, the data since our 1993 report confirm and extend the evidence of NSEP efficacy and the lack of associated adverse effects. The combination of NSEP with efforts to increase syringe availability by modifying restrictive laws and regulations [42] and outreach to increase pharmacist involvement in syringe sales [43,44] holds promise for reducing the toll of HIV infection. </span>//

Contention 1: FW
Ought: used to express duty or moral obligation. (Dictionary.com)
<span style="color: black; margin: 0.1pt 0in;">Therefore the value is **__Morality.__** </span>

<span style="color: black;">If we allow for violence or justify immoral actions, we shift our morality into neutral gear. </span>Philip Zimbardo explains how people adopt moral standards; 

Zimbardo, Philip. The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil. Random House, 1st Edition. March 27, 2007. 

<span style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Times;">This model begins …</span>**__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times;"> fellow human beings.</span>__** </span>

Therefore when we disengage others’ moral status as a human we no longer take moral actions. The standard is thus: Minimizing Disengagement of Moral Status.

Observation: Specific advocacies.

My interpretation: Specific advocacies that are within resolutional limits are good. 

<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">1. My interp increases the quality of the argumentation by forcing debaters to engage in the substance of the plan. This provides more specific links instead of just giving negatives weak tangential links. I grant them strong links to disadvantages. This increases quality of negative ground.</span>
<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">2. It increases quantity of negative ground. It grants them counterplan ground and link turn ground instead of general argumentation like law good.</span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver; text-indent: -0.25in;">3. They stabilize AC advocacies. This holds me down to an advocacy and prevents me from shifting in later speeches. This is a really big internal link. 1st: in round ground. By maintaining a stable advocacy the negative can build a link and actually attach arguments to my position. Without a plan I could shift in the 1AR or 2AR, ruining all negative ground. 2nd: in round predictability. The negative knows what I will go for in the 1AR and 2AR. This is a internal link to strategy since they can formulate a better strategy and one that is specific to the plan. </span>
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver; text-indent: -0.25in;">4. Depth: Plans allow for more in depth discussion of the issues. This is necessary to get sufficient education about the topic instead of just a useless blanket of knowledge. Furthermore my interpretation allows for more breadth. There is no reason to believe that the same plan would be run every round so that means we get in depth on multiple different issues. This interpretation is the best link to education. </span>

Thus the plan: All governments should increase funding for treatment facilities relating to prenatal care and substance abuse treatment specifically tailored for pregnant mothers that abuse illicit substances and stop punishing them for the drug abuse. We should only remove the children from these mothers if they demonstrate serious risk to the child, not as an automatic response to drug abuse. I reserve the right to clarify.

<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Substance abuse treatment … women not in treatment. </span>


Contention 4: Advantages

Advantage 1 is Moral Panic

Drug laws are founded from the idea of “drug wars”. These are moral panics at their finest. Flavin et al. 2010

<span style="color: black; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 9.5pt;">Jeanne Flavin, Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Fordham University; Lynn Paltrow, National Advocates for Pregnant Women; “Punishing Pregnant Drug-Using Women- Defying Law, Medicine, and Common Sense”; Journal of Addictive Diseases; April 20, 2010</span>

**__<span style="color: black; font-family: Times; font-size: 10.5pt;">The drug war … </span>__**<span style="color: black; font-family: Times; font-size: 10.5pt;"> drug or alcohol.</span>

This moral panic adopts moral imperatives and stigmatizes the mothers, two strong links to the framework. Finally helping these mothers and sending out the helping hand of public health we stop the stigmatization of these women.

Advantage 2: Punishment scares mothers away from Prenatal Care.

The criminal justice mindset is an ineffective method to dealing with pregnant substance abusers because it forces them to avoid pre-natal care. Paltrow explains;

<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt; margin: 0.1pt 0in;">Lynn M. Paltrow. “Punishing Women for Their Behavior During Pregnancy: An Approach that Undermines the Health of Women and Children.” New York: Center for Reproductive Law & Policy; 1996.</span>

<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"> <span style="font-family: Cambria;">Leading public health … </span> and her newborn.</span>

And these fears are now a reality. In the United States doctors are supposed to report any pregnant mothers they suspect of drug abuse because of the 2006 law. This stigmatization means mothers will be much more secretive about their drug abuse and avoid their prenatal care.

By giving significant improvements to prenatal care then we decrease the rate of prematurity <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">and low birth weight.</span> El-Mohandes et al;

Advantage 3: Criminal justice is harmful to the child.

The criminal justice system stigmatizes these mothers into a category of [quote] “unfit parents.” The solution in their eyes is to remove the child. This is actually really bad for both infant and mother, and one of the most horrific punishments. Brody et al. 2001;

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">David C. Brody, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice, Washington State University, Spokane; B.A. (University of Arizona); J.D. (University of Arizona College of Law); Ph.D. (State University of New York, Albany); Heidee McMillin, Doctoral student, Department of Political Science, Washington State University; B.A. (Arizona State University); M.A. (Washington State University). We would like to thank Stephen Wasby, Nicholas Lovrich and Wendy Molyneux for their editorial, theoretical and critical input. This work was partially supported by the Edward R.

The removal of … are substance abusers. 
Furthermore the assumption made by the criminal justice system, that these mothers are unfit parents is stigmatizing. 

====1AR HIV Advantage==== 

==== ==== 
Punishment scares mothers away from HIV treatment.

Pregnant female drug users don’t have access to treatment. They are stigmatized. UN Office of Drugs and Crime 06;

United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime; “HIV/AIDs Prevention and Care for Females Injecting Drug Users”; July 2006

**__Pregnant injecting drug... stigma and discrimination.__**

And there are multiple barriers to treatment because of this stigmatization. UN ODC 06;

United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime; “HIV/AIDs Prevention and Care for Females Injecting Drug Users”; July 2006

**__Many HIV/AIDS prevention... identified and stigmatized.__**

Therefore even if you don’t buy the moral framework I have an impact to HIV in these pregnant mothers. Furthermore this is a systematic impact of stigmatization and HIV since the stigmatization is institutionalized and HIV is passed from mother to child.


1AR A2: Turns

Don’t listen to the turns about mothers. The lies of the moral panic makes people believe the drug abuse is the worst thing ever.

JULIE B. EHRLICH; “BREAKING THE LAW BY GIVING BIRTH: THE WAR ON DRUGS, THE WAR ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, AND THE WAR ON WOMEN”; NYU School of Law; Review of Law and Social Change; 2008

**__“If the true goal...__** the only determinant.”

====1AR Discourse K==== 

=====Shell===== 

Language is an important tool to understand and change reality. Hyde et al. 2000;

Bruce Hyde and Jeffery L. Bineham; Department of Speech Communication, St. Cloud State University; FROM DEBATE TO DIALOGUE: Toward a Pedagogy of Nonpolarized Public Discourse; SOUTHERN COMMUNICATION JOURNAL, Volume 65, Numbers 2 & 3, Winter-Spring 2000; 

**__To those in ... them in things__**” (1954/1982, p. 266).

Creating a social association between mothers and immoral or evil actions, such as the negative does, creates a social norm. You begin associating these people as evil, as [quote] crack mothers. And prescriptions from this discourse establish the necessary social conditions to make exclusion possible.

<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">**__<span style="font-size: 12pt;">A discourse makes ... and therefore, meaningful. </span>__**</span>



=====Discourse before Fairness===== 
1: Because the impacts are ingrained into the real world we wouldn’t have debate. With these impacts the debate doesn’t matter in the sense that I could kill my opponent and then make the argument that you have to vote for me and it will be cold dropped. However the judge has to recognize that these actions shouldn’t be done in the real world.

2: The judge has an obligation to prevent bad mindsets from spreading into the real world. Everyone says that a debater will have a high probability of becoming a policy maker. They explain the purpose of debate is education. The judge has to vote and take action to help that person learn, grow, and develop. This is the reason for giving oral critics and for giving advice after rounds. However the judge has another obligation that comes along with those. This is to reject bad discourse and ideologies. Allowing racism or this lack of apathy wouldn’t be good for that debater’s development. 

3: Prevent bad discourse: Reason you wouldn't allow "N" word in debate.
-civility
-acceptance.
Both importance parts of debate.

4: The judge has to prevent real world implications. In the case of the real world action is the same as inaction. There is no objective discrimination between the two. When it comes to situation such as genocide or horrible atrocities this is doubly true. If the judge justifies this lack of apathy they justify every atrocity against these people. The judge’s jurisdiction doesn’t allow him to cause severe real world implications. Therefore the judge must vote against my opponent’s bad discourse.




=====And...===== 

1: Fairness doesn’t exist within the context of a debate. There are time biases and even resolutional biases. Furthermore each debater attempts to make it easier for him or herself to win the round. This means that fairness can’t be artificially created.

2: Only one debater gets the rewards of fairness while both debaters have the possibility of their discourse affecting the real world. This gives us justification to forgo fairness FOR discourse, not just for no reason.

This tactic is not new. **__Since the 1980s, anti-reproductive rights advocates have consistently depicted "a deeply fundamental conflict between [a woman and her fetus] that must be mediated and regulated by outside forces for the fetus to survive__**.'" **__Today the fetus is viewed as "belong[ing] to someone other than the pregnant woman, who simply acts as the 'host' for the man's unborn child."

==//Affirmative//== 

===//Transfer Students//=== 

//I affirm; “In the United States, juveniles charged with violent felonies ought to be treated as adults in the criminal justice system.” The affirmative is a categorical statement, that all juveniles who commit violent felonies be tried as adults. To clarify I define the following://

//Violent felonies are defined by the 2009 case US v. Thrower;//

//<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">**<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;">http://definitions.uslegal.com/v/violent-felony/ </span>**</span>//

//<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">**__<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;">A violent … injury to another." </span>__** </span>//

//Juvenile is defined as://

//http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/juvenile+delinquent; 2005; Gerald N. Hill and Kathleen T. Hill;//

//**__a person who … low as 14.__**//

//Observation 1: Proving that juveniles are not culpable for committing crimes is not sufficient to negate because law holds that those who are not culpable for crimes do not deserve punishment. Steinberg explains//

//<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">Steinberg, L. (2009). Adolescent development and juvenile justice. </span>//Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 5//, 47-73. http://www.temple.edu/psychology/lds/publications.htm//

//The starting point … **__punishment at all__** (Scott & Steinberg 2008).//

//The impact is that a juvenile who did not understand the crime they committed will never be punished for it in the affirmative world. Only juveniles who are capable of knowing that they did something wrong will be punished.//

//Observation 2: The negative should be forced to defend the status quo since the aff is a change from the status quo. This is the fairest interpretation for multiple reasons…//

//1: Topic Literature.//
//2: Predictable Ground.//
//Thus the affirmative will defend all juveniles who are charged with violent felonies will be sent to the adult system. The negative will defend the status quo where only some juveniles are sent to the adult system, at the digression of the judge.//

//Ought is a normative question, therefore the resolution questions justice. Furthermore the purpose behind the criminal justice systems is to promote justice; therefore the value is justice, defined as giving each their due.//

//Arbitrary conditions of treating people differently are unjust.//

//Manuel Velasquez, Claire Andre, Thomas Shanks, S.J., and Michael J. Meyer; “Justice and Fairness”; Santa Clara University; Issues in Ethics V3 N2 (Spring 1990)//

//<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">**__The foundations of … other as equals.__** </span>//

//Thus any arbitrary condition such as race, sex, or class; should not be a factor in punishment. Thus the value criterion is: Minimizing Arbitrariness.//
//Thus if a form of punishment is arbitrarily applied we should remediate the solution and eliminate the arbitrary condition.//

//Furthermore even if you don’t buy the value you should still use this standard.//

//Legitimacy of procedures plays a significant role in promoting compliance with law. Tyler 06 explains the methodology.//

//<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tom R. Tyler; Why People Obey the Law; Princeton Press; Book; 2006.</span>//

//**__"Regression analysis was …__** not influence compliance."//

//RESULTS PROVE. TYLER 06 [ibid];//

//“The usefulness analysis… by other factors.”//

//The thesis of the affirmative is that current waiver methods are arbitrary, which is a reason that we should send all juveniles convicted of violent felonies to the adult system.//

//Contention 1: Disgression.//

//The judge’s discretion allows them to choose which standards they look to or ignore. This arbitrariness allows for bias who gets transferred.//

//Barry Feld; “Abolish the Juvenile Court: Youthfulness, Criminal Responsibility, and Sentencing Policy”; Autumn 1997; Journal of Criminal Law and Criminality, Volume 88 No. 1; http://www.jstor.org/stable/1144075//

//<span style="color: black;">“In most states… new-found "adult" status.” </span>//

[[#_Toc142755694]]

//<span style="color: black;">The issue here is that the judge has sole discretion. The judge can take into the fact youthfulness but that is up to their “sound discretion”. The judge can determine your fate based on the perceived ability to be rehabilitated. Other judges would ignore that question. Your fate should not be based on which judge you draw which is a reason I reject these arbitrary conditions. </span>//

//FURTHERMORE Waivers are arbitrary because judicial discretion is entirely subjective. Osbun and Rode illucidate;//

//Part One is the Issue: We’ve become slaves to the norm of debate.//
//Increasingly theory is run each and every round. It is often seen as a first resort when answering critical or odd cases. The opening of the case expresses the final product of this norm.//

//There are two reasons why theory corrupts our discourse and the way we use language.//

//A: The discontinuity formed by the formation of a norm of debate destroys our ability to reform language and use resemblance. Michel Foucault 1://

//Michel Foucault; Philosopher, Professor at Institut Francais in Hamburg, Germany, Institut de Philosophie at the Faculte des Lettres in the University of Clermont-Ferrand, France; “The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences”; 1970; Book//

//**__“Discontinuity – the fact… to escape itself.”__**//

//Thus we must always fully learn about discourse and what can be represented before we create limits and attempt to define what we should debate.//

//B: These idols suppose a greater order, that the ideas of fairness and education can form what we talk about. However these ideas are blinding and prevent any form of learning. Michel Foucault 2://

//“**__The__**// **__idols of the…//__** by perfect circles’.

<span style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">Part 2: The Change: The 1ac is a recognition through absurdity that the world is not static. </span>

Part 3: is the Role of The Ballot

Completely understanding language is the most important part of debate and communication. Thus the judge should vote on whoever best utilizes resemblance to describe the world. Foucault 3:

“Up to the end… **__right of speech.”__**

1: Language is an important tool to understand and change reality, thus discourse comes first. Hyde et al. 2000;

**__To those in the… them in things__**” (1954/1982, p. 266).

2: <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Language is necessary to interpret signs necessary to reaching truth. Thus there is infinite need for language. Foucault 4: </span>

**__<span style="font-family: Helvetica;">"Knowledge therefore consisted… one over another." </span>__**

<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt; margin: 0.1pt 0in;">Furthermore language necessitates constant shifts and redefinitions over time. Without the unique position the affirmative, language dies. We need to recognize the needs of adapting language and the way we communicate. </span>

===EMORY AC=== 

I affirm; In the United States, juveniles charged with felonies ought to be treated as adults in the criminal justice system. To clarify I offer the following definitions and observations. 

Ought is defined as: Used to indicate desirability by Merriam Webster’s Dictionary. 

Juvenile: a young person...up to the age of 18. (Merriam-Webster Dictionary)
However, statistics may aid in clarifying this definition. California DOJ explains:

(SOURCE: State of California Department of Justice, California Criminal Justice.)

In California, 92.9%... age group of 13-17 

And juveniles charged with violent felonies they make up about 7 percent of the juvenile population. OJJDP explains; 

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, OJJDP; “Prosecute Certain Serious, Violent, and Chronic Juvenile Offenders in Criminal Court”; July 2006; http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/nr2006/html/chp3.html </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The behavior of … safety and security.</span>


Observation 1: Proving that juveniles are not culpable for committing crimes is not sufficient to negate because law holds that those who are not culpable for crimes do not deserve punishment. Only juveniles who are capable of knowing that they did something wrong will be punished. This is comparable to an adult who has a disorder causing them to be commit serious crimes being put in rehabilitation or an insanity plea being upheld. Thus if culpability does not directly correlate with the separation between juvenile and adult courts then there is no purpose for such a categorical division.

The value is Justice; which is a necessary part of the criminal justice system.
Without such ethical claims the justice system would be purposeless.
Therefore my value criterion is Reducing Crime. 

Contention 1: Those that aren’t violent.

Keeping juveniles in the juvenile system is known as retention. When this occurs rehabilitation is thrown out the window for all juveniles. There are two warrants

First: The reason juvenile facilities can focus on rehabilitation is because the violent youth are transferred to adult courts. Lawrence and Hemmens 1 explain;

Treating these less serious delinquents in a rehabilitative environment is always better than punishing them. Even if we could have a rehabilitative juvenile justice system after total retention it is better to punish the serious offenders. Scott and Steinberg defend this delineation;

Contention 2: Those that are violent.

When variables are adjusted for the differences between transfers and non-transfers, numbers show that transfer to the adult system does not affect recidivism. Moreover, there is a reduction in the number of person crimes. Loughran and Schubert in 2010 

Loughran, T., Mulvey, E., Schubert, C., Chassin, L., Steinberg, L., Piquero, A., Fagan, J., Cota-Robles, S., Cauffman, E., & Losoya, S. (2010).

This analysis shows that those who go through the adult system are less likely to commit violent crimes, verifying the deterrent effect. If juveniles know that they will be going to the adult system, the deterrent effect will be stronger because there will be no question prior to committing the crime as to where the juvenile will be sent when convicted. This links back to minimizing arbitrary actions because failing to take an action that prevents crime and is relatively safe unfairly disadvantages members of society who are not criminals. 

Furthermore heterogeneity is an important factor other studies don’t control for.

===__NDCA Round 5__ (v Jalon)=== 

I affirm; In the United States, juveniles charged with felonies ought to be treated as adults in the criminal justice system. To clarify I offer the following definitions and observations. 

Ought is defined as: Used to indicate desirability by Merriam Webster’s Dictionary. 

Juvenile: a young person...up to the age of 18. (Merriam-Webster Dictionary)
However, statistics may aid in clarifying this definition. California DOJ explains:

(SOURCE: State of California Department of Justice, California Criminal Justice.)

In California, 92.9% of juvenile violent crimes were attributed to the age group of 13-17 

And juveniles charged with violent felonies they make up about 7 percent of the juvenile population. OJJDP explains; 

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, OJJDP; “Prosecute Certain Serious, Violent, and Chronic Juvenile Offenders in Criminal Court”; July 2006; http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/nr2006/html/chp3.html </span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The behavior of a relatively small percentage of juvenile offenders has had a devastating impact on the public's sense of security, on victims, and on the families of victims.</span> **__Research shows that__**, **__although these serious, violent, and chronic offenders comprise only 6 to 8 percent__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of the total juvenile offender population, they account for a disproportionately large number of offenses</span>. **__These juveniles are involved in a wide range of offense types and are likely to commit both serious offenses and violent crimes.__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(See figure 7 for trends in juvenile arrests for specific violent crimes.) Because of its frequency and seriousness, the violent behavior of this group of offenders must be controlled to ensure public safety and security.</span>


Observation 1: Proving that juveniles are not culpable for committing crimes is not sufficient to negate because law holds that those who are not culpable for crimes do not deserve punishment. Only juveniles who are capable of knowing that they did something wrong will be punished. This is comparable to an adult who has a disorder causing them to be commit serious crimes being put in rehabilitation or an insanity plea being upheld. Thus if culpability does not directly correlate with the separation between juvenile and adult courts then there is no purpose for such a categorical division. 

Observation 2: The negative must defend the status quo.
1: Topic Literature

2: Predictable Ground

Thus the affirmative will defend all juveniles who are charged with violent felonies will be sent to the adult system. The negative will defend the status quo where only some juveniles are sent to the adult system, at the digression of the judge. 

This does not violate the negative’s counterplan ground. They can specify an existing juvenile court system as long as it doesn’t delink from AC offense and allows for statistics ground.


The value is Justice; which is a necessary part of the criminal justice system.
Without such ethical claims the justice system would be purposeless.
Therefore my value criterion is Reducing Crime. 
1: This is a necessary pragmatic evaluation of the criminal justice system.
2: Reducing crime is always a good thing to improve society. Each crime has a victim and taxpayers that are affected by the criminal’s action.
3: Crime destroys the image of society. The United States as the agent of action in this resolution needs to protect its image. Whenever the notion of authority or legitimacy is lost then the agent loses its ability to act. This is comparable to Somalia which functions in a state of anarchy.

Contention 1: Those that are violent.

The adult system deters juvenile crime. Chamberlin writes

This analysis shows that those who go through the adult system are less likely to commit violent crimes, verifying the deterrent effect. Thus we should send all violent juveniles to the adult court. Further this avoids biased transferred laws because they are transferred based on the severity of the crime. 


Contention 2: Those that aren’t violent. 

Keeping juveniles in the juvenile system is known as retention. When this occurs rehabilitation is thrown out the window for all juveniles. This is the reason in the status quo the rehabilitative models are becoming more punitive. As long as we are keeping violent juveniles in the juvenile system it will be more punitive. There are two warrants

Juveniles thus are not necessarily associated with violence because only 8 percent are truly violent. Thus affirming doesn’t perpetuate any negative discourses.

B: Even educational institutions have some semblance of rules because fairness and order is necessary to create an educational environment. C: The ballot in front of you signifies competition. You pick a winner and loser and one advances to the next round. They can still run counterplans as long as they don’t defend transfer to the adult system. This still gives them access to MST CP, etc.
