NC #1
V- Morality
S- Proportionality

C1- Deadly force is not proportional for 19 reasons (I read 3-6 any given rnd)
All 19 reasons are analytic :)

NC #2
V- Morality
S- Meeting the imminence requirement
C1- Deadly force as a response to repeated domestic violence is not imminent for 14 reasons (I read 3-6 any given round)
all are analytic

NC #3
V- Morality
S- Protecting Life
C1- Deadly force kills people for 1 reason (I am sure you can guess what it is)

NC #4
V- Morality
S- Deontology
C1- Deadly force is deont bad for 12 reasons (I read 3-6 any given round)
all are analytic

NC #5
V- Societal Welfare
S- Util
C1- Deadly force in response to DV is Util bad for a lot of reasons (does it really matter how many? Ill read 3-6..... chill?)
ex: Deadly force kills people, when people die they cant experience pleasure, death= bad.

NC #6
V- valuing Values
S- Setting standards for valuing values
C1- Deadly force sets a standard for valuing the standard values that we use to value standard values, valuably.
its all analytic

Problems I gotz with Disclosure
1) The website wont let me copy and paste urls so if you want cites email me (also this means i literally cant post cites, dont drop me for something I cant do.)
* If i read cites, those cards were decided on a round by round basis, and thus not part of case. I think it would be unreasonable to require me to post every card I have. 
* If anyone wants cites read in round, ask! I am more than willing to give cites. 
2) Email me if you LOVE my cases :) I do!
3) This is the only use of the wiki I do. I post cases of my own and nothing else. I am not viewing others' pages, taking outlines, or cites. I have opted out of much of the wiki. Please respect my wishes. 
4) My cases change every round (apart from ones posted, and they might actually change including the ones posted)
The disclosure being advocated says you dont need to post cases that havent been broken. "Tickle-Me-Shmikles AC" may be run multiple rounds, but each time it changes from Version 1 to Version 2 and so on. I do not run V1 after i write V2, and I edit before each tournament and likely before each round. Thus, every time I go into round, the AC I am running is new and not broken. I wont be running the same version in later rounds, so rather than being declared "fooling" people with old versions, i just wont post old cases. ALSO, no one would be able to shift through 30 Versions of an AC, so I think it makes more sense to just not post those. If you need Cites let me know. If you have any other thoughts about the way I disclose, or have recommendations for how to solve this "version" problem, email me! I am asking now, for those who view my page, to email me now so I can fix the problem rather than hurting your movement by dropping someone who is trying their best! Thanks! Email is rshmikler@gmail.com
5) Right now, and very likely for Harvard, I do not have a working computer. I spent a lot of money for the plane ticket to Harvard, and I dont have money right now to buy a new laptop. My family only has one in the house, and that is mine. That means, for financial reasons, that I cannot post much of cases and cites. Do not drop me because I dont have enough money. 
6) ALSO FAIRNESS DOESNT MATTER!!!! the ballot says to vote for the better debater. I cant do anything about the genes I was born with. I might not be as smart as you. That means you are unfairly advantaged over me, but also, that I literally cannot win, because even if i won the flow, i am still the worse debater. And, a bunch of yall went to camp knowing you would have a competitive advantage. Most people in the community (not national, but debate) cannot afford that. That means you drop every debater who went to camp, or you disregard fairness.
(I am making these arguments out of round conditionally, sooo..... yeah)
