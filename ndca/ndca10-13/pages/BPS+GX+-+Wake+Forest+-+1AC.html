 Failure to secure advance appropriations is delaying Air Force acquisition of new communications satellites<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Brinton ‘11</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (Turner Brinton, “Conaton: Budget Pressure Necessitates Satellite Block Buys,” Space News, 7-1-2011, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4116:http://www.spacenews.com/military/110701-budget-necessitates-sat-block-buys.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spacenews.com/military/110701-budget-necessitates-sat-block-buys.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spacenews.com/military/110701-budget-necessitates-sat-block-buys.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4116 -->)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">With the U.S. Congress pushing back on the Air Force’s proposal to start buying multiple satellites at a time using multiyear advance appropriations, a top service official reiterated the need to rein in the cost of space systems and stabilize the industrial base to prepare for the tough fiscal environment the military will face in the years ahead. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Air Force</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">’s budget for space </span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">programs likely <strong>will come under pressure from other Defense Department priorities</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which means everyone will have to learn how to do more with less, Air Force Undersecretary Erin Conaton said at an event here hosted by the Space Foundation and Center for Strategic Space Studies. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Air Force in <strong>its 2012 budget request is seeking</strong> permission <strong>to implement</strong> a new space acquisition strategy dubbed <strong>Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency</strong> (EASE). The concept is <strong>to buy satellites in blocks</strong> of two or more <strong>using fixed-price contracts</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for programs that have reached maturity. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In parallel, the Air Force <strong>and</strong> its industry partners would continue to <strong>develop new technologies</strong> that could be inserted <strong>into later satellites</strong>, thus <strong>preserving a highly skilled industrial base</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> designated <strong>test case for EASE is</strong> the fifth and sixth Advanced Extremely High Frequency (<strong>AEHF</strong>) <strong>secure communications satellites</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif. The Air Force requested $552.8 million in 2012 as a down payment for the two satellites, which would be funded incrementally for the next several years. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The service asked lawmakers to approve several years of advance appropriations for AEHF</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, which would lock in funding for the procurement</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the 2013 budget request, the Air Force said it will pursue a similar block buy for the fifth and sixth Space Based Infrared System missile warning satellites, also built by Lockheed Martin. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Three of the four <strong>congressional defense committees have considered the AEHF block buy proposal</strong>. The House and Senate Armed Services committees</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which authorize appropriations for the Pentagon, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">supported the concept of the AEHF block buy and recommended fully funding the procurement request for 2012. Both committees were willing to allow the satellites to be funded over multiple years, <strong>but neither was willing to authorize a specific appropriation level for the next few years</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The House Appropriations Committee, meanwhile, was critical, saying information provided by the Air Force on the strategy was “woefully lacking” and characterizing the advance appropriations idea as a “budgetary gimmick.” Nevertheless, the committee’s bill would provide the requested amount of AEHF procurement funding for 2012, though it would trim $67.2 million from the program’s proposed $421.7 million research and development budget. Senate appropriators have not yet marked up their version of the 2012 defense spending bill. Though the Air Force could probably work within the parameters laid out by the three committees, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the AEHF program would have more certainty if advance appropriations are provided</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Conaton said. She acknowledged that the Air Force had not done an adequate job of detailing how it would spend the AEHF technology development funding, and it would soon be able to provide the committees with more insight. Joanne Maguire, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin Space Systems, said </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">block buys</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> of satellites <strong>have the potential to save</strong> 15 to <strong>20 percent</strong> compared to buying satellites individually</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and in a period when the Defense Department is recapitalizing all of its satellite fleets, cost reduction has become a top priority for the government and for her company. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The <strong>EASE</strong> strategy <strong>would create a</strong> more <strong>steady production rhythm, shoring up prospects for</strong> second- and third-tier <strong>component suppliers that might exit the market if production breaks stretch out too long</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Concepts like <strong>EASE can make a difference, but only if the government is all in</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Maguire said. </span></span><br />
<br />
Advance appropriations are key – buying the full constellation now is essential to reduce program costs and avoid production breaks<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Deficit reduction doesn't always mean hard choices.

And unlike initiatives such as the F-35 alternate engine that require up-front investments to save money later, the EASE concept starts saving money right away</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It's an amazingly simple idea. <strong>All Congress needs to do is agree to buy more than one satellite at a time, and then spread the appropriations out over several budget years</strong>. <strong>That's not what the government does today</strong>. <strong>Instead, it buys one costly satellite</strong> in a constellation <strong>at a time, and then waits years to buy the next one -- even though legislators know they will eventually need to buy several satellites of any given type</strong> to complete a constellation. <strong>And because satellites are bought one-at-a-time with all the money appropriated in a single year, staffers can't find the money to buy another satellite for years and contractors can't manage their production processes efficiently</strong>. So <strong>each satellite ends up costing a lot more than it needs to</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Here's an example. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Pentagon is buying</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> Advanced Extremely High Frequency</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (<strong>AEHF</strong>) <strong>communications satellites</strong> that will allow warfighters all over the world to communicate securely even in adverse circumstances. That's <strong>an essential capability and military planners expect to buy several</strong> of the satellites <strong>over the coming decade</strong>. Now, <strong>if Congress buys the next two satellites separately with full funding of each in the year it's requested, the cost for both will be about $4 billion</strong>. <strong>If it buys them in a &quot;block&quot;</strong> (together) <strong>and then spaces the money out over several years as EASE proposes, the two satellites will cost $3.1 billion</strong>. <strong>About $900 million is saved just by doing business differently, without giving anything up</strong>. <strong>And the same approach can be applied to any other satellite constellation where the government plans to buy more than one satellite of the same design, whether it's for missile warning or weather reports</strong> or whatever</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. You can't really call EASE a breakthrough, because </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the N</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ational <strong>R</strong>econnaissance <strong>O</strong>ffice <strong>has been buying its spy satellites this way for a long time</strong>. <strong>But</strong> most of the military satellites the government buys aren't for spying, and <strong>all the other spacecraft are currently being bought one-at-a-time at very high cost</strong>. <strong>By switching to incremental funding of multi-satellite buys, the government can start saving billions of dollars in fiscal 2012</strong>. <strong>It can also help military planners and contractors to start thinking more coherently about how to introduce necessary upgrades into later versions of current satellites</strong>, since we know constellations like AEHF are going to be operating for decades to come. But <strong>the real savings come from being able to use workers and facilities more efficiently</strong>, because when the government commits to buying multiple satellites of the same type in a single &quot;block&quot; <strong>the work can be sequenced to make sure each employee with specialized skills is working every day, rather than waiting around for the next satellite to be funded</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This isn't a budgeting gimmick and there are no catches</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. <strong>Congress can begin saving billions of dollars on military satellites in 2012 without killing any programs</strong> or closing any facilities. <strong>All it needs to do is agree to</strong> what staffers call &quot;<strong>advanced appropriations</strong>,&quot; which is technical language for agreeing to fund satellites over several budget years rather than setting aside all the money in a single year. Once it does that, budgeting for military space will become easier and savings will begin accumulating that can be applied to other purposes such as deficit reduction</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of course, somebody somewhere will probably complain about Congress changing the way it does business. But when you're borrowing $4 billion per day from lenders like China, change is indicated. </span></span><br />

We have taken actions to mitigate impacts where we can, such as our recent reprogramming of $80 million in FY10 funds into the GPS IIIA program to avoid costly programmatic delays and contract renegotiation for the first long-lead production option for space vehicles (SV) 3 and 4. However, our success in mitigating CR impacts to GPS IIIA has limited our flexibility to address other detrimental impacts of a prolonged CR. Additionally, new start limitations prevent the Air Force from carrying out the scheduled award of WGS-7, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">potentially <strong>causing a production break with</strong> estimated cost impacts of up to $50 million <strong>if funding is delayed until the start of FY12</strong>.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the years since the Cold War ended, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> U.S. <strong>military has become heavily dependent upon satellite communications to maintain its global connectivity</strong>. <strong>Without such links, it would be difficult for the military to operate in a coordinated fashion or exchange information critical to situational awareness</strong>. Defense experts have repeatedly warned that <strong>the availability of space-based communications could be compromised</strong> in future conflicts <strong>by the fact that 80-90% of all military traffic is transmitted on vulnerable commercial satcom channels</strong>. However, there is a related problem that far fewer military observers have noticed: <strong>only about 1% of defense communications today are protected against even the most modest jamming threats</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Jamming means overloading key frequencies with so much electronic &quot;noise&quot; that communications cannot get through to intended destinations. It's a simple process in the case of unprotected satellite links, because signals are relatively weak after traveling 22,000 miles from transponders in geosynchronous orbit</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- the orbit that communications satellites must maintain in order to serve as &quot;stationary&quot; links above particular points on the Earth's surface (they aren't really stationary, but they appear to be because their rotation matches that of the Earth). If the satellites were any closer to Earth they would zoom across the surface at a speed of several miles per second, making them unavailable as communications nodes most of the time. So they must sit 22,000 miles above sea level, which makes their signals easy to overwhelm with modest amounts of electromagnetic interference, especially if the jammer is near communications receivers. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The only satellite constellation</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the military is currently building <strong>that can provide protection against the full array of potential communications threats is</strong> the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (<strong>AEHF</strong>) system. AEHF is <strong>designed to cope with everything from jammers to hackers to</strong> scintillation from <strong>thermonuclear explosions</strong>. However, although it will provide ten times as much capacity as the legacy MilStar constellation, it can only carry a small portion of the military communications traffic passing through space portals. As a result, the amount of that traffic that is well protected against jamming will peak at 6-7% in fiscal year 2012, leaving over 90% of joint-force transmissions vulnerable to degradation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That's not a serious problem if the biggest threats we face are rag-tag adversaries such as the Taliban, but </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in a war</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">with China <strong>there's a high likelihood that America's military would lose the use of most of its satcom links</strong> in places like the Western Pacific</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Bush Administration had an initiative for addressing this problem called the Transformational Communications Satellite program, or TSAT. TSAT would have provided internet-like access to U.S. warfighters all over the world, including troops on the move, from a constellation of five very capable satellites. However, TSAT was canceled last year due to astronomical (no pun intended) costs, and </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">now <strong>the military</strong> space community <strong>has no real plan for assuring that a reasonable portion of joint-force communications traffic will be protected against jamming in the future</strong>. <strong>The feasible</strong>, affordable <strong>answer is</strong> not to begin a new program, but <strong>to start incrementally evolving AEHF towards a more robust capability</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I argued in Space News several years ago that such an approach was more likely to work out than trying to implement the complex TSAT initiative, but at the time everybody in the business was still chasing the TSAT opportunity. Now that it's gone, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">military planners need to start thinking about how the government can leverage its investment in AEHF <strong>through</strong> incremental <strong>improvements to each new satellite</strong>. <strong>If that move is not made soon, our warfighters may</strong> one day <strong>face an adversary who knows how to isolate them from the rest of the joint force and then kill them</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />

In order to address current as well as emerging requirements for national security objectives, newer and more powerful systems are being developed and deployed by the U.S. Military. These assets include the Wideband Global Satcom (WGS), Advanced EHF satellites (AEHF) and the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) programs. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Advances in IT are changing the way warfighting and peacekeeping are being conducted. <strong>The ability to transmit critical information in theater in real-time</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or near real-time, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">securely</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> to and from various parts of the globe <strong>has enabled faster deployment of highly mobile forces</strong>. <strong>Bandwidth per soldier requirements has increased tremendously</strong>, and the result among others is that troops have become more capable in adapting quickly to changing conditions in the battlefield</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Satellite communications have played a key role in providing interoperable, robust, communications; however, <strong>the current fleet of satellites has proven to be inadequate in terms of bandwidth supply to address current as well as future operations</strong>. <strong>In the</strong> next, or future, <strong>“network-centric” architecture that will</strong> upgrade or <strong>evolve future operations, advanced communications’ systems will be required</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Advanced military satellite communications are</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often identified, and to a large extent, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">defined by</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the upcoming <strong>AEHF</strong> program</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF will provide</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> global, highly secure, protected, survivable communications for all warfighters</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> serving under the U.S. Department of Defense. Moreover, AEHF will provide greater total capacity and offer higher channel data rates compared to current milstar satellites</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The <strong>higher data rates permit transmission of tactical military communications such as real-time video, battlefield maps and targeting data</strong>. In addition, <strong>AEHF will also provide the critical survivable, protected, and endurable communications to the National Command Authority</strong> including presidential conferencing <strong>in all levels of conflict</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">There is now an undeniable and accepted recognition that militaries around the globe cannot do away with commercial systems. Even if the U.S. Military were to achieve independence in terms of its bandwidth supply, the other benefits such as flexibility and redundancy that the commercial industry offers are invaluable</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Challenges and Requirements FSS and MSS commercial satellites currently provide the same types of applications, including real-time video as well as tactical military communications. Commercial satellites are even a part of UAV missions, currently a growing and highly-critical application suite for warfighting that will increase in the future. Moreover, commercial satellites in terms of bandwidth may be able to throughput higher data rates based on currently available satellites based on bent-pipe and on-board processing programs. The sheer number of commercial satellites currently deployed makes bandwidth availability much higher compared to current and planned military programs, specifically for the U.S. military. In terms of the definition as well as </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the main difference between AEHF and commercial communications satellites, AEHF will provide survivable, highly secure, protected, global communications for all warfighters serving under the U.S. Department of Defense, <strong>whereas</strong> <strong>commercial satellite systems are vulnerable in the event of attacks</strong> or engagements that include nuclear capability</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In terms of the ability to throughput secure, reliable, real-time or near-real time data, commercial systems could play a role in providing advanced communications for military missions. MILSATCOM systems are generally categorized as wideband, protected and narrowband: •Wideband systems provide high capacity, •Protected systems feature antijam, covertness, and nuclear survivability, and •Narrowband systems support users who need mobile voice and low-data-rate communications. In terms of these categories, commercial systems can tap into wideband and narrowband applications via FSS and MSS platforms. Indeed, commercial outsourcing by the U.S. Military has led to healthy leases of wideband/broadband capacity for missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for UAV missions in both countries as well as Pakistan. For narrowband applications, the U.S. Military has had a contract with Iridium, specifically for such capabilities. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> only challenge, or </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">requirement, not met by commercial systems lies in the protected realm</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. By definition, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">protected systems such as AEHF have the ability to</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> avoid, prevent, negate, or mitigate the degradation, disruption, denial, unauthorized access, or exploitation of communications’ services by adversaries or the environment</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. This is particularly epitomized by activities that involve nuclear capabilities</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Another</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> challenge or </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">requirement currently unmet by commercial platforms is the ability to offer wideband capacity in the Polar Regions</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. <strong>AEHF will feature an Advanced Polar System both for wideband as well as protected needs</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The ability of the commercial industry to offer wideband services in Polar regions may change with the upcoming Iridium NEXT constellation. However, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the requirement for protected wideband communications will once again remain a challenge in the commercial realm</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Now that the literature review is complete, it is possible to investigate the potential of NCW. This author has not found any proponents of NCW touting that this concept is the “Silver Bullet” to solve all the problems of future warfare. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Many of the same problems that have plagued warfighters in the past exist today and will exist in the future: fog and friction, competing advances in technologies, the unpredictable nature of human behavior on the battlefield, and asymmetric warfare</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to name only a few. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The issue isn’t the existence of these challenges to modern warfare but how one exploits the advantages of information to mitigate risk and take advantage of strengths in the force to achieve objectives</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.35 Are the potential benefits of NCW worth the opportunity costs associated with aggressively moving forward with the implementation of this new concept? </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The concept of Network Centric Warfare has already moved beyond the “bumper sticker” stage. <strong>NCW is not a fad that will go quietly into the night</strong>. <strong>There is little doubt that DOD is spending significant finite resources to pursue NCW capabilities</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. DOD costs in the area of military electronics, aircraft avionics, vetronics, and missile guidance, communications, electro-optics is approaching $99.57 billion in the 2010.36 </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">There may be changes to terminology</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, shifts in policy, <strong>and alterations in implementation plans</strong>. <strong>However, the core concepts</strong> that relate to leveraging the power of information <strong>will remain</strong>. The <strong>DOD and senior military leaders have been consistent</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> yet cautious </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in their support of a networked force</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld concisely stated the importance a fully networked force in the Transformation Planning Guidance, “We must achieve: fundamentally joint, network-centric, distributed forces capable of rapid decision superiority and massed effects across the operational environment. Realizing these capabilities will require transforming our people, processes, and military forces.”37 ADM Giambastiani, former Commander U.S. Joint Forces Command stated, “A fully collaborative and networked force is an imperative, not a luxury.”38 The former Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, General Michael Haggee said, “The capability to connect disparate units spread over the battlefield will help to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance to commanders who can then call in fire support…Information Technology (IT) will also be critical to Sea Basing, a key component of the Navy’s Sea Power 21 Concept.”39 Vice Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Gen. Peter Chiarelli recently stated, “Access to information can mean the difference between living and dying.”40 General William Wallace, USA (Ret.) goes on to caution that “despite the enormous benefits of using a network, it would be folly to lose sight of the fact that it is still merely a tool to aid the commander in understanding and decisionmaking.”41 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates wrote in his recent Foreign Affairs article, We should be modest about what military force can accomplish and what technology can accomplish. The advances in precision, sensor, information, and satellite technologies have led to extraordinary gains in what the U.S. military can do. The Taliban were dispatched within three months; Saddam’s regime was toppled in three weeks. A button can be pushed in Nevada, and seconds later a pickup truck will explode in Mosul. A bomb dropped from the sky can destroy a targeted house while leaving the one next to it intact. But no one should ever neglect the psychological, cultural, political, and human dimensions of warfare.42 </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The question is not if DOD will proceed with NCW, but how</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.NCW WAY AHEAD </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The DOD has a plan for the implementation of NCW. The plan calls for a holistic approach to the implementation of NCW that investigates the potential of NCO in joint, multinational, and interagency operations</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As previously discussed in this paper, there has been a significant effort to establish the theoretical underpinnings of the concept. The publication, Implementation of Network-Centric Warfare, establishes the outline of the plan to move forward with NCW. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Services are working to integrate information systems, sensors, and decisionmaking processes and technology</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> <strong>to leverage the capabilities of a fully networked joint force</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Air Force Command and Control Constellation network is an example of the integration of C2; ISR; tankers; space, ground, and sea-based systems; and strike platforms to achieve shared awareness in the operational environment to maximize effects.43 Constellation works with FORCEnet (U.S. Navy), and LandWarNet (U.S. Army) to achieve synergy on the battlefield.</span></span><br />

The Iraq war's real cost,</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> for example, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">has been about $3 trillion</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, per the analysis of Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes -- and even &quot;official&quot; figures put expenditures around $1 trillion. As for human capital, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">U.S. troops are exhausted by repeated lengthy deployments against foes who, if they were lined up, would hardly fill a single division of Marines. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">In a very real sense, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the United States has come close to punching itself out since 9/11. When militaries don't keep up with the pace of change, countries suffer. In</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> World War I, the failure to grasp the implications of mass production led not only to senseless slaughter, but also to the end of great empires and the bankruptcy of others. The inability to comprehend the meaning of mechanization at the outset of World War II handed vast tracts of territory to the Axis powers and very nearly gave them victory. The failure to grasp the true meaning of nuclear weapons led to a suicidal arms race and a barely averted apocalypse during the Cuban missile crisis. Today, the signs of misunderstanding still abound. For example, in an age of supersonic anti-ship missiles, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the U.S. Navy has spent countless billions of dollars on &quot;surface warfare ships&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> whose aluminum superstructures will likely burn to the waterline if hit by a single missile. Yet Navy doctrine calls for them to engage missile-armed enemies at eyeball range in coastal waters. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The U.S. Army, meanwhile, has spent tens of billions of dollars on its &quot;Future Combat Systems,&quot; a grab bag of new weapons, vehicles, and communications gadgets now seen by its own proponents as almost completely unworkable </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">for the kind of military operations that land forces will be undertaking in the years ahead. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The oceans of information the systems would generate each day would clog the command circuits</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> so that carrying out even the simplest operation would be a terrible slog. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">And the U.S. Air Force, beyond its well-known devotion to massive bombing, remains in love with extremely advanced and extremely expensive fighter aircraft -- despite losing only one fighter plane to an enemy fighter in nearly 40 years.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Although </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the hugely costly F-22 turned out to function poorly and is being canceled</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> after enormous investment in its production, the Air Force has by no means given up. Instead, the more advanced F-35 will be produced, at a cost running in the hundreds of billions of dollars. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">All this in an era in which what the United States already has is far better than anything else in the world and will remain so for many decades</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. These developments suggest that </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the United States is spending huge amounts of money in ways that are actually making Americans less secure, not only against irregular insurgents, but also against smart countries building different sorts of militaries.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> And the problem goes well beyond weapons and other high-tech items. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">What's missing most of all from the U.S. military's arsenal is a deep understanding of networking</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the loose but lively interconnection between people that creates and brings a new kind of collective intelligence, power, and purpose to bear -- for good and ill. Civil society movements around the world have taken to networking in ways that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">have done far more to advance the cause of freedom</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">than the U.S. military's problematic efforts to bring democracy to Iraq and Afghanistan at gunpoint. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">As for &quot;uncivil society,&quot; </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">terrorists and transnational criminals have embraced connectivity to coordinate global operations</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> in ways that simply were not possible in the past. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Before the Internet and the World Wide Web, a terrorist network operating cohesively in more than 60 countries could not have existed. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Today, a world full of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallabs awaits -- and not all of them will fail. But </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the principles of networking don't have to help only the bad guys. If fully embraced, they can lead to a new kind of military -- and</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> even a new kind of war. The conflicts of the future should and could be less costly and destructive, with armed forces more able to protect the innocent and deter or defend against aggression</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Vast tank armies may no longer battle it out across the steppes, but modern warfare has indeed become exceedingly fast-paced and complex. Still, there is a way to reduce this complexity to just three simple rules that can save untold amounts of blood and treasure in the netwar age. Rule 1: &quot;Many and Small&quot; Beats &quot;Few and Large.&quot; </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The greatest problem traditional militaries face today is that they are organized to wage big wars and have difficulty orienting themselves to fight small ones. The demands of large-scale conflicts have led to reliance on a few big units rather than on a lot of little ones.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> For example, the Marines have only three active-duty divisions, the U.S. Army only ten. The Navy has just 11 carrier strike groups, and the Air Force about three dozen attack aircraft &quot;wings.&quot; Almost 1.5 million active service members have been poured into these and a few other supporting organizational structures. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It is no wonder that the U.S. military has exhausted itself in the repeated deployments</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> since the 9/11 attacks. It has a chronic &quot;scaling problem,&quot; making it unable to pursue smaller tasks with smaller numbers. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Add in the traditional, hierarchical military mindset, which holds that more is always better</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> (the corollary belief being that one can only do worse with less), </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and you get massive approaches to little wars.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> This was the case during the Vietnam War, too, when the prevailing military organizational structure of the 1960s -- not much different from today's -- drove decision-makers to pursue a big-unit war against a large number of very small insurgent units. The final result: 500,000-plus troops deployed, countless billions spent, and a war lost. The iconic images were the insurgents' AK-47 individual assault rifles, of which there were hundreds of thousands in use at any moment, juxtaposed against the U.S. Air Force's B-52s, of which just a hundred or so massed together in fruitless attempts to bomb Hanoi into submission. The same problem persists today, the updated icons being the insurgents' thousands of improvised explosive devices and the Americans' relative handful of drones. It is ironic that the U.S. war on terrorism commenced in the Afghan mountains with the same type of B-52 bombers and the same problematic results that attended the Vietnam War. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The U.S. military is not unaware of these problems. The Army has incrementally increased the number of brigades</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> -- which typically include between 3,000 and 4,000 trigger-pullers -- from less than three dozen in 2001 to almost 50 today. And the Marines now routinely subdivide their forces into &quot;expeditionary units&quot; of several hundred troops each. But </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">these changes hardly begin the needed shift from a military of the &quot;few and large&quot; to one of the &quot;many and small</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.&quot; That's because U.S. military leaders have not sufficiently grasped that even quite small units -- like a platoon of 50 or so soldiers -- can wield great power when connected to others, especially friendly indigenous forces, and when networking closely with even a handful of attack aircraft. Yet the evidence is there. For example, beginning in late 2006 in Iraq, the U.S. command shifted little more than 5 percent of its 130,000 troops from about three dozen major (i.e., town-sized) operating bases to more than a hundred small outposts, each manned by about 50 soldiers. This was a dramatic shift from few-large to many-small, and it soon worked wonders in reducing violence, beginning well before the &quot;surge&quot; troops arrived. In part this happened because the physical network of platoon-sized outposts facilitated social networking with the large numbers of small tribal groups who chose to join the cause, forming the core of the &quot;Awakening&quot; movement. The Pentagon's reluctance to see the new possibilities -- reflected in the shrilly repeated calls for more troops, first in Iraq, then in Afghanistan -- stems in part from the usual generalized fear of change, but also from concern that a many-and-small force would have trouble against a traditional massed army. Say, like North Korea's. Then again, perhaps the best example of a many-and-small military that worked against foes of all sizes was the Roman legion. For many centuries, legionary maniples (Latin for &quot;handfuls&quot;) marched out -- in their flexible checkerboard formations -- and beat the massive, balky phalanxes of traditional foes, while dealing just as skillfully with loose bands of tribal fighters. Rule 2: Finding Matters More Than Flanking. Ever since Theban general Epaminondas overloaded his army's left wing to strike at the Spartan right almost 2,400 years ago at Leuctra, hitting the enemy in the flank has been the most reliable maneuver in warfare. Flank attacks can be seen in Frederick the Great's famous &quot;oblique order&quot; in his 18th-century battles, in Erwin Rommel's repeated &quot;right hooks&quot; around the British in North Africa in 1941, and in Norman Schwarzkopf's famous &quot;left hook&quot; around the Iraqis in 1991. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Flanking has quite a pedigree. Flanking also formed a basis for the march up Mesopotamia by U.S. forces in 2003. But something odd happened this time.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> In the words of military historian John Keegan, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the large Iraqi army of more than 400,000 troops just &quot;melted away</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.&quot; There were no great battles of encirclement and only a handful of firefights along the way to Baghdad. Instead, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Iraqis largely waited until their country was overrun and then mounted an insurgency based on tip-and-run attacks and bombings. Thus did war cease to be driven by mass-on-mass confrontation, but rather by a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">hider-finder dynamic</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> In a world of networked war, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">armies will have to redesign how they fight</span><span class="UnderlineChar"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, </span></strong></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">keeping in mind that the enemy of the future will have to be found before it can be fought</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. To some extent this occurred in the Vietnam War, but that was a conflict during which the enemy obligingly (and quite regularly) massed its forces in major offensives: held off in 1965, defeated in 1968 and 1972, and finally winning in 1975. In Iraq, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">there weren't mass assaults, but a new type of irregular warfare in which a series of small attacks no longer signaled buildup toward a major battle.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> This is the path being taken by the Taliban in Afghanistan and is clearly the concept of global operations used by al Qaeda. At the same time, the U.S. military has shown it can adapt to such a fight</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Indeed, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">when it finally improved its position in Iraq, the change was driven by a vastly enhanced ability to find the enemy. The physical network of small outposts was linked to and enlivened by a social network of tribal fighters willing to work with U.S. forces. These elements, taken together, shone a light on al Qaeda i</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">n Iraq, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and in the glare of this illumination the militants were easy prey</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> for the small percentage of coalition forces actually waging the campaign against them. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Think of this as a new role for the military. Traditionally, they've seen themselves largely as a &quot;shooting organization&quot;; in this era, they will also have to become a &quot;sensory organization.&quot; This approach can surely work in Afghanistan</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">as well as it has in Iraq -- and in counterinsurgency campaigns elsewhere -- so long as the key emphasis is placed on creating the system needed for &quot;finding.&quot; In some places, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">friendly tribal elements might be less important than technological means, most notably in cyberspace, al Qaeda's &quot;virtual safe haven.&quot; As war shifts from flanking to finding</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, the hope is that instead of exhausting one's military in massive expeditions against elusive foes, success can be achieved with a small, networked corps of &quot;finders.&quot; So a conflict like the war on terror is not &quot;led&quot; by some great power; rather, many participate in it, with each adding a piece to the mosaic that forms an accurate picture of enemy strength and dispositions. This </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">second shift -- to finding -- has the potential to greatly empower those &quot;many and small&quot; units </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">made necessary by Rule 1. All that is left is to think through the operational concept that will guide them. Rule 3: Swarming Is the New Surging. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Terrorists, knowing they will never have an edge in numbers, have pioneered a way of war that allows them to make the most of their slender resources: swarming. This is a form of attack undertaken by small units coming from several directions or hitting many targets at the same time.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Since 9/11, al Qaeda has mounted but a few major stand-alone strikes -- in Bali, Madrid, and London -- while the network has conducted multiple significant swarming campaigns in Turkey, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia featuring &quot;wave attacks&quot; aimed at overloading their targets' response capabilities. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Such attacks have persisted even in post-surge Iraq where,</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> as Gen. David Petraeus noted in a recent speech, the </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">enemy shows a &quot;sophistication&quot; among the militants &quot;in carrying out simultaneous attacks&quot; against major government targets.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Perhaps the clearest example of a terrorist swarm was the November 2008 attack on Mumbai, apparently mounted by the Lashkar-e-Taiba group. The assault force consisted of just 10 fighters who broke into five two-man teams and struck simultaneously at several different sites. It took more than three days to put them down -- and cost the lives of more than 160 innocents -- as the Indian security forces best suited to deal with this problem had to come from distant New Delhi and were configured to cope with a single threat rather than multiple simultaneous ones. In another sign of the gathering swarm, the August 2008 Russian incursion into Georgia, rather than being a blast from the Cold War past, heralded the possibility that </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">more traditional armies can master the art of omnidirectional attack</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. In this instance, Russian regular forces were augmented by ethnic militias fighting all over the area of operations -- and there was swarming in cyberspace at the same time. Indeed, the distributed denial of service attack, long a staple of cyberwarriors, is a model form of swarming. And in this instance, Georgian command and control was seriously disrupted by the hackers. Simultaneous attack from several directions might be at the very cutting edge in conflict, but its lineage is quite old. Traditional tribal warfare, whether by nomadic horse archers or bush fighters, always featured some elements of swarms. The zenith of this kind of fighting probably came with the 13th-century Mongols, who had a name for this doctrine: &quot;Crow Swarm.&quot; When the attack was not carried out at close quarters by charging horsemen, but was instead conducted via arrows raining down on massed targets, the khans called it &quot;Falling Stars.&quot; With such tactics, the Mongols carved out the largest empire the world has ever seen, and kept it for a few centuries. But swarming was eclipsed by the rise of guns in the 15th century, which strongly favored massed volley fire. Industrial processes encouraged even more massing, and mechanization favored large flank maneuvers more than small swarms. Now again, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in an age of global interdependence replete with advanced information technologies, even quite small teams of fighters can cause huge amounts of disruption</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. There is an old Mongol proverb: &quot;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">With 40 men you can shake the world.&quot; Look at what al Qaeda did with less than half that number on Sept. 11, 2001.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> This point was made by the great British strategist B.H. Liddell Hart in his biography of T.E. Lawrence, a master of the swarm in his own right. Liddell Hart, writing in 1935, predicted that at some point &quot;</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the old concentration of force is likely to be replaced by an intangibly ubiquitous distribution of force -- pressing everywhere, yet assailable nowhere</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.&quot; Now, swarming is making a comeback, but at a time when few organized militaries are willing or able to recognize its return. For the implications of this development -- most notably, that </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">fighting units in very small numbers can do amazing things if used to swarm -- are profoundly destabilizing. The most radical change is this: Standing armies can be sharply reduced in size, if properly reconfigured </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">and trained to fight in this manner.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Instead of continually &quot;surging&quot; large numbers of troops to trouble spots, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the basic response of a swarm force would be to go swiftly, in small numbers, and strike the attackers at many points. I</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">n the future, it will take a swarm to defeat a swarm. Almost 20 years ago, I began a debate about networks that blossomed into an unlikely friendship with Vice Adm. Art Cebrowski, the modern strategic thinker most likely to be as well remembered as Alfred Thayer Mahan, the great American apostle of sea power. He was the first in the Pentagon power structure to warm to my notions of developing fighting networks, embracing the idea of opening lots of lateral communications links between &quot;sensors and shooters.&quot; We disagreed, however, about the potential of networks. Cebrowski thought that &quot;network-centric warfare&quot; could be used to improve the performance of existing tools -- including aircraft carriers -- for some time to come. I thought that networking implied a wholly new kind of navy, one made up of small, swift vessels, many of them remotely operated. Cebrowski, who passed away in late 2005, clearly won this debate, as the U.S. Navy remains heavily invested in being a &quot;few-large&quot; force -- if one that is increasingly networked. In an implicit nod to David Ronfeldt's and my ideas, the Navy even has a Netwar Command now. Swarming has also gained some adherents. The most notable has been Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper, who famously used swarm tactics in the last great Pentagon war game, &quot;Millennium Challenge 2002,&quot; to sink several aircraft carriers at the outset of the imagined conflict. But rather than accept that something quite radical was going on, the referees were instructed to &quot;refloat&quot; the carriers, and the costly game -- its price tag ran in the few hundred millions -- continued. Van Riper walked out. Today, some in the U.S. military still pursue the idea of swarming, mostly in hopes of employing large numbers of small unmanned aerial vehicles in combat. But military habits of mind and institutional interests continue to reflect a greater audience for surges than swarms. What if senior military leaders wake up and decide to take networks and swarming absolutely seriously? If they ever do, it is likely that the scourges of terrorism and aggression will become less a part of the world system. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Such a military would be smaller but quicker to respond, less costly but more lethal. The world system would become far less prone to many of the kinds of violence that have plagued it</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Networking and swarming are the organizational and doctrinal keys, respectively, to the strategic puzzle that has been waiting to be solved in our time. A networked U.S. military that knows how to swarm would have much smaller active manpower -- easily two-thirds less than the more than 2 million serving today -- but would be organized in hundreds more little units of mixed forces. The model for military intervention would be the 200 Special Forces &quot;horse soldiers&quot; who beat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan late in 2001. Such teams would deploy quickly and lethally, with ample reserves for relieving &quot;first waves&quot; and dealing with other crises. At sea, instead of concentrating firepower in a handful of large, increasingly vulnerable supercarriers, the U.S. Navy would distribute its capabilities across many hundreds of small craft armed with very smart weapons. Given their stealth and multiple uses, submarines would stay while carriers would go. And in the air, the &quot;wings&quot; would reduce in size but increase in overall number, with mere handfuls of aircraft in each. Needless to say, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">networking means that these small pieces would still be able to join together to swarm enemies, large or small.</span></span><br />

That makes hegemony sustainable<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span class="CiteChar"><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Wilson 4</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (Clay Wilson, Specialist in Technology and National Security Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division at the Congressional Research Service, June 2, 2004, “Network Centric Warfare: Background and Oversight Issues for Congress”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/33858.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/33858.pdf</a> bcliff)</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Advantages of NCW.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Emerging literature supports the theory that power is increasingly derived from information sharing, information access, and speed. This view has been supported by results of recent military operational experiences 22 showing that when forces are truly joint, with comprehensively integrated capabilities and operating according to the principles of NCW, they can fully exploit the highly path-dependent 23 nature of information age warfare.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Some resulting military advantages of NCW operations include the following: (1)</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Networked forces can consist of smaller-size unitsthat can travel lighter and faster, meaning fewer troops</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> with fewer platforms and carrying fewer supplies </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">can perform a mission effectively</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, or differently, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">at a lower cost. (2)Networked forces can fight using new tactics. During OIF, U.S. Army forces utilized movement that was described by some as “swarm tactics.”</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Because </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">networking allows soldiers to keep track of each other</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">when they are out of one another’s sight, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">forces could move forward in Iraq spread out in smaller independent units</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, avoiding the need to maintain a tight formation. Using “swarm tactics,” </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">unit movements are conducted quickly, without securing the rear. All units know each other’s location. If one unit gets into trouble, other independent units nearby can quickly come to their aid, “swarming” to attack the enemy from all directions at once.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Benefits may include the following: (1) </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">fewer troops and less equipment are needed, so </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">waging war is less expensive;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">(</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">2) it is harder for an enemy to effectively attack a widely dispersed formation; (3) combat units can cover much more ground</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, because they do not have to maintain a formation or slow down for lagging vehicles; (4) </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">knowing the location of all friendly units reduces fratricide</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> during combat operations; and (5) </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">swarming allows an attack to be directed straight into the heart of an enemy command structure,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> undermining support by operating from the inside, rather than battling only on the periphery. (3)</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The way individual soldiers think and act on the battlefield is also changing. When a unit encounters a difficult problem in the field, they radio the Tactical Operations Center, which types the problem into an online chat room</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, using Microsoft Chat software. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The problem is then “swarmed” by experts who may be located as far away as the Pentagon. 24 (4)The sensor-to-shooter time is reduced. Using NCW systems, soldiers in the field have the capability to conduct an “on site analysis” of raw intelligence </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">from sensor displays, rather than waiting for return analysis reports to arrive back from the continental United States. 25 </span></span><br />

One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">nuclear</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> weapons. That could make </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">wars</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">embargos</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">would disrupt trade</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe 's stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">War could erupt between China and Taiwan</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Russia and Georgia</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, forcing</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> its </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Europe</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">an allies </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">to</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> decide whether to </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">intervene</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Conflict between India and Pakistan</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> remains possible, as does conflict between </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Iran and</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Israel or other </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Middle Eastern states. These</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, too, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">could draw in</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> other </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">great powers</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, including the United States. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Such conflicts</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">are</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> more </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">likely</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to erupt </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">if</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">weakens</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> or withdraws from its positions of </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">regional dominance</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe -- if it adopted what some call a strategy of &quot;</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">offshore balancing</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">&quot; -- this could in time </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">increase</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the likelihood of </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">conflict involving Russia</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">and its near neighbors, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">which could</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> in turn </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">draw the</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">back in under unfavorable circumstances</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there. The vital </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">interest</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the United States has </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> access to </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">oil</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">make it unlikely that American leaders</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> could or </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">would stand back</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn 't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">states of the region, particularly Iran</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, to expand and </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">fill the vacuum</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">withdrawal from Iraq</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">will produce</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> a new </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">instability</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, one </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">likely to draw the U</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">nited </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">tates </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">back in</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> again. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The alternative to American</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> regional </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">predominance</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> likely to be one of</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">intensified competition among nations </span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and nationalist movements</span></u></span><br />

Although Europe would almost certainly not see the return to competitive balancing among regional powers (i.e., competition and even military rivalry between France and Germany) of the kind that some realist scholars of international relations have predicted,&quot; elsewhere the dangers could increase. </span><span style="color: black;">In Asia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would have strong motivation to acquire nuclear weapons – which they have the technological capacity to do quite quickly. Instability and regional competition could also escalate, not only between India and Pakistan, but also in Southeast Asia</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> involving Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and possibly the Philippines. </span><span style="color: black;">Risks in the Middle East would be likely to increase, with regional competition among </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">the major countries of the Gulf region (</span><span style="color: black;">Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq) as well as Egypt, Syria, and Israel. Major regional wars, eventually involving the use of weapons of mass destruction plus human suffering on a vast scale, floods of refugees, economic disruption, and risks to oil supplies are all readily conceivable</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="color: black;">Based on past experience,theU</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="color: black;">S</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="color: black;">would almost certainly be <strong>drawn back into</strong> these areas, whether to defend friendly states, to cope with a humanitarian catastrophe, or to prevent a hostile power from dominating an entire region</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Steven Peter </span><span style="color: black;">Rosen has thus fit-tingly observed, &quot;If the logic of American empire is unappealing, it is not at all clear that the alternatives are that much more attractive.&quot;</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">2z Similarly, Niall </span><span style="color: black;">Ferguson has added that those who dislike American predominance ought to bear in mind that the alternative may</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> not </span><span style="color: black;">be</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> a world of competing great powers, but one with no hegemon at all.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">NCO is a theory which proposes that the application of information age concepts to speed </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">communications</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> increase </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">situational awareness through networking improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Proponents advocate that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">this allows combat units to be smaller in size, operate more independently and effectively, and undertake a different range of missions than nonnetworked forces</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.7 Networked sensors are sources of data, and data is processed into information. NCO is intended to increase collaboration through enabling the free flow of information across the battlespace so that acquired data is shared, processed into information, and then provided quickly to the person or system that needs it.8 Proponents argue that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">a strong and flexible network linking military forces will speed up the pace of warfare, prevent or reduce fratricide, and also provide the means for getting more combat power out of a smaller force</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.9 These proponents also argue that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">theory and practice have merged</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> through <strong>achieving proof of concept in</strong> the major operations phase of Operation <strong>Iraqi Freedom</strong>, and</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">NCO is now an accepted and enduring part of current and future combat</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.10 Procurement policy to support joint NCO efforts is also intended to improve economic efficiency by eliminating stovepipe systems, parochial interests, redundant and non-interoperable systems, and by optimizing capital planning investments for present and future information technology systems. Command and control objectives of NCO include the following: (1) Self-synchronization, or doing what needs to be done without traditional orders. (2) Improved understanding of higher command’s intent. (3) Improved understanding of the operational situation at all levels of command. (4) Increased ability to tap into the collective knowledge of all U.S. (and coalition) forces to reduce the “fog and friction” commonly referred to in descriptions of fighting.11 Some argue that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">as</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> new <strong>concepts and technologies are proven</strong> over time, <strong>NCO may</strong> also <strong>become a stabilizing deterrence against extended conflict</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;The team of folks behind the first AEHF mission is a great set of Americans who have dedicated many years of their life to put this satellite into orbit,&quot; said Col. Michael Sarchet, commander of the Protected Satellite Communications Group at the Space and Missile Systems Center. &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is a very sophisticated satellite because it </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">built to provide the highest levels of protection</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> for our nation's most critical users. <strong>Encryption, low probability of intercept and detection, jammer resistance</strong> and the ability to penetrate the electro-magnetic interference caused by nuclear weapons are essential features when communication can be of the highest priority</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; said Sarchet. This maiden AEHF bird should be ready, if all goes well, to enter service early next year from an orbital location dictated by the needs at that time. [Most Destructive Space Weapon Concepts] Controllers plan to spend the next 100 days or so using the craft's conventional and exotic ion propulsion systems to circularize the orbit 22,300 miles over the equator at 90 degrees West longitude for months-long testing. Built in a collaboration between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, this and </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">future AEHF spacecraft will replace <strong>the aging Milstar satellite fleet</strong> to provide faster communications simultaneously to more users</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> through modernized technology. &quot;It really does mark a new era for us. Milstar was the first protected (communications satellite) system that we ever put up and it's done a great job for us. We launched the first one back in February 1994. If you add up all the on-orbit life of the five vehicles up there operating, we've got over 56 years experience with </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Milstar</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; said Col. William Harding, the Military Satellite Communications Systems Wing vice commander at Los Angeles Air Force Base. &quot;But it </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is getting older. All five of the spacecraft are past their 7-year mean mission duration and two of them <strong>are past their</strong> 10-year <strong>design life</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">it's time to move on to the next version -- AEHF</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Designers say </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">one AEHF spacecraft has more capacity than Milstar's</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> five-satellite <strong>constellation combined and</strong> its <strong>faster data rates</strong> will benefit tactical military communications, enabling higher quality maps, targeting data and live video to be transmitted without being detected by the enemy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> also <strong>will provide</strong> a five-fold increase in the numbers of communication coverage opportunities</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> so that more terminals spread over more of the globe will be able to access more communications resources,&quot; Harding said. The new satellites will be crosslinked with the existing Milstars, and the AEHF are compatible with existing user equipment. &quot;</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The benefits also include</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> use of small terminals that can provide high data rate channels, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">resilience against electronic warfare and cyber attack, and survivable</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, high availability communications connections across the full spectrum of military operations</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> from peacetime training to nuclear warfare</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; Sarchet said. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF was envisioned to keep communications flowing between the military and civilian leadership in any extreme wartime environment, giving the U.S. information superiority</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Communications relayed through AEHF can include critical support to Special Operations, situational awareness for Army troops, giving last-minute targeting information to en-route Air Force fighters and transmitting Tomahawk missile updates to the Navy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">For the nation's nuclear forces, these hardened satellites would be the communications lifeline for crisis response and war planning in the most dire circumstances imaginable</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Communications links for control of the U.S. nuclear force</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, force direction from the president of the United States, missile attack early warning, missile defense, communications support to Special Operations and high-speed anti-jam protected communications for tactical forces,&quot; said Sarchet. Milstar and its </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> successor </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">are far different from the other types of communications satellites operated by the military</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Navy-led </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">UHF</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> system </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">provides mobile communications to a large number of user terminals but at low data rates</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

In fact, says the study, &quot;</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">this may be <strong>an easier alternative for terrorist groups than</strong> building or <strong>acquiring a nuclear weapon</strong> or dirty bomb <strong>themselves</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;.

Extinction<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Morgan ‘9</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (Dennis Ray Morgan, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, South Korea, “World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race,” Futures, 41(10), December 2009, ScienceDirect)</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what most terrorists obviously already know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange. As Moore points out, all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States” [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities [10]. In that case, of course, Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on. <strong>Any</strong> accident, <strong>mistaken communication</strong>, false signal</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or “lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">could, in a matter of</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> a few <strong>minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons</strong>, and <strong>once a weapon is used</strong>, then <strong>the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is</strong> actually <strong>less probable</strong> since <strong>each country would act under the “use them or lose them” strategy</strong> and psychology; <strong>restraint by one power would be interpreted as</strong> a <strong>weakness</strong> by the other, <strong>which could be exploited as a window of opportunity</strong> to “win” the war</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In other words, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">once Pandora's Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, “everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self-determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors” In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">once even just one is used, it is very likely that</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> many, if not <strong>all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of</strong> much of <strong>human civilization</strong> while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Pentagon’s first National Security Space Strategy and its recently released budget request for space are attempting <strong>to prioritize procurement</strong> and operations <strong>after a decade of problematic performance</strong></span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. But work still needs to be done. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Air Force’s unclassified space budget saw a nearly 10% boost in fiscal 2012</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">—to $8.7 billion—from the $8 billion request in fiscal 2011. A portion of this is intended to increase and stabilize the buy of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV) as the government assumes the role of sole supporter of the United Launch Alliance and its massive industrial base in light of an unrealized commercial market. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Even with the boost in funding</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. James Cartwright says that </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the projects now scheduled are impossible to execute within the current planning figures</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. This, he says, underscores the need to work with international partners in areas such as space situational awareness, communications and, perhaps, shared missile warning. “We still can’t afford most of the constellations we have up there. . . . At some point you have to come to a position of partnering” to share the financial burden, Cartwright said last week. “We have this construct where we believe everything has got to come from us . . . but we fight in combined constructs” on the ground, at sea and in the air. He advocates for trust with partners to also provide key pieces of space capabilities—such as augmented intelligence collection and, possibly, precision navigation and timing signals. He stopped short, however, of suggesting that the Pentagon could curtail its buy of Global Positioning System III satellites, being developed by Lockheed Martin; this request is for $978 million in development and procurement. Perhaps underscoring the fact that Pentagon leadership still lacks a unified view on this subject, Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn notes that some missions will continue to be handled solely by the U.S., though the “goal is to move away from the world where the U.S. develops unilateral strategy.” Thus, his focus appears to be more on collaboration rather than interdependence. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Another initiative in the National Security Space Strategy is to improve support for the space industrial base, which experts worry has atrophied since the end of the Cold War</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Lynn says </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the U.S. is still the top provider of space capabilities, but</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">its share of the market is waning. Previously, the U.S. comprised about 66% of the space market; that figure is now less than 40%</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Air Force’s approach for military space spending is to buy smarter, beginning with more stable and predictable funding</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. Gone are the days when the Air Force would simply put a “wedge” of funding into the budget for a program without fully understanding the out-year financial impact. “We need to fully fund programs,” says Maj. Gen. John Hyten, space program director for the Air Force acquisition office. “We don’t want to just put numbers in the budget.” </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Included in the fiscal 2012 budget request is a new strategy to procure satellites, the</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency (</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">EASE</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">) </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">buy of</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Advanced, Extremely High-Frequency (</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">) </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Space-Based Infrared System (</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Sbirs) satellites</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">, both produced at Lockheed Martin’s Sunnyvale, Calif., facility. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The three-pronged EASE strategy includes stable funding for a block buy of two of each satellite type; parallel funding provided separately for continued product improvement and research work</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> (including competitive projects) </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">for the next-generation upgrades or designs; and parallel work on the mission area’s architecture</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Implementation of the procurement portion of EASE is fashioned somewhat after multi-year buys for aircraft. The goal is to incrementally fund buys of two satellites at a time to keep a stable stream of income for the prime contractor and its base of subcontractors, all of which lead to some savings</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. As with aircraft procurements, the goal is to achieve at least 10% savings in the cost of the satellites, but Hyten believes they can get even lower than that. “You take the savings that you find in terms of lower cost on the satellite and reinvest them through a capabilities improvement program,” says Erin Conaton, undersecretary of the Air Force. The Air Force would traditionally spend about $4 billion buying AEHF 5 and 6, Hyten says. In fiscal 2012, it is requesting $550 million as an initial payment for these two satellites; additional funding would be requested up through fiscal 2017 to complete the buys. The Sbirs block buy would follow, beginning in fiscal 2013. The request related to EASE in fiscal 2012 is for $185 million. A major chunk, $550 million, would be requested in fiscal 2013 with five more years of additional funding to complete the buy. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Though multi-year funding has become a regular practice for military aircraft production, lawmakers might eye an incremental satellite funding strategy with more skepticism. The Air Force lacks examples of satellite programs delivering on time and cost, and lawmakers are leery of obligating future funds for projects. “<strong>This is asking Congress to do business in a different way</strong></span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">,” Hyten says. Conaton says </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 6pt;">and Sbirs</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> <strong>were</strong> both <strong>at key points in</strong> </span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">their <strong><u>production cycles, allowing for them to serve as the pathfinders for EASE</u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">. However, Congress is expected to review this request this summer, well before the Pentagon has a chance to demonstrate the capabilities of the first AEHF and Sbirs satellites produced with development funding. Officials say that </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">if the EASE concept is accepted by Congress, they plan to implement the strategy for other programs</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, including</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Boeing’s </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Wideband Global Satcom and</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> Lockheed Martin’s </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">GPS III</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

More importantly, from the aspect of safety, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">the lack of a defined mission can negatively affect workforce morale and the ability to attract and maintain the necessary skill sets needed for this high-technology venture</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The lack of clarity and constancy of purpose increases the likelihood that essential knowledge and competencies in the workforce</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> (either contractor or Government), such as those involving important safety considerations, lessons learned, and past experience, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">will not be present to effectively reduce risk going into the future</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. Even for commercial transportation to LEO, we find uncertainty. What is to be the acquisition strategy to integrate commercial programs to support NASA’s LEO mission? What is to be the system of oversight that protects both NASA astronaut safety and general public safety, given a system of commercial providers? If something goes wrong, who would be liable? When one considers assigning Government “employees” (i.e., astronauts) to a commercial vehicle, what are the criteria for validating their safety, what is the process for determining that the criteria have been met, and how do we know that initial safety precautions/designs have been maintained? In effect, how safe is safe enough for either exploration or sustainment missions? Clearly, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">uncertainty is driving the safety risk factor to a higher level</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">, as it does in any endeavor. Space travel’s significant challenges merely heighten the exposure and the consequences. NASA’s stated goals from 2008 to 2010 have changed dramatically. The Moon and Mars sequential exploration objectives were substantially changed or discarded, and associated </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">hardware development such as</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> the </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Constellation</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> Program </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">was proposed</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> for cancellation. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">These changes</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">, together with others such as questions regarding the use of Orion, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">are examples of how uncertainty has become a critical issue. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">A key point has been made by each Center that the ASAP has visited over this past year—</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">the lack of guidance, clarity, and mission has increased the potential for risk, negative consequences to the workforce, and additional expense resulting from duplicative efforts or efforts that are ultimately determined to be unnecessary due to a change of course</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. In the ASAP’s view, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">it is not in the Nation’s best interest to continue functioning in this manner</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. The Congress, the White House, and NASA must quickly reach a consensus position on the future of the Agency and the future of the United States in space. The discussion must move beyond LEO and on to the necessary steps needed to achieve our future in space, whatever that might be. The constancy of purpose drives workforce loyalty and high achievement and attracts high levels of expertise that clearly make for a safer and lower-risk solution. The ASAP recognizes that this is a fundamental problem that NASA alone cannot solve. It goes beyond the Agency—and clearly is on the shoulders of the Administration and Congress, and that is where it ultimately must be addressed.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Great power status is achieved through competition between nations. This competition is often based on advancing science and technology and applying these advancements to enabling new operational capabilities. A great power that succeeds in this competition adds to its power while a great power that does not compete or does so ineffectively or by choice, becomes comparatively less powerful</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. Eventually, it loses the great power status and then must align itself with another great power for protection. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As the pace of science and technology advancement has increased, so has the potential for the pace of change of great power status</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. While the U.S. &quot;invented&quot; powered flight in 1903, a decade later leadership in this area had shifted to Europe. Within a little more than a decade after the Wright Brothers' first flights, the great powers of Europe were introducing aeronautics into major land warfare through the creation of air forces. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, it was forced to rely on French-built aircraft. Twenty years later, as the European great powers were on the verge of beginning another major European war, the U.S. found itself in a similar situation where its choice to diminish national investment in aeronautics during the 1920's and 1930's—you may recall that this was the era of General Billy Mitchell and his famous efforts to promote military air power—placed U.S. air forces at a significant disadvantage compared to those of Germany and Japan. This was crucial because military air power was quickly emerging as the &quot;game changer&quot; for conventional warfare. Land and sea forces increasingly needed capable air forces to survive and generally needed air superiority to prevail. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">With the great power advantages of becoming spacefaring expected to be comparable to those derived from becoming air-faring in the 1920's and 1930's, a delay by the U.S. in enhancing its great power strengths through expanded national space power may result in a reoccurrence of the <strong>rapid emergence</strong> of new or the rapid growth of <strong>current great powers</strong> to the point that they are capable of effectively challenging the U.S. Many great powers—China, India, and Russia—are already speaking of plans for developing spacefaring capabilities</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. Yet, today, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the U.S. retains a</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> commanding aerospace technological lead over these nations. <strong>A strong effort</strong> by the U.S. to become a true spacefaring nation</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">, starting in 2009 with the new presidential administration, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">may yield a </span></u><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">generation or longer lead in space</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">, not just through prudent increases in military strength but also through the other areas of great power competition discussed above. This is an advantage that the next presidential administration should exercise.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">China’s space capabilities have improved rapidly in the past decade and a half. China’s Long March series have arguably become the world’s most reliable medium space launch vehicles.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;"> China has also developed and deployed a series of weather satellites; electro-optical reconnaissance satellites; position, navigation, and timing (PNT) satellites; oceansurveillance satellites; synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites; highcapacity communications satellites; and possibly signals-intelligence or electronic-intelligence satellites. China has also become the third country to put humans in space. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Over the next decade, China’s surveillance and reconnaissance, communications, and weather satellite capabilities will undoubtedly improve further</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">, and by 2020, China will likely have a fully deployed satellite PNT system comparable to the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS). </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There is no question that China’s growing civilian aerospace capabilities are contributing to the development of its military aerospace capabilities. Many aerospace systems are inherently dual-use or can provide a basis for the development of military systems. Moreover, many of the skills and technologies required to produce commercial or dual-use aerospace products are also applicable to purely military systems.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">And </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">given that China and the United States have conflicting interests in East Asia and elsewhere, <strong>China’s growing aerospace capabilities increase its ability and possibly its propensity to use force in ways that negatively affect U.S. interests and would increase the costs—human and material—of resisting such force.</strong><u><span class="Underline">Foreign involvement in China’s civil aerospace sector has unquestionably</span></u>contributed to its development and thus to the development of China’s military capabilities</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u>THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into <strong>a full-scale war between the US and China</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u>Conflict on such a scale <strong>would embroil other countries far and near and</strong> -horror of horrors -<strong>raise the possibility of a</strong> <strong>nuclear war</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u>If China were to retaliate</u><u>, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as <strong>opportunistic powers</strong> elsewhere <strong>may try to overturn the existing world order</strong>. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> <u>If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, <strong>there is little hope of winning a war against China</strong> 50 years later, <strong>short of using nuclear weapons</strong>. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. <strong>Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option</strong></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><u>should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation</u></strong><u>. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">.</span><br />

Despite the importance of aerospace, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the deterioration of the industry at home has continued at a dramatic rate.

Sadly, the fact of these enormous job losses comes as no surprise. More than 10 years ago, in Jobs on the Wing, authors Randy Barber and Robert Scott predicted that &quot;up to 469,000&quot; jobs in the aerospace and related industries &quot;could be eliminated by 2013 because of offset policies and increased foreign competition&quot; (Barber and Scott 1995, 2). In a later study, Scott predicted that </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">by 2013 the industry would suffer a loss of over 25%</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> &quot;of the total jobs in aircraft production in 1995&quot; (Scott 1998).

In its final report, the Aerospace Commission summarized this concern: The U.S. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">aerospace</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> sector, once the employer of choice for the &quot;best and brightest&quot; technically trained workers, now </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">finds it presents a negative image</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> to potential employees. Surveys indicate a feeling of disillusionment about the aerospace industry among its personnel, whether they are production/technical workers, scientists or engineers. The majority of newly dislocated workers say they will not return to aerospace. In a recent survey of nearly 500 U.S. aerospace engineers, managers, production workers, and technical specialists, 80 percent of respondents said they would not recommend aerospace careers to their children. (Aerospace Industries Commission 2002, 8-5) While the Aerospace Commission found that </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&quot;U.S. policy toward domestic aerospace employment must reaffirm the goal of stabilizing and increasing the number of</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> good and decent </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">jobs</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> in the industry,&quot; </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">this policy has yet to be embraced</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">, let alone implemented (Aerospace Industries Commission 2002, 8-12).

Should there be any doubt about the seriousness of the competition from foreign entities and governments, one has only to look at the success of companies like EADS. What were once fledgling industries are now U.S. competitors who benefit from a sophisticated approach to offsets that moves jobs and technology their way.10 As succinctly stated by the Aerospace Commission, &quot;…</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">foreign nations</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> clearly recognize the potential benefits from aerospace and </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">are attempting to wrest global leadership away from us</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">&quot; (Aerospace Industries Commission 2002, 1-2). A country that truly understands the importance of adopting a comprehensive aerospace policy based on offsets is China. As reported in the 2005 Report to Congress of the of U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, &quot;…Chinese firms have used their leverage to extract offsets—agreements to transfer some of the aircraft production along with related expertise and technology—as part of the deals&quot;; the report further concludes, &quot;China nurtures its domestic aviation and aerospace industry by exploiting the international competition already in the industry&quot; (U.S.-China Review Commission 2005, 30). Indeed, as summarized in one U.S. government report: </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">China is likely to be the largest</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">customer—and possibly an emerging </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">competitor</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">—of the U.S. aerospace industry in the future. China's aerospace manufacturing base is enormous. U.S. companies (and European companies to a lesser extent) have successfully partnered with Chinese companies that provide components or parts for a number of commercial aerospace programs. However, China also is seeking to become a world-class prime commercial aerospace manufacturing industrial base, both through indigenous development programs and joint ventures with non-Chinese companies. (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, xii) In testimony in 2001, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) singled out China for developing an effective industrial policy in an effort to create its own aerospace industry. It noted in its testimony that the U.S. International Trade Commission had already found with respect to China, &quot;…the nation's aviation sector intends to pursue a principal role in commercial aircraft manufacturing.&quot;11 During a 1998 visit to China to tour aerospace facilities, IAM participants observed the country's enormous aerospace capacity.12 China's aviation industry &quot;consists of more than 200 enterprises that produce and manufacture products such as aircraft, turboprop engines, aircraft components and subsystems, helicopters, industrial gas turbines, and various electromechanical products&quot; (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, 58). China's huge industrial capacity has been noted by other observers as well.13 For example, one research group notes that in China there are six companies devoted to &quot;airframe assembly,&quot; eight &quot;engine&quot; companies, 28 entities involved with &quot;components,&quot; and 20 &quot;research institutes.&quot;14 The two leading aircraft companies in China (China Aviation Industry Corporation I [AVIC I] and Aviation Industry Corporation II [AVIC II]) &quot;and their subsidiaries have about 491,000 employees&quot; (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, 5815). How did China develop such a huge capacity for aerospace production? While there are many different and related methods China uses, a significant one is offsets.16 As globalization critic Jeff Faux said in testimony to Congress, &quot;China is one of the most aggressive countries in pursuing offsets agreements and, with its market potential and minimal labor standards, it has substantial leverage in negotiating these agreements&quot; (Faux 2002). And as a business person told the Wall Street Journal, &quot;they're interested in having total access to technology….&quot;17 Of particular concern to the United States is the huge involvement of Boeing in China, an involvement the company acknowledges. According to its Web site: &quot;Boeing procurement from China is significantly greater than other aviation companies&quot; (Boeing 2007). According to company summaries: Since the 1980s, Boeing has purchased more than $1 billion in aviation hardware and services from China. Approximately 4,500 Boeing airplanes with parts and assemblies built by China are flying throughout the world today. Boeing and Boeing supplier partners have active supplier contracts with China's aviation industry valued at well over $2.5 billion (Boeing 2007). A detailed listing illustrating Boeing's extensive procurement activities, production work, and supplier involvement in China appears in the appendix. According to a news report, &quot;Boeing is expanding its relationship with China through plans to double its annual purchases from Chinese companies over the next six years to more than $1 billion per year by 2010&quot; (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, 59, citing Business Daily Update, &quot;Boeing Seeks Higher-Level Cooperation With Chinese Suppliers&quot;). Boeing is, of course, just one of many aerospace companies investing in China's aerospace industry; another is Boeing's chief rival, Airbus. As quoted in The Australian (&quot;Airbus Enlists China,&quot; June 14, 2004), Airbus Chief Executive Noel Forgeard explained his company's philosophy with respect to China: &quot;Airbus is not only selling aircraft in China but is also committed to the long-term development of China's aviation industry.&quot; The Australian also reported that parts of the A380 will be produced in China: European aircraft maker Airbus has subcontracted a state-owned Chinese manufacturer to make parts for its super-jumbo A380 plane, in a deal worth about $170 million. China Aviation Corp. I (AVIC I) will make panels for A380 nose-landing gear….China's Shenyang Aircraft Corp., affiliated with AVIC I, would also be subcontracted to make A330/A340 forward-cargo door projects….Five Chinese companies are now making parts for Airbus. The New York Times reported that Airbus is committed &quot;to buy at least $60 million yearly in parts from China by 2007, rising to $120 million yearly by 2010.&quot;18 According to other news reports, China will &quot;build wing boxes for Airbus&quot; in a $500 million deal,19 and Airbus and China have agreed on &quot;a $9 billion order…for 150 narrow-body A320 aircraft, and said they would study the possibility of building a final assembly line for the aircraft in China.&quot;20 That study apparently produced positive results; as stated in an Airbus press release (&quot;Joint Venture Contract Signed for the A320 Family Final Assembly Line in Tianjin,&quot; June 28, 2007): &quot;The FAL [final assembly line] in Tianjin will be based on the latest state-of-the-art Airbus single-aisle final assembly line in Hamburg, Germany. The aircraft will be assembled and delivered in China to the same standards as those assembled and delivered in Europe.&quot; The significance of such a development cannot be overstated: &quot;the memorandum of understanding between China's National Development and Reform Commission and Airbus…meant that China was likely to become only the third country assembling Airbus aircraft, after France and Germany.&quot;21 Brazil's aerospace industry is also teaming up with China. &quot;In order to supply its domestic market while continuing to learn how to assemble a modern, complete aircraft to Western standards, two AVIC-II companies teamed with Embraer…in 2002 for co-production of their regional jet (ERJ-145) in Harbin&quot; (Andersen 2008). Eurocopter, a subsidy of EADS, is also involved with China's aerospace industry. &quot;France's Eurocopter and Singapore Technologies Aerospace have signed with Hafei Aviation, a listed arm of one of China's top military contractors, to make helicopters for domestic civil use.&quot;22 China's aerospace industry is apparently not content to maintain its current level of success. According to news reports, &quot;China is likely to start developing its own large aircraft rather than rely solely on foreign giants Boeing and Airbus….&quot;23 The country recently announced that it would be entering the large civil aircraft industry in the next 20 years,24 and, according to news reports, much of the success of this effort depends on the transfer of production and technology from other countries, presumably in the form of outsourcing and offsets from U.S. and other aerospace companies. And according to a report in Jane's Defence Weekly, &quot;China is developing a new stealthy fighter jet aircraft and many of the design concepts and components have already been created….This new aircraft is the first Eastern rival to the West's F/A-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to be put into development….&quot;25 China's aerospace industry may even be expanding to space. In an article headlined &quot;The Next Space Race: China Heads to the Stars,&quot; the New York Times (January 22, 2004) raises the possibility of a space race with China, noting: The Chinese plan to send more astronauts into space next year, to launch a Moon probe within three years, and are aiming to land an unmanned vehicle on the Moon by 2010…. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Will the U.S. aerospace industry remain the strongest</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> in the world? </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As other countries implement industrial policies based on outsourcing and offsets, <strong>the question becomes</strong></span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> more </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">urgent</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. Moves by countries like China to implement industrial policies targeting U.S. leadership in such essential industries as aerospace call for a response by U.S. policy makers.

It has the capacity, skilled workforce, and the will to make this a reality.

Leadership is key to resiliency – absence causes nuclear conflict<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">Although the spread of nuclear weapons, with the corresponding increase in the likelihood that a nuclear shot would be fired in anger somewhere in the world, counted as the most serious potential consequence of the abandonment by the United States of its role as the world's government, it was not the only one.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> <u>In the previous period of American international reticence, the 1920s and 1930s, the global economy suffered serious damage that a more active American role might have mitigated</u>. <u>A twenty-first-century American retreat could have similarly adverse international economic consequences.</u> <u>The economic collapse of the 1930s caused extensive hardship throughout the world and led indirectly to World War II</u><u>by paving the way for the people who started it to gain power in Germany and Japan</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">In retrospect, the Great Depression is widely believed to have been caused by a series of errors in public policy that made an economic downturn far worse than it would have been had governments responded to it in appropriate fashion. Since the 1930s, acting on the lessons drawn from that experience by professional economists, governments have taken steps that have helped to prevent a recurrence of the disasters of that decade.' In the face of reduced demand, for example, governments have increased rather than cut spending. Fiscal and monetary crises have evoked rescue efforts rather than a studied indifference based on the assumption that market forces will readily reestablish a desirable economic equilibrium. In contrast to the widespread practice of the 1930s, political authorities now understand that putting up barriers to imports in an attempt to revive domestic production will in fact worsen economic conditions everywhere. Still,</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> <u>a serious, prolonged failure of the international economy, inflicting the kind of hardship the world experienced in the 1930s</u> (which some Asian countries also suffered as a result of their fiscal crises in the 1990s) <u>does not lie beyond the realm of possibility. Market economies remain subject to cyclical downturns, which public policy can limit but has not found a way to eliminate entirely</u>. <u>Markets also have an inherent tendency to form bubbles, excessive values for particular assets,</u> whether seventeenth century Dutch tulips or twentieth century Japanese real estate and Thai currency, <u>that cause economic harm when the bubble bursts and prices plunge</u>. <u>In responding to these events, governments can make errors</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">They can act too slowly, or fail to implement the proper policies, or implement improper ones. Moreover, the global economy and the national economies that comprise it, like a living organism, change constantly and sometimes rapidly: Capital flows across sovereign borders, for instance, far more rapidly and in much greater volume in the early twenty-first century than ever before. This means that measures that successfully address economic malfunctions at one time may have less effect at another, just as medical science must cope with the appearance of new strains of influenza against which existing vaccines are not effective. Most importantly,</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> <u>since the Great Depression, an active American international economic role has been crucial both in fortifying the conditions for global economic well-being and in coping with the problems that have occurred, especially periodic recessions and currency crises, by applying the lessons of the past. The absence of such a role could weaken those conditions and aggravate those problems.</u> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 7pt;">The overall American role in the world since World War II therefore has something in common with the theme of the Frank Capra film It's a Wonderful Life, in which the angel Clarence, played by Henry Travers, shows James Stewart, playing the bank clerk George Bailey, who believes his existence to have been worthless, how life in his small town of Bedford Falls would have unfolded had he never been born. George Bailey learns that people he knows and loves turn out to be far worse off without him. So it is with the United States and its role as the world's government. Without that role, the world very likely would have been in the past, and would become in the future, a less secure and less prosperous place.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> The abdication by the United States of some or all of the responsibilities for international security that it had come to bear in the first decade of the twenty-first century would deprive the international system of one of its principal safety features, <u>which keeps countries from smashing into each other, as they are historically prone to do</u>.<u>In this sense, a world without America would be the equivalent of a freeway full of cars without brakes</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Similarly, should the American government abandon some or all of the ways in which it had, at the dawn of the new century, come to support global economic activity<u>,</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u>the world economy would function less effectively and might even suffer a severe and costly breakdown.</u> A <u>world without the United States would in this way resemble a fleet of cars without gasoline.</u></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">At best, an American withdrawal would bring with it some of the political anxiety typical during the Cold War and a measure of the economic uncertainty that characterized the years before World War II.

Indeed, the potential for economic calamity and wartime destruction is greater at the outset of the new century than it was in the first half of the preceding one because of the greater extent of international economic interdependence and the higher levels of prosperity—there is more to lose now than there was then—and because of the presence, in large numbers, of nuclear weapons</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">Less intuitive is how periods of </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. As such, exogenous shocks such as </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> (see also Gilpin. 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">increasing the risk of miscalculation</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland's (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> of states</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. He argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">if the expectations of future trade decline</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> potentially be the </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">trigger</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> for </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">decreased trade expectations</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> (2002) </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. They write: The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">presence of a recession tends to <strong>amplify the extent</strong> to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. (Blomberg &amp; Hess, 2002. p. 89) </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Economic</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">decline has</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> also </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">been linked with an increase in</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the likelihood of terrorism</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> (Blomberg, Hess, &amp; Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&quot;Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect.</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;"> than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">periods of weak economic performance in the U</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">nited States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels</span></u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 9pt;">.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.</span><br />

The House and Senate Armed Services committees</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which authorize appropriations for the Pentagon, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">supported the concept of the AEHF block buy and recommended fully funding the procurement request for 2012. Both committees were willing to allow the satellites to be funded over multiple years, <strong>but neither was willing to authorize a specific appropriation level for the next few years</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The House Appropriations Committee, meanwhile, was critical, saying information provided by the Air Force on the strategy was “woefully lacking” and characterizing the advance appropriations idea as a “budgetary gimmick.” Nevertheless, the committee’s bill would provide the requested amount of AEHF procurement funding for 2012, though it would trim $67.2 million from the program’s proposed $421.7 million research and development budget. Senate appropriators have not yet marked up their version of the 2012 defense spending bill. Though the Air Force could probably work within the parameters laid out by the three committees, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the AEHF program would have more certainty if advance appropriations are provided</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Conaton said. She acknowledged that the Air Force had not done an adequate job of detailing how it would spend the AEHF technology development funding, and it would soon be able to provide the committees with more insight. Joanne Maguire, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin Space Systems, said </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">block buys</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> of satellites <strong>have the potential to save</strong> 15 to <strong>20 percent</strong> compared to buying satellites individually</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and in a period when the Defense Department is recapitalizing all of its satellite fleets, cost reduction has become a top priority for the government and for her company. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The <strong>EASE</strong> strategy <strong>would create a</strong> more <strong>steady production rhythm, shoring up prospects for</strong> second- and third-tier <strong>component suppliers that might exit the market if production breaks stretch out too long</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Concepts like <strong>EASE can make a difference, but only if the government is all in</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Maguire said. </span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Deficit reduction doesn't always mean hard choices. Sometimes it's easy, if politicians are willing to rethink how the government goes about pursuing its goals. Perhaps that's what Pentagon policymakers had in mind when they decided to name </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">a new approach to purchasing satellites</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> EASE. The official name </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is &quot;Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; but the acronym says it all. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Budget analysts have figured out a way of <strong>saving billions of dollars on space systems without having to give up anything</strong>. And unlike initiatives such as the F-35 alternate engine that require up-front investments to save money later, the EASE concept starts saving money right away</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It's an amazingly simple idea. <strong>All Congress needs to do is agree to buy more than one satellite at a time, and then spread the appropriations out over several budget years</strong>. <strong>That's not what the government does today</strong>. <strong>Instead, it buys one costly satellite</strong> in a constellation <strong>at a time, and then waits years to buy the next one -- even though legislators know they will eventually need to buy several satellites of any given type</strong> to complete a constellation. <strong>And because satellites are bought one-at-a-time with all the money appropriated in a single year, staffers can't find the money to buy another satellite for years and contractors can't manage their production processes efficiently</strong>. So <strong>each satellite ends up costing a lot more than it needs to</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Here's an example. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Pentagon is buying</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> Advanced Extremely High Frequency</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> (<strong>AEHF</strong>) <strong>communications satellites</strong> that will allow warfighters all over the world to communicate securely even in adverse circumstances. That's <strong>an essential capability and military planners expect to buy several</strong> of the satellites <strong>over the coming decade</strong>. Now, <strong>if Congress buys the next two satellites separately with full funding of each in the year it's requested, the cost for both will be about $4 billion</strong>. <strong>If it buys them in a &quot;block&quot;</strong> (together) <strong>and then spaces the money out over several years as EASE proposes, the two satellites will cost $3.1 billion</strong>. <strong>About $900 million is saved just by doing business differently, without giving anything up</strong>. <strong>And the same approach can be applied to any other satellite constellation where the government plans to buy more than one satellite of the same design, whether it's for missile warning or weather reports</strong> or whatever</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. You can't really call EASE a breakthrough, because </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the N</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ational <strong>R</strong>econnaissance <strong>O</strong>ffice <strong>has been buying its spy satellites this way for a long time</strong>. <strong>But</strong> most of the military satellites the government buys aren't for spying, and <strong>all the other spacecraft are currently being bought one-at-a-time at very high cost</strong>. <strong>By switching to incremental funding of multi-satellite buys, the government can start saving billions of dollars in fiscal 2012</strong>. <strong>It can also help military planners and contractors to start thinking more coherently about how to introduce necessary upgrades into later versions of current satellites</strong>, since we know constellations like AEHF are going to be operating for decades to come. But <strong>the real savings come from being able to use workers and facilities more efficiently</strong>, because when the government commits to buying multiple satellites of the same type in a single &quot;block&quot; <strong>the work can be sequenced to make sure each employee with specialized skills is working every day, rather than waiting around for the next satellite to be funded</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This isn't a budgeting gimmick and there are no catches</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. <strong>Congress can begin saving billions of dollars on military satellites in 2012 without killing any programs</strong> or closing any facilities. <strong>All it needs to do is agree to</strong> what staffers call &quot;<strong>advanced appropriations</strong>,&quot; which is technical language for agreeing to fund satellites over several budget years rather than setting aside all the money in a single year. Once it does that, budgeting for military space will become easier and savings will begin accumulating that can be applied to other purposes such as deficit reduction</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of course, somebody somewhere will probably complain about Congress changing the way it does business. But when you're borrowing $4 billion per day from lenders like China, change is indicated. </span></span><br />

We have taken actions to mitigate impacts where we can, such as our recent reprogramming of $80 million in FY10 funds into the GPS IIIA program to avoid costly programmatic delays and contract renegotiation for the first long-lead production option for space vehicles (SV) 3 and 4. However, our success in mitigating CR impacts to GPS IIIA has limited our flexibility to address other detrimental impacts of a prolonged CR. Additionally, new start limitations prevent the Air Force from carrying out the scheduled award of WGS-7, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">potentially <strong>causing a production break with</strong> estimated cost impacts of up to $50 million <strong>if funding is delayed until the start of FY12</strong>.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the years since the Cold War ended, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> U.S. <strong>military has become heavily dependent upon satellite communications to maintain its global connectivity</strong>. <strong>Without such links, it would be difficult for the military to operate in a coordinated fashion or exchange information critical to situational awareness</strong>. Defense experts have repeatedly warned that <strong>the availability of space-based communications could be compromised</strong> in future conflicts <strong>by the fact that 80-90% of all military traffic is transmitted on vulnerable commercial satcom channels</strong>. However, there is a related problem that far fewer military observers have noticed: <strong>only about 1% of defense communications today are protected against even the most modest jamming threats</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Jamming means overloading key frequencies with so much electronic &quot;noise&quot; that communications cannot get through to intended destinations. It's a simple process in the case of unprotected satellite links, because signals are relatively weak after traveling 22,000 miles from transponders in geosynchronous orbit</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- the orbit that communications satellites must maintain in order to serve as &quot;stationary&quot; links above particular points on the Earth's surface (they aren't really stationary, but they appear to be because their rotation matches that of the Earth). If the satellites were any closer to Earth they would zoom across the surface at a speed of several miles per second, making them unavailable as communications nodes most of the time. So they must sit 22,000 miles above sea level, which makes their signals easy to overwhelm with modest amounts of electromagnetic interference, especially if the jammer is near communications receivers. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The only satellite constellation</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the military is currently building <strong>that can provide protection against the full array of potential communications threats is</strong> the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (<strong>AEHF</strong>) system. AEHF is <strong>designed to cope with everything from jammers to hackers to</strong> scintillation from <strong>thermonuclear explosions</strong>. However, although it will provide ten times as much capacity as the legacy MilStar constellation, it can only carry a small portion of the military communications traffic passing through space portals. As a result, the amount of that traffic that is well protected against jamming will peak at 6-7% in fiscal year 2012, leaving over 90% of joint-force transmissions vulnerable to degradation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That's not a serious problem if the biggest threats we face are rag-tag adversaries such as the Taliban, but </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in a war</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">with China <strong>there's a high likelihood that America's military would lose the use of most of its satcom links</strong> in places like the Western Pacific</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Bush Administration had an initiative for addressing this problem called the Transformational Communications Satellite program, or TSAT. TSAT would have provided internet-like access to U.S. warfighters all over the world, including troops on the move, from a constellation of five very capable satellites. However, TSAT was canceled last year due to astronomical (no pun intended) costs, and </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">now <strong>the military</strong> space community <strong>has no real plan for assuring that a reasonable portion of joint-force communications traffic will be protected against jamming in the future</strong>. <strong>The feasible</strong>, affordable <strong>answer is</strong> not to begin a new program, but <strong>to start incrementally evolving AEHF towards a more robust capability</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I argued in Space News several years ago that such an approach was more likely to work out than trying to implement the complex TSAT initiative, but at the time everybody in the business was still chasing the TSAT opportunity. Now that it's gone, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">military planners need to start thinking about how the government can leverage its investment in AEHF <strong>through</strong> incremental <strong>improvements to each new satellite</strong>. <strong>If that move is not made soon, our warfighters may</strong> one day <strong>face an adversary who knows how to isolate them from the rest of the joint force and then kill them</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />

In addition, <strong>AEHF will also provide the critical survivable, protected, and endurable communications to the National Command Authority</strong> including presidential conferencing <strong>in all levels of conflict</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">There is now an undeniable and accepted recognition that militaries around the globe cannot do away with commercial systems. Even if the U.S. Military were to achieve independence in terms of its bandwidth supply, the other benefits such as flexibility and redundancy that the commercial industry offers are invaluable</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Challenges and Requirements FSS and MSS commercial satellites currently provide the same types of applications, including real-time video as well as tactical military communications. Commercial satellites are even a part of UAV missions, currently a growing and highly-critical application suite for warfighting that will increase in the future. Moreover, commercial satellites in terms of bandwidth may be able to throughput higher data rates based on currently available satellites based on bent-pipe and on-board processing programs. The sheer number of commercial satellites currently deployed makes bandwidth availability much higher compared to current and planned military programs, specifically for the U.S. military. In terms of the definition as well as </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the main difference between AEHF and commercial communications satellites, AEHF will provide survivable, highly secure, protected, global communications for all warfighters serving under the U.S. Department of Defense, <strong>whereas</strong> <strong>commercial satellite systems are vulnerable in the event of attacks</strong> or engagements that include nuclear capability</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In terms of the ability to throughput secure, reliable, real-time or near-real time data, commercial systems could play a role in providing advanced communications for military missions. MILSATCOM systems are generally categorized as wideband, protected and narrowband: •Wideband systems provide high capacity, •Protected systems feature antijam, covertness, and nuclear survivability, and •Narrowband systems support users who need mobile voice and low-data-rate communications. In terms of these categories, commercial systems can tap into wideband and narrowband applications via FSS and MSS platforms. Indeed, commercial outsourcing by the U.S. Military has led to healthy leases of wideband/broadband capacity for missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and for UAV missions in both countries as well as Pakistan. For narrowband applications, the U.S. Military has had a contract with Iridium, specifically for such capabilities. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> only challenge, or </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">requirement, not met by commercial systems lies in the protected realm</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. By definition, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">protected systems such as AEHF have the ability to</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> avoid, prevent, negate, or mitigate the degradation, disruption, denial, unauthorized access, or exploitation of communications’ services by adversaries or the environment</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.

Realizing these capabilities will require transforming our people, processes, and military forces.”37 ADM Giambastiani, former Commander U.S. Joint Forces Command stated, “A fully collaborative and networked force is an imperative, not a luxury.”38 The former Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, General Michael Haggee said, “The capability to connect disparate units spread over the battlefield will help to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance to commanders who can then call in fire support…Information Technology (IT) will also be critical to Sea Basing, a key component of the Navy’s Sea Power 21 Concept.”39 Vice Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Gen. Peter Chiarelli recently stated, “Access to information can mean the difference between living and dying.”40 General William Wallace, USA (Ret.) goes on to caution that “despite the enormous benefits of using a network, it would be folly to lose sight of the fact that it is still merely a tool to aid the commander in understanding and decisionmaking.”41 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates wrote in his recent Foreign Affairs article, We should be modest about what military force can accomplish and what technology can accomplish. The advances in precision, sensor, information, and satellite technologies have led to extraordinary gains in what the U.S. military can do. The Taliban were dispatched within three months; Saddam’s regime was toppled in three weeks. A button can be pushed in Nevada, and seconds later a pickup truck will explode in Mosul. A bomb dropped from the sky can destroy a targeted house while leaving the one next to it intact. But no one should ever neglect the psychological, cultural, political, and human dimensions of warfare.42 </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The question is not if DOD will proceed with NCW, but how</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.NCW WAY AHEAD </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The DOD has a plan for the implementation of NCW. The plan calls for a holistic approach to the implementation of NCW that investigates the potential of NCO in joint, multinational, and interagency operations</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As previously discussed in this paper, there has been a significant effort to establish the theoretical underpinnings of the concept. The publication, Implementation of Network-Centric Warfare, establishes the outline of the plan to move forward with NCW. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Services are working to integrate information systems, sensors, and decisionmaking processes and technology</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> <strong>to leverage the capabilities of a fully networked joint force</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Air Force Command and Control Constellation network is an example of the integration of C2; ISR; tankers; space, ground, and sea-based systems; and strike platforms to achieve shared awareness in the operational environment to maximize effects.43 Constellation works with FORCEnet (U.S. Navy), and LandWarNet (U.S. Army) to achieve synergy on the battlefield.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">SEA SHIELD embraces emerging technologies and concepts that for the first time have the potential to extend naval defensive firepower beyond the task force. SEA SHIELD encompasses some things great navies always have tried to do—sea control off hostile coasts and maritime defense of the homeland, for example—and some that no navy has ever done, such as projecting defense deep inland against cruise and ballistic missiles. But whether new missions or traditional ones done in new ways, these enhanced warfighting capabilities will play an increasingly central role in U.S. national security in the decades ahead. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">U.S. national strategy is founded on the advantages of forward-deployed forces, sea and air supremacy, and information superiority, allowing U. S. forces to fight and win thousands of miles from American shores. <strong>Potential enemies</strong> know this, and they <strong>are working to circumvent U.S. strengths by denying its forces access to their regions</strong> <strong>and</strong> by developing asymmetric strategies to conduct attacks on U.S. soil. Future adversaries will <strong>strive to hold U.S. deployments at risk by interdicting air and sea lines of communication, rendering debarkation points unusable, and delaying or denying political access</strong>. By <strong>projecting defensive power</strong>, SEA SHIELD <strong>will defeat these efforts and enable</strong> the U.S. Navy to &quot;climb into the ring&quot; to conduct SEA STRIKE and SEA BASE in forward theaters of operation, setting the stage for <strong>combat victory</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Theater Air and Missile Defense. Effective theater air and missile defense is critical to achieving the vision for SEA SHIELD. This is a challenging task, as </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">countering emerging cruise and ballistic missiles will require advanced network-centric operations</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and high levels of weapon-system technology, seamlessly fused to produce a single integrated air picture available to all elements of the force</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Air defense in the 21st century will require missiles that reach ranges, altitudes, and speeds never before seen. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Networks will </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">pass vast volumes of precise data to achieve near-instantaneous speed of command, ensuring targets are destroyed using advanced weapons with extended range, over-the-horizon</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, and ballistic missile defense versions of the Standard missile and new models of the advanced medium-range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM)</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ballistic missile defense is yet another potential breakthrough on the horizon. Over the next decade, our Navy's globally deployed, mobile infrastructure of sea-based radars and missile launchers will be used to field ballistic missile defense, for both forward theaters and the U.S. homeland. Linked to a network of space and airborne sensors, and directed by highly responsive command-and-control systems, a family of sea-based interceptor missiles will provide options for boost phase, midcourse, and terminal defense as part of an overall joint force ballistic missile defense system. Tests of this capability are ongoing, and recent successes indicate that sea-based missile defense will strengthen U.S. security in the years ahead. Sea and Littoral Control. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Battlespace control near land is essential to ensure prompt access and freedom of maneuver for joint forces moving from the sea to objectives deep inland. Surface and subsurface <strong>threats include small, fast surface combatants, modern ultra-quiet submarines, and</strong> an array of floating, moored, and buried <strong>mines</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">To detect and defeat these threats, force sensors and weapons will be integrated to produce battlespace dominance on, above, and below the sea. This is a challenging goal because sensors and weapons in the littoral environment have limited ranges as a result of environmental conditions and the clutter of maritime traffic. <strong>The most effective approach to countering these limitations is to network large numbers of distributed sensors and weapons</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Navy is pursuing this approach through advanced research and program development. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The key to future effectiveness against modern, quiet diesel submarines in shallow waters once again will be the application of advanced sensor and networking technologies</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These will contribute to building a common undersea picture that fuses the information from distributed sensors, platforms, and command elements to permit collaborative mission planning and tactical decision making. New, longer-range individual sensors and new acoustic processors on nuclear submarines will complement distributed sensors. In addition, multi-static and advanced signal processing technologies will extract every possible element of information from the surrounding environment, making the water column increasingly transparent. None of these approaches will make anti-submarine warfare easy, but in the aggregate, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">these technologies</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, combined with well-trained sailors using realistic simulators to refine their skills, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">can sustain assured access for U.S. forces in the face of diesel submarine threats</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Mine warfare is on the verge of a revolution in the U.S. Navy. This decade will see the progressive fielding of new systems that will make mine countermeasure (MCM) capabilities integral to forward-deployed strike groups. While dedicated MCM forces will remain vital to keeping open the sea lines of communication, surface and subsurface combatants will detect and avoid mines on their own, sustaining the critical tempo of operations early in crises. Both dedicated and organic MCM forces will use new generations of sophisticated UUVs—eventually to be joined by unmanned air and surface vehicles—to detect, avoid, and neutralize mines at all depths. Small, fast enemy surface combatants represent another threat to operations in geographically confined areas, where their size and the surrounding clutter of geography and traffic make long-range detection difficult. While destroying these craft in port or at long range is the preferred solution, a dispersed force of smaller surface and air platforms networked with distributed, unmanned sensors, offers promising response capabilities once enemy vessels are under way. Revolutionary new technologies, such as directed-energy weapons, also offer promise as the next generation of systems for precise close-in defense against both combatant craft at sea and waterborne threats to ships pier-side. Extended Homeland Defense. Homeland defense relies on many of the elements that will make SEA SHIELD effective in a forward battlefield environment, such as expanded sensor coverage, increased situational awareness by networking, and rapidly deployable defensive assets and weapon systems. Sharing information with other services and agencies will extend the security boundaries of the United States far seaward, using the time and space afforded by naval forces to shield our nation from impending threats. In close coordination with Northern Command, naval forces will establish comprehensive maritime domain awareness, to include the tracking of surface vessels, aircraft, and subsurface units approaching the United States. Interagency communication reach-back systems will send the latest intelligence to and from naval assets. This will integrate afloat forces into joint, interagency, and civil efforts to a far greater degree than today, providing the situational awareness, agility, and timeliness so vital to countering terrorist threats. Key homeland defense assets in years ahead will include ballistic missile defense ships, U.S. Coast Guard Deepwater units, the new Multi-Mission Aircraft, and the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance UAV that will provide long-dwell coverage of very large areas of the ocean because of its high-resolution sensors and unprecedented flight endurance. The Chief of Naval Operations has tasked Commander, Third Fleet, to work in concert with Commander, Seventh Fleet, to accelerate the development of all facets of SEA SHIELD. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Yesterday's Navy defended itself and the sea lines of communication. Tomorrow's Navy will do much more. <strong>It will provide assured access for joint power projection forces</strong> in an environment where threats increasingly hold land bases at risk. It will protect friends and partners from enemies armed with an array of advanced and deadly weapons. And it will provide the first, critical layer of defense against asymmetric threats to the U.S. homeland</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. SEA SHIELD will extend homeland defense, sustain access to contested littorals, and project security deep inland. In short, SEA SHIELD will provide the capabilities needed for the United States </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">to deter, dissuade, and decisively defeat adversaries</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> in the decades ahead, providing stability and security</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> in an uncertain century</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Development of anti-access measures </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">China is aware that, in order to be successful in</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> a military confrontation over Taiwan, it must prevent the US from entering the conflict</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or at least degrade the size and effectiveness of a projected US military intervention.26 </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In view of the US military’s superiority, <strong>China has developed anti-access measures which have “the effect of slowing the deployment of friendly forces into a theater, preventing them from operating</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from certain locations within that theater, or causing them to operate from distances farther from the locus of conflict than they would normally prefer.”27 Chinese anti-access measures focus strongly on US air power. Command of the air has been one of the cornerstones of US military superiority in the post-cold war era, a fact that became most evident to China during the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1995-1996.28 Parallel to its long-term effort to modernize its air force and other air defense capacities, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">China has invested significant resources to develop anti-access measures to prevent the deployment of US naval and land-based air power in a potential conflict with Taiwan</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.29 Conventional ballistic missiles </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">China has sharply increased its capacity to attack US air bases in the region</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, particularly in Okinawa.30 China has been modernizing its fleet of fighter-bombers and arsenal of cruise missiles, but these systems continue to be vulnerable to more advanced US and Japanese fighter aircraft, supported by ground and air-based early warning systems. However, an attack by ballistic missiles can only be countered by anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems.31 Although these systems offer a certain degree of protection against ballistic missile attacks, a completely successful defense against a surprise attack with ballistic missiles is highly unlikely.32 While ballistic missiles are not effective at destroying aircraft in hardened aircraft shelters, they can destroy large, high-value aircraft such as AWACS and tanker aircraft too large for normal shelters. Furthermore, ballistic missiles can destroy runways with sub- munitions and thus leave the paralyzed air bases vulnerable to follow-on attacks.33 China has been deploying the DF-21C, a conventionally armed medium range ballistic missile (MRBM), since 2004-2005.34 Using this missile, PLA forces could attack US airbases in Okinawa, South Korea, and mainland Japan. Currently, hardened aircraft shelters are available only at four US air bases in the region. The base closest to the Taiwan Strait, Kadena Air Base on Okinawa, has only 15 hardened aircraft shelters, leaving most of the 190 aircraft likely to be deployed in a crisis vulnerable to attacks.35 Unless additional hardened aircraft shelters are constructed, effective ABM systems are deployed, and damage control capacities are strengthened, the deployment of Chinese MRBMs will make dispersal and basing at a greater distance necessary to avoid the risk of a crippling strike against US land-based air power.36 Anti-ship ballistic missiles </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">China is also strengthening its ability to attack US aircraft carriers at long distances using <strong>anti-ship ballistic missiles</strong> (ASBM)</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Since the mid-90s, China has modernized its submarine force, deployed anti-ship cruise missiles on its ships, and introduced modern Russian fighter-bombers equipped with anti-ship missiles.37 However, all of these weapon systems are constrained by their limited range and limited ability to penetrate the protection afforded by the anti-submarine warfare and anti-air warfare capacities of US carrier strike groups.38 In contrast, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ASBMs <strong>have the potential to destroy US carriers before they even enter the theater of operations around Taiwan – a potential “game-changer” in a military conflict</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.39 Based on a survey of Chinese technical and doctrinal publications, a number of US non-profit and government institutions claim that China has had significant success in its pursuit of an ASBM capacity. Although there has been no official acknowledgment by Chinese authorities, nor any known test of ASBM assets, an initial capacity is estimated to be available in 2010.40 The Chinese ASBM capacity is based on the existing DF-21 class of medium-range ballistic missiles with a range of 1,500–2,000 km.41 The first anti-ship variant of this missile will likely have a comparable range, while future models may use “boost-glide trajectory” capabilities to allow ranges of 3,000–8,000 km by 2020.42 Targeting data for ASBM launches could be provided by over-the-horizon (OTH) radar systems and different types of satellites. China already operates an OTH radar with a range of up to 3,000 km, allowing it to monitor ship movements in a wide arc between Japan and the Philippines.43 China is also developing satellites that can detect carriers using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or by tracking their electronic emissions.44 Once an ASBM is launched against the approximate position of an aircraft carrier, an onboard SAR system would provide mid-course guidance from an altitude of around 80 km to the missile’s maneuverable reentry vehicle (MARV).45 In order to specifically target and destroy key carrier infrastructure, including “carrier-borne planes, the control tower and other easily damaged and vital positions,”46 terminal guidance to the conventional warheads would be provided by a combination of millimeter wave radar and infrared seekers.47 </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The consequences of this development are significant. ASBMs offer an unprecedented and relatively low cost surgical strike capability against aircraft carriers, to which there are only limited and risky countermeasures available. <strong>Because of the precision of ASBM warheads, it is not necessary to sink an aircraft carrier to achieve a “mission kill,” allowing China to strike at carriers while avoiding the risk of escalation</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that would most certainly incorporate the sinking of an aircraft carrier and the resulting deaths of up to 5,000 US sailors.48 Additionally, ASBM systems appear to be both effective and highly cost-efficient: assuming a relatively low success rate of 25%, only 4 ASBMs, costing between 40 and 80 million USD in total, would suffice to disable a US aircraft carrier. 49 </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Countermeasures to ASBMs are either limited in their effectiveness or bear risks of escalation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Direct defense is hard to achieve, given the extremely high speed of ASBMs and the ability to use mid-course maneuvers to change the trajectory. A further disadvantage for a ship defending against an ASBM attack is the limited number of ABM missiles carried onboard. So far, only 75 SM-3 ABMs, to be carried by 18 destroyers and cruisers, have been ordered for the US Navy.50 If a carrier is augmented with two ships carrying six SM-3 each, only 12 ASBMs could currently be defended against in a best-case scenario, as reloading at sea is not possible.51 While defense against ASBMs in flight is difficult, preemptive attacks against the launch platforms and C4ISR infrastructure are risky alternatives. To destroy the mobile launchers, which could be stationed throughout much of Eastern China, or the supporting radar systems, air strikes might be necessary against targets over 1,000 km inland. However, executing such attacks against the depth of the Chinese mainland would be a difficult and highly escalatory option. When Chinese ASBMs become effective to a range of 2,000 km, US carriers might have to operate at distances far from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, such that carrier-based fighters such as the F/A-18 or the future Joint Strike Fighter could hardly enter the fight.52 Using ballistic missiles against US naval and land-based air power, China can substantially reduce the volume of air power available to the US to deter or repel Chinese military action against Taiwan. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review acknowledges the threat posed inter alia by Chinese ballistic missiles and has suggested an increased reliance on submarine-based weapons, development of armed naval UAVs and new cruise missiles for long-range strikes, as well as strengthened active and passive defenses for overseas US air bases.53 However, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">until the US has fielded</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> these and other </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">effective countermeasures</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> to the Chinese ballistic missile threat, China’s anti-access strategy may be successful in deterring US intervention in a military conflict over Taiwan</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Indeed, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Washington's mistake is in not taking a clear side in the cross-Strait dispute</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The United States should be more vigorously supporting its long-time democratic friend and partner. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">There are clear strategic reasons for doing so--reasons that are only growing in importance</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Not least of these is the increasing importance for the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">to been seen as both a reliable friend and a supporter of democratization. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As China rises</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> and puts </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">increasing pressure on</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> its neighbours</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">--many of whom are </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">US allies--it's essential that those allies consider the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">to be a dependable security partner</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Without that assurance, the region is more likely to descend into</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> unwanted and unnecessary </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">arms races</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as countries work on their own to balance China and potentially each other as their military might grows. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Moreover, Taiwan's continued existence as an independent, democratic state--and US support for it--can provide succour for liberals in China, who want representative government for their own country</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Since the end of World War II, Americans have found that the spread of liberal democracy in Asia has benefitted their interests. An imposed reversal of liberalization in Taiwan would benefit no one but the Chinese Communist Party. From an American point of view, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">there is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of course, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">a military-strategic imperative as well for Taiwan's continued de facto independence. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">An annexed Taiwan almost certainly becomes a militarized Taiwan, home to both PLA air and naval bases</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For China, the benefits of such bases are threefold. First, in the event of conflict in East Asia, the 'unsinkable aircraft carrier,' as Douglas MacArthur referred to Taiwan, will provide mainland China with strategic depth that it currently lacks. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Any US forces steaming into the region will have to contend with</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> Chinese military </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">aircraft and naval vessels operating from Taiwan</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. Neutralization of bases on the island will likely be necessary prior to pursuing other primary objectives</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, thus complicating US calculations and military planning. Second, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">an annexed Taiwan will allow China to easily threaten Japan's southern flank</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, including US bases on Okinawa. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Clashing strategic, economic, and nationalistic interests foreshadow a more antagonistic future for Sino-Japanese relations</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and while Japan has foresworn the use of violence to settle international disputes, China most certainly hasn't. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It will be much more difficult for Japan to defend itself--and for the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">to defend its ally--if the islands face PLA threats emanating from Taiwan</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, from China's east coast, and, perhaps one day, from the east coast of North Korea. Finally, control of Taiwan will enable the PLA to more easily exert control over the Luzon Strait, the waterway connecting the South China Sea and the Philippine Sea. Control of the Strait is necessary for China to achieve its dual goals of enforcing its claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea and of keeping foreign military forces out of that body of water. Control of Taiwan and the Luzon Strait, moreover, will for the first time grant the PLA Navy easy access to the Philippine Sea and the Pacific Ocean beyond, providing China even greater strategic depth and, for the first time since 1941, allowing an Asian power to threaten Guam and Hawaii. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Taiwan</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> isn't a relic of the Cold War. Rather, it </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is situated at the geographic forefront of the strategic competition</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that very well may define the 21st century--that </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">between the U</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and China</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The United States has long pursued a policy in Asia in which it provides security while promoting economic and political liberalization. The Taiwan of today is in many ways a fruit of that policy. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Washington would soon regret any decision to drop its support for Taiwan and allow mainland China to annex the island nation. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Only by</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> continuing to nurture its relationship with Taipei and by </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">continuing to steel the island against threats from the mainland can the U</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">hope to ensure continued peace in Asia</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />

But </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">even a minor miscalculation</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by any of them </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">could destabilize Asia</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, jolt the global economy, and</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">start a nuclear war</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. <strong>India, Pakistan, and China all have nuclear weapons, and North Korea</strong> may have a few, <strong>too</strong>. <strong>Asia lacks the</strong> kinds of <strong>organizations</strong>, negotiations, <strong>and diplomatic relationships that helped keep</strong> an uneasy <strong>peace</strong> for five decades <strong>in</strong> Cold War <strong>Europe</strong>. “<strong>Nowhere else on Earth are the stakes as high and relationships so fragile</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” said Bates Gill, director of northeast Asian policy studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. “We see </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the convergence of great power interest overlaid with lingering confrontations with no institutionalized security mechanism in place.

Second is naval power – independently, <u>global sea power</u> is key to deescalating and deterring all conflicts<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Why Seapower? </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">American Seapower is</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the most flexible of the various instruments of military power, and the one most uniquely able to</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> accommodate</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the foregoing </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">strategic considerations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even more, it is an essential element of an effective grand strategy, along with a strong economy and useful alliances. As policy-makers begin to think seriously about an appropriate grand strategy for the Post War on Terror world, American Seapower should occupy a central enabling position. Several obvious US national security imperatives are made possible by preponderant American Seapower. Seapower Enables the Homeland Defense “Away Game”. Naval forces operate for extended periods far from US shores without the permission of any sovereign government; this translates into the extension of America’s homeland “defensive perimeter”. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The ability to </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">gather information, perform surveillance of seaborne and airborne threats, interdict suspected WMD carriers and disrupt terrorist networks</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> without a large shoreward “footprint” is critical in a world of denied access and decreasing acceptance of American troops stationed abroad</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Dealing with these threats as far from our shores as possible gains decision space and engagement opportunities. Seapower Bolsters Critical Security Balances. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Preponderant</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> American Seapower underwrites East Asian security by demonstrating to friends and allies American resolve to maintain regional stability</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Additionally, the overwhelming advantage enjoyed by US forces in sea control and striking power is in and of itself, an inducement to maintaining security</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Absent such preponderance, a </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">nascent Asian naval arms race has the potential to intensify</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the Arabian Gulf and Indian Ocean, sustained preponderant US naval combat power serves to assure allies of the nation’s resolve to maintain stability in the face of an unpredictable regime in Iran. Seapower Provides an Effective Conventional Deterrent. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The visible presence of American Seapower operating freely in the maritime commons provides an effective conventional deterrent to those who would seek to threaten regional</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> security and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">stability</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">First,</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the capabilities and capacities of </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">preponderant naval power</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> are arrayed in a manner that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">causes an adversary to question the effectiveness of a pre-emptive attack</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (deterrence by denial). </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Such capabilities include sea-based</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ballistic missile defense (</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">BMD</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">) </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and the striking power of carrier-based airpower armed with precision guided munitions. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Second, the likelihood of a prompt and painful counter-attack from the sea raises the costs associated with military adventurism</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (punishment). </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In either case, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">recent scholarship</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> in the study of conventional deterrence </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">indicates that overall US conventional superiority is less likely to provide an effective deterrence</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> than is the local regional balance of power</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.[9] </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This suggests that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">in order to deter effectively, the US must be “present”—and no form of military power can be as consistently present in as many critical places at once as Seapower</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Presence should be</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> re-evaluated to include a more robust paradigm of “forward stationing”, or what the Navy refers to as “Forward Deployed Naval Forces” (FDNF). These forces do not deploy from the U.S. on a rotational basis; rather, they are </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">homeported forward, dramatically increasing their operational availability</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Seapower Enables Diplomacy, Development and Defense. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">American Seapower is the global guarantor of freedom of commerce on the world’s oceans, thereby promoting American economic stability and growth</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This role has been played before in history by the Portuguese, the Dutch </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the British, but never before has it been played by a nation without imperial or colonial aspirations. American guarantees to the global commons do not come with a colonial “tax” on other nations. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The overwhelming majority of world trade</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (by weight and by value) </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">travels across the world’s oceans, to the benefit of all trading nations</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. Additionally, America’s diplomatic power is increasingly enabled by its Seapower</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a symbiotic relationship reminiscent of US foreign policy conduct throughout much of its pre-World War II history. With the advent of US Navy Global Fleet Stations and the emerging concept of Sea-basing,</span><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> <u>American Seapower will provide its diplomats with new options for flexibly engaging friends, partners, allies and others</u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. This close relationship between America’s military and its diplomatic arm will be </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">essential to promoting good governance in ungoverned spaces and building partnership capacity</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> in nations facing critical security threats</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Seapower Provides for Modulated Military Response. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The world is an increasingly disordered and untidy place, with regional instability a constant feature of the strategic landscape. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Should deterrence fail</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (as it sometimes does), </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">already present, combat ready naval forces</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> are prepared to conduct prompt and sustained operations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These operations range from shows of force, raids and demonstrations, strikes and special operations, all the way to the forcible entry of land power from the sea. This menu of choices is a primary feature of American Seapower, and </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">it </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">provides</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the President with unmatched flexibility to respond, escalate, and de-escalate without </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">having to flow</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> additional forces </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">into theater. Should the nation find it necessary to transition to a punishing land war, American Seapower provides the means for assuring the entry of follow-on forces, as well as providing considerable combat power in support of ongoing land operations</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It is important to recognize at the outset <span style="font-size: 8pt;">two</span>key points about UnitedStates strategy and the potential costs and benefits for the United States in a changing security environment. First, the United States is very likely to remain fully engaged in global affairs. Advocates of restraint or global withdrawal, while popular in some segments of academia, remain on the margins of policy debates in Washington D.C<strong>.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This could always change, of course. However, at present</span><strong>,</strong> <span style="background-color: yellow;">it is a given that the U</span>nited States will define its interests globally and pursue a strategy that requires capable military forces able to project power around the world<strong>.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Because ‘‘indirect’’ counter-strategies are the rational choice for actors facing a strong state’s power projection, irregular/asymmetric threats are inevitable given America’s role in the global order.24 </span></span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color: black;">Withdrawal from foreign commitments might seem to be a means of evading hostility toward the U</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="color: black;">S</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates, </span><span style="color: black;">but theconsequences would almost certainly be harmful</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> both </span><span style="color: black;">to regional stability</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> and to U.S. national interests. Although Europe would almost certainly not see the return to competitive balancing among regional powers (i.e., competition and even military rivalry between France and Germany) of the kind that some realist scholars of international relations have predicted,&quot; elsewhere the dangers could increase. </span><span style="color: black;">In Asia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would have strong motivation to acquire nuclear weapons – which they have the technological capacity to do quite quickly. Instability and regional competition could also escalate, not only between India and Pakistan, but also in Southeast Asia</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> involving Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and possibly the Philippines. </span><span style="color: black;">Risks in the Middle East would be likely to increase, with regional competition among </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">the major countries of the Gulf region (</span><span style="color: black;">Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq) as well as Egypt, Syria, and Israel. Major regional wars, eventually involving the use of weapons of mass destruction plus human suffering on a vast scale, floods of refugees, economic disruption, and risks to oil supplies are all readily conceivable</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="color: black;">Based on past experience,theU</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><span style="color: black;">S</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><span style="color: black;">would almost certainly be <strong>drawn back into</strong> these areas, whether to defend friendly states, to cope with a humanitarian catastrophe, or to prevent a hostile power from dominating an entire region</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. Steven Peter </span><span style="color: black;">Rosen has thus fit-tingly observed, &quot;If the logic of American empire is unappealing, it is not at all clear that the alternatives are that much more attractive.&quot;</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">2z Similarly, Niall </span><span style="color: black;">Ferguson has added that those who dislike American predominance ought to bear in mind that the alternative may</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> not </span><span style="color: black;">be</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"> a world of competing great powers, but one with no hegemon at all.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;The team of folks behind the first AEHF mission is a great set of Americans who have dedicated many years of their life to put this satellite into orbit,&quot; said Col. Michael Sarchet, commander of the Protected Satellite Communications Group at the Space and Missile Systems Center. &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is a very sophisticated satellite because it </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">built to provide the highest levels of protection</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> for our nation's most critical users. <strong>Encryption, low probability of intercept and detection, jammer resistance</strong> and the ability to penetrate the electro-magnetic interference caused by nuclear weapons are essential features when communication can be of the highest priority</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; said Sarchet. This maiden AEHF bird should be ready, if all goes well, to enter service early next year from an orbital location dictated by the needs at that time. [Most Destructive Space Weapon Concepts] Controllers plan to spend the next 100 days or so using the craft's conventional and exotic ion propulsion systems to circularize the orbit 22,300 miles over the equator at 90 degrees West longitude for months-long testing. Built in a collaboration between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, this and </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">future AEHF spacecraft will replace <strong>the aging Milstar satellite fleet</strong> to provide faster communications simultaneously to more users</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> through modernized technology. &quot;It really does mark a new era for us. Milstar was the first protected (communications satellite) system that we ever put up and it's done a great job for us. We launched the first one back in February 1994. If you add up all the on-orbit life of the five vehicles up there operating, we've got over 56 years experience with </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Milstar</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; said Col. William Harding, the Military Satellite Communications Systems Wing vice commander at Los Angeles Air Force Base. &quot;But it </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is getting older. All five of the spacecraft are past their 7-year mean mission duration and two of them <strong>are past their</strong> 10-year <strong>design life</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">it's time to move on to the next version -- AEHF</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Designers say </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">one AEHF spacecraft has more capacity than Milstar's</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> five-satellite <strong>constellation combined and</strong> its <strong>faster data rates</strong> will benefit tactical military communications, enabling higher quality maps, targeting data and live video to be transmitted without being detected by the enemy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> also <strong>will provide</strong> a five-fold increase in the numbers of communication coverage opportunities</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> so that more terminals spread over more of the globe will be able to access more communications resources,&quot; Harding said. The new satellites will be crosslinked with the existing Milstars, and the AEHF are compatible with existing user equipment. &quot;</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The benefits also include</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> use of small terminals that can provide high data rate channels, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">resilience against electronic warfare and cyber attack, and survivable</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, high availability communications connections across the full spectrum of military operations</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> from peacetime training to nuclear warfare</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; Sarchet said. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF was envisioned to keep communications flowing between the military and civilian leadership in any extreme wartime environment, giving the U.S. information superiority</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Communications relayed through AEHF can include critical support to Special Operations, situational awareness for Army troops, giving last-minute targeting information to en-route Air Force fighters and transmitting Tomahawk missile updates to the Navy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">For the nation's nuclear forces, these hardened satellites would be the communications lifeline for crisis response and war planning in the most dire circumstances imaginable</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Communications links for control of the U.S. nuclear force</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, force direction from the president of the United States, missile attack early warning, missile defense, communications support to Special Operations and high-speed anti-jam protected communications for tactical forces,&quot; said Sarchet. Milstar and its </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> successor </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">are far different from the other types of communications satellites operated by the military</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Navy-led </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">UHF</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> system </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">provides mobile communications to a large number of user terminals but at low data rates</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In a remarkable website on nuclear war, Carol Moore asks the question “Is Nuclear War Inevitable??” [10].4 In Section 1, Moore points out what most terrorists obviously already know about the nuclear tensions between powerful countries. No doubt, they’ve figured out that the best way to escalate these tensions into nuclear war is to set off a nuclear exchange. As Moore points out, all that militant terrorists would have to do is get their hands on one small nuclear bomb and explode it on either Moscow or Israel. Because of the Russian “dead hand” system, “where regional nuclear commanders would be given full powers should Moscow be destroyed,” it is likely that any attack would be blamed on the United States” [10]. Israeli leaders and Zionist supporters have, likewise, stated for years that if Israel were to suffer a nuclear attack, whether from terrorists or a nation state, it would retaliate with the suicidal “Samson option” against all major Muslim cities in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Israeli Samson option would also include attacks on Russia and even “anti-Semitic” European cities [10]. In that case, of course, Russia would retaliate, and the U.S. would then retaliate against Russia. China would probably be involved as well, as thousands, if not tens of thousands, of nuclear warheads, many of them much more powerful than those used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would rain upon most of the major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Afterwards, for years to come, massive radioactive clouds would drift throughout the Earth in the nuclear fallout, bringing death or else radiation disease that would be genetically transmitted to future generations in a nuclear winter that could last as long as a 100 years, taking a savage toll upon the environment and fragile ecosphere as well. And </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">what many people fail to realize is what a precarious, hair-trigger basis the nuclear web rests on. <strong>Any</strong> accident, <strong>mistaken communication</strong>, false signal</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or “lone wolf’ act of sabotage or treason </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">could, in a matter of</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> a few <strong>minutes, unleash the use of nuclear weapons</strong>, and <strong>once a weapon is used</strong>, then <strong>the likelihood of a rapid escalation of nuclear attacks is quite high while the likelihood of a limited nuclear war is</strong> actually <strong>less probable</strong> since <strong>each country would act under the “use them or lose them” strategy</strong> and psychology; <strong>restraint by one power would be interpreted as</strong> a <strong>weakness</strong> by the other, <strong>which could be exploited as a window of opportunity</strong> to “win” the war</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In other words, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">once Pandora's Box is opened, it will spread quickly, as it will be the signal for permission for anyone to use them</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moore compares swift nuclear escalation to a room full of people embarrassed to cough. Once one does, however, “everyone else feels free to do so. The bottom line is that as long as large nation states use internal and external war to keep their disparate factions glued together and to satisfy elites’ needs for power and plunder, these nations will attempt to obtain, keep, and inevitably use nuclear weapons. And as long as large nations oppress groups who seek self-determination, some of those groups will look for any means to fight their oppressors” In other words, as long as war and aggression are backed up by the implicit threat of nuclear arms, it is only a matter of time before the escalation of violent conflict leads to the actual use of nuclear weapons, and </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">once even just one is used, it is very likely that</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> many, if not <strong>all, will be used, leading to horrific scenarios of global death and the destruction of</strong> much of <strong>human civilization</strong> while condemning a mutant human remnant, if there is such a remnant, to a life of unimaginable misery and suffering in a nuclear winter</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Pentagon’s first National Security Space Strategy and its recently released budget request for space are attempting <strong>to prioritize procurement</strong> and operations <strong>after a decade of problematic performance</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But work still needs to be done. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Air Force’s unclassified space budget saw a nearly 10% boost in fiscal 2012</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—to $8.7 billion—from the $8 billion request in fiscal 2011. A portion of this is intended to increase and stabilize the buy of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV) as the government assumes the role of sole supporter of the United Launch Alliance and its massive industrial base in light of an unrealized commercial market. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Even with the boost in funding</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. James Cartwright says that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the projects now scheduled are impossible to execute within the current planning figures</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This, he says, underscores the need to work with international partners in areas such as space situational awareness, communications and, perhaps, shared missile warning. “We still can’t afford most of the constellations we have up there. . . . At some point you have to come to a position of partnering” to share the financial burden, Cartwright said last week. “We have this construct where we believe everything has got to come from us . . . but we fight in combined constructs” on the ground, at sea and in the air. He advocates for trust with partners to also provide key pieces of space capabilities—such as augmented intelligence collection and, possibly, precision navigation and timing signals. He stopped short, however, of suggesting that the Pentagon could curtail its buy of Global Positioning System III satellites, being developed by Lockheed Martin; this request is for $978 million in development and procurement. Perhaps underscoring the fact that Pentagon leadership still lacks a unified view on this subject, Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn notes that some missions will continue to be handled solely by the U.S., though the “goal is to move away from the world where the U.S. develops unilateral strategy.” Thus, his focus appears to be more on collaboration rather than interdependence. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Another initiative in the National Security Space Strategy is to improve support for the space industrial base, which experts worry has atrophied since the end of the Cold War</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Lynn says </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the U.S. is still the top provider of space capabilities, but</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">its share of the market is waning. Previously, the U.S. comprised about 66% of the space market; that figure is now less than 40%</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Air Force’s approach for military space spending is to buy smarter, beginning with more stable and predictable funding</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Gone are the days when the Air Force would simply put a “wedge” of funding into the budget for a program without fully understanding the out-year financial impact. “We need to fully fund programs,” says Maj. Gen. John Hyten, space program director for the Air Force acquisition office. “We don’t want to just put numbers in the budget.” </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Included in the fiscal 2012 budget request is a new strategy to procure satellites, the</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency (</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">EASE</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">) </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">buy of</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Advanced, Extremely High-Frequency (</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">) </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Space-Based Infrared System (</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Sbirs) satellites</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, both produced at Lockheed Martin’s Sunnyvale, Calif., facility. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The three-pronged EASE strategy includes stable funding for a block buy of two of each satellite type; parallel funding provided separately for continued product improvement and research work</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (including competitive projects) </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">for the next-generation upgrades or designs; and parallel work on the mission area’s architecture</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Implementation of the procurement portion of EASE is fashioned somewhat after multi-year buys for aircraft. The goal is to incrementally fund buys of two satellites at a time to keep a stable stream of income for the prime contractor and its base of subcontractors, all of which lead to some savings</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As with aircraft procurements, the goal is to achieve at least 10% savings in the cost of the satellites, but Hyten believes they can get even lower than that. “You take the savings that you find in terms of lower cost on the satellite and reinvest them through a capabilities improvement program,” says Erin Conaton, undersecretary of the Air Force. The Air Force would traditionally spend about $4 billion buying AEHF 5 and 6, Hyten says. In fiscal 2012, it is requesting $550 million as an initial payment for these two satellites; additional funding would be requested up through fiscal 2017 to complete the buys. The Sbirs block buy would follow, beginning in fiscal 2013. The request related to EASE in fiscal 2012 is for $185 million. A major chunk, $550 million, would be requested in fiscal 2013 with five more years of additional funding to complete the buy. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Though multi-year funding has become a regular practice for military aircraft production, lawmakers might eye an incremental satellite funding strategy with more skepticism. The Air Force lacks examples of satellite programs delivering on time and cost, and lawmakers are leery of obligating future funds for projects. “<strong>This is asking Congress to do business in a different way</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Hyten says. Conaton says </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">AEHF</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">and Sbirs</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> <strong>were</strong> both <strong>at key points in</strong> </span></u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">their <strong><u>production cycles, allowing for them to serve as the pathfinders for EASE</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, Congress is expected to review this request this summer, well before the Pentagon has a chance to demonstrate the capabilities of the first AEHF and Sbirs satellites produced with development funding. Officials say that </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">if the EASE concept is accepted by Congress, they plan to implement the strategy for other programs</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, including</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Boeing’s </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Wideband Global Satcom and</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Lockheed Martin’s </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">GPS III</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />

The Defense Department has not been involved in the shuttle program since the 1980s, but </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">NASA and the military</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">’s own space operations remain inextricably linked</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “While we don’t share the shuttle, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">we do <strong>share the industrial base</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Gregory Schulte, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for space policy, told reporters at a breakfast on Tuesday morning. “And so </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">anything that NASA does is important to us in terms of the industrial base.

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">For a considerable period, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the need for clarity and constancy of purpose has been a key ASAP message. Today the issue is still present and becoming ever more pressing</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. What is NASA’s exploration mission? The debate’s concentration on the ability of commercial providers to offer transportation to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) has overshadowed the much larger debate about exploration beyond LEO. What should our next destination goal be? An asteroid? The Moon? Mars? The decision affects the necessary technology programs needed to prepare for such a mission. More importantly, from the aspect of safety, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the lack of a defined mission can negatively affect workforce morale and the ability to attract and maintain the necessary skill sets needed for this high-technology venture</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The lack of clarity and constancy of purpose increases the likelihood that essential knowledge and competencies in the workforce</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> (either contractor or Government), such as those involving important safety considerations, lessons learned, and past experience, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">will not be present to effectively reduce risk going into the future</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Even for commercial transportation to LEO, we find uncertainty. What is to be the acquisition strategy to integrate commercial programs to support NASA’s LEO mission? What is to be the system of oversight that protects both NASA astronaut safety and general public safety, given a system of commercial providers? If something goes wrong, who would be liable? When one considers assigning Government “employees” (i.e., astronauts) to a commercial vehicle, what are the criteria for validating their safety, what is the process for determining that the criteria have been met, and how do we know that initial safety precautions/designs have been maintained? In effect, how safe is safe enough for either exploration or sustainment missions? Clearly, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">uncertainty is driving the safety risk factor to a higher level</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, as it does in any endeavor. Space travel’s significant challenges merely heighten the exposure and the consequences. NASA’s stated goals from 2008 to 2010 have changed dramatically. The Moon and Mars sequential exploration objectives were substantially changed or discarded, and associated </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">hardware development such as</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Constellation</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Program </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">was proposed</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> for cancellation. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">These changes</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, together with others such as questions regarding the use of Orion, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">are examples of how uncertainty has become a critical issue. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">A key point has been made by each Center that the ASAP has visited over this past year—</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the lack of guidance, clarity, and mission has increased the potential for risk, negative consequences to the workforce, and additional expense resulting from duplicative efforts or efforts that are ultimately determined to be unnecessary due to a change of course</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. In the ASAP’s view, </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">it is not in the Nation’s best interest to continue functioning in this manner</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. The Congress, the White House, and NASA must quickly reach a consensus position on the future of the Agency and the future of the United States in space. The discussion must move beyond LEO and on to the necessary steps needed to achieve our future in space, whatever that might be. The constancy of purpose drives workforce loyalty and high achievement and attracts high levels of expertise that clearly make for a safer and lower-risk solution. The ASAP recognizes that this is a fundamental problem that NASA alone cannot solve. It goes beyond the Agency—and clearly is on the shoulders of the Administration and Congress, and that is where it ultimately must be addressed. </span></span><br />

While the U.S. &quot;invented&quot; powered flight in 1903, a decade later leadership in this area had shifted to Europe. Within a little more than a decade after the Wright Brothers' first flights, the great powers of Europe were introducing aeronautics into major land warfare through the creation of air forces. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, it was forced to rely on French-built aircraft. Twenty years later, as the European great powers were on the verge of beginning another major European war, the U.S. found itself in a similar situation where its choice to diminish national investment in aeronautics during the 1920's and 1930's—you may recall that this was the era of General Billy Mitchell and his famous efforts to promote military air power—placed U.S. air forces at a significant disadvantage compared to those of Germany and Japan. This was crucial because military air power was quickly emerging as the &quot;game changer&quot; for conventional warfare. Land and sea forces increasingly needed capable air forces to survive and generally needed air superiority to prevail. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">With the great power advantages of becoming spacefaring expected to be comparable to those derived from becoming air-faring in the 1920's and 1930's, a delay by the U.S. in enhancing its great power strengths through expanded national space power may result in a reoccurrence of the <strong>rapid emergence</strong> of new or the rapid growth of <strong>current great powers</strong> to the point that they are capable of effectively challenging the U.S. Many great powers—China, India, and Russia—are already speaking of plans for developing spacefaring capabilities</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Yet, today, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the U.S. retains a</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> commanding aerospace technological lead over these nations. <strong>A strong effort</strong> by the U.S. to become a true spacefaring nation</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, starting in 2009 with the new presidential administration, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">may yield a </span></u><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">generation or longer lead in space</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, not just through prudent increases in military strength but also through the other areas of great power competition discussed above. This is an advantage that the next presidential administration should exercise.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">China’s space capabilities have improved rapidly in the past decade and a half. China’s Long March series have arguably become the world’s most reliable medium space launch vehicles.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> China has also developed and deployed a series of weather satellites; electro-optical reconnaissance satellites; position, navigation, and timing (PNT) satellites; oceansurveillance satellites; synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites; highcapacity communications satellites; and possibly signals-intelligence or electronic-intelligence satellites. China has also become the third country to put humans in space. </span>Over the next decade, China’s surveillance and reconnaissance, communications, and weather satellite capabilities will undoubtedly improve further<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and by 2020, China will likely have a fully deployed satellite PNT system comparable to the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS). </span>There is no question that China’s growing civilian aerospace capabilities are contributing to the development of its military aerospace capabilities. Many aerospace systems are inherently dual-use or can provide a basis for the development of military systems. Moreover, many of the skills and technologies required to produce commercial or dual-use aerospace products are also applicable to purely military systems.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">And </span>given that China and the United States have conflicting interests in East Asia and elsewhere, <strong>China’s growing aerospace capabilities increase its ability and possibly its propensity to use force in ways that negatively affect U.S. interests and would increase the costs—human and material—of resisting such force.</strong><u><span class="Underline">Foreign involvement in China’s civil aerospace sector has unquestionably</span></u>contributed to its development and thus to the development of China’s military capabilities<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO </span><u>THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into <strong>a full-scale war between the US and China</strong></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable.</span><u>Conflict on such a scale <strong>would embroil other countries far and near and</strong> -horror of horrors -<strong>raise the possibility of a</strong> <strong>nuclear war</strong></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore.</span><u>If China were to retaliate</u><u>, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as <strong>opportunistic powers</strong> elsewhere <strong>may try to overturn the existing world order</strong>. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons.</span> <u>If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, <strong>there is little hope of winning a war against China</strong> 50 years later, <strong>short of using nuclear weapons</strong>. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. <strong>Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option</strong></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that</span><strong><u>should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation</u></strong><u>. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else</u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span></span><br />

U.S. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">aerospace has been identified as a major source of</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> &quot;technical innovation with </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">substantial spillovers to other </span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">industrial and commercial sectors&quot; and &quot;high-wage employment, which spreads the benefits of rising productivity <strong>throughout the U.S. economy</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.…&quot; </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Aerospace </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Commission</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> also </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">noted the industry's contribution to the nation's &quot;economic growth</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, quality of life, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and scientific achievements</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">….&quot; (Aerospace Industry Commission 2002, 1-2). Despite the importance of aerospace, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the deterioration of the industry at home has continued at a dramatic rate. Nearly 500,000 jobs have been lost in the U.S. aerospace industry</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> since 1990 (Aerospace Industry Commission 2002, 8-12; see also AIA 2007), and several hundred thousand more workers have lost their jobs in related industries. Sadly, the fact of these enormous job losses comes as no surprise. More than 10 years ago, in Jobs on the Wing, authors Randy Barber and Robert Scott predicted that &quot;up to 469,000&quot; jobs in the aerospace and related industries &quot;could be eliminated by 2013 because of offset policies and increased foreign competition&quot; (Barber and Scott 1995, 2). In a later study, Scott predicted that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">by 2013 the industry would suffer a loss of over 25%</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> &quot;of the total jobs in aircraft production in 1995&quot; (Scott 1998). These </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">gloomy predictions are</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> apparently </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">reinforced by U.S. government reports.</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> According to the Department of Labor, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the outlook for</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> employment in the U.S. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">aerospace</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> industry </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">is not rosy</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">: between 2002 and 2012 aerospace employment in the United States will &quot;decrease by 18 percent&quot; (U.S. Department of Labor 2004). </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The future health</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> of the industry </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">depends</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> in large part </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">on</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">its ability to attract new workers</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, but the crisis in employment and the prediction that the crisis will deepen does not bode well for attracting new workers. In its final report, the Aerospace Commission summarized this concern: The U.S. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">aerospace</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> sector, once the employer of choice for the &quot;best and brightest&quot; technically trained workers, now </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">finds it presents a negative image</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to potential employees. Surveys indicate a feeling of disillusionment about the aerospace industry among its personnel, whether they are production/technical workers, scientists or engineers. The majority of newly dislocated workers say they will not return to aerospace. In a recent survey of nearly 500 U.S. aerospace engineers, managers, production workers, and technical specialists, 80 percent of respondents said they would not recommend aerospace careers to their children. (Aerospace Industries Commission 2002, 8-5) While the Aerospace Commission found that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&quot;U.S. policy toward domestic aerospace employment must reaffirm the goal of stabilizing and increasing the number of</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> good and decent </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">jobs</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> in the industry,&quot; </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">this policy has yet to be embraced</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, let alone implemented (Aerospace Industries Commission 2002, 8-12). Far from embracing any sort of effective industrial policy when it comes to aerospace, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the U.S. government continues to relegate policy development</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> in this area </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">to private parties</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, just as it does with offsets in general</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. The inherent weakness to this approach is obvious</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">—</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">private U.S. companies must compete with foreign companies that have the full support of their governments.</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> If a sale means transferring production and/or technology, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">private companies</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> are in a difficult position</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Given that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">their interests do not</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">always align with</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">national interest, they can be expected to maximize corporate returns</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, even though the use of offsets, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">which <strong>can deeply affect an industry as essential to the nation's economy</strong> and security as aerospace, can be detrimental to U.S. national interests</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Should there be any doubt about the seriousness of the competition from foreign entities and governments, one has only to look at the success of companies like EADS. What were once fledgling industries are now U.S. competitors who benefit from a sophisticated approach to offsets that moves jobs and technology their way.10 As succinctly stated by the Aerospace Commission, &quot;…</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">foreign nations</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> clearly recognize the potential benefits from aerospace and </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">are attempting to wrest global leadership away from us</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">&quot; (Aerospace Industries Commission 2002, 1-2). A country that truly understands the importance of adopting a comprehensive aerospace policy based on offsets is China. As reported in the 2005 Report to Congress of the of U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, &quot;…Chinese firms have used their leverage to extract offsets—agreements to transfer some of the aircraft production along with related expertise and technology—as part of the deals&quot;; the report further concludes, &quot;China nurtures its domestic aviation and aerospace industry by exploiting the international competition already in the industry&quot; (U.S.-China Review Commission 2005, 30). Indeed, as summarized in one U.S. government report: </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">China is likely to be the largest</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">customer—and possibly an emerging </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">competitor</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">—of the U.S. aerospace industry in the future. China's aerospace manufacturing base is enormous. U.S. companies (and European companies to a lesser extent) have successfully partnered with Chinese companies that provide components or parts for a number of commercial aerospace programs. However, China also is seeking to become a world-class prime commercial aerospace manufacturing industrial base, both through indigenous development programs and joint ventures with non-Chinese companies. (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, xii) In testimony in 2001, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) singled out China for developing an effective industrial policy in an effort to create its own aerospace industry. It noted in its testimony that the U.S. International Trade Commission had already found with respect to China, &quot;…the nation's aviation sector intends to pursue a principal role in commercial aircraft manufacturing.&quot;11 During a 1998 visit to China to tour aerospace facilities, IAM participants observed the country's enormous aerospace capacity.12 China's aviation industry &quot;consists of more than 200 enterprises that produce and manufacture products such as aircraft, turboprop engines, aircraft components and subsystems, helicopters, industrial gas turbines, and various electromechanical products&quot; (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, 58). China's huge industrial capacity has been noted by other observers as well.13 For example, one research group notes that in China there are six companies devoted to &quot;airframe assembly,&quot; eight &quot;engine&quot; companies, 28 entities involved with &quot;components,&quot; and 20 &quot;research institutes.&quot;14 The two leading aircraft companies in China (China Aviation Industry Corporation I [AVIC I] and Aviation Industry Corporation II [AVIC II]) &quot;and their subsidiaries have about 491,000 employees&quot; (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, 5815). How did China develop such a huge capacity for aerospace production? While there are many different and related methods China uses, a significant one is offsets.16 As globalization critic Jeff Faux said in testimony to Congress, &quot;China is one of the most aggressive countries in pursuing offsets agreements and, with its market potential and minimal labor standards, it has substantial leverage in negotiating these agreements&quot; (Faux 2002). And as a business person told the Wall Street Journal, &quot;they're interested in having total access to technology….&quot;17 Of particular concern to the United States is the huge involvement of Boeing in China, an involvement the company acknowledges. According to its Web site: &quot;Boeing procurement from China is significantly greater than other aviation companies&quot; (Boeing 2007). According to company summaries: Since the 1980s, Boeing has purchased more than $1 billion in aviation hardware and services from China. Approximately 4,500 Boeing airplanes with parts and assemblies built by China are flying throughout the world today. Boeing and Boeing supplier partners have active supplier contracts with China's aviation industry valued at well over $2.5 billion (Boeing 2007). A detailed listing illustrating Boeing's extensive procurement activities, production work, and supplier involvement in China appears in the appendix. According to a news report, &quot;Boeing is expanding its relationship with China through plans to double its annual purchases from Chinese companies over the next six years to more than $1 billion per year by 2010&quot; (U.S. Department of Commerce 2005b, 59, citing Business Daily Update, &quot;Boeing Seeks Higher-Level Cooperation With Chinese Suppliers&quot;). Boeing is, of course, just one of many aerospace companies investing in China's aerospace industry; another is Boeing's chief rival, Airbus. As quoted in The Australian (&quot;Airbus Enlists China,&quot; June 14, 2004), Airbus Chief Executive Noel Forgeard explained his company's philosophy with respect to China: &quot;Airbus is not only selling aircraft in China but is also committed to the long-term development of China's aviation industry.&quot; The Australian also reported that parts of the A380 will be produced in China: European aircraft maker Airbus has subcontracted a state-owned Chinese manufacturer to make parts for its super-jumbo A380 plane, in a deal worth about $170 million. China Aviation Corp. I (AVIC I) will make panels for A380 nose-landing gear….China's Shenyang Aircraft Corp., affiliated with AVIC I, would also be subcontracted to make A330/A340 forward-cargo door projects….Five Chinese companies are now making parts for Airbus. The New York Times reported that Airbus is committed &quot;to buy at least $60 million yearly in parts from China by 2007, rising to $120 million yearly by 2010.&quot;18 According to other news reports, China will &quot;build wing boxes for Airbus&quot; in a $500 million deal,19 and Airbus and China have agreed on &quot;a $9 billion order…for 150 narrow-body A320 aircraft, and said they would study the possibility of building a final assembly line for the aircraft in China.&quot;20 That study apparently produced positive results; as stated in an Airbus press release (&quot;Joint Venture Contract Signed for the A320 Family Final Assembly Line in Tianjin,&quot; June 28, 2007): &quot;The FAL [final assembly line] in Tianjin will be based on the latest state-of-the-art Airbus single-aisle final assembly line in Hamburg, Germany. The aircraft will be assembled and delivered in China to the same standards as those assembled and delivered in Europe.&quot; The significance of such a development cannot be overstated: &quot;the memorandum of understanding between China's National Development and Reform Commission and Airbus…meant that China was likely to become only the third country assembling Airbus aircraft, after France and Germany.&quot;21 Brazil's aerospace industry is also teaming up with China. &quot;In order to supply its domestic market while continuing to learn how to assemble a modern, complete aircraft to Western standards, two AVIC-II companies teamed with Embraer…in 2002 for co-production of their regional jet (ERJ-145) in Harbin&quot; (Andersen 2008). Eurocopter, a subsidy of EADS, is also involved with China's aerospace industry. &quot;France's Eurocopter and Singapore Technologies Aerospace have signed with Hafei Aviation, a listed arm of one of China's top military contractors, to make helicopters for domestic civil use.&quot;22 China's aerospace industry is apparently not content to maintain its current level of success. According to news reports, &quot;China is likely to start developing its own large aircraft rather than rely solely on foreign giants Boeing and Airbus….&quot;23 The country recently announced that it would be entering the large civil aircraft industry in the next 20 years,24 and, according to news reports, much of the success of this effort depends on the transfer of production and technology from other countries, presumably in the form of outsourcing and offsets from U.S. and other aerospace companies. And according to a report in Jane's Defence Weekly, &quot;China is developing a new stealthy fighter jet aircraft and many of the design concepts and components have already been created….This new aircraft is the first Eastern rival to the West's F/A-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to be put into development….&quot;25 China's aerospace industry may even be expanding to space. In an article headlined &quot;The Next Space Race: China Heads to the Stars,&quot; the New York Times (January 22, 2004) raises the possibility of a space race with China, noting: The Chinese plan to send more astronauts into space next year, to launch a Moon probe within three years, and are aiming to land an unmanned vehicle on the Moon by 2010…. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Will the U.S. aerospace industry remain the strongest</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> in the world? </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">As other countries implement industrial policies based on outsourcing and offsets, <strong>the question becomes</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> more </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">urgent</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Moves by countries like China to implement industrial policies targeting U.S. leadership in such essential industries as aerospace call for a response by U.S. policy makers. Even if China's aerospace industry remains behind that of the United States, it is poised to contribute to growing global competition. It has the capacity, skilled workforce, and the will to make this a reality. The virtually unregulated world of offsets only exacerbates this situation. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">While the U.S. government <strong>continues a hands-off approach</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to this market-distorting scheme, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">other countries are giving their companies significant backing based on well-developed industrial policies</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span></span><br />

Leadership is key to resiliency – absence causes nuclear conflict<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">[Michael, The Case for Goliath: How America Acts As the World’s Government in the Twenty-First Century, p. 192-195]</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">Although the spread of nuclear weapons, with the corresponding increase in the likelihood that a nuclear shot would be fired in anger somewhere in the world, counted as the most serious potential consequence of the abandonment by the United States of its role as the world's government, it was not the only one.</span> <u>In the previous period of American international reticence, the 1920s and 1930s, the global economy suffered serious damage that a more active American role might have mitigated</u>. <u>A twenty-first-century American retreat could have similarly adverse international economic consequences.</u> <u>The economic collapse of the 1930s caused extensive hardship throughout the world and led indirectly to World War II</u><u>by paving the way for the people who started it to gain power in Germany and Japan</u>. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">In retrospect, the Great Depression is widely believed to have been caused by a series of errors in public policy that made an economic downturn far worse than it would have been had governments responded to it in appropriate fashion. Since the 1930s, acting on the lessons drawn from that experience by professional economists, governments have taken steps that have helped to prevent a recurrence of the disasters of that decade.' In the face of reduced demand, for example, governments have increased rather than cut spending. Fiscal and monetary crises have evoked rescue efforts rather than a studied indifference based on the assumption that market forces will readily reestablish a desirable economic equilibrium. In contrast to the widespread practice of the 1930s, political authorities now understand that putting up barriers to imports in an attempt to revive domestic production will in fact worsen economic conditions everywhere. Still,</span> <u>a serious, prolonged failure of the international economy, inflicting the kind of hardship the world experienced in the 1930s</u> (which some Asian countries also suffered as a result of their fiscal crises in the 1990s) <u>does not lie beyond the realm of possibility. Market economies remain subject to cyclical downturns, which public policy can limit but has not found a way to eliminate entirely</u>. <u>Markets also have an inherent tendency to form bubbles, excessive values for particular assets,</u> whether seventeenth century Dutch tulips or twentieth century Japanese real estate and Thai currency, <u>that cause economic harm when the bubble bursts and prices plunge</u>. <u>In responding to these events, governments can make errors</u>. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">They can act too slowly, or fail to implement the proper policies, or implement improper ones. Moreover, the global economy and the national economies that comprise it, like a living organism, change constantly and sometimes rapidly: Capital flows across sovereign borders, for instance, far more rapidly and in much greater volume in the early twenty-first century than ever before. This means that measures that successfully address economic malfunctions at one time may have less effect at another, just as medical science must cope with the appearance of new strains of influenza against which existing vaccines are not effective. Most importantly,</span> <u>since the Great Depression, an active American international economic role has been crucial both in fortifying the conditions for global economic well-being and in coping with the problems that have occurred, especially periodic recessions and currency crises, by applying the lessons of the past. The absence of such a role could weaken those conditions and aggravate those problems.</u> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">The overall American role in the world since World War II therefore has something in common with the theme of the Frank Capra film It's a Wonderful Life, in which the angel Clarence, played by Henry Travers, shows James Stewart, playing the bank clerk George Bailey, who believes his existence to have been worthless, how life in his small town of Bedford Falls would have unfolded had he never been born. George Bailey learns that people he knows and loves turn out to be far worse off without him. So it is with the United States and its role as the world's government. Without that role, the world very likely would have been in the past, and would become in the future, a less secure and less prosperous place.</span> The abdication by the United States of some or all of the responsibilities for international security that it had come to bear in the first decade of the twenty-first century would deprive the international system of one of its principal safety features, <u>which keeps countries from smashing into each other, as they are historically prone to do</u>.<u>In this sense, a world without America would be the equivalent of a freeway full of cars without brakes</u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Similarly, should the American government abandon some or all of the ways in which it had, at the dawn of the new century, come to support global economic activity<u>,</u></span><u>the world economy would function less effectively and might even suffer a severe and costly breakdown.</u> A <u>world without the United States would in this way resemble a fleet of cars without gasoline.</u></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">At best, an American withdrawal would bring with it some of the political anxiety typical during the Cold War and a measure of the economic uncertainty that characterized the years before World War II. At worst, </span><u>the retreat of American power could lead to a repetition of the great global economic failure and</u> <u>the bloody international conflicts the world experienced in the 1930s and 1940s. Indeed, the potential for economic calamity and wartime destruction is greater at the outset of the new century than it was in the first half of the preceding one because of the greater extent of international economic interdependence and the higher levels of prosperity—there is more to lose now than there was then—and because of the presence, in large numbers, of nuclear weapons</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Less intuitive is how periods of </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. As such, exogenous shocks such as </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> (see also Gilpin. 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">increasing the risk of miscalculation</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland's (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> of states</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. He argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">if the expectations of future trade decline</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> potentially be the </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">trigger</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> for </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">decreased trade expectations</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> (2002) </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. They write: The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">presence of a recession tends to <strong>amplify the extent</strong> to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. (Blomberg &amp; Hess, 2002. p. 89) </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Economic</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">decline has</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> also </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">been linked with an increase in</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> the likelihood of terrorism</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> (Blomberg, Hess, &amp; Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&quot;Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect.</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">periods of weak economic performance in the U</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">nited States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas </span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels</span></u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention. </span></span>
