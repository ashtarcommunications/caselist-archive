===Contention 1: China Threat=== 
**China threat discourse is created by the military-industrial complex, repeated by a compliant media. Any Chinese space weapons program is in response to US policy.**

Foust ‘8
Jeff Foust, editor and publisher of The Space Review, The Space Review, 3/3/08, China and the US: space race or miscommunication?, http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1075/1

Those in the US who are concerned … a lot of mistrust and bad feelings.”

**The consequence of these misperceptions is counterproductive policies like the Wolf amendment, which bans cooperation with China on space issues and threatens the relationship of two incredibly powerful states**

Kulacki 6/23
Gregory, senior analyst and China Project manager for the Union of Concerned Scientists, Nature 474, 444–445 (23 June 2011)

Attempts to isolate the Chinese space … suspicions created by the legacy of this affair.

**Indeed, the second half of the twentieth century has been the story of paranoia over China perpetuated to justify power politics and the military-industrial complex. This cycle of enemy creation results in financial disaster and the sacrificial destruction of millions.**

Clark 6

For as long as I have been in the China-watching business … have been spent. And millions have died.

**Why is the American military-industrial complex obsessed with Chinese space militarization? Their knowledge of China is produced without reference to its epistemological basis, and fails to describe the status quo objectively, instead self-starting a cycle of fulfilled prophecies of rising tensions.**

Pan 4

More specifically, I want to argue …, oriental studies, political science, and international relations.*

**Accordingly, China’s military space programs are countermeasures to US military posture, spurring a costly arms race—changing US space policy can stop the security dilemma cycle.**

China’s military space program and its … the U.S. could slow the momentum toward a space arms race.

**China threat discourse makes war between the two countries inevitable and emboldens nationalists and hardliners in China. We must reject this kind of security discourse to allow better ways of thinking about China in the policy realm.**

I have argued above that the "China threat" … dangerous ways of interpreting and debating China might become possible.

**“Threats real” is not responsive – hardline arguments miss that the only way to eliminate a threat is to understand from whence it came. Deconstructing threats is try or die.**

Mack 91

The threat of nuclear annihilation … will with anything approaching objectivity.”

**China threat discourse is hyped up to justify bases overseas and massive military budgets.**

Philosophical attention to war has typically …f contemporary military institutions and practices. 

**In addition—the creation of security threats is a technology of power—security is used as a threat to discipline the population into a conformity which facilitates torture and violence. The opposite of insecurity is not to secure but to emancipate.**

Neocleous 8
Mark Neocleous, Professor of the Critique of Political Economy at Brunel University, 08 (“Critique of Security”, McGill-Queen’s University, pp. 4-6 Published 2008)

But what if at the heart of … anti-disciplinary. It is a work of critique.

===Plan===

On the surface, it may seem as … incompatible, uncompromising realm is outer space.

**Uncertainty over space cooperation creates zero-sum space conflict. Close cooperation reassures both sides and avoids conflict.**

**But changing policy alone cannot succeed—only rejecting the production of “China Threat” discourse and its flawed epistemology and embracing insecurity and unpredictability can break the cycle.**

Pan 4
Chengxin Pan, Department of Political Science and International Relations at Australian National University (June-July 2004, “The ‘China Threat’ in American Self-Imagination: The Discursive Construction of Other as Power Politics, Alternatives: Global, Local, Political”)

And yet, the real problem … and debating China might become possible.

**The power of security relies on the assent of those oppressed—the choice of the ballot is to accept or reject the securitized speech act directed at China - it is only securitized if you accept their speech act. Side constraint for rejecting securitization.**
Saltera ‘8

This model of settings for securitizing moves fits cleanly … policy making discourse' (Floyd 2007: 336). 

**Understanding the discourse we use to understand the world is a prerequisite to policymaking—policy change can only take place when discursive dynamics are also changed through the slow transformation of cultural values. The affirmative is that transversal dissent.**

Bleiker 2000
[Roland, Prof of International Relations, Popular Dissent, Human Agency, and Global Politics, p. 183-4]

While the previous chapter explained … elusive to be apprehended by the human mind?

**And, the Aff’s speech act of dissenting to China threat rhetoric can create solidarity in other countries to create international change—example is anti-apartheid campaign.**
