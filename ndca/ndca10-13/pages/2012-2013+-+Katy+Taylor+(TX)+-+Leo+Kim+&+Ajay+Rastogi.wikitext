**We have internalized the blackmail of security, encasing ourselves in cellophane to ensure our shelf lives. This view reduces the body to a diseased object in need of protection and insurance, making life nothing more than a process of continual mortification.**
**Baudrillard 76** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Jean, smart Frenchy, Symbolic Exchange and Death, pp. 177-180, Sage Publications)</span>

==Anti Aesthetics v2 @Berkeley== 

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">The War to End all Wars. That was the name given to the bloodbath where the greatest atrocities against man were committed. World War 1 brought upon much worse than death and suffering—it inspired a hatred for humanity. And it is from this disgust and cynicism that the Dadaists were born. This group of people represented everything aesthetics hated -they were the anti-bourgeoisie, they were anti-art, they were anti-RULES. They destroyed the idols and gods created by the AESTHETIC IDEAL. Esaak explains</span>**
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Dada was</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> a literary and … </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Dada self-destructed when it was in danger of becoming "acceptable".</span>

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">While World War 1 may be over, a new aesthetic ideal has pervaded every aspect of our lives. The new god of the modern world confines everything to the servitude of utility. The status quo’s obsession with this logic has dichotomized the concepts of usefulness and waste. Furthermore, our attempts to secure what is useful justifies the use of the world’s populations as a means to an end. Only acts of wasteful expenditure can dissolve this dualism. Land explains</span>**
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Nick, Professor at Warwick University, //The Thirst for Annihilation: Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism//, pg. xi-xii, [LK])</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Life appears as a</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">… </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">back into the blind infernal extravagance of the sun.</span>


**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Our enslavement to utility produces the paradox of the modern world where all of our actions are driven by search for a solution that is supposed to helpful, but only disappoints. This meaningless search is a struggle that estranges the person from their self.</span>**
**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Bataille tells us…</span>**
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">(Georges, historian, librarian and philosopher, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The Accursed Share</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 10pt;">, P. 129)</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">At the origin of industrial society … in history, and of the projected fulfillment that is offered us.</span>




**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Our transportation infrastructure system is a perfect example of the application of the aesthetic ideal to our every day lives. Its inherent value is derived from its utility and is nothing more than a normality used to construct the boundaries of society. </span>**
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">(Julien Merle, Faculty of Architecture, Delft University of Technology, “Bataille’s Writings: (Un-)framing the transgression of architecture’s limits,” 2009, Edinburgh Architecture Research, http://ace.caad.ed.ac.uk/ear2009/upload/pdfs/015-Merlex.pdf)</span>
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">More than 70 years ago … in the present disciplinary shifts of boundaries</span>


**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">In fact we are so engrossed in the benefits transportation infrastructure provides for us, we overlook the racism it produces, the discrimination it creates, and the natives it oppresses. It is the modern day example of how we attempt to securitize our lives and view difference as expendable. Just as the Dadaists were sick of humanity for allowing World War 1 to happen, Ajay and I are disgusted by how humanity is able to overlook the horrors transportation infrastructure creates because its utilitarian frame meets the aesthetic ideal. It is within this aesthetic ideal that props up the idols we must smash. God is dead but we still try to warm ourselves in the presence of his ever-rotting carcass by holding onto the myth of values – We must shirk off the chains of ideals and destroy them, else we succumb to endless violence. The only solution is to dissolve the status quo’s representation of transportation infrastructure.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Thus we affirm: the United States federal government should wastefully and excessively invest in the construction of meaningless roads in a labyrinthine manner.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">The labyrinth is THE anti-aesthetics that we need – an affirmation of its construction is the act of transgression against the restrictive logic of utility that confine us into a mental prison. Just as the Dadaists attempted to deconstruct humanities concepts of nationalism, rationalism, and all the other –isms that allowed war to happen, we attempt to destroy all concepts of what makes status quo transportation infrastructure what it is.

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Our construction of a labyrinth is planless planning which turns purpose against itself in a confrontation to the aesthetic ideal – With our actions comes a lucidity that opens onto the death of God and the idols we subscribe to. Only wasteful expenditures are able to destroy the society which lusts for finding utility and purpose. Stoekl furthers…</span>**

**__<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">This is “planning without a head” … a lucidity that opens onto the extinction of society, the individual, and the state.</span>__**


<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Any opposition to our transgressive action of building the labyrinth results in devastating accumulation and denies life meaning. The managerial ethics of the status quo inevitably leads to war and depopulation. Stoekl explains</span>

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Our obsession with the virtual catastrophe locks us in a mental state where we reproduce the catastrophe market for the pleasure of alleviating them. We fail to realize that the real catastrophe is the fear and neurosis these apocalyptic scenarios incite in our minds. Our labyrinth is key to breaking down the logic of security which limits our existence and negates life.</span>**

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">It is clear that </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">the world is purely parodic</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> … </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;"> even though the anus is night.</span></span></span>


**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">We understand that a world in which a labyrinth exists would be chaotic and disastrous, but these are the aspects of life that we must learn to exist with to truly give life meaning. Clinging to security and aesthetic ideals which give a purpose to our lives is inherently life negating—we must kill the gods which dictate our lives to escape the wrath of nihilism and regain control over our own subjectivities.</span>**

==Anti-Aesthetics Aff @ Baylor RR== 
**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">The War to End all Wars. That was the name given to the bloodbath where the greatest atrocities against man were committed. World War 1 brought upon much worse than death and suffering—it inspired a hatred for humanity. And it is from this disgust and cynicism that the Dadaists were born. These people represented everything aesthetics hated – they broke conventions, they broke rules, they broke the ideal. They were the anti-bourgeoisie, they were anti-art, they were anti-RULES. They destroyed the idols and gods created by the AESTHETIC IDEAL Esaak explains</span>**

<span style="color: #3366cc; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">([[http://arthistory.about.com/bio/Shelley-Esaak-9525.htm|Shelley]],</span> <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">[[http://arthistory.about.com/cs/arthistory10one/a/dada.htm]], </span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;">majored in Illustration at Kendall College of Art and Design, and Graphic Design, with a minor concentration in Art History, at the University of Michigan School of Art and Design 1/11/13, [AR])</span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Dada was</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> a literary and artistic movement </span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 8pt;"> ... </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Dada self-destructed when it was in danger of becoming "acceptable".</span>


**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">This aesthetic ideal confines everything to the servitude of utility. Death and life now become defined in terms of their usefulness – Death is inherently viewed as valueless – This logic of utility causes our lives to be secured over excess which justifies the use of the world’s population as a means to an end. Only acts of wasteful expenditure can solve. Land explains</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Thus in the face of this years resolution we have found another god we must kill. Our transportation infrastructure has become shaped by nothing other than another aesthetic ideal which forces us to view transportation in terms of its utility to us. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">It is nothing but a social norm used to construct the boundaries of society. </span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Bataille does, then, implicitly face the question of carrying capacity ... perhaps, the world’s (but not modernity’s) </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">survival</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>





**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">We are forced to overlook the racism it produces, the discrimination it causes against the disabled, the natives is oppresses all in the name of the benefits it provides for us. It is the modern day example of how we attempt to securitize our lives and view difference as expendable. Just as the Dadaists were sick of humanity for allowing World War 1 to happen, Ajay and I are disgusted by how humanity is able to overlook the horrors transportation infrastructure creates because it meets the restrictions set upon by a new aesthetic ideal. It is within this aesthetic ideal that props up the idols we must smash. God is dead but we still try to warm ourselves in the presence of his ever-rotting carcass by holding onto the myth of values – We must shirk off the chains of ideals and destroy them, else we succumb to endless violence in the name of maintain a norm. The only solution is to dissolve the status quo’s representation of transportation infrastructure.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.5;">The labyrinth is THE anti-aesthetics that we need – an affirmation of its construction is the act of transgression against the restrictive logic of utility that confine us into a mental prison.

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">And we know that Dadaists have their flaws, but just like the surrealists and culture jammers, we use their anti-aesthetics and anti-art position as inspiration for our destruction of the idols and gods. Continue to kill the gods created by the aesthetic ideal- laugh with us! The jokes on debate because no matter how much you try to stop us, we will continue to kill the gods. We admit life would probably be chaos in a world where transportation infrastructure doesn’t make sense, but that’s okay. Embracing chaos is good, in fact it’s the only way to avoid nihilism and affirm life. Smith tells us.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">THROUGH THIS SYSTEM OF CONTROL, THE STATE IS ABLE TO SUBJUGATE AFFECT INTO THEIR HIERARCHIES OF VALUE, WHICH CREATES THE HEROIC-META NARRATIVES THAT ENABLE ALL FORMS OF EXPLOITATION IN POLITICS.

__**Affect is**__ for Deleuze and Spinoza...as spiritual simulation.

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">These hierarchal power structures allow the state to implement policy actions like transportation infrastructure in the name of its people. These actions, however, only solidify the states’ control of every aspect of its people lives. This control creates a subject-object relationship between the transcendental state and its population where the people are just modes of production and become assemblages to the state.

The twentieth century...societies of control

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">THE SUBJECT OBJECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND US ALLOWS FOR THE STATE TO CONTROL EVERY FACET OF OUR LIVES- OUR FLOWS, SOCIAL INTERACTIONS, AND LIBIDINAL DESIRES. THIS PLACES LITTLE VOICES IN OUR HEAD WHICH MAKE US BELIEVE THERE IS A CORRECT FORM OF EXISTENCE. THESE MICRO-FACISMS NEGATE VALUE TO LIFE AND CAUSE US TO DESIRE OUR OWN REPRESSION.

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">THUS AJAY AND I AFFIRM A MINOR APPROACH TO INCREASING INVESTMENTS IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN A POLITICS OF IMMANENCE. WE DO THIS BY CONSTANTLY BECOMING OTHER THAN OURSELVES TO STOP THE STATE’S SUBJUGATION OF AFFECT TO REGAIN OUR POTENTIAL TO MAKE RADICAL CHANGE. WE CHOOSE TO EMBRACE THE INFINITE MIDDLE AND SEE OUR AFFIRMATION AS PART OF AN ONGOING PROCESS WITHOUT A BEGINNING OR END. ONLY BY DECONSTRUCTING THE COMMON NOTION OF WHAT TRANSPORTATION IS CAN WE ALLOW FOR NEW, INNOVATIVE TYPES TO EMERGE—TYPES THAT WE CAN’T EVEN FATHOM TODAY. </span>**


**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">OUR AFFIRMATION ISN’T AN OBSESSIVE TRANSCENDENCE FROM THE STATUS QUO, BUT RATHER AN AFFIRMATION OF IMMANENCE, BECOMINGS, DIFFERENCE… THOUGHT IS NOT ARBORESCENT AND WE MUST REFUSE TO ENCAPSULATE OUR RESISTANCE TO A SINGULAR IDEOLOGICAL NOTION BUT AFFIRM THE POWER OF AFFECT.

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Humans have always lusted to discover foreign places and expel uncertainty. Even before Columbus discovered America and Magellan circumvented the seas, we sailed to the unknown in order to map it out. Our desire for knowledge knows no bounds, and even in the status quo, no stone is left unturned. Smooth space has disappeared as transportation infrastructure striates everything it comes into contact with. The seas have been mapped out by the states’ navigation techniques and use of ships.

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Thus Ajay and I affirm a nomadic approach to increase investments in transportation infrastructure in a politics of immanence. We nomadically affirm the topic by not engaging in the status quo’s politics of transcendence where everything is mapped out and planned. Rather we choose to embrace the infinite middle and see our affirmation as part of an ongoing process without a beginning or end. Only by deconstructing the common notion of what transportation is can we allow for new, innovative types to emerge—types that we can’t even fathom today. </span>**


**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 11pt;">Our nomadic affirmation is not an obsessive transcendence from the status quo but rather an affirmation of immanence- there is no set beginning or end-point but merely a smooth space, open to infinite amounts of possibilities and becomings.

===Kill the Gods 1NC=== 

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">As I walked the streets of Paris, wandering mindlessly, I met a madman or perhaps the Dark Lord himself. A small crowd was gathered around him so I leaned an ear to hear what he has to say.</span>**
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is clear that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">…. anus is night.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> [[file:///C:/Users/Leo%20Kim/Desktop/Kill%20the%20Gods%20CItes.docx#_ftn1|[1]]]</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">WHAT?!</span>**
**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">What I heard boggled my mind – for years I have been wandering mindlessly without a purpose… But why? For what? Now I knew. I was to bring this world into my hands, understand the chaos of the world, and control EVERYTHING!</span>**

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Thus I began my journey – in the beginning everything seemed to be going well but it was only a fleeting time until I was stuck. I desired the TRUTH I desired KNOWLEDGE I desired a new GOD, but whiter can it be found?</span>**

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Depressed, angry at myself, angry at the world, I sulked in my room, lost and confused. I looked out the window and saw a man with a very familiar mustache wandering around my garden. He was none other than Friedrich Nietzsche.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">It was Nietzsche who transcended time to converse with Zoroaster in Persian, Gilles in French, and Heidegger in German – he had said - __Too far into the future did I fly; dread fell upon me__. </span><span style="color: black;">[[file:///C:/Users/Leo%20Kim/Desktop/Kill%20the%20Gods%20CItes.docx#_ftn2|**[2]**]]</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> - and now he was here telling me the fable –</span>**

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Can it be that I desire too much from this world? I hated this world. I wished for new world, one that does not make us suffer. One that I could CONTROL! One that I could know everything and fear nothing. Turanli explains</span>**

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">A denaturalized world Nietzsche said about the world I desired. I desired merely for truth and an interpretation to frame this world, but I ended up desiring more. I desired for security in my life, free from everything that could harm me – but Seem tells us that - </span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">What are they based on? For </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> … </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">“a breath of fresh air, a relationship with the outside world.” </span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Leo%20Kim/Desktop/Kill%20the%20Gods%20CItes.docx#_ftn5|[5]]]</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">As Friedrich and I talked amidst drinks and card games, he was reprimanding about how I should stop desiring such dangerous thoughts. To this I said: “But Friedrich, I’m scared! I’m scared of things unknown to me! I fear death and I worry about death.” At this moment, I remembered another thing the madman on this streets of Paris said to the crowd –</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">"</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">'Life</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;">."

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">“Welcome to the modern world!” the madman said “a world that is constantly driven by the search for a solution that locks only in a meaningless struggle!” He was mad, indeed, but perhaps he was right! Our desire for the perfect solution stems from the functionality of politics in the status quo – one that condemns everything to the servitude of UTILITY. Death and life become defined in terms of utility and excess. Land furthers on my point when he said:</span>**
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">Life appears as a</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 8pt;"> … </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">extravagance of the sun.</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">[[file:///C:/Users/Leo%20Kim/Desktop/Kill%20the%20Gods%20CItes.docx#_ftn7|[7]]]</span>

**<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Putting 1 and 1 came out with 2. I was enlightened. The world was indeed parodic, chaotic, lacking an interpretation… we can’t control the world, we can’t frame out the undesirable notions of life… everyone is so obsessed with controlling everything – life, death, excess… But God is dead! Gods create meaning where there isn’t meaning, a transcendent being, who with the telos of staving off death and uncertainty, controls and dictates ethics and morals and lives</span>**

===Bataille 1NC (Death Version)=== 

**The 1AC’s concept of death creates a binary of death with life and presupposes a transcendental emphasis on the vertical hierarchy which establishes individual beings. But there is always a horizontal dissolution all boundaries in a positive and immanent complexity. From this perspective, death is nothing more than the abolition of stop signs in an infinite traffic of intensities. All of life is a vertical mirage- a few implications**
**1) No impact to the 1AC- there is no impact to death, and life is rather a solar flux of particles, vote negative on presumption**
**2) The 1AC’s ideas of death destroys value to life and turns case**
**Land ’92** (Nick, lecturer of Continental philosophy at Warwick University, //The Thirst for Annhilation- Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism//, pdf found online, pp. 123-124, [LK])

A provisional differentiation... streaming with solar dreams.

**B. Thus in the face of death Leo and I,**

**Laugh and laugh**
**at the sun**
**at the nettles**
**at the stones**
**at the ducks**
**at the rain**
**at the pee-pee of the pope**
**at mummy**
**at a coffin full of shit [IV 13].***

***Bataille, Georges. “Rire”**

**Our alternative is an act of looking death into the eyes and breaking out in a pure, rapturous laugh- our act of sacrifice and laughter is an act of liberation from creeping slave morality and of transgression against transcendence and ressentiment.**
**Land ’92** (Nick, lecturer of Continental philosophy at Warwick University, //The Thirst for Annhilation- Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism//, pdf found online, Preface, [LK])

This poem introduces... the ultimate principle of utility.

**C. Our laughter in the face of death leads us into a risk encounter with death that gives us meaning to our lives- the affirmative causes us to live to not die rather than to live to live. Our laughter in the face of death is key to living a life of value**

**<span style="font-family: Times;">D. </span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Aff must explain why your response to</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"> **death should be worry – the alt doesn’t embrace of extinction but refuses to subordinate life to fear** </span>

===Bataille 1NC (Utility Version)=== 

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The 1AC merely glosses over the reason that makes their impacts sustainable. The discrimination or oppression of the affirmative is symptomatic of the concept of utility. </span>**

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Nick, Professor at Warwick University, //The Thirst for Annihilation: Georges Bataille and Virulent Nihilism//, pg. xi-xii, [LK])</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Life appears as a pause on the energy path; ... </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;">The death of God is the ultimate transgression, the release of humanity from itself, back into the blind infernal extravagance of the sun.</span>

**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The managerial ethic of the affirmative only serves to uphold the very system that makes their plan defensible. Their endorsement of economic rationality culminates into war and depopulation. </span>**

<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">Bataille does, then, implicitly face the question of carrying capacity. Perhaps the ultimate example of this is nuclear war ... perhaps, the world’s (but not modernity’s) </span><span class="DebateUnderline">**__<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">survival</span>__**</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

===Viviocentrism 1NC=== 

**The affirmative approaches the world with the __tautological rationality of viviocentrism__ – that is life-centeredness. Viviocentrism is a noble lie that informs all aspects of their advocacy and it is the same binary logic of natural mastery that justifies racism, sexism, anthropomorphism, etc. Opening our minds to death allows a transcendence of the tyranny of life and creates the conditions for the ultimate erosion of all borders and conceptions of the natural – put the burden on them to justify physical existence as a role for the ballot**

===__Security 1NC__=== 
**<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">We have internalized the blackmail of security, encasing ourselves in cellophane to ensure our shelf lives.

===Nuclearism 1NC=== 

**<span style="background-color: white; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">The scenario for nuclear escalation and war they imagine will always be prevented by deterrence. However, the </span>**<span class="highlight">**<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 12pt;">fear </span>**</span>**<span style="background-color: white; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">of nuclear war is used to justify a state security apparatus that freezes the social and maintains a system of perfect control. the true damage of nuclear weapons is not the war that could result, but in the</span>**<span class="highlight">**<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 12pt;">fear</span>**</span>**<span style="background-color: white; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">and mental destruction that </span>**<span class="highlight">**<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 12pt;">fear </span>**</span>**<span style="background-color: white; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">of them demands. Instead of trying to avoid the catastrophe, we must embrace its simulation and break the mental chains of deterrence.</span>**<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 12pt;"> **The threat of nuclear war is only a simulacrum of violence holding the world captive under deterrence destroying life’s experience.** </span>
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 12pt;">**Baudrillard 81** (Jean, Simulacra and Simulation, pg. 32-34)</span>

The apothesis of simulation ... the whole world is satellized.

Everywhere survival has become a burning issue ... At a stroke an end is put to survival blackmail and life can go on.

**The Onion ’98** (The World’s Finest News Source, “Poll: 73 percent of Americans Unable to Believe This Shit”, Online, [LK])

According to the latest Gallup poll ... "Shit, no."

===Comparative Institutional Analysis (aka A-Spec) 1NC=== 

**The affirmative refused to specify the branch of government they act through doing it in the 2AC is too late because we’ve already chosen the 1NC and no longer have the ability to conduct comparative institutional analysis**

**And, Power in the federal government is divided by three branches**
**Rotunda in ‘1** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Richard, prof. law at the university of Illinois, 18 const. Commentary 319, “The commerce clause, the political question doctrine, and Morrision”, lexis)</span>

**__The Framers__** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">sought to protect liberty by creating a central government of enumerated powers. They divided power between the state and federal governments, and they</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">further </span>**__divided power__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> within the federal government by splitting it </span>**__among__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the </span>**__three branches of government__**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and they further divided the legislative power (the power that the Framers most feared) by splitting it between two Houses of Congress.</span>


**This is a voting issue**

**First, Policy Education – It’s impossible to determine whether the plan is valuable without looking to the branch of government implementing it**

**Komesar in ’94** <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Neil professor of law at the University of Wisconsin, Imperfect Alternatives: Choosing institutions in Law, Economic, and Public Policy, p. 4-5)</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">For example, one would assume... public policy results.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Issues of institutional representation ... the issue of institutional choice.</span>


**Role of the ballot -**

**The most fundamental question for academics in determining public policy is to engage in comparative institutional analysis: serial policy failure is inevitable without conscious effort to encourage comparative analysis by decision-makers**

**Heminway in ‘5** <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Joan, professor of law at the University of Tennessee, 10 Fordham J. Corp. & Fin. L. 225, lexis)</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It also, however ... who struggle with these decisions.</span>


**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">There’s always a suitable version of their aff, that can meet our interpretation. Their aff can still be read as long as they specify solves back all of their offense.</span>**





**90% of the analysis of plan is in the implementation, this guts solvency and education, because while they are only focusing on the goal they don’t focus on how we get there, and we can’t learn about individual branches.**

**__Elmore ’80__****(Prof. Public Affairs at University of Washington, PolySci Quarterly 79-80, p. 605)**
The emergence of implementation as a subject ... the realm of implementation.

**Fiat Abuse – Using the entirety of the federal government allows them to access all of the potential actors within its jurisdiction. We lose all of our agent CP and specific link ground, because they can always spike out of the positions by altering what they include.**


===Schmitt===

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">The Aff’s strategy of inclusion is a means of converting the Other to sameness. </span>**
**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">The problem is not in a contact with the other but the way we seek them and search them out to assimilate.</span>**

**<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">However, this is not an end to violence or exclusion, it merely drives those divisions underground and makes them more pernicious. It shifts exclusion from the level of state policy to the level of morality and humanity itself. No longer are those on the outside equal human beings who happen to belong to another state. Instead, in this new order those who trespass against the moral law are inhuman barbarians who must be exterminated to preserve humanity.</span>**
