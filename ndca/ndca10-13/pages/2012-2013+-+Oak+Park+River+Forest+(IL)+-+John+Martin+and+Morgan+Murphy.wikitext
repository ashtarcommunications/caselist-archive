Our reliance on infrastructures posits the world as an Other, opposed to the deeply rooted condition of modernity. Our inability to question our appropriation of infrastructure means that the only possible response is an endless attempt to control the forces that surround us.
__Edwards, 2002__
(Paul N., Professor of Information @ University of Michigan Department of History, //Technology and Modernity: The Empirical Turn//, Eds. Philip Brey, Arie Rip, and Andrew Feenberg, MIT Press, “Infrastructure and Modernity: Force, Time, and Social Organization in the History of Sociotechnical Systems”)

**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">in the case of infrastructure.</span>__**


This strategy has never and will never be successfully applied to infrastructures, but its failure is hidden by transportation’s attempt to reconcile time with space; at any reasonable scale of time, all infrastructure inevitably crumbles.

__Edwards, 2002__

The same is true of everything. Extinction is inevitable – our most immediate concern is how to ethically appropriate ourselves and our infrastructures.

**__<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt;">If not us, then who?</span>__**

Enframing infrastructure within standard risk calculus presumes the neutrality of objectivity. Ignoring our powerlessness opens us to the haunting of the unknown and makes us lash out in an attempt to reassert certainty.

Transportation infrastructure ontologically separates us from technology and nature – this division makes anthropocentric value systems possible and ensures a control-oriented approach to the world.
