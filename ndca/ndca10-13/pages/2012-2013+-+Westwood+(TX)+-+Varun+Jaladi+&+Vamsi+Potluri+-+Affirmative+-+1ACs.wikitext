=Metropolitian Planning Organizations Affirmative= 
==TOC== 
===Contention 1 is Inherency=== 
**Many federal funds are earmarked outside of locally derived transportation improvement plans, or TIPs now – That unexpected money disrupts Metropolitan Planning Organization, or MPO plans and undermines effective investment**
Gian-Claudia <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sciara</span>, postdoctoral scholar at the Urban Land Use and Transportation Center (ULTRANS) at the University of California, Davis, 7-5-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">12</span>, [“Planning for Unplanned Pork,” Journal of the American Planning Association, 78:3, 239-255, [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2012.694269]]] E. Liu
Earmarking shifts the power to allocate federal funds to specific projects away from regional,
AND
noted that the Congressman did not understand how earmarks could compel reshuffling projects.
That earmarking process makes policymaking a matter of distributive top-down policies – This undermines inclusive and actively participatory community planning
Evelyn <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Blumenberg</span>, Associate Professor of Urban Planning in the School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles <span style="font-size: 13pt;">and</span> Lisa <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Schweitzer</span>, Associate Professor at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, 3-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">06</span>, [“Devolution and Transport Policy for the Working Poor: The Case of the US Job Access and Reverse Commute Program,” Planning Theory & Practice, Vol. 7, No. 1, 7–25, March 2006, [[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14649350500497364]]] E. Liu
In contrast, distributive theorists argue that congressional representatives are primarily motivated by maximizing the
AND
-based organizations and county welfare and employment agencies, and program experimentation.
===Contention 2 is Community=== 
Strengthening MPOs is key to citizen involvement and influence in planning – It integrates citizens outside of traditional political spaces
Thomas W. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sanchez</span>, Chair and Professor of the Urban Affairs and Planning Program at Virginia Tech and Nonresident Senior Fellow at Brookings <span style="font-size: 13pt;">and</span> James F. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wolf</span>, Associate Professor of Public Administration at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 1-13-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">05</span>, [“Environmental Justice and Transportation Equity: A Review of Metropolitan Planning Organizations,” [[http://210.74.184.3:8080/international/case/case/276.pdf]]] E. Liu
ISTEA required greater citizen involvement in the MPO process and MPOs were expected to ensure
AND
meetings, committee membership, and other materials related to their planning activities.
Citizen participation and community unity is necessary to resist the rollback of government social provisions and check expansion of violent policing domestically and internationally
Henry A. <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Giroux,</span> Waterbury Chair Professorship at Penn State University, Global Television Network Chair in English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">08</span>, [“Democracy, Patriotism, and Schooling After September 11th Critical Citizens or Unthinking Patriots?,” From: The Abandoned Generation: Democracy Beyond the Culture of Fear, Journal of Educational Controversy, [[http://www.wce.wwu.edu/Resources/CEP/eJournal/v003n001/a007.shtml]]] E. Liu
Policing and incarceration emerge as part of a larger pattern of social control, dressed
AND
complex that also prioritizes punishment over rehabilitation, containment over social investment.67 
Media representations form imaginary communities now – These lead to spectatorship politics and are incompatible with true public involvement – This control of information shapes reality and bolsters state power through anxiety creation, legitimating violence
Jennifer <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Isherwood</span>, graduate student, Bowling Green State University, 12-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">06</span>, [“VIOLENCE, NARRATIVE AND COMMUNITY AFTER 9/11: A READING OF IAN McEWAN’S SATURDAY,” Master of Arts Thesis, [[http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/isherwood%20jennifer.pdf?bgsu1155763355]]] E. Liu
In addition to drawing upon this narrative frame in order to contextualize the events of
AND
people and legitimize violence against those who are defined as threats or outsiders.
Traumatic events open up an opportunity for political change and the imagination of less violent forms of community – The alternative is ceding initiative to the state to create a chance to perpetuate violent solutions to problems
Jennifer <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Isherwood</span>, graduate student, Bowling Green State University, 12-<span style="font-size: 13pt;">06</span>, [“VIOLENCE, NARRATIVE AND COMMUNITY AFTER 9/11: A READING OF IAN McEWAN’S SATURDAY,” Master of Arts Thesis, [[http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/isherwood%20jennifer.pdf?bgsu1155763355]]] E. Liu
This supposedly unbridgeable distinction can be disrupted by a process that Žižek calls “self
AND
by inflicting violence upon them, or by denying our own violent potential.
Infrastructure is necessary – It’s the only way to promote public spaces and develop a culture of connections and interpersonal interactions – The quality and design of infrastructure with social goals in mind is key
Annalisa <span style="font-size: 13pt;">Meyboom</span>, Assistant Professor at the University of British Columbia, <span style="font-size: 13pt;">09</span>, [“Infrastructure as Practice,” Journal of Architectural Education, pp. 72–81, 2009 ACSA Infrastructure as Practice, http://fbe-studiocollaboration.unsw.wikispaces.net/file/view/Infrastructure+as+Practice+JAE2009.pdf] E. Liu
To design infrastructure is to design a built form that can be generative and directive
AND
requires a different type of infrastructure and a different approach to building it.
===Plan Text=== 
Plan: The United States federal government should invest substantial funding directly into the transportation infrastructure components of United States Metropolitan Planning Organization Transportation Improvement Plans in the United States.
===Contention 3 is Solvency=== 
Substantial federal investment solves and is necessary – It empowers MPOs and increases their authority – Trades-off with state control and diversion of funds towards highways at the expense of urban areas
