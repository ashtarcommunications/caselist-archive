<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Although France is not without allies, most EU-member NATO allies seek a middle road. They favor a strong and autonomous ESDP and would probably be prepared to go further in this direction than the United States would like, but they are generally not prepared to cross the U.S. redlines discussed above. This reflects an enduring commitment to maintain close relations with the United States despite the absence of any palpable military threat to their security. Yet, just as they are unwilling to go as far as the French would like in pushing ESDP independence from NATO, they are similarly disinclined to go as far as the United States would like in finding new roles and missions for the alliance, particularly if they conflict with perceived EU prerogatives, or in funding the NRF.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Now, as the Bush administration draws to a close, European allies do not want to be lectured about the dangers of abandoning NATO. They expect a new US president – whether from the Republican or Democratic Party – to re-launch Euro-Atlantic relations. However, this is a high-risk strategy. For, while a new U.S president will undoubtedly want to re-invest in NATO, most presidential candidates have talked about the need to deploy more troops to Afghanistan; expect the next occupant of the White House to come calling for more troops. The Americans see NATO as part of a tool box to effect operations around the world, not just for the territorial defence of Europe. If Europe remains unwilling to make the necessary military contribution to ISAF – and the U.S becomes forced to “surge” unilaterally, as it did in Iraq – a new administration is likely to conclude, as the current one did in 2001 that NATO has little to offer as a war-fighting organisation and, by extension, is not relevant as an alliance of ideals. For, in the words of Sun Tzu, “virtue is not enough.” Ideas survive because they are supported by people who believe in them. Way ahead How, then, to get out of the current downward spiral and ensure that NATO’s Bucharest Summit does not become a venue for an alliance-destroying argument about ISAF? First, the Alliance should be re-asserted as the centre of US-European relations. The United States needs to put aside talk of ‘coalitions of the willing’ and allegations of European weakness and reaffirm the 4 multilateral nature and collective defence orientation of the Alliance. In order to restore the Alliance to a central place in US-European relations, Washington must find a way to walk back from the depth of damage done to the Alliance through the unilateral invasion of Iraq and restore the political character of NATO. This means a real, consultative engagement with the Alliance as it existed during the Cold War years. But, for this to be sustained, Europe must accept a role for the Alliance ‘out of area’ and it must do much more than has been the case in Afghanistan. Second, the members of the Alliance need to reaffirm their liberal values as the basis of NATO and redraft a strategic concept that addresses the current ‘narrative confusion’ in current counter terrorist and stabilization operations. A strategic concept based on the defence of political liberalism would reduce the current difficulties the Alliance has in resolving traditional notions of collective defence versus out of area operations involving stabilization operations—difficulties which currently threaten the very identity and future of the Alliance; the relationship of Article 5 to current operations in Afghanistan is far from clear. A new strategic consensus is vital in helping to shape US engagement in global affairs and for making liberal interventionism more effective. By making liberal interventionism less erratic, a new strategic consensus would greatly enhance the ability of NATO to condition behaviour and deter courses of action before they occur. With a new concept, hopefully, all the allies could contribute more equitably to future missions avoiding the ‘tiering ‘of the Alliance that has occurred in Afghanistan. Third, NATO needs to become truly operationally capable. It is not enough to be willing to act; allies must also be capable of acting. An inability to contribute effectively to missions further re-enforces the perception of a multi-tier alliance. The Alliance needs to redirect its military transformation agenda from the seamless conduct of low-intensity stabilization operations to high-intensity combat operations. While niche capabilities are a useful way to complement the war-fighting capabilities of other members, all new members in the Alliance must demonstrate an ability to directly contribute to full spectrum operations. The Alliance must make itself directly useful to its most powerful member, the United States. The United States needs help in Afghanistan. Unless NATO can supply additional troops to their ISAF operations and lift national caveats on their use to allow for the eventual defeat the Taliban through more agile operations, the United States will come to view the Alliance as of no further utility. This is not about NATO being subservient to the US – it is about the transatlantic community making a serious, cooperative contribution to global peace and security. America thinks in global terms, not simply European ones. Without US support, the Alliance is moribund. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">John </span></strong><u>O'Sullivan</u> <strong>, editor of the National Review and founder of the New Atlantic, 6-19</strong><u>98</u> <strong>[American Spectator]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Some of those ideas--notably, dissolution and &quot;standing pat&quot;--were never likely to be implemented. Quite apart from the sociological law that says organizations never go out of business even if their main aim has been achieved (the only exception being a slightly ominous one, the Committee for the Free World, which Midge Decter closed down after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact), NATO's essential aim has not been permanently achieved. True, the Soviet threat is gone; but a nuclear-armed and potentially unstable Russia is still in the game; a major conflict has just been fought in the very Balkans which sparked the First World War; and there are a number of potential wars and civil wars lurking in such regions as the Tyrol, the Basque country, Northern Ireland (not yet finally settled), Corsica, Belgium, Kosovo, and Eastern Europe and the Balkans generally where, it is said, &quot; every England has its Ireland, and every Ireland its Ulster.&quot; If none of these seems to threaten the European peace very urgently at present, that is in part because the existence of NATO makes any such threat futile and even counter-productive. No nation or would-be nation wants to take NATO on. And if not NATO, what? There are international bodies which could mediate some of the lesser conflicts: the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe is explicitly given that responsibility, and the European Union is always itching to show it can play a Big Power role. But neither body has the military heft or the prestige to deter or repress serious strife. The OSCE is a collective security organization, and as Henry Kissinger said of a similar body: &quot;When all participants agree, there is no need for it; when they split, it is useless.&quot; And the EU only made itself look ridiculous when it attempted to halt the Bosnian conflict in its relatively early stages when a decisive intervention might have succeeded. As for dealing with a revived Russian threat, there is no military alliance in sight other than NATO that could do the job. In a sense, NATO today is Europe's defense. Except for the American forces, Western armies can no longer play an independent military role. They are wedded to NATO structures and dependent on NATO, especially American, technology. (As a French general admitted in the Gulf War: &quot;The Americans are our eyes and ears.&quot;) If NATO were to dissolve--even if it were to be replaced by some European collective defense organization such as a beefed-up Western European Union--it would invite chaos as every irredentist faction sought to profit from the sudden absence of the main guarantor of European stability.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">SEC. POWELL: Sure. On the first question of consensus, clearly, when you go from 16 to 19 to 26 to 29, decision-making becomes more difficult when you have that many sovereign nations, each one represented at the council table and all the baggage that comes with them in terms of public opinion and the political dynamic within their parliament or legislature. It makes it much more difficult. But I don't think it makes it impossible to act at 29, or even that much more difficult or that much more unwieldy. I think long before you get into the council chamber, discussions take place, negotiations take place, and you essentially come in with a pretty good lineup. And we have been quite effective in bringing people around to our line of thinking within 19. And when I look at the next seven coming in and I see how they helped us and how they stood by us in this recent debate over Iraq, I have some confidence that they also would be inclined toward our point of view, but they are sovereign nations to make their own decision. So I think that we have been effective in playing the leadership role in the alliance which will help the alliance get through to a consensus decision quickly. And that leadership role will not be diminished as we move forward to either 26 or 29.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Nonetheless, NATO remains for the US, as stated in the new national security strategy, »the pre-eminent securi-ty alliance in the world today«, both the »cornerstone for US engagement with the world and a catalyst for international action«. Most of the US’s other formal alliance relationships and all its less formal security partnerships are essentially one-way streets where the US commits itself to help partners in their own defense but without expecting much, if any, help from them outside the strict confines of the joint defense of the partner in question. NATO is – with the partial excepti-on of Australia and to a much lesser extent Japan – the only case where the US can realistically regard its part-ner as a potential source of assistance outside the con-text of the US guarantee. This broader relationship is not, however, without its problems simply because the US expects more of its NATO partners – so it is more likely that the partners will seem to fall short of what the US expects, and that the allies will believe the US is pres-sing them to act more in its interests than their own.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> The NATO-Russia Council ( NRC) met informally at Ministerial level Saturday in Corfu, bringing an end to the body suspension, in place since the Russian military intervention in Georgia last Summer. The NRC had been due to hold this meeting in late May, but Russia cancelled that meeting angry at NATO holding joint exercises with Georgia. Before the meeting, James Appathurai the NATO spokesman told reporters that: It means we are back to business. It was not the business that was totally frozen. But at the political level and at the military-to-military level, I expect we will leave Corfu back to business. In fact, the Council had only ever been suspended at the insistence of former President George Bush. Many European nations had wanted to use the NRC to talk with Russia about Georgia, but the US insisted on gesture politics instead. President Obama has sought better relations with Russia to move his arms control and disarmament agenda along. Restoration of the NATO-Russia Council was part of this policy. The NRC has been meeting regularly at Ambassadorial level for some time. At a meeting a week ago, Russian Ambassador to NATO Dmitry Rogozin told Itar-Tass that the NRC ministerial meeting “will make it possible to re-launch the full format political dialogue that was interrupted on the NATO initiative after the Russian response to Georgia’s aggression against South Ossetia.” The restoration of the political dialogue will also “open the way for the resumption of military cooperation, including interaction on Afghanistan, resumption of Russia’s participation in the NATO antiterrorist operation in the Mediterranean “Active Endeavour,” as well as cooperation in the fight against pirates near the Somalia coast.” Re-engaging with Russia on Afghanistan is another key Obama objective. With Russian support the possibility grows of more robust northern supply lines into Afghanistan to provide logisitics for the ever growing US and NATO mission. Given the uncertain nature of southern supply routes through Pakistan, this is likely to be essential to any NATO success in Afghanistan. After the meeting, outgoing NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said to journalists that: Despite the fact that there are differences ... the spirit (of the meeting) was one of wanting to cooperate.. The NATO-Russia Council, which has been in the neutral stand for almost a year, is now back in gear. The 29 ambassadors in Brussels will very quickly get back to work to agree on new procedures to make the NATO-Russia Council function more effectively. The Russian view of the meeting was a little less positive. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that the meeting was &quot;.. a positive development&quot;, but that there was a &quot;frank exchange of views&quot; at the table. As de Hoop Scheffer said, the disagreements focused on Georgia, where NATO nations refuse to accept Russian recognition of breakaway regions South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which they now support militarily. Scheffer said that: No one tried to paper over our differences, on Georgia for example. But we agreed not to let those disagreements bring the whole NRC train to a halt. Lavrov, on the other hand, insisted that Russia's recognition of the separatists could not be reversed: All have to accept the new realities and the decisions taken by Russia after the conflict are irreversible. This is a first step, but the most positive factor is that both sides have agreed that talking about problems is better than a new East-West face-off. The Bush administration wa sprepared to push NATO into a new Cold War to make a point to Russia about Georgia. Cooler heads have prevailed, and a range of issues from missile defence and arms control to Afghanistan are now on the table for future cooperation.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> MOSCOW, May 27 (RIA Novosti) - A leading U.S. analyst has said the NATO-Russia Council is the perfect forum for talks on Arctic security. &quot;There seems to be a growing interest and importance in the Arctic region. Certainly, Russia has a fundamental interest in the Arctic and its future development in terms of economics and resources, and also maritime trade,&quot; Dr. Charles M. Perry, vice president and director of studies at the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, told RIA Novosti. &quot;There are some contentions about who owns what. The NATO-Russia forum would be an excellent place to talk about things like Arctic security. Not necessarily solving it all bilaterally...this concerns everybody in the region and right now we are not talking about it very well,&quot; Dr. Perry, who is also vice-president of National Security Planning Associates, said. Arctic territories, seen as the key to huge untapped natural resources, have increasingly been at the center of mounting disputes between the United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark in recent years as rising temperatures lead to a reduction in sea ice. President Dmitry Medvedev said in September at a Russian Security Council session that the extent of the Russian continental shelf in the Arctic should be defined as soon as possible. Russia has undertaken two Arctic expeditions - to the Mendeleyev underwater chain in 2005 and to the Lomonosov ridge in the summer of 2007 - to support its territorial claims in the region. Moscow has pledged to submit documentary evidence to the UN on the external boundaries of Russia's territorial shelf by 2010. The Russia-NATO Council meets on Wednesday in Brussels for the second time since the end of last August's war between Russia and Georgia over Abkhazia. The work of the Council was suspended by the alliance unilaterally in September 2008, Relations had looked to be recovering, but took another hit earlier this month with the expulsion of two Russian NATO diplomats from Brussels. Russia responded by expelling two NATO officials from Moscow and pulling out of a NATO-Russia Council session. &quot;It is really important to keep some kind of useful form and vehicle, at the very least, for Russia and NATO member states to gather around the same table, lay out their concerns about emerging problems,&quot; Dr. Perry said. The meeting is expected to focus in particular on security in the Euro-Atlantic region and NATO-Russia relations, as well as see a discussion of Monday's announcement of a nuclear test by North Korea.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> In response to Russia’s aggressive assertion of its claims to the Arctic, Cohen believes that “legal and diplomatic actions are necessary,” and pointed out that the U.S. State Department has “already expressed its skepticism of planting of the Russian Flag,” and believes the act was “not in legal effect.” Cohen added that “Canada joined in this opposition,” noting its Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, quickly embarked upon a “three-day Arctic trip” during which he made major announcements that “increased Canada’s naval presence in the Arctic.” In order to “block Russia's grab,” Cohen believes that the United States “should encourage its friends and allies—especially Canada, Denmark, and Norway—to pursue their own claims with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.” And while America “has not ratified LOST,” the Law of the Sea Treaty, Cohen noted the other Arctic states “have filed claims with the Commission in opposition to Russia's claims,” and believes “the U.S. should also encourage Canada to coordinate a possible claim through the International Justice Court in The Hague against the Russian grab, which the U.S. may join.” Cohen believes Moscow’s “decision to take an aggressive stand has left the U.S., Canada, and the Nordic countries little choice but to forge a cooperative high-north strategy and invite other friendly countries, such as Great Britain, to help build a Western presence in the Arctic: This will probably have to include a fleet of modern icebreakers, submersibles, geophysics/seismic vessels, and polar aircraft.” As Cohen explained, there’s “too much at stake to leave the Arctic to the Russian bear.” But in an optimistic “parting thought,” Cohen added, “I don’t think Russia has financial resources and technology to explore Artic for its riches alone,” and that it “would be much better if U.S., Canada, and—as well as Denmark and Norway will have a multilateral regime negotiated that will specify the economic zones, and will open each other’s resources for joint ventures that will boost economic development in the Arctic.” To understand Russia’s intentions, we interviewed Dr. Vladimir Frolov, the director of the National Laboratory for Foreign Policy, a Moscow-based think tank.[18] Frolov, a former Foreign Service officer, writes about Russia’s foreign policy for Russia Profile magazine and penned a prescient column in the July 17th edition titled “The Coming Conflict in the Arctic: Russia and U.S. to Square Off Over Arctic Energy Reserves.”[19] Frolov explained that “there are two principal lines of thinking on global warming in Russia. One is that global warming is a myth, the other is that global warming exists and it is good for Russia.” He added that “Russia might benefit from global warming if it leads to more mild temperatures in the Arctic, provided the problem of flooding could be solved,” because a milder climate “would make it less prohibitively costly to develop the considerable energy resources that Russia has there.” He noted that “Russia views the Arctic reserves as its ‘last barrel of oil’ to be safeguarded and then used to Russia’s strategic advantage,” much like the U.S. view of “oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).” So bountiful are Russia’s reserves of Arctic petroleum resources that Frolov thinks that they will precipitate an inevitable clash between Russia and the United States reminiscent of its Cold War clash across the Arctic. As Frolov explained in his July 17, 2007 column in Russia Profile, “the stage has been quietly set for a much more serious confrontation in the non-too-distant future between Russia and the United States—along with Canada, Norway and Denmark,” as Russia “recently laid claim to a vast 1,191,000 square km chunk of the ice-covered Arctic seabed.” Its claim is “not really about territory, but rather about the huge hydrocarbon reserves that are hidden on the seabed under the Arctic ice cap: these newly discovered energy reserves will play a crucial role in the global energy balance as the existing reserves of oil and gas are depleted over the next 20 years.”</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization. Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently. Such a war might however be a local terminal risk for the cities most likely to be targeted. Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Finally, the NATO-Russia Council provides tremendous political value. It is a serious forum for conceptual work on peacekeeping and discussion of defense reform. We have also engaged in strategic political and security discussions on topical issues such as Afghanistan, the Balkans and Georgia. The most remarkable aspect of the current NATO-Russia relationship is the breadth of our cooperation and the number of our common projects. However, there is more that we can do together, especially militarily. Despite the progress made, Russian and NATO forces are not yet sufficiently interoperable. Our militaries should exercise together more often. For those exercises to occur on Russian soil, Russia needs to conclude an agreement that provides legal protections for our troops – the Partnership for Peace Status of Forces Agreement. We are confident of completing this agreement by the end of the year. We could also hold more joint NATO-Russia field exercises, especially counter-terrorism field training. In addition, we need to make joint NATO-Russia peacekeeping a reality. We hope that Moscow will take another look at creating a NATO-interoperable peacekeeping brigade, which would be a major step forward in this regard. For the past two years, we have discussed the need to build mutual confidence among our respective naval forces. In February of 2003, we signed a Framework Document on cooperation in Search and Rescue at Sea. However, NATO also has a vigorous maritime interdiction operation – known as Active Endeavor – underway in the Mediterranean to protect shipping lanes from possible acts of terrorism. We expect that, at the Istanbul Summit, NATO will invite Russia to join with the Alliance in Operation Active Endeavor.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> At Istanbul, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Secretary of State Powell, and the other 25 NATO Foreign Ministers will meet together in the NATO-Russia Council. Despite Russia's concerns about NATO enlargement, we see that Russian attitudes toward the Alliance have grown more positive as a result of engagement in the NRC. Russia has said that it does not intend to join NATO, but its participation in the NRC and its partnership with the Alliance extends security across virtually two continents. This constructive new relationship between former enemies eases decades of suspicion and mistrust between NATO and Russia, and leaves our countries more secure today than at any time in the last half-century.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Without intervention, researchers predict that over 75 million people will be infected worldwide by 2010,</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> with a loss of human life to AIDS totaling 100 million by 2020. Scientists predict that more than two million Russians could be infected by 2005 - next year - and millions more by 2010; in fact, the HIV virus is spreading more rapidly here than in almost any other country on the planet. Unless decisive action is taken - and soon - Russia faces a humanitarian catastrophe rivaling that of World War II. Fortunately, this represents an area tailor-made for bilateral cooperation. As the AIDS epidemic began in the United States years before it struck Russia, we have considerable experience in treating the disease and controlling its spread. Russia has an educated population and an expanding sector of dedicated NGOs that provide hope that concerted efforts at prevention can succeed. What these organizations lack is resources and, most crucially, high-level political support. In addition, Russia is blessed with a large and talented medical and scientific community that can play an important role in international efforts to find a cure and develop a vaccine. Given our complementary resources and our mutual interest in staving off disaster, the AIDS crisis provides an ideal opportunity to demonstrate the potential of our partnership for the betterment of Russia's own people, and all of humanity.</span></strong><br />

<u>Thrift 2000</u> <strong>(Nigel, Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Professor of Geography at the University of Oxford England, “It’s the Little Things”, Geopolitical Traditions: A Century of Geopolitical Thought, Ed. Atkinson and Dodds, p. 383-385, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Let us finally come to one more arena: the arena of words. After all, here we might be thought to have the clearest example of representation at work, the word. Yet, what we do not get from critical geopolitics is a clear enough sense of how words function to bring about geopolitical change and it is not possible to do so as long as geopolitical forces continue to be framed as ‘big’ and ‘commanding’ (with all the masculine overtones). Some of the most potent geopolitical forces are, I suspect, lurking in the ‘little’ ‘details’ of people’s lives, what is ‘“carried” in the specific variabilities of their activities’ (Shotter and Billig 1998:23), in the context of utterances. And these variabilities have immediate consequences. Thus, As Bakhtin notes, and as is confirmed by the work in conversational analysis, ‘we sensitively catch the smallest shift in intonation, the slightest interruption of voices in anything of importance to us in another person’s practical everyday discourse. All those verbal sideward glances, reservations, loopholes, hints, thrusts do not slip past our ear, are not foreign to our own lips’ (Bakhtin 1984:201). And we in turn show our stance to what they do or say also in fleeting bodily reactions, facial expressions, sounds of approval or disapproval, etc. Indeed, even in the continuously responsive unfolding of non-linguistic activities between ourselves and others—in a dance, in a handshake, or even a mere chance collision on the street—we are actively aware of whether the other’s motives are, so to speak, ‘in tune’ or ‘at odds’ with ours. And in our sense of their attunement or lack of it, we can sense their attitude to us as intimate or distant, friendly or hostile, deferential or arrogant, and so on. (Shotter and Billig 1998:23) Thus, very effective work has been done in disciplines like anthropology and discursive psychology (Billig 1995, 1997) which attempts to provide a sense of how national identity and an accompanying geopolitical stance are inscribed through the smallest of details. Thus, for example, national identity is not accomplished in grand displays which incite the citizen to wave the flag in a fit of patriotic fervour. Instead, it goes on in more mundane citations: it is done unobtrusively on the margins of conscious awareness by little words such as ‘the’ and ‘we’. Each day we read or hear phrases such as ‘the prime minister’, ‘the nation’, or the ‘weather’. The definite article assumes deictically the national borders. It points to the homeland: but while we, the readers or listeners, understand the pointing, we do not follow it with our consciousness—it is a ‘seen but unnoticed’ feature of our everyday discourse. 6 (Shotter and Billig 1998:20) Such work goes some way towards understanding the deep, often unconscious aggressions which lurk behind so much geopolitical ‘reasoning’, which through small details build a sense of ‘us’ as not like ‘them’, and from which political programmes then flow as infractions are identified and made legible. 7</strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Despite the fact that the federal government had been abundantly warned about the precarious condition of the levees, federal officials insisted on their innocence, ignorance, and goodness, while vilifying the New Orleans government and the Louisiana government for a delayed and incompetent response to the disaster. “Mother” Nature, too, became labeled as the unpredictable enemy. In this national scenario, as in organizational life, leaders often resort to psychological splitting between us/them, good/bad, and count on frightened loyalty from followers. Allcorn writes of the critical role of corporate ideology in establishing this either/or process: Ideology aimed at destroying all opposing views to maintain the certainty of its [that is, the reified organization’s] righteousness and correctness, is a sign of simplicity triumphing over complexity and the regressive withdrawal into a primitive state of oneness and homogeneity. (2006) Through ideology, leaders psychologically “bind” workers to the organization, whereby all opposing views are rejected and doubt is eliminated. For psychoanalyst Christopher Bollas, in the fascist state of mind, “The mind ceases to be complex, achieving a simplicity held together initially by bindings around the signs of ideology” (1992, p. 201). Followers are recruited and subsequently “bound” to the ideology by the promise of alleviating intense anxiety and radically splitting the perceptual world into “good” people (us, insiders) and “bad” people (them, others). Organizational leaders’ appeal to grave danger and their offer of a magical solution, is illustrated by the following story from Seth Allcorn: I recall hearing of a meeting in a large teaching hospital that was called to formally announce that downsizing was about to ensue with the help of a notorious downsizing consulting group. The hospital CEO was speaking to all of upper and middle management, approximately 150 people. He explained the downsizing process this way. “You are standing on a train station platform. You have three choices. You can get on the train that is going where I want to go. You can wait just a little bit before deciding what you want to do. Or, you can get on the second train that is leaving the hospital.” Since I studied downsizing in depth as a researcher...I can bear witness to the fact that the metaphorical trains both lead to a man-made hell on earth. (1998, p. xii) As I have described elsewhere (Stein, 1998; 2001), Nazi Holocaust-era trains are a widespread metaphor used by leaders, victims, and survivors to describe the harrowing experience of downsizing, reductions in force, rightsizing, and other forms of “managed social change.” The CEO offers Captain Ahab’s choice: follow me and you live; don’t follow me and you’re dead. The irony, of course, is that to follow Ahab is to doom oneself to death. Firm belief in the totalitarian ideology and the cause that it champions becomes more vital than life itself. Before continuing, let me say a few words about the psychodynamics of what is “total” in the ideology and practice of totalitarianism. The work of a number of psychoanalytic writers converges to help us understand the psychodynamics of organizational and political totalitarianism, and hence the appeal of its ideology and its ability to mobilize people in its service. In his pioneering work on the adolescent quality of the either/or, inside/outside thinking that characterizes totalitarian ideologies, Erik Erikson distinguished between exclusivistic “totalistic” thinking and inclusivistic “wholism” in identity formation (1968, pp. 74–90). In “totalistic” thinking, an ideology is created and embraced that radically simplifies the world, repudiates if not destroys all opposing views, and is intolerant of all doubt. Erikson described the universal process of dividing the world into what he called “pseudospecies” (pp. 41–42), by which all peoples to some degree describe themselves as THE human beings, and others as lesser and lower life forms. That is, there is a split in affect such that affiliative “good” feelings are associated with one’s own group, and disaffiliative “bad” feelings are associated with Others. “Inside” is idealized and “outside” is demonized. The Others “were at least useful as a screen of projection for the negative identities which were the necessary, if most uncomfortable, counterpart of the positive ones” (p. 41). Erikson continues: “The pseudospecies...is one of the more sinister aspects of all group identity” (p. 42). This process becomes exaggerated and ossified in times of crisis, anxiety, and massive large group regression, as Vamik Volkan (1997; 2002) and Howard Stein (2004) have described. Under such circumstances, people come to rely on emergency psychological measures to protect themselves. What George Devereux (1955) called “catastrophic” thinking tends to seize the group, and the reduction of (psychotic) anxiety becomes the central obsession of the group and its leaders. Great effort is mobilized to revitalize the loss- and death-obsessed group (see La Barre, 1972). Under these simultaneously inner and outer circumstances, people come to re-experience annihilation anxiety, against which they defend themselves by the use of some of the earliest developmental defense mechanisms such as splitting, massive projective identification, and externalization. Identity rigidity replaces continuous identity development. “Total immersion in a synthetic identity” goes hand in glove with “a totally stereotyped enemy of the new identity” (Erikson, 1968, p. 89). Erikson continues: The fear of loss of identity which fosters such indoctrination contributes significantly to that mixture of righteousness and criminality which, under totalitarian conditions, becomes available for organized terror and for the establishment of major industries of extermination.

<u>Lifton</u> <strong>19</strong><u>89</u> <strong>(Robert Jay, M.D. World renowned Psychiatrist,Updated preface to Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Now, after twenty-eight years, my own sense of this book has changed. I see it as less a specific record of Maoist China and more an exploration of what might be the most dangerous direction of the twentieth-century mind—the quest for absolute or &quot;totalistic&quot; belief systems. Indeed, that quest has produced nothing short of a worldwide epidemic of political and religious fundamentalism—of movements characterized by literalized embrace of sacred texts as containing absolute truth for all persons, and a mandate for militant, often violent measures taken against designated enemies of that truth or mere unbelievers. The epidemic includes fundamentalist versions of existing political movements as well as newly emerging groups that may combine disparate ideological elements. These latter groups are often referred to as cults, now a somewhat pejorative designation, so that some observers prefer the term new religions. But I think we can speak of cults as groups with certain characteristics: first, a charismatic leader, who tends increasingly to become the object of worship in place of more general spiritual principles that are advocated; second, patterns of &quot;thought reform&quot; akin to those described in this volume, and especially in Chapter 22; and third, a tendency toward manipulation from above with considerable exploitation (economic, sexual, or other) of ordinary supplicants or recruits who bring their idealism from below. Indeed, this book is largely responsible for my having been drawn into these controversies. With the profusion of the religious cults during the late 197os and 198os, I began to hear that Chapter 22 was being made use of for various forms of &quot;deprogramming&quot; of cult recruits, and then that the same chapter was being studied by cult leaders, ostensibly for the purpose of dissociating their groups from the patterns I described. Young people who had been involved in cults and the parents of such people began to consult me about these general patterns. I felt I had to clarify my position by preparing a new essay on cult formation and totalism in my recent collection The Future of Immortality and Other Essays for a Nuclear Age (1987), but specially pleased by the extent to which is his earlier volume on thought reform has remained central to literature on cults and on totalism in general. Tendencies toward totalism in China itself have diminished over the years, as have specific thought reform programs. But that did not happen until after a fierce reassertion of totalistic behavior during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s. I was able to study that upheaval and saw in it an effort on the part of the aging Mao Zedong to call forth the young in a common quest to reassert the immortalizing power of the revolution itself, and hence I entitled the work Revolutionary Immortality: Mao Tse-Tung and the Chinese Revolution (1968). Chinese society is still recovering from that extreme, often violent, outbreak. The regime's subsequent tendency, through fits and starts, has been in the direction of liberalization throughout the society, but that in no way precludes the possibility of future waves of totalistic policies or thought reform projects. From the beginning, this book was meant to provide principles of a general kind, criteria for evaluating any environment in relationship to ideological totalism. Such patterns are all too readily embraced by a great variety of groups, large and small, as a means of manipulating human beings, always in the name of a higher purpose. And it should not be forgotten that such groups can hold great attraction for large numbers of people. In recent research on Nazi Germany I was able to explore the most sinister of all historical examples of this phenomenon. I found that a particular kind of totalistic ideology – a biologized view of society, or what I called a “biomedical vision” - could, with its accompanying institutions, draw ordinary people into murderous activities. I came to understand that, in an atmosphere of totalism and brutality, even fragments of an ideology can readily contribute to participation in killing, as I reported in my book The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide (1986) There are parallels in Nazi and Chinese Communist cure by “re-education.” I have been equally concerned with a contemporary category of fundamentalism that could contribute to killing on so great a scale as to dwarf even what the Nazis did, that associated with nuclear threat. Nuclear fundamentalism can take shape around the weapons themselves: the exaggerated dependency on them and embrace of them to the point of near worship. That is what I call the ideology of nuclearism. The weapons become an ultimate truth in their ostensible capacity to grant security and safety, to keep the world going, to offer salvation. A seemingly different but related form of nuclear fundamentalism is the &quot;end-time&quot; ideology, within which nuclear holocaust is viewed as the realization of of biblical prophecy prophecy and a necessary occurrence to bring about the longed-for Second Coming of Jesus and eventual earthly paradise. In a study we have been conducting at The City University Center on Violence and Human Survival, we have been pleased to learn that even fundamentalists with strong belief in end- time ideas find it hard to espouse this formula without great ambivalence and uncertainty. They too, it seems, have taken in some of the horrible actuality of the consequences of nuclear weapons and find it hard to believe that God would bring about such horrors or permit them to occur. Nonetheless, these fundamentalist attitudes become associated with the weapons in varying ways and with varying intensity throughout much of our society, and in the process they interfere greatly with the nuanced thought and moral imagination needed to cope with nuclear threat. While totalitarianism is a twentieth-century phenomenon requiring modern technology and communications networks, the totalistic cast of mind is not. It probably was, in fact, much more common in previous centuries. It is in any case part of the human repertoire, an ever-present potential that can readily manifest itself when historical conditions call it forth. What is new is the potential for radically increased consequences of totalism, to the point of human extinction. The kind of wisdom that totalistic ideas now interfere with has to do with what I call species awareness and the species self, the recognition that, given the capacity of our weaponry to destroy all human life, each sense of self becomes bound up with the life of every other self on the planet. My critical evaluation of ideological totalism in this book is meant to further that species orientation.</span></strong><br />

<strong>The total area of the peninsula, including the islands, is 22,154 square kilometers of which about 45 percent (99,313 square kilometers), excluding the area in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), constitutes the territory of South Korea. The combined territories of South and North Korea is similar in size of Britain (244,100 square kilometers) and Guyana (215,000 square kilometers). South Korea along is about the size of Hungary (93,000 square kilometers) and Jordan (97.700 square kilometers). There are about 3,000 islands belonging to Korea. The islands are located mostly around the Yellow Sea; only a handful of them lie of the East Sea. Ullungdo, the largest island in the East Sea, serves as a major fishery base as does Tokdo island. Important islands within South Korea's territory include Chejudo, the largest island, which lies off the southwest corner of the peninsula. Until the 11th century, the territory of Korea had encompassed most of Manchuria, but by the 15th century, due to repeated conflicts with China, Koreans retreated southward and the Amnokkang and Tuman-gang rivers became the permanent Sino-Korean border. At the end of World War II, the peninsula was divided into a northern zone occupied by Soviet forces and a southern zone occupied by US forces, the boundary between the two zones being formed at the 38th parallel. In 1953, at the end of the Korean War, this boundary became semi-permanently fixed at the DMZ, a 4 kilometer wide strip of land than runs along the lines of cease-fire from the east to the west coast for a distance of about 241 kilometers. Back to Top ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS There are three administrative tiers in South Korea. The highest tier includes seven metropolitan cities and nine provinces (do). Metropolitan cities refer to those urban areas with a population of over 1 million. Seoul, the capital of South Korea, is the largest urban center, having over 10 million residents. Pusan is the second largest city, with a population of over 4 million. Taegu, Inch'eon, Kwangju, Taejon and Ulsan, in descending order, are each home to over 1 million people. At the second administrative tier, provinces (do) are subdivided into small cities (shi) and counties (gun). A small city (shi) comprises those areas with populations of more than 50,000. A county (gun) consists of one town (up) and five to ten townships (myon). Although they are administrative units, provinces (do) also play an important role in the regional identification of the people and many Koreans often identify themselves by the province in which they were born and raised. The last administrative tier consists of subdivisions of shi which are called dong. In rural areas however, counties (gun) are subdivided into towns (up) and townships (myon). A town (up) has a population of 20,000 people or less. In the last several decades, South Korea has witnessed a rapid growth of its urban centers. The population of these areas now constitutes over 85 percent of the national total. Urban growth has been particularly spectacular along the Seoul-Pusan corridor, the Seoul metropolitan area and the Kyongsang-do area. By contrast, the southwestern and northeastern peripheral regions have sustained a considerable loss in population. North Korea also has a similar jurisdictional heiarchy. Back to Top GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS Mountain ranges have traditionally served as natural boundary markers between regions. Because these natural boundaries inhibited frequent interactions between people living on either side of the range, subtle, and sometimes substantial, regional differences developed in both the spoken language and customs of the people. These regional distinctions also correspond to the traditional administrative units devised during the Choson Dynasty (1392-1910). The Korean Peninsula, located in Northeast Asia, is bordered on the north by China and Russia and juts toward Japan to the southeast. The northernmost point is Yup'ojin in Onsong-gun, Hamgyongbuk-do Province, and the southernmost point is Marado island, Cheju-do Province. The westernmost point of Maando island in Yongch'on-gun, Pyonganbuk-do Province, and the easternmost is Tokdo island in Ullung-gun, Kyongsangbukdo Province. The Korean Peninsula is 222,154 square kilometers, almost the same size as the UK or Romania. The administrative area of the Republic of Korea is 99,392 square kilometers, slightly larger than Hungary or Portugal and a little smaller than Iceland.</strong><br />

Education—we should reject geographical inaccuracy.<br />
<u>JAMES</u> <strong>19</strong><u>67</u> <strong>(Preston E., Honorary President of the Association of American Geographers, “On the Origin and Persistence of Error in Geography,” Annals of the Association of American Geographers, March)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>ABSTRACT. Human error concerning the geography of the earth has been recurrent throughout historic time. Some kinds of error arise because of the problems of dealing with phenomena in the three-dimensional zone forming earth-space. The broad curvature of the earth, the sheer diversity of earth-space, and the patterns of change through time all form pitfalls for the geographer who is, thereby, liable to error in his descriptive analyses. The problems of placing percepts (things perceived) against concepts (mental abstractions ) make for difficulties in analyzing the three-dimensional spatial zone in which geographers work. Among the kinds of error committed there are avoidable varieties, such as the inexact use of descriptive and analytical language, the uncritical use of statistical data, the acceptance of unreliable data, and the confusion of the several kinds of spatial distributions. Less avoidable error derives from the formulation of hypotheses accounting for phenomena which, when critically examined against accurate data, turn out to be inadequate, incomplete, or wrong. Such early hypotheses may actually become stimulants to progress in research; the Huttonian theory of the observable causation for landforms in time produced all of modern landform theory while at the same time producing many errors in analytical explanation. The construct of a model, per conceptualization, risks dangers of obscuring effective explanation owing to the fact that models normally can originally be only caricatures of reality. The Davisian cycle of erosion so obscured progress for a long period by its overacceptance. Social Darwinism, similarly, obstructed effective explanation for a period. The persistence of error becomes an obstruction to progress in geography. The overlong employment of Maury’s simple model of the earths wind systems was such a persistence. Currently the dichotomy of the dualism phrased as physical geography and human geography constitutes an error of persistence. The elimination of avoidable error and the replacement of inadequate to erring hypotheses require a continuing process of critical review, lest avoidable error continue into persistent error. However, on the present errors of inadequate hypotheses may be built the progress of geography in the future.</strong><br />

<strong>Japan's annexation of Corea didn't become formal until 1910, but for all practical purposes Japan had become the power that regulated Corea's relations with the outside world in 1897 when it defeated China in a war over Japan's ambition to exercise control over Corea. The only other power willing to contest Japan's supremacy in the Corean peninsula was Russia. When it was easily defeated by Japan at Port Arthur in 1905, the annexation of Corea became a fait accompli. Anxious to avoid a costly Pacific conflict, President Wilson ignored the pleas of a delegation of Corean patriots and their American missionary supporters and turned a blind eye to Japan's acts of formal annexation and colonization of Corea. During that period Japan mounted a campaign to push for the &quot;Korea&quot; useage by the American press. Why? For one of Japan's prospective colonies to precede its master in the alphabetical lineup of nations would be unseemly, Japanese imperialists decided. Japan's colonial rule over Corea ended on August 15, 1945 when it lost World War II. Now that Corea is eagerly shedding the last vestiges of the colonial period, even demolishing public buildings erected by the Japanese (for example, the monstrously immense colonial governor's mansion), forward-thinking Corean and Corean American journalists, intellectuals and scholars are urging the American media to revert to the original, more natural rendering of Corea. The changeover will pose a problem only in English-speaking nations as other western nations never accepted the &quot;K&quot; spelling. For example, France, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, among many others, use the &quot;C&quot; rendering. English convention, too, is on the side of the Corea rendering. Non-European names are romanized with a &quot;C&quot; (Cambodia, Canada, cocoa, Comanche, Congo, and even old Canton, for example) except where the first letter is followed by an &quot;e&quot; or an &quot;i&quot;, (as in Kenya). Other than that, the &quot;K&quot; spelling is used only in connoting childlike ignorance of spelling conventions (&quot;Kitty Kat&quot; and &quot;Skool&quot;, for examples). Therefore, the American &quot;K&quot; spelling is 1. offensive from a historical standpoint (remember &quot;Peking&quot; and &quot;Canton&quot;?); 2. violates western rendering conventions; 3. suggests a lack of sophistication toward Corea; and 4. by connoting naiveté, imputes a lack of sophistication to Corea and its people. The Corea rendering will ultimately become universal when more Americans are educated as to the offensive and relatively recent origin of the &quot;Korea&quot; rendering. The English-speaking world was responsible for agreeing to Japanese efforts to change the spelling of Corea's name in English useage. Who better than concerned Asian Americans to help change it back?</strong><br />

<strong>Words play a critical role in articulating our reality within an Indo-European linguistic framework. We must, as long as we speak non-African languages, find ways to control word usage when it speaks to our condition through a process of assimilating and normalizing words that serve in our interest. It is ignorant to ignore the significance of making a universal Pan-Africanist lexicon, which is adopted across the board. And just like as there is a body which, monitors, controls the English language we need such a body for serving our linguistic interest. There is no denying the billion dollar linguistic industry of the capitalist system; correct wording for marketing is a serious activity in fashioning consumer responses. In politics the careful wording by politicians to avoid liability testifies to the delicate, yet critical, significance of words. In media arena the neologism created to marry Islam to terror, show the power words have on sculpturing perception. There thus can be no denying that in the area of African reality words are an area which requires a full discourse. Language and thought There can be no undermining how both philosophies of language influences thought and vice-versa. Thus language is a key aspect of culture and culture is key in determining ones language. The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis suggested that language limited the extent to which members of a &quot;linguistic community&quot; can think about certain subjects. The interdependence of thought and speech makes it clear that languages are not so much a means of expressing truth that has already been established, but are a means of discovering truth that was previously unknown. Their diversity is a diversity not of sounds and signs but of ways of looking at the world. Karl Kerenyi The complicated dynamics behind word usage is solely rooted in a battle of self-interest. Many times we find ourselves trapped with popular anti-African sentiments such as “Africans enslaved other Africans,” “Egyptians weren't black,” etc. We are trapped fighting battles from a strategic disadvantage because the terms and definitions we employ serve solely in a Eurocentric reality that have been sculpted to destroy our historical foundation. If we speak of the African Holocaust then facts of so-called “Slavery by Africans” becomes redundant as the African Holocaust does not focus on systems of imprisonment, but moreover, the wholesale inhumane destruction visited upon African people. In addition, African Holocaust is not limited to the Transatlantic Slave Trade but the broader horror that also encompasses Colonial rule and more over the legacies of those systems.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Forward deployment of forces, then, is one of the principal ways in which the United States assures the South Koreans of its commitment to their defense. Forward-deployed forces are the embodiment of that commitment and the mechanism by which the United States would become engaged in any new Korean war. In certain circumstances, the direct engagement of American conventional forces in such a conflict could increase the prospect of U.S. nuclear use. This connection reinforces the nuclear guarantee to Seoul. For these purposes, the presence of some not-insignificant U.S. ground force in South Korea is more important than the specific number of troops or their disposition. While U.S. nuclear weapons in the past were forward deployed in South Korea, a nuclear presence on the peninsula has not been essential to the nuclear guarantee. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">South Korea’s history of considering its nuclear options closely corresponds with and demonstrates well the four principal drivers governing the potential for nuclear proliferation. The national security consideration has clearly been paramount for South Korea. Its geographical situation at the intersection of the security interests of the major powers in Northeast Asia presents South Korea with a number of long-term security and related alliance dilemmas. During the Cold War, the most pressing of these security dilemmas was obviously the confrontation with North Korea, and Seoul, lacking confidence in its own national resource constraints to deter Pyongyang, turned to U.S. alliance conventional and nuclear security guarantees. Consequently, the possibility of the alliance dilemma of U.S. abandonment was what formed the prime driver for South Korea’s first attempt at acquiring nuclear weapons. South Korea’s perception of declining U.S. implacability in the face of North Korea provocations in the late 1960s, U.S. rapprochement with China in the early 1970s, and U.S. plans to scale back its troop deployments (under the Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations) all galvanized President Park to begin to seek nuclear weapons. Park was only dissuaded from this option by U.S. threats to cease security and economic guarantees altogether. South Korea was then forced to return to the shelter of the U.S. nuclear umbrella in the absence of its own deterrent, thus enabling the reaffirmation of U.S. security guarantees.54</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The blocks would fall quickest and hardest in Asia, where proliferation pressures are already building more quickly than anywhere else in the world. If a nuclear breakout takes place in Asia, then the international arms control agreements that have been painstakingly negotiated over the past 40 years will crumble. Moreover, the United States could find itself embroiled in its fourth war on the Asian continent in six decades--a costly rebuke to those who seek the safety of Fortress America by hiding behind national missile defenses. Consider what is already happening: North Korea continues to play guessing games with its nuclear and missile programs; South Korea wants its own missiles to match Pyongyang's; India and Pakistan shoot across borders while running a slow-motion nuclear arms race; China modernizes its nuclear arsenal amid tensions with Taiwan and the United States; Japan's vice defense minister is forced to resign after extolling the benefits of nuclear weapons; and Russia--whose Far East nuclear deployments alone make it the largest Asian nuclear power--struggles to maintain territorial coherence. Five of these states have nuclear weapons; the others are capable of constructing them. Like neutrons firing from a split atom, one nation's actions can trigger reactions throughout the region, which in turn, stimulate additional actions. These nations form an interlocking Asian nuclear reaction chain that vibrates dangerously with each new development. If the frequency and intensity of this reaction cycle increase, critical decisions taken by any one of these governments could cascade into the second great wave of nuclear-weapon proliferation, bringing regional and global economic and political instability and, perhaps, the first combat use of a nuclear weapon since 1945. </span></strong><br />

They kill the alliance and deterrence, sq solves war.<br />
<u>S</u> ingh <u>and Il-Young,</u> <strong>03 - senior research fellow at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul and president of the Indo-Korean Policy Forum [2003, Lakhvinder Singh and Il-Young Kim , “Time to Keep Going: The Role and Structure of U.S. Forces in a Unified Korea,” Pacific Focus, Volume 18 Issue 1, Pages 65 – 87, Center for International Studies, Inha University]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Such intelligence capabilities of the U.S. forces would be a key element of deterrence, and would provide the capability to swiftly repel enemy attack with minimal casualties in a unified Korea. In particular, the awareness of Korea's neighbors of such intelligence capabilities would in and of itself, have a substantial deterrent effect.27 The U.S. forces in a unified Korea, equipped with high-tech equipment, would be capable of bringing new forms of warfare in the 21st century28 The ROK armed forces has endeavored to acquire and enhance its intelligence collection and management system during the past ten years. However, considering the probable future economic status of a unified Korea, it would be hard to expect South Korea to keep an independent and complete eye on potential enemies. For example, it costs 1 million US dollars per mission for the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. Considering the fact that the U.S. operates an overlapping reconnaissance aircraft and surveillance system manned 24 hours a day, the total sum of such an operation is astronomical. These U.S. intelligence forces, thus must constitute the core of U.S. forces in a unified Korea. In a unified Korea, China and Russia would be the two main countries with which Korea could possibly have a military conflict.29 Both these countries have modem military technology which makes naval and air forces very vulnerable. High-tech sensors in their possession would make it difficult for American naval and air forces to operate because they stand out against the back-ground of air and sea and thus would be easy to locate and destroy. On the other hand, American ground forces, given the mountainous terrain of Korea, are less vulnerable to advanced technology and thus could operate more easily.30 Air and naval forces would have a very limited role to play in any future war in Korea. As the Gulf War should, it was American tanks which destroyed more Iraqi tanks than the allied air forces, even though the terrain and the absence of an opposing air force facilitated the task of allied pilots.31 Any possible future military conflict involving Korea would almost certainly be won or lost on land. Ac cordingly, infantrymen and tanks must remain an essential component of the American forces in Korea. What's more, dependence on air and naval forces for the protection of Korea would weaken traditional alliances and deterrents as well as American support for the very values and political principles that make other countries respect and trust the United States.32 As has been shown in the recent military conflicts in Europe and South Asia, almost all military contingencies still require the use of ground forces to fight or to deter wars, despite the increasingly excessive use of air or naval force. Thus, even if U.S. air and naval forces remained stationed in Korea, the absence of U.S. ground forces would seriously undermine the deterrent and fighting power of the United States in the region. American soldiers have a stronger deterrent value because they represent the world's only superpower on both a direct and symbolic level. One country fighting another nation, which is helped only by U.S. air and naval forces, may rethink that it can escape a frontal clash with the United States; but no rational aggressor would dream of simultaneously fighting U.S. ground forces while avoiding confrontation with America.33 Though there is no doubt that in this age of supersonic speed, ground forces can be flown or shipped anywhere in the world in a short span of time in case of some military contingency, they do not have the same deterrent effect as the advance deployment of forces in places where the chances of military conflict are high. This can be clearly seen in the context of the Gulf War crisis. Despite the American diplomatic commitment to the region, Saddam Hussein occupied Kuwait. He underestimated the American resolve because of the absence of any U.S. troops in the region. American verbal commitment to the region failed to deter him, and, despite the massive use of high speed ships and airplanes, it took the U.S. more than 6 months to build up the forces to where they were strong enough to take on and overcome Saddam Hussein's aggressive actions. In case of war on the Korea peninsula, the U.S. might not have that much time available. Given the firepower of bordering countries, it is commonly accepted among military analysts that Seoul would be completely destroyed within the first few hours of a war. Thus the situation on the Korean peninsula is very peculiar and resembles no other situation in the rest of the world. For the protection of Seoul and thus the whole of South Korea, it would be necessary to push the aggressor back in the first few hours of any conflict and not allow him to seriously damage Seoul. To accomplish this, the ability to gather massive ground force within the shortest possible time would be necessary. American air and naval forces alone would not be enough to stop powerful militaries marching towards Seoul. Though South Korean forces are much better equipped than ever before, they may not be able to stop the marching forces from bombing Seoul with artillery and short-range missiles. Only the U.S. forces equipped with state-of-the-art, high-tech weapons, stationed in Seoul in advance, would the have this ability to defend Seoul. Thus any argument for the withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from Korea must take this point into account.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">In the face of the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the United States will continue to provide deterrence in the &quot;full range of military might,&quot; Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday after two days of talks with South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae-young (see GSN, Oct. 8). The United States and South Korea recently held joint military exercises, initiated in response to the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan by North Korea in March, an attack that killed 46 crewmembers. These &quot;Invincible Spirit&quot; exercises focused primarily on anti-submarine tactics, and were intended to demonstrate military readiness in response to the North Korean aggression. &quot;North Korea's provocations and aggressions will not be tolerated,&quot; Gates said during a brief news conference at the end of the 42nd annual security meeting of the top U.S. and South Korean defense officials Neither Gates nor Kim commented on a Washington Post report today that North Korea may be farther along with plans to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. Kim did address another issue involving weapons of mass destruction, telling reporters, &quot;We are currently in the process of coordinating the details of immediate response in the case of a biological or chemical threat from North Korea.&quot; According to the Post, a report released Friday by the Institute for Science and International Security says North Korea has moved beyond laboratory-scale work and is now capable of building &quot;at the very least, a pilot-scale&quot; plant of centrifuges to enrich uranium. North Korea is estimated to possess 500-1,000 centrifuges. Experts agree the country would need 3,000 centrifuges to make enough enriched uranium for a bomb. Kim acknowledged news reports from North Korea today confirming that leader Kim Jong Il will be succeeded by one of his sons, Kim Jong Un. &quot;We cannot eliminate the possibility of a situation of instability in North Korea that would influence the security of both [U.S and South Korean] governments,&quot; Kim said. &quot;It is the responsibility of both governments to prepare for all possible contingencies,&quot; he added. Ahead of the G-20 economic summit to take place in Seoul next month, Gates and Kim stressed their &quot;robust coordination&quot; to ensure a successful event. Kim had said in previous statements that North Korea may have plans to disrupt the summit. While so far there has been no significant threat from North Korea, &quot;we will continue to watch,&quot; Kim said. The bilateral meeting also covered the newly established 2015 date for South Korea to take back operational control on the peninsula, Gates said. The transfer was first scheduled for 2012 but South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and President Obama agreed in June to delay the transfer to 2015 after the sinking of the Cheonan. This week's annual meeting falls 60 years after the Korean War, when the U.S.-led United Nations was initially handed peacetime and wartime operational control.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">USFK Force Realignments Will Have Adverse Effects on U.S.-ROK Relations </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Moving USFK military forces out of South Korea will have adverse effects on the U.S.-ROK alliance in the following areas: The ROK will consider the United States as having broken defense commitments; the ROK will be left vulnerable to attack due to lack of adequate military advancements; and the ROK will question the United States’ commitment of defense should North Korea attack. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">ROK will consider the United States as having broken defense commitments. A significant factor to remember is that the Korean War has not officially ended. Even though there has been an “armed truce” which has been in place for over 50 years, withdrawing U.S. troops would be tantamount to leaving an ally on the battlefield to be run over by the enemy. “By deploying USFK in a forward area as a ‘tripwire’12 in order to defend and retaliate against the North Korean attack, the United States has successfully deterred North Korea’s attack.”13 Although this is an extreme picture of the U.S.-ROK alliance situation, it still deserves some consideration. “Abrogation of the U.S. security treaty with South Korea and abandonment of that long-standing ally…could seriously degrade the importance of military power as a U.S. foreign policy implement, undercut U.S. interests in national credibility, and perhaps encourage aggression against other U.S. friends around the world. Civil war on the Korean Peninsula probably would erupt. The Republic of Korea and Japan might feel needs to develop their own nuclear weapons.”14 The deterrence of North Korea and the defense of South Korea is firmly grounded in the presence of USFK military forces, for “…it is impossible to talk about the [U.S.-ROK] alliance without focusing on USFK.”15 </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Small footprint causes Taliban takeover, nuclear terrorism, and Indo-Pak war.</span><br />
<u>Kagan &amp; Kagan 2009</u> <strong>(Fredrick W., former prof of military history at West Point and Kimberly, military historian, “Don't Go Wobbly on Afghanistan”, 10/12/2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/article/101110" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/article/101110</a>, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Now, however, some of the most vocal supporters of the regional approach are considering--or even advocating--a return to its antithesis, a purely counterterrorism (CT) strategy in Afghanistan. Such a reversion, based on the erroneous assumption that a collapsing Afghanistan would not derail efforts to dismantle terrorist groups in Pakistan, is bound to fail. Recent discussions of the &quot;CT option&quot; have tended to be sterile, clinical, and removed from the complexity of the region--the opposite of the coherence with which the administration had previously sought to address the problem. In reality, any &quot;CT option&quot; will likely have to be executed against the backdrop of state collapse and civil war in Afghanistan, spiraling extremism and loss of will in Pakistan, and floods of refugees. These conditions would benefit al Qaeda greatly by creating an expanding area of chaos, an environment in which al Qaeda thrives. They would also make the collection of intelligence and the accurate targeting of terrorists extremely difficult. It is very likely that the insurgency will grow in size and strength in 2010 faster than Afghan security forces can be developed without the addition of significant numbers of American combat troops. If the United States should adopt a small-footprint counterterrorism strategy, Afghanistan would descend again into civil war. The Taliban group headed by Mullah Omar and operating in southern Afghanistan (including especially Helmand, Kandahar, and Oruzgan Provinces) is well positioned to take control of that area upon the withdrawal of American and allied combat forces. The remaining Afghan security forces would be unable to resist a Taliban offensive. They would be defeated and would disintegrate. The fear of renewed Taliban assaults would mobilize the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras in northern and central Afghanistan. The Taliban itself would certainly drive on Herat and Kabul, leading to war with northern militias. This conflict would collapse the Afghan state, mobilize the Afghan population, and cause many Afghans to flee into Pakistan and Iran. Within Pakistan, the U.S. reversion to a counterterrorism strategy (from the counterinsurgency strategy for which Obama reaffirmed his support as recently as August) would disrupt the delicate balance that has made possible recent Pakistani progress against internal foes and al Qaeda. Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari, army chief of staff General Ashfaq Kayani, and others who have supported Pakistani operations against the Taliban are facing an entrenched resistance within the military and among retired officers. This resistance stems from the decades-long relationships nurtured between the Taliban and Pakistan, which started during the war to expel the Soviet Army. Advocates within Pakistan of continuing to support the Taliban argue that the United States will abandon Afghanistan as it did in 1989, creating chaos that only the Taliban will be able to fill in a manner that suits Pakistan. Zardari and Kayani have been able to overcome this internal resistance sufficiently to mount major operations against Pakistani Taliban groups, in part because the rhetoric and actions of the Obama administration to date have seemed to prove the Taliban advocates wrong. The announcement of the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces would prove them right. Pakistani operations against their own insurgents--as well as against al Qaeda, which lives among those insurgents--would probably grind to a halt as Pakistan worked to reposition itself in support of a revived Taliban government in Afghanistan. And a renewed stream of Afghan refugees would likely overwhelm the Pakistani government and military, rendering coherent operations against insurgents and terrorists difficult or impossible. The collapse of Pakistan, or even the revival of an aggressive and successful Islamist movement there, would be a calamity for the region and for the United States. It would significantly increase the risk that al Qaeda might obtain nuclear weapons from Pakistan's stockpile, as well as the risk that an Indo-Pakistani war might break out involving the use of nuclear weapons. Not long ago, such a collapse seemed almost imminent. Islamist groups operating under the umbrella of the Tehrik-e Taliban-e Pakistan (TTP), led by Baitullah Mehsud until his recent death, had occupied areas in the Swat River Valley and elsewhere not far from Islamabad itself. Punjabi terrorists affiliated with the same group were launching attacks in the heart of metropolitan Pakistan. Since then, Pakistani offensives in Swat, Waziristan, and elsewhere have rocked many of these groups back on their heels while rallying political support within Pakistan against the Taliban to an unprecedented degree. But these successes remain as fragile as the Pakistani state itself. The TTP and its allies are damaged but not defeated. Al Qaeda retains safe-havens along the Afghan border. What if the United States did not withdraw the forces now in Afghanistan, but simply kept them at current levels while emphasizing both counterterrorism and the rapid expansion of the Afghan security forces? Within Afghanistan, the situation would continue to deteriorate. Neither the United States and NATO nor Afghan forces are now capable of defeating the Taliban in the south or east. At best, the recently arrived U.S. reinforcements in the south might be able to turn steady defeat into stalemate, but even that is unlikely. The accelerated expansion of Afghan security forces, moreover, will be seriously hindered if we fail to deploy additional combat forces. As we discovered in Iraq, the fastest way to help indigenous forces grow in numbers and competence is to partner U.S. and allied units with them side by side in combat. Trainers and mentors are helpful--but their utility is multiplied many times when indigenous soldiers and officers have the opportunity to see what right looks like rather than simply being told about it. At the current troop levels, commanders have had to disperse Afghan and allied forces widely in an effort simply to cover important ground, without regard for partnering. As a result, it is very likely that the insurgency will grow in size and strength in 2010 faster than Afghan security forces can be developed without the addition of significant numbers of American combat troops--which will likely lead to Afghan state failure and the consequences described above in Afghanistan and the region. The Obama administration is not making this decision in a vacuum. Obama ran on a platform that made giving Afghanistan the resources it needed an overriding American priority. President Obama has repeated that commitment many times. He appointed a new commander to execute the policy he enunciated in his March 27 speech, in which he noted: &quot;To focus on the greatest threat to our people, America must no longer deny resources to Afghanistan because of the war in Iraq.&quot; If he now rejects the request of his new commander for forces, his decision will be seen as the abandonment of the president's own commitment to the conflict. In that case, no amount of rhetorical flourish is likely to persuade Afghans, Pakistanis, or anyone else otherwise. A president who overrules the apparently unanimous recommendation of his senior generals and admirals that he make good the resource shortfalls he himself called unacceptable can hardly convince others he is determined to succeed in Afghanistan. And if the United States is not determined to succeed, then, in the language of the region, it is getting ready to cut and run, whatever the president and his advisers may think or say. That is a policy that will indeed have regional effects--extremely dangerous ones.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The surreal belief in some quarters that abandoning Afghanistan -- described as a &quot;graveyard of empires&quot; with its complicated tribes, forbidding terrain, and peripheral strategic importance -- would not have direct and bloody consequences for the United States, never mind the Afghan people, can be answered with three numbers: 9-11. It is troubling that our political and foreign policy elites even need to engage this debate (including its more sophisticated but equally illusory variants like moving to an &quot;over-the-horizon&quot; strike-and-retreat strategy). At the same time, the experts (correctly) advocating a counterinsurgency strategy make the same mistake of framing their arguments purely with reference to Afghanistan's internal dynamics. As important as they are, they constitute only part of a wider strategic landscape that would be upended by a U.S. decision to reduce its political and military commitment to Afghanistan. A recent trip to Islamabad and Lahore revealed to me that most Pakistani elites -- including the small minority that could credibly be described as sympathetic to Western goals in Afghanistan -- already believe that the game is up: the will of the transatlantic allies is broken, Obama doesn't have the courage or vision to see America's mission in Afghanistan through to victory, and the U.S. is well along the road to walking away from Afghanistan as it did after 1989. This widespread Pakistani belief has encouraged behavior deeply inimical to Washington's regional aims, with the effect that the American debate over whether Afghanistan is worth it is inspiring Pakistani actions that will make success all the harder to achieve. After all, why shouldn't the Pakistani security services continue to invest in their friendly relations with the Taliban if Mullah Omar and company soon will take power in Afghanistan's Pashtun heartland? Why should the Pakistani military take on the militant groups that regularly launch cross-border attacks into Afghanistan when the NATO targets of those attacks will soon slink away in defeat? Why should the Pakistani government get serious about wrapping up the Quetta Shura when the Afghan Taliban appears to be ascendant in the face of Western weakness? Why should Pakistan's intelligence service break <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/world/asia/30mumbai.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world" rel="nofollow">its ties to Lashkar-e-Taiba</a>, one of the world's most potent terrorist groups, when it forms such a useful instrument with which to bleed U.S. ally India? And why should Pakistani civilian and military leaders overtly cooperate with the United States when it appears such a weak and unreliable ally of the Afghan people -- incapable, despite its singular wealth and resources, of defeating a 25,000-man insurgency in one of the poorest countries on Earth? As <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/016/917tltdv.asp" rel="nofollow">Chris Brose and I recently argued</a>, it is vital for the West to prevail in Afghanistan because of its effect in shaping Pakistan's strategic future. Proponents of drawing down in Afghanistan on the grounds that Pakistan is the more important strategic prize have it only half right: if Pakistan is the strategic prize, it should be unthinkable not to press for victory in Afghanistan given the spillover effects of a Western defeat there. All of Pakistan's pathologies -- from terrorist sanctuary in ungoverned spaces, to radicalized public opinion that creates an enabling environment for violent extremism, to lack of economic opportunity that incentivizes militancy, to the (in)security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, to the military's oversized role in political life in ways that stunt the development of civilian institutions -- all of this will intensify should Afghanistan succumb to the Taliban as the West withdraws. These dynamics, in turn, will destabilize India in ways that could torpedo the country's rise to world power -- and the strategic dividends America would reap from India's success. New Delhi is now a truer proponent of Washington's original objectives in Afghanistan -- the Taliban's decisive defeat by military force rather than reconciliation and the construction of a capable Afghan democracy -- than some American leaders are now. Afghanistan is in India's backyard -- they shared a border until 1947 -- and the collapse of its government would destabilize Pakistan in ways that would quickly cost Indian dearly. Indian strategists fear that the spillover from a Taliban victory in Afghanistan would induce Pakistan's &quot;Lebanonization,&quot; with the Pakistani Taliban becoming a kind of South Asian Hezbollah that would launch waves of crippling attacks against India. India cannot rise to be an Asian balancer, global security provider, and engine of the world economy if it is mired in interminable proxy conflict with terrorists emanating from a weak or collapsing state armed with nuclear weapons on its border. The strategic implications of a Western defeat in Afghanistan for American relations with other major powers are similarly troubling. The biggest game-changer in the nuclear standoff with Iran is not new sanctions or military action but a popular uprising by the Iranian people that changes the character of the radical regime in Tehran -- a prospect one would expect to be meaningfully diminished by the usurpation through violence of the Afghan government, against the will of a majority of Afghans, by the religious extremists of the Taliban. And despite welcome new unity in the West on a tougher approach to Iran's development of nuclear weapons following revelations of a new nuclear complex in Qum, how can Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin stare down the leaders of Iran -- a potentially hegemonic Middle Eastern state with an advanced conventional and near-nuclear arsenal and a vast national resource base -- if they can't even hold their own against the cave-dwelling, Kalashnikov-wielding despots of the Taliban? Russia appears to be quietly reveling in the prospect that NATO, which appeared so threatening to Russian eyes during its multiple rounds of enlargement during the 1990s, could be defeated in its first real out-of-area operation. A NATO defeat in Afghanistan would call into question the future of the alliance and the credibility of American leadership with it, possibly creating a new and lasting transatlantic breach and intensifying concerns about the alliance's ability to protect weak European states against a resurgent Russia. China has no interest in Afghanistan's collapse into a sanctuary for Islamist extremists, including Uighers who militate against China's rule in Xinjiang. But a Western defeat in Afghanistan, which if historical precedent holds would be followed by a bout of U.S. isolationism, would only create more space for China to pursue its (for now) peaceful rise. And that is the point: the debate over whether to prevail in Afghanistan is about so much more. An American recommitment to a sustained counterinsurgency strategy that turned around the conflict would demonstrate that the United States and its democratic allies remain the principal providers of public goods -- in this case, the security and stability of a strategically vital region that threatens the global export of violent extremism -- in the international system. A new and sustained victory strategy for Afghanistan would show that Washington is singularly positioned to convene effective coalitions and deliver solutions to intractable international problems in ways that shore up the stability of an international economic and political order that has provided greater degrees of human freedom and prosperity than any other. By contrast, a U.S. decision to wash its hands of Afghanistan would send a different message to friends and competitors alike. It would hasten the emergence of a different kind of international order, one in which history no longer appeared to be on the side of the United States and its friends. Islamic extremism, rather than continuing to lose ground to the universal promise of democratic modernity, would gain new legs -- after all, Afghan Islamists would have defeated their second superpower in a generation. Rival states that contest Western leadership of the international order and reject the principles of open society would increase their influence at America's expense. Just as most Afghans are not prepared to live under a new Taliban regime, so most Americans are surely not prepared to live in a world in which the United States voluntarily cedes its influence, power, and moral example to others who share neither our interests nor our values.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Not much chance Obama will go that route. If the violence skyrockets next year and it looks as though the president’s ambitious objectives can’t be met, Afghanistan could look a lot more like Vietnam in 1973. U.S. forces withdrew. Our abandoned ally was soon overrun. South Vietnam became a gulag; Cambodia sprouted the killing fields; life in Laos was just plain lousy. By 1979, the Sino-Vietnamese war erupted. We can expect similar results if Obama’s Afghan strategy fails and he opts to cut and run. Most forget that throwing South Vietnam to the wolves made the world a far more dangerous place. The Soviets saw it as an unmistakable sign that America was in decline. They abetted military incursions in Africa, the Middle East, southern Asia and Latin America. They went on a conventional- and nuclear-arms spending spree. They stockpiled enough smallpox and anthrax to kill the world several times over. State-sponsorship of terrorism came into fashion. Osama bin Laden called America a “paper tiger.” If we live down to that moniker in Afghanistan, odds are the world will get a lot less safe. Al-Qaida would be back in the game. Regional terrorists would go after both Pakistan and India—potentially triggering a nuclear war between the two countries. Sensing a Washington in retreat, Iran and North Korea could shift their nuclear programs into overdrive, hoping to save their failing economies by selling their nuclear weapons and technologies to all comers. Their nervous neighbors would want nuclear arms of their own. The resulting nuclear arms race could be far more dangerous than the Cold War’s two-bloc standoff. With multiple, independent, nuclear powers cautiously eyeing one another, the world would look a lot more like Europe in 1914, when precarious shifting alliances snowballed into a very big, tragic war.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">However, there is some space between U.S. and Russian interests if it comes to a NATO defeat and withdrawal from Afghanistan. In lieu of a complete U.S. victory over the Taliban and other jihadists in Afghanistan as well as the cap- ture of al Qaeda’s leadership, most important Osama bin Laden, Russia’s interests would be served more by the West’s long-term engagement of jihadists in Afghanistan and Pakistan than by defeat and withdrawal, thus containing the threat to South Asia and bog down the United States, NATO, al Qaeda, and jihadists in the region, diverting their attention and resources from deployment elsewhere. If there were a NATO withdrawal, Russia and/or others might be tempted to enhance the already growing military component of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO; members include Russia, China, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; observer-members are Pakistan, India, Iran, and Mongolia) and employ it to defeat or contain jihadism in Central Asia.5 Such actions would be more costly for Moscow, and many Russians would blame the regional crisis on American hubris or even conspiracies, further damaging U.S.-Russian relations. A SCO role would involve China even more deeply in the region, something that is probably neither in Russia’s nor America’s interests. In this event, Moscow likely would promote a more virulently anti- Western, especially anti-American, and perhaps “Eurasianist” line, proposing an alliance of non-Western civilizations to counter American hegemony. In the long-term, this could compensate Russia’s Muslims for Moscow’s war against foreign Muslims and rally some Islamic states toward SCO, further threaten- ing American interests. At present, Moscow supports U.S. efforts in Afghanistan, where the West is doing heavy lifting for the Kremlin. It is imperative that Moscow’s support continues and grows, even if NATO draws back from ground operations to covert and air operations. It is in the American and Russian interest to maximize reconstruction, intelligence, security, and, perhaps in the future, limited military forms of cooperation in Afghanistan. Otherwise, as Barnett Rubin and Ahmed Rashid have warned, Afghanistan and Central Asia could be transformed into yet another region where Russian-American differences lead to competition or conflict (such as the recent five-day war in Georgia), which can only benefit the region’s jihadists.6</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">What trends? Simply put, the world has entered a period of great flux and upheaval of uncertain duration. We are witnessing an historic shift in global dynamism from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region, initially in the economic realm, but one that will eventually reorder the geopolitical realm. The Middle East—or more broadly the Muslim world—is engaged in an epic battle between tradition and modernization that jeopardizes global energy security. Although the nation-state, the fundamental unit of the international system since the Westphalian peace of 1648, is thriving in East Asia and the United States, it is under mounting strain as Europe seeks to create a supranational structure and artificial states in the Middle East begin to break down along sectarian and ethnic lines. Globalization has fueled an unprecedented period of economic growth around the world while unleashing the forces of disorder—terrorism, transnational crime—and raising challenges beyond the capacity of individual states or current international organizations to manage—global warming, pandemic diseases, proliferation of the materials and know-how to build weapons of mass destruction. With the economic growth has come an historic transfer of wealth from the West to energy exporters, such as Russia, and rising manufacturing powers, such as China. In this uncertain world, the United States and Russia are not strategic rivals, and neither poses a strategic threat to the other (despite some overwrought Russian rhetoric to the contrary), in contrast to the situation during the Cold War. Rather, they share a set of common strategic challenges. Russia, by virtue of its geographic location, and the United States, by virtue of its global role, must build new relationships with a Europe that is expanding and deepening; they both must find a way to cope with the growing instability in the Middle East, the challenge to energy security that implies, and, at least for Russia, the threat that that instability will infect Russia’s southern reaches; and they both must manage relations with a rising China. In addition, both countries must deal with the dark side of globalization, and both have a keen interest in the role and effectiveness of the institutions of global governance, such as the United Nations and the G-8, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Common challenges, however, are not the same as common interests. And there are deep differences in the way the United States and Russia think of global order (consider, for example, the role of democracy or the United Nations). But the question each country needs to ask is how important the other is to its achieving its own strategic goals. For example:</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">- Given their standing as the world’s two leading nuclear powers, the United States and Russia are each indispensable to dealing with the problems of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear terrorism, and strategic stability.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">- The United States, as the world’s largest energy consumer, and Russia, as the largest producer of hydrocarbons, are essential to any discussion of energy security and energy’s future.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">- Global economic dynamics and transfers of wealth will require bringing Russia, along with China, India, and others, into a more central role in managing the global economy, a service long performed by Europe and the United States.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">- In East Asia, to create a favorable new equilibrium, Russia has an interest in a strong power—that is, the United States—acting as a moderating influence on China, and the United States has no interest in a weakening Russian presence in Siberia and the Russian Far East, regions rich in the natural resources that fuel modern economies.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">- In the Middle East, both the United States and Russia have levers that could help promote stability, if the two countries were working in concert, or fuel conflict, if they were not.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">- In Europe, Russian energy is critical to economic well-being, and the United States remains essential to security and stability.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">- On a range of other issues—for example, civil nuclear energy, pandemic diseases, climate change—each country is capable of making a major contribution, given the vast scientific talent of each.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">- In the former Soviet space, both countries will be critical to building lasting security and economic structures.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The hour is late. Leading climate scientists such as James Hansen are literally shouting at the top of their lungs that the world needs to reduce emissions by 20-40% as soon as possible, and 80-90% by the year 2050, if we are to avoid climate chaos, crop failures, endless wars, melting of the polar icecaps, and a disastrous rise in ocean levels. Either we radically reduce CO2 and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e, which includes all GHGs, not just CO2) pollutants (currently at 390 parts per million and rising 2 ppm per year) to 350 ppm, including agriculture-derived methane and nitrous oxide pollution, or else survival for the present and future generations is in jeopardy. As scientists warned at Copenhagen, business as usual and a corresponding 7-8.6 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures means that the carrying capacity of the Earth in 2100 will be reduced to one billion people. Under this hellish scenario, billions will die of thirst, cold, heat, disease, war, and starvation. If the U.S. significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, other countries will follow. One hopeful sign is the recent EPA announcement that it intends to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Unfortunately we are going to have to put tremendous pressure on elected public officials to force the EPA to crack down on GHG polluters (including industrial farms and food processors). Public pressure is especially critical since &quot;just say no&quot; Congressmen-both Democrats and Republicans-along with agribusiness, real estate developers, the construction industry, and the fossil fuel lobby appear determined to maintain &quot;business as usual.&quot;</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The danger posed by those incidents was not the unauthorized or accidental launch of a handful of nuclear-tipped missiles but the possibility that either country might misinterpret a benign event—a computer training tape mistakenly inserted into an operational computer or sunlight glinting off clouds during a rare lineup of the sun. earth, and satellite—and decide to launch a full-scale nuclear attack. Almost inevitably, some future benign event will be misinterpreted by Russian military leaders as a possible nuclear attacked especially if the incident happens during a period of increased political tension with the United States. When that happens, early warning systems can play a vital role in preventing escalation into a nuclear holocaust. Therefore, Russia's deteriorating early-warning system poses a real threat to U.S. security. The United States has a vital interest in helping Russia maintain an early-warning system that covers the entire globe. Such a system could provide Russia with the confidence that no attacks have been launched. U.S. assistance, however, should be narrowly focused on solving real problems.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">President Obama and Russian President Dimitri Medvedev are scheduled to Wednesday in London during the G-20 summit. They must not let the current economic crisis keep them from focusing on one of the greatest threats confronting humanity: the danger of nuclear war. Since the end of the Cold War, many have acted as though the danger of nuclear war has ended. It has not. There remain in the world more than 20,000 nuclear weapons. Alarmingly, more than 2,000 of these weapons in the U.S. and Russian arsenals remain on ready-alert status, commonly known as hair-trigger alert. They can be fired within five minutes and reach targets in the other country 30 minutes later. Just one of these weapons can destroy a city. A war involving a substantial number would cause devastation on a scale unprecedented in human history. A study conducted by Physicians for Social Responsibility in 2002 showed that if only 500 of the Russian weapons on high alert exploded over our cities, 100 million Americans would die in the first 30 minutes. An attack of this magnitude also would destroy the entire economic, communications and transportation infrastructure on which we all depend. Those who survived the initial attack would inhabit a nightmare landscape with huge swaths of the country blanketed with radioactive fallout and epidemic diseases rampant. They would have no food, no fuel, no electricity, no medicine, and certainly no organized health care. In the following months it is likely the vast majority of the U.S. population would die. Recent studies by the eminent climatologists Toon and Robock have shown that such a war would have a huge and immediate impact on climate world wide. If all of the warheads in the U.S. and Russian strategic arsenals were drawn into the conflict, the firestorms they caused would loft 180 million tons of soot and debris into the upper atmosphere — blotting out the sun. Temperatures across the globe would fall an average of 18 degrees Fahrenheit to levels not seen on earth since the depth of the last ice age, 18,000 years ago. Agriculture would stop, eco-systems would collapse, and many species, including perhaps our own, would become extinct. It is common to discuss nuclear war as a low-probabillity event. But is this true? We know of five occcasions during the last 30 years when either the U.S. or Russia believed it was under attack and prepared a counter-attack. The most recent of these near misses occurred after the end of the Cold War on Jan. 25, 1995, when the Russians mistook a U.S. weather rocket launched from Norway for a possible attack. Jan. 25, 1995, was an ordinary day with no major crisis involving the U.S. and Russia. But, unknown to almost every inhabitant on the planet, a misunderstanding led to the potential for a nuclear war. The ready alert status of nuclear weapons that existed in 1995 remains in place today. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Now that we all know about the massive Afghan minerals find (the Saudi Arabia of lithium we are told), the Pentagon has found a reason to stay in Afghanistan long after the date for the draw down. Gen. David Petraeus testified in the Senate that one role of the US armed forces is to create a &quot;foundation of security&quot; so that the minerals can be exploited. That's clearly not happening within a year. But it's unlikely that lithium is what's driving Petraeus. The US army will not have it seen that they lost this war. They will not allow another Vietnam, a defeat that made it almost impossible to launch major wars for decades. They will insist on staying until, like the sham success in Iraq, they can declare a victory no matter the reality. Why? Because the projection of US power around the world rests on a global belief in US military supremacy. It's the critical glue that holds an entire jigsaw puzzle of regimes in power; it protects a system that favors the wealthy powers over the poorer ones. This is what makes Republican Senator Lindsey Graham literally shake whenever he contemplates &quot;defeat&quot;. For such leaders it's worth thousands of lives and billions of dollars to avoid the US being seen as strategically weak. Can Obama risk being known as the President who lost the Afghan war? Not likely before the election of 2012. And then, Presidents do like their place in history. As unpopular as this war gets, Obama has shown himself to be far more afraid of his right flank than his left. That is, unless Americans rise up against this war in a way that is yet to be seen.</span></strong><br />

<u>Hegghammer 2009</u> <strong>(Thomas, a senior research fellow at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) and an associate of the Initiative on Religion in International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, “The big impact of small footprints”, 11/11/2009, Foreign Policy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/19691/big_impact_of_small_footprints.html" rel="nofollow">http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/19691/big_impact_of_small_footprints.html</a>)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">A growing number of people, led by Vice President Joe Biden, are advocating a so-called &quot;small footprint&quot; approach to the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan. They propose a significantly reduced military presence that focuses more on destroying al Qaeda than on building Afghanistan, and relies more on airstrikes and special forces than on conventional tactics. America will get about as much security as before, the argument goes, but at a much lower price. A return of the Taliban to power is not necessarily a problem, small footprint proponents argue, because the regime <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/08/18/the_safe_haven_myth" rel="nofollow">can be deterred</a> from hosting al Qaeda by the threat of U.S. airstrikes or another invasion. One of the many assumptions behind this tempting argument is that there is a certain level of proportionality between the amount of force we use and the level of resistance we encounter. If we stop occupying Afghanistan and limit violence to the really bad guys, al Qaeda will be unable, and other radicalized Muslims unwilling, to attack the United States. This may be true for local insurgencies such as the Taliban, but not for small transnational movements such as al Qaeda. In fact, a significantly smaller U.S. presence in Afghanistan may paradoxically generate more anti-Americanism outside Afghanistan and ultimately more anti-Western terrorism than a more conventional military approach. This is because jihadi propaganda today relies on visually powerful symbols to mobilize people, and intermittent &quot;surgical&quot; strikes, and the casualties they cause, may create more such symbols than continuous conventional warfare. The history of jihadism is full of examples of seemingly small incidents having a major effect on mobilization. In August 1998, the U.S. launched missiles on Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for al Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa. The strikes made Mullah Omar work more closely with Osama Bin Laden and were followed by an increase in recruitment to al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. In April 2002, the Israeli military's incursion into Jenin caused a veritable political earthquake in the Muslim world, and demonstrably helped recruitment to al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. This was despite the relatively few casualties (a U.N. report <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.un.org/peace/jenin/index.html" rel="nofollow">concluded</a> 52 Palestinian were killed, half of them civilians). In Pakistan, a <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4614486.stm" rel="nofollow">few</a> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6099946.stm" rel="nofollow">failed</a> U.S. airstrikes in the Tribal Areas in 2006 and 2007 caused public outrage.and dramatically increased anti-Americanism across the country. The power of small incidents has increased in the past decade thanks to the Internet. Increasing bandwidth, cheaper digital cameras and fast-learning activists have turned the world wide web into a giant propaganda tool which can generate powerful visual messages and project them instantly to a global audience. The smallest detail can be dramatically enlarged and turned into a symbol of &quot;Muslim suffering at the hands of non-Muslims.&quot; On jihadi discussion forums such as Faloja(named after the Iraqi city whose 2004 battles between jihadis and U.S. forces made it an icon of Muslim suffering), high-quality video productions appear on a daily basis. The relationship between objective physical destruction and jihadi mobilization has never been less linear. (Of course, the non-linearity works both ways; more conventional power does not necessarily generate less powerful propaganda.) Why, then, would a small footprint approach in Afghanistan create more visual symbols of Muslim suffering? For a start, a troop reduction would not take away the occupation, at least not in the eyes of non-Afghan Islamists. Al Qaeda has a very wide definition of occupation and would frame any U.S. military presence in the region as such. Moreover, the surgical strikes would not be that surgical. A significantly smaller U.S. ground presence is likely to produce less good human intelligence, because it will be harder to protect informants. This will increase the risk of hitting, for example, wedding parties. In addition, fewer strikes means that each individual operation is more visible. This mitigates the problem of information saturation which currently frustrates jihadi propagandists. In war, many bad things happen, but individual incidents drown in the noise of the conflict. This may explain why interest in the Iraqi insurgency on jihadi forums has decreased steadily since 2005; there was so much going on that even jihadis were desensitized. A related dynamic may be behind the paradox that in Pakistan, public outrage over CIA drone strikes seems to have decreased in 2008 and 2009 as the frequency of strikes has <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newamerica.net/publications/policy/revenge_drones" rel="nofollow">gone up</a>.

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The affirmative’s concept of violence as external from their own lives allows individuals to abdicate their responsibility. Denial of our individual culpability with violence forecloses the possibility of meaningful change; in the process, violence becomes more likely.</span><br />
<u>Kappeler 1995</u> <strong>(Susanne, Associate Professor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Al Akhawayn University. &quot;The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior&quot;, p. 1-4, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> What is striking is that the violence which is talked about is always the violence committed by someone else: women talk about the violence of men, adults about the violence of young people; the left, liberals and the centre about the violence of right extremists; the right, centre and liberals about the violence of leftist extremists; political activists talk about structural violence, police and politicians about violence in the `street', and all together about the violence in our society. Similarly, Westerners talk about violence in the Balkans, Western citizens together with their generals about the violence of the Serbian army. Violence is recognized and measured by its visible effects, the spectacular blood of wounded bodies, the material destruction of objects, the visible damage left in the world of `objects'. In its measurable damage we see the proof that violence has taken place, the violence being reduced to this damage. The violation as such, or invisible forms of violence - the non-physical violence of threat and terror, of insult and humiliation, the violation of human dignity - are hardly ever the issue except to some extent in feminist and anti-racist analyses, or under the name of psychological violence. Here violence is recognized by the victims and defined from their perspective - an important step away from the catalogue of violent acts and the exclusive evidence of material traces in the object. Yet even here the focus tends to be on the effects and experience of violence, either the objective and scientific measure of psychological damage, or the increasingly subjective definition of violence as experience. Violence is perceived as a phenomenon for science to research and for politics to get a grip on. But violence is not a phenomenon: it is the behaviour of people, human action which may be analysed. What is missing is an analysis of violence as action - not just as acts of violence, or the cause of its effects, but as the actions of people in relation to other people and beings or things. Feminist critique, as well as other political critiques, has analysed the preconditions of violence, the unequal power relations which enable it to take place. However, under the pressure of mainstream science and a sociological perspective which increasingly dominates our thinking, it is becoming standard to argue as if it were these power relations which cause the violence. Underlying is a behaviourist model which prefers to see human action as the exclusive product of circumstances, ignoring the personal decision of the agent to act, implying in turn that circumstances virtually dictate certain forms of behaviour. Even though we would probably not underwrite these propositions in their crass form, there is nevertheless a growing tendency, not just in social science, to explain violent behaviour by its circumstances. (Compare the question, `Does pornography cause violence?') The circumstances identified may differ according to the politics of the explainers, but the method of explanation remains the same. While consideration of mitigating circumstances has its rightful place in a court of law trying (and defending) an offender, this does not automatically make it an adequate or sufficient practice for political analysis. It begs the question, in particular, `What is considered to be part of the circumstances (and by whom)?' Thus in the case of sexual offenders, there is a routine search - on the part of the tabloid press or professionals of violence - for experiences of violence in the offender's own past, an understanding which is rapidly solidifying in scientific model of a `cycle of violence'. That is, the relevant factors are sought in the distant past and in other contexts of action, e a crucial factor in the present context is ignored, namely the agent's decision to act as he did. Even politically oppositional groups are not immune to this mainstream sociologizing. Some left groups have tried to explain men's sexual violence as the result of class oppression, while some Black theoreticians have explained the violence of Black men as the result of racist oppression. The ostensible aim of these arguments may be to draw attention to the pervasive and structural violence of classism and racism, yet they not only fail to combat such inequality, they actively contribute to it. Although such oppression is a very real part of an agent's life context, these `explanations' ignore the fact that not everyone experiencing the same oppression uses violence, that is, that these circumstances do not `cause' violent behaviour. They overlook, in other words, that the perpetrator has decided to violate, even if this decision was made in circumstances of limited choice. To overlook this decision, however, is itself a political decision, serving particular interests. In the first instance it serves to exonerate the perpetrators, whose responsibility is thus transferred to circumstances and a history for which other people (who remain beyond reach) are responsible. Moreover, it helps to stigmatize all those living in poverty and oppression; because they are obvious victims of violence and oppression, they are held to be potential perpetrators themselves.' This slanders all the women who have experienced sexual violence, yet do not use violence against others, and libels those experiencing racist and class oppression, yet do not necessarily act out violence. Far from supporting those oppressed by classist, racist or sexist oppression, it sells out these entire groups in the interest of exonerating individual members. It is a version of collective victim-blaming, of stigmatizing entire social strata as potential hotbeds of violence, which rests on and perpetuates the mainstream division of society into so-called marginal groups - the classic clienteles of social work and care politics (and of police repression) - and an implied `centre' to which all the speakers, explainers, researchers and careers themselves belong, and which we are to assume to be a zone of non-violence. Explaining people's violent behaviour by their circumstances also has the advantage of implying that the `solution' lies in a change to circumstances. Thus it has become fashionable among socially minded politicians and intellectuals in Germany to argue that the rising neo-Nazi violence of young people (men), especially in former East Germany, needs to be countered by combating poverty and unemployment in these areas. Likewise anti-racist groups like the Anti. Racist Alliance or the Anti-Nazi League in Britain argue that `the causes of racism, like poverty and unemployment, should be tackled and that it is `problems like unemployment and bad housing which lead to racism'.' Besides being no explanation at all of why (white poverty and unemployment should lead specifically to racist violence (and what would explain middle- and upper-class racism), it is more than questionable to combat poverty only (but precisely) when and where violence is exercised. It not only legitimates the violence (by `explaining' it), but constitutes an incentive to violence, confirming that social problems will be taken seriously when and where `they attract attention by means of violence - just as the most unruly children in schools (mostly boys) tend to get more attention from teachers than well-behaved and quiet children (mostly girls). Thus if German neo-Nazi youths and youth groups, since their murderous assaults on refugees and migrants in Hoyerswerda, Rostock, Dresden etc., are treated to special youth projects and social care measures (to the tune of DM 20 million per year), including `educative' trips to Morocco and Israel,' this is am unmistakable signal to society that racist violence does indeed 'pay off'.</span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Political violence is sustained by organized thinking that looks at violence through meta-analysis. We need to have deeper insight that realizes that each of us are culpable for violence. This is integral to ending the cycle of violence.</span><br />
<u>Kappeler 1995</u> <strong>(Susanne, Associate Professor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Al Akhawayn University. &quot;The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior&quot;, p. 8-11, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Moreover, personal behaviour is no alternative to `political' action; there is no question of either/or. My concern, on the contrary, is the connection between these recognized forms of violence and the forms of everyday behaviour which we consider `normal' but which betray our own will to violence - the connection, in other words, between our own actions and those acts of violence which are normally the focus of our political critiques. Precisely because there is no choice between dedicating oneself either to `political issues' or to `personal behaviour', the question of the politics of personal behaviour has (also) to be moved into the centre of our politics and our critique. Violence - what we usually recognize as such - is no exception to the rules, no deviation from the normal and nothing out of the ordinary, in a society in which exploitation and oppression are the norm, the ordinary and the rule. It is no misbehaviour of a minority amid good behaviour by the majority, nor the deeds of inhuman monsters amid humane humans, in a society in which there is no equality, in which people divide others according to race, class, sex and many other factors in order to rule, exploit, use, objectify, enslave, sell, torture and kill them, in which millions of animals are tortured, genetically manipulated, enslaved and slaughtered daily for `harmless' consumption by humans. It is no error of judgement, no moral lapse and no transgression against the customs of a culture which is thoroughly steeped in the values of profit and desire, of self-realization, expansion and progress. Violence as we usually perceive it is `simply' a specific - and to us still visible - form of violence, the consistent and logical application of the principles of our culture and everyday life. War does not suddenly break out in a peaceful society; sexual violence is not the disturbance of otherwise equal gender relations. Racist attacks do not shoot like lightning out of a non-racist sky, and the sexual exploitation of children is no solitary problem in a world otherwise just to children. The violence of our most commonsense everyday thinking, and especially our personal will to violence, constitute the conceptual preparation, the ideological armament and the intellectual mobilization which make the `outbreak' of war, of sexual violence, of racist attacks, of murder and destruction possible at all. 'We are the war', writes Slavenka Drakulic at the end of her existential analysis of the question, `what is war?': I do not know what war is, I want to tell [my friend], but I see it everywhere. It is in the blood-soaked street in Sarajevo, after 20 people have been killed while they queued for bread. But it is also in your non-comprehension, in my unconscious cruelty towards you, in the fact that you have a yellow form [for refugees] and I don't, in the way in which it grows inside ourselves and changes our feelings, relationships, values - in short: us. We are the war ... And I am afraid that we cannot hold anyone else responsible. We make this war possible, we permit it to happen.' `We are the war' - and we also `are' the sexual violence, the racist violence, the exploitation and the will to violence in all its manifestations in a society in so-called `peacetime', for we make them possible and we permit them to happen. `We are the war' does not mean that the responsibility for a war is shared collectively and diffusely by an entire society - which would be equivalent to exonerating warlords and politicians and profiteers or, as Ulrich Beck says, upholding the notion of `collective irresponsibility', where people are no longer held responsible for their actions, and where the conception of universal responsibility becomes the equivalent of a universal acquittal.' On the contrary, the object is precisely to analyse the specific and differential responsibility of everyone in their diverse situations. Decisions to unleash a war are indeed taken at particular levels of power by those in a position to make them and to command such collective action. We need to hold them clearly responsible for their decisions and actions without lessening theirs by any collective `assumption' of responsibility. Yet our habit of focusing on the stage where the major dramas of power take place tends to obscure our sight in relation to our own sphere of competence, our own power and our own responsibility - leading to the well-known illusion of our apparent `powerlessness' and its accompanying phenomenon, our so-called political disillusionment. Single citizens - even more so those of other nations - have come to feel secure in their obvious non-responsibility for such large-scale political events as, say, the wars in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina or Somalia - since the decisions for such events are always made elsewhere. Yet our insight that indeed we are not responsible for the decisions of a Serbian general or a Croatian president tends to mislead us into thinking that therefore we have no responsibility at all, not even for forming our own judgement, and thus into underrating the responsibility we do have within our own sphere of action. In particular, it seems to absolve us from having to try to see any relation between our own actions and those events, or to recognize the connections between those political decisions and our own personal decisions. It not only shows that we participate in what Beck calls `organized irresponsibility', upholding the apparent lack of connection between bureaucratically, institutionally, nationally and also individually organized separate competences. It also proves the phenomenal and unquestioned alliance of our personal thinking with the thinking of the major powermongers. For we tend to think that we cannot `do' anything, say, about a war, because we deem ourselves to be in the wrong situation; because we are not where the major decisions are made. Which is why many of those not yet entirely disillusioned with politics tend to engage in a form of mental deputy politics, in the style of `What would I do if I were the general, the prime minister, the president, the foreign minister or the minister of defence?' Since we seem to regard their mega spheres of action as the only worthwhile and truly effective ones, and since our political analyses tend to dwell there first of all, any question of what I would do if I were indeed myself tends to peter out in the comparative insignificance of having what is perceived as `virtually no possibilities': what I could do seems petty and futile. For my own action I obviously desire the range of action of a general, a prime minister, or a General Secretary of the UN - finding expression in ever more prevalent formulations like `I want to stop this war', `I want military intervention', `I want to stop this backlash', or `I want a moral revolution.' 7 , We are this war', however, even if we do not command the troops or participate in so-called peace talks, namely as Drakulic says, in our 'non-comprehension': our willed refusal to feel responsible for our own thinking and for working out our own understanding, preferring innocently to drift along the ideological current of prefabricated arguments or less than innocently taking advantage of the advantages these offer. And we `are' the war in our `unconscious cruelty towards you', our tolerance of the `fact that you have a yellow form for refugees and I don't' - our readiness, in other words, to build identities, one for ourselves and one for refugees, one of our own and one for the `others'. We share in the responsibility for this war and its violence in the way we let them grow inside us, that is, in the way we shape `our feelings, our relationships, our values' according to the structures and the values of war and violence. So if we move beyond the usual frame of violence, towards the structures of thought employed in decisions to act, this also means making an analysis of action. This seems all the more urgent as action seems barely to be perceived any longer. There is talk of the government doing `nothing', of its `inaction', of the need for action, the time for action, the need for strategies, our inability to act as well as our desire to become `active' again. We seem to deem ourselves in a kind of action vacuum which, like the cosmic black hole, tends to consume any renewed effort only to increase its size. Hence this is also an attempt to shift the focus again to the fact that we are continually acting and doing, and that there is no such thing as not acting or doing nothing. </span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> None of us have our hands on the levers of power, instead we need to interrogate our own will to violence; only be politicizing the way we think about violence can we find ways to end the cycle of violence.</span><br />
<u>Kappeler 1995</u> <strong>(Susanne, Associate Professor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Al Akhawayn University. &quot;The Will To Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior&quot;, p. 4-5, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> If we nevertheless continue to explain violence by its ‘circumstances’ and attempt to counter it by changing these circumstances, it is also because in this way we stay in command of the problem. In particular, we do not complicate the problem by any suggestions that it might be people who need to change. Instead, we turn the perpetrators of violence into the victims of circumstances, who as victims by definition, cannot act sensibly (but in changed circumstances will behave differently. ‘We,’ on the other hand, are the subjects able to take in hand the task of changing the circumstances. Even if changing the circumstance – combating poverty, unemployment, injustice, etc. – may not be easy, it nevertheless remains within ‘our’ scope at least theoretically and by means of state power. Changing people, on the other hand, is neither within our power nor, it seems, ultimately in our interest: we prefer to keep certain people under control, putting limits on their violent behavior, but we apparently have no interest in a politics that presupposes people's ability to change and aims at changing attitudes and behavior. For changing (as opposed to restricting) other people's behavior is beyond the range and influence of our own power; only they themselves can change it. It requires their will to change, their will not to abuse power and not to use violence. A politics aiming at a change in people's behavior would require political work that is very much more cumbersome and very much less promising of success than is the use of state power and social control. It would require political consciousness-raising — politicizing the way we think — which cannot be imposed on others by force or compulsory educational measures. It would require a view of people which takes seriously and reckons with their will, both their will to violence and their will to change. To take seriously the will of others however would mean recognizing one's own, and putting people's will, including our own, at the centre of political reflection. A political analysis of violence needs to recognize this will, the personal decision in favour of violence - not just to describe acts of violence, or the conditions which enable them to take place, but also to capture the moment of decision which is the real impetus for violent action. For without this decision there will be no violent act, not even in circumstances which potentially permit it. It is the decision to violate, not just the act itself, which makes a person a perpetrator of violence - just as it is the decision not to do so which makes people not act violently and not abuse their power in a situation which would nevertheless permit it. This moment of decision, therefore, is also the locus of potential resistance to violence. To understand the structures of thinking and the criteria, by which such decisions are reached, but above all to regard this decision as an act of choice, seems to me a necessary precondition for any political struggle against violence and for a non-violent society.</span></strong><br />

The U.S. marries destructive military capabilities to a policy of selective engagement to make it’s military appear less threatening - ignoring the way our isolation of threats can incite aggression frames our response in a way that creates a self-fullfiling prophecy - oh and your threats are constructed.<br />
Grondin <strong>20</strong>04 <strong>(David Grondin, Masters in Political Science and Ph.D. Candidate – University of Ottawa, 2004, (“(Re)Writing the ‘National Security State,’ Center for United States Studies, p. 12-17, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Approaches that deconstruct theoretical practices in order to disclose what is hidden in the use of concepts such as “national security” have something valuable to say. Their more reflexive and critically-inclined view illustrates how terms used in realist discourses, such as state, anarchy, world order, revolution in military affairs, and security dilemmas, are produced by a specific historical, geographical and socio-political context as well as historical forces and social relations of power (Klein, 1994: 22). Since realist analysts do not question their ontology and yet purport to provide a neutral and objective analysis of a given world order based on military power and interactions between the most important political units, namely states, realist discourses constitute a political act in defense of the state. Indeed, “[…] it is important to recognize that to employ a textualizing approach to social policy involving conflict and war is not to attempt to reduce social phenomena to various concrete manifestations of language. Rather, it is an attempt to analyze the interpretations governing policy thinking. And it is important to recognize that policy thinking is not unsituated” (Shapiro, 1989a: 71). Policy thinking is practical thinking since it imposes an analytic order on the “real world”, a world that only exists in the analysts’ own narratives. In this light, Barry Posen’s political role in legitimizing American hegemonic power and national security conduct seems obvious: U.S. command of the commons provides an impressive foundation for selective engagement. It is not adequate for a policy of primacy. […] Command of the commons gives the United States a tremendous capability to harm others. Marrying that capability to a conservative policy of selective engagement helps make U.S. military power appear less threatening and more tolerable. Command of the commons creates additional collective goods for U.S. allies. These collective goods help connect U.S. military power to seemingly prosaic welfare concerns. U.S. military power underwrites world trade, travel, global telecommunications, and commercial remote sensing, which all depend on peace and order in the commons” (Posen, 2003: 44 and 46). Adopting a more critical stance, David Campbell points out that “[d]anger is not an objective condition. It (sic) is not a thing which exists independently of those to whom it may become a threat. […] Nothing is a risk in itself; [...] it all depends on how one analyses the danger, considers the event” (Campbell, 1998: 1-2). In the same vein, national security discourse does not evaluate objective threats; rather, it is itself a product of historical processes and structures in the state and society that produces it. Whoever has the power to define security is then the one who has the authority to write legitimate security discourses and conduct the policies that legitimize them. The realist analysts and state leaders who invoke national security and act in its name are the same individuals who hold the power to securitize threats by inserting them in a discourse that frames national identity and freezes it.9 Like many concepts, realism is essentially contested. In a critical reinterpretation of realism, James Der Derian offers a genealogy of realism that deconstructs the uniform realism represented in IR: he reveals many other versions of realism that are never mentioned in International Relations texts (Der Derian, 1995: 367). I am aware that there are many realist discourses in International Relations, but they all share a set of assumptions, such as “the state is a rational unitary actor”, “the state is the main actor in international relations”, “states pursue power defined as a national interest”, and so on. I want to show that realism is one way of representing reality, not the reflection of reality. While my aim here is not to rehearse Der Derian’s genealogy of realism, I do want to spell out the problems with a positivist theory of realism and a correspondence philosophy of language. Such a philosophy accepts nominalism, wherein language as neutral description corresponds to reality. This is precisely the problem of epistemic realism and of the realism characteristic of American realist theoretical discourses. And since for poststructuralists language constitutes reality, a reinterpretation of realism as constructed in these discourses is called for.10 These scholars cannot refer to the “essentially contested nature of realism” and then use “realism as the best language to reflect a self-same phenomenon” (Der Derian, 1995: 374). Let me be clear: I am not suggesting that the many neorealist and neoclassical realist discourses in International Relations are not useful. Rather, I want to argue that these technicist and scientist forms of realism serve political purposes, used as they are in many think tanks and foreign policy bureaucracies to inform American political leaders. This is the relevance of deconstructing the uniform realism (as used in International Relations): it brings to light its locatedness in a hermeneutic circle in which it is unwittingly trapped (Der Derian, 1995: 371). And as Friedrich Kratochwil argues, “[…] the rejection of a correspondence theory of truth does not condemn us, as it is often maintained, to mere ‘relativism’ and/or to endless “deconstruction” in which anything goes but it leaves us with criteria that allows us to distinguish and evaluate competing theoretical creations” (Kratochwil, 2000 : 52). Given that political language is not a neutral medium that gives expression to ideas formed independently of structures of signification that sustain political action and thought, American realist discourses belonging to the neorealist or neoclassical realist traditions cannot be taken as mere descriptions of reality. We are trapped in the production of discourses in which national leaders and security speech acts emanating from realist discourses develop and reinforce a notion of national identity as synonymous with national security. U.S. national security conduct should thus be understood through the prism of the theoretical discourses of American political leaders and realist scholars that co-constitute it. Realist discourses depict American political leaders acting in defense of national security, and political leaders act in the name of national security. In the end, what distinguishes realist discourses is that they depict the United States as having behaved like a national security state since World War II, while legitimating the idea that the United States should continue to do so. Political scientists and historians “are engaged in making (poesis), not merely recording or reporting” (Medhurst, 2000: 17). Precisely in this sense, rhetoric is not the description of national security conduct; it constitutes it. It is difficult to trace the exact origins of the concept of “national security”. It seems however that its currency in policymaking circles corresponds to the American experience of the Second World War and of the early years of what came to be known as the “Cold War”. In this light, it is fair to say that the meaning of the American national security state is bound up with the Cold War context. If one is engaged in deciphering the meaning of the Cold War prism for American leaders, what matters is not uncovering the “reality” of the Cold War as such, but how, it conferred meaning and led people to act upon it as “reality”. The Cold War can thus be seen as a rhetorical construction, in which its rhetorical dimensions gave meaning to its material manifestations, such as the national security state apparatus. This is not to say that the Cold War never existed per se, nor does it “make [it] any less real or less significant for being rhetorical” (Medhurst, 2000: 6). As Lynn Boyd Hinds and Theodore Otto Windt, Jr. stress, “political rhetoric creates political reality, structures belief systems, and provides the fundamental bases for decisions” (Hinds and Windt, cited in Medhurst, 2000: 6). In this sense, the Cold War ceases to be a historical period which meaning can be written permanently and becomes instead a struggle that is not context-specific and not geared towards one specific enemy. It is “an orientation towards difference in which those acting on behalf of an assumed but never fixed identity are tempted by the lure of otherness to interpret all dangers as fundamental threats which require the mobilization of a population” (Campbell, 2000: 227). Indeed, if the meaning of the Cold War is not context-specific, the concept of national security cannot be disconnected from what is known as the Cold War, since its very meaning(s) emerged within it (Rosenberg, 1993 : 277).11 If the American national security state is a given for realist analysts,12 it is important to ask whether we can conceive the United States during the Cold War as anything other than a national security state.13 To be clear, I am not suggesting that there is any such essentialized entity as a “national security state”.14 When I refer to the American national security state, I mean the representation of the American state in the early years of the Cold War, the spirit of which is embodied in the National Security Act of 1947 (Der Derian, 1992: 76). The term “national security state” designates both an institutionalization of a new governmental architecture designed to prepare the United States politically and militarily to face any foreign threat and the ideology – the discourse – that gave rise to as well as symbolized it. In other words, to understand the idea of a national security state, one needs to grasp the discursive power of national security in shaping the reality of the Cold War in both language and institutions (Rosenberg, 1993 : 281). A national security state feeds on threats as it channels all its efforts into meeting current and future military or security threats. The creation of the CIA, the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Council at the onset of the Cold War gave impetus to a state mentality geared to permanent preparedness for war. The construction of threats is thus essential to its well-being, making intelligence agencies privileged tools in accomplishing this task. As American historian of U.S. foreign relations Michael Hogan observes in his study on the rise of the national security state during the Truman administration, “the national security ideology framed the Cold War discourse in a system of symbolic representation that defined America’s national identity by reference to the un-American ‘other,’ usually the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, or some other totalitarian power” (Hogan, 1998: 17). Such a binary system made it difficult for any domestic dissent from U.S. policy to emerge – it would have “amounted to an act of disloyalty” (Hogan, 1998: 18).15 While Hogan distinguishes advocates from critics of the American national security state, his view takes for granted that there is a given and fixed American political culture that differs from the “new” national security ideology. It posits an “American way”, produced by its cultural, political, and historical experience. Although he stresses that differences between the two sides of the discourse are superficial, pertaining solely to the means, rather than the ends of the national security state, Hogan sees the national security state as a finished and legitimate state: an American state suited to the Cold War context of permanent war, while stopping short of a garrison state: Although government would grow larger, taxes would go up, and budget deficits would become a matter of routine, none of these and other transformations would add up to the crushing regime symbolized in the metaphor of the garrison state. The outcome instead would be an American national security state that was shaped as much by the country’s democratic political culture as it was by the perceived military imperatives of the Cold War (Hogan, 1998: 22). I disagree with this essentialist view of the state identity of the United States. The United States does not need to be a national security state. If it was and is still constructed as such by many realist discourses, it is because these discourses serve some political purpose. Moreover, in keeping with my poststructuralist inclinations, I maintain that identity need not be, and indeed never is, fixed. In a scheme in which “to say is to do”, that is, from a perspective that accepts the performativity of language, culture becomes a relational site where identity politics happens rather than being a substantive phenomenon. In this sense, culture is not simply a social context framing foreign policy decision-making. Culture is “a signifying part of the conditions of possibility for social being, […] the way in which culturalist arguments themselves secure the identity of subjects in whose name they speak” (Campbell, 1998: 221). The Cold War national security culture represented in realist discourses was constitutive of the American national security state. There was certainly a conflation of theory and policy in the Cold War military-intellectual complex, which “were observers of, and active participants in, defining the meaning of the Cold War. They contributed to portray the enemy that both reflected and fueled predominant ideological strains within the American body politic. As scholarly partners in the national security state, they were instrumental in defining and disseminating a Cold War culture” (Rubin, 2001: 15). This national security culture was “a complex space where various representations and representatives of the national security state compete to draw the boundaries and dominate the murkier margins of international relations” (Der Derian, 1992: 41). The same Cold War security culture has been maintained by political practice (on the part of realist analysts and political leaders) through realist discourses in the post-9/11 era and once again reproduces the idea of a national security state. This (implicit) state identification is neither accidental nor inconsequential. From a poststructuralist vantage point, the identification process of the state and the nation is always a negative process for it is achieved by exclusion, violence, and marginalization. Thus, a deconstruction of practices that constitute and consolidate state identity is necessary: the writing of the state must be revealed through the analysis of the discourses that constitute it. The state and the discourses that (re)constitute it thus frame its very identity and impose a fictitious “national unity” on society; it is from this fictive and arbitrary creation of the modernist dichotomous discourses of inside/outside that the discourses (re)constructing the state emerge. It is in the creation of a Self and an Other in which the state uses it monopolistic power of legitimate violence – a power socially constructed, following Max Weber’s work on the ethic of responsibility – to construct a threatening Other differentiated from the “unified” Self, the national society (the nation).16 It is through this very practice of normative statecraft,17 which produces threatening Others, that the international sphere comes into being. David Campbell adds that it is by constantly articulating danger through foreign policy that the state’s very conditions of existence are generated 18.</strong><br />

<strong>The threat of nuclear annihilation has stimulated us to try to understand what it is about mankind that has led to such self-destroying behavior. Central to this inquiry is an exploration of the adversarial relationships between ethnic or national groups. It is out of such enmities that war, including nuclear war should it occur, has always arisen. Enmity between groups of people stems from the interaction of psychological, economic, and cultural elements. These include fear and hostility (which are often closely related), competition over perceived scarce resources,[3] the need for individuals to identify with a large group or cause,[4] a tendency to disclaim and assign elsewhere responsibility for unwelcome impulses and intentions, and a peculiar susceptibility to emotional manipulation by leaders who play upon our more savage inclinations in the name of national security or the national interest. A full understanding of the &quot;enemy system&quot;[3] requires insights from many specialities, including psychology, anthropology, history, political science, and the humanities. In their statement on violence[5] twenty social and behavioral scientists, who met in Seville, Spain, to examine the roots of war, declared that there was no scientific basis for regarding man as an innately aggressive animal, inevitably committed to war. The Seville statement implies that we have real choices. It also points to a hopeful paradox of the nuclear age: threat of nuclear war may have provoked our capacity for fear-driven polarization but at the same time it has inspired unprecedented efforts towards cooperation and settlement of differences without violence. The Real and the Created Enemy: Attempts to explore the psychological roots of enmity are frequently met with responses on the following lines: &quot;I can accept psychological explanations of things, but my enemy is real. The Russians [or Germans, Arabs, Israelis, Americans] are armed, threaten us, and intend us harm. Furthermore, there are real differences between us and our national interests, such as competition over oil, land, or other scarce resources, and genuine conflicts of values between our two nations. It is essential that we be strong and maintain a balance or superiority of military and political power, lest the other side take advantage of our weakness&quot;. This argument does not address the distinction between the enemy threat and one's own contribution to that threat-by distortions of perception, provocative words, and actions. In short, the enemy is real, but we have not learned to understand how we have created that enemy, or how the threatening image we hold of the enemy relates to its actual intentions. &quot;We never see our enemy's motives and we never labor to assess his will, with anything approaching objectivity&quot;.[6] Individuals may have little to do with the choice of national enemies. Most Americans, for example, know only what has been reported in the mass media about the Soviet Union. We are largely unaware of the forces that operate within our institutions, affecting the thinking of our leaders and ourselves, and which determine how the Soviet Union will be represented to us. Ill-will and a desire for revenge are transmitted from one generation to another, and we are not taught to think critically about how our assigned enemies are selected for us. In the relations between potential adversarial nations there will have been, inevitably, real grievances that are grounds for enmity. But the attitude of one people towards another is usually determined by leaders who manipulate the minds of citizens for domestic political reasons which are generally unknown to the public. As Israeli sociologist Alouph Haveran has said, in times of conflict between nations historical accuracy is the first victim.[8] The Image of the Enemy and How We Sustain It: Vietnam veteran William Broyles wrote: &quot;War begins in the mind, with the idea of the enemy.&quot;[9] But to sustain that idea in war and peacetime a nation's leaders must maintain public support for the massive expenditures that are required. Studies of enmity have revealed susceptibilities, though not necessarily recognized as such by the governing elites that provide raw material upon which the leaders may draw to sustain the image of an enemy.[7,10] Freud[11] in his examination of mass psychology identified the proclivity of individuals to surrender personal responsibility to the leaders of large groups. This surrender takes place in both totalitarian and democratic societies, and without coercion. Leaders can therefore designate outside enemies and take actions against them with little opposition. Much further research is needed to understand the psychological mechanisms that impel individuals to kill or allow killing in their name, often with little questioning of the morality or consequences of such actions. Philosopher and psychologist Sam Keen asks why it is that in virtually every war &quot;The enemy is seen as less than human? He's faceless. He's an animal&quot;.&quot; Keen tries to answer his question: &quot;The image of the enemy is not only the soldier's most powerful weapon; it is society's most powerful weapon. It enables people en masse to participate in acts of violence they would never consider doing as individuals&quot;.[12] National leaders become skilled in presenting the adversary in dehumanized images. The mass media, taking their cues from the leadership, contribute powerfully to the process. The image of the enemy as less than human may be hard to dislodge. For example, a teacher in the Boston area reported that during a high school class on the Soviet Union a student protested: &quot;You're trying to get us to see them as people&quot;. Stephen Cohen and other Soviet experts have noted how difficult it is to change the American perception of the Soviet Union, despite the vast amount of new information contradicting old stereotypes.&quot; Bernard Shaw in his preface to Heartbreak House, written at the end of World War I, observed ironically: &quot;Truth telling is not compatible with the defense of the realm&quot;. Nations are usually created out of the violent defeat of the former inhabitants of a piece of land or of outside enemies, and national leaders become adept at keeping their people's attention focused on the threat of an outside enemy.[14] Leaders also provide what psychiatrist Vamik Volkan called &quot;suitable targets of externalization&quot;[10] – i.e., outside enemies upon whom both leaders and citizens can relieve their burdens of private defeat, personal hurt, and humiliation.[15] All-embracing ideas, such as political ideologies and fixed religious beliefs act as psychological or cultural amplifiers. Such ideologies can embrace whole economic systems, such as socialism or capitalism, or draw on beliefs that imply that a collectivity owes its existence to some higher power in the universe. It was not Stalin as an individual whom Nadezhda Mandelstam blamed for the political murder of her poet husband Osip and millions of other citizens but the &quot;craving for an all-embracing idea which would explain everything in the world and bring about universal harmony at one go”.[16] Every nation, no matter how bloody and cruel its beginnings, sees its origins in a glorious era of heroes who vanquished less worthy foes. One's own race, people, country, or political system is felt to be superior to the adversary's, blessed by a less worthy god. The nuclear age has spawned a new kind of myth. This is best exemplified by the United States' strategic defense initiative. This celestial fantasy offers protection from attack by nuclear warheads, faith here being invested not in a god but in an anti-nuclear technology of lasers, satellites, mirrors, and so on in the heavens.Individual Group Linkages and Lessons in Childhood: To find out the source of hatred or antagonism we need to understand the complex relationship between the psychology of the individual, and the national group.[17] We can start by examining how enmity develops in childhood. In the first year of life a child begins to have a sense of self,[18] which includes the ability to distinguish between familiar people with whom he or she feels comfortable and those who are strangers or are felt to be alien. The small child's ability to distinguish between friends and strangers[19] is accompanied by thought patterns that tend to divide people and things into good and bad, safe and unsafe. It is out of such primitive thinking that the structures of enmity later grow. In the second year the child learns that ill-will directed towards those upon whom he is dependent is dangerous to his own well-being. He develops, therefore, mechanisms such as displacement and externalization which allow him to disown such negative impulses. Grandparents and parents may pass on to their children stories of the designated enemy groups' evil actions so that chosen displacements persist from one generation to another. From the drawings and comments of children in Germany, the United States, Central America, and Samoa, Hesse showed that by age five a child understands the idea of an enemy, which he or she will depict as whatever in the culture seems most immediately fearful or threatening-a monster, wild animal, or bad man.[20] By age eight a child understands that &quot;the idea of the enemy&quot; has to do with an unfriendly relationship. But this idea does not usually become cast in political terms until age ten to twelve. It is noteworthy that Hesse's research children, including the older ones, tend not to see their own country as bad or responsible for bad actions. The small child's sense of helplessness is accompanied by a feeling of vulnerability and awareness of dependence on others. The formation of relationships or alliances with other individuals and groups, beginning with family members and extending to the neighborhood, classroom, school playground, and teenage youth group, is an important strategy for gaining a sense of power. Such alliances are the prototype for later political relationships. All of these primitive, or child-like, mechanisms provide fertile soil for political leaders in real life interethnic or international conflicts. Nationalistic slogans and media manipulation focus the child's mind (or the child-mind of the adult) on the peoples or system he is supposed to hate or fear (Jews, Arabs, capitalists, or communists). In the United States patriotic recruitment is accompanied by commercial profiteering-for example, robotic war toys designed to kill communists.[21] The extraordinary dimensions of the nuclear threat have also spawned examples of apocalyptic thinking, in which the world is divided into forces of good and evil, and the belief that, in the event of a nuclear holocaust, the good would be saved and the evil would perish. In such thinking the primitive, polarizing tendencies of the child's mind are all too evident. Creating a Safer World: Hesse's finding that even older children do not perceive their own country's responsibility for states of enmity is in accord with those of psychologists and social scientists - that there is no self-awareness or self-responsibility at the political level which corresponds to the awareness of personal responsibility with which we are familiar in a clinical setting.&quot; In political life, the assignment of blame, disclaiming of responsibility, and the denial of one's own nation's contribution to tensions and enmity are the norm.[23] The first task, therefore, is to apply the insights of the behavioral sciences to create a new expectation of political self-responsibility. Nuclear weapons have connected all the peoples of the earth. Not only the nuclear superpowers but also all peoples are now interdependent and mutually vulnerable. Nations may have conflicting values but they cannot afford to have enemies. Education in elementary and secondary schools that reflects this new reality should be our highest priority. Instead of constant blaming of the other side, we need to give new attention to the adversary's culture and history, to his real intentions as well as his hopes, dreams, and values. To understand is not to forgive, but awareness and knowledge could lead to a more realistic appreciation of who has contributed what to the problems and tensions that exist in the world. Young people should be taught in their homes and schools how to identify and resist ideological propaganda. In the nuclear age we need to redefine hackneyed ideas such as national security or the national interest. just as we can no longer afford enemies, there is no longer such a notion as national security. The security of each depends on the other, and the communication of this reality must become a major focus of our educational system.</strong><br />

<strong>This goal is pursued in ways which are still unconventional in the intellectual milieu of international relations in Australia, even though they are gaining influence worldwide as traditional modes of theory and practice are rendered inadequate by global trends that defy comprehension, let alone policy. The inability to give meaning to global changes reflects partly the enclosed, elitist world of professional security analysts and bureaucratic experts, where entry is gained by learning and accepting to speak a particular, exclusionary language. The contributors to this book are familiar with the discourse, but accord no privileged place to its ‘knowledge form as reality’ in debates on defence and security. Indeed, they believe that debate will be furthered only through a long overdue critical re-evaluation of elite perspectives. Pluralistic, democratically-oriented perspectives on Australia’s identity are both required and essential if Australia’s thinking on defence and security is to be invigorated. This is not a conventional policy book; nor should it be, in the sense of offering policy-makers and their academic counterparts sets of neat alternative solutions, in familiar language and format, to problems they pose. This expectation is in itself a considerable part of the problem to be analysed. It is, however, a book about policy, one that questions how problems are framed by policy-makers. It challenges the proposition that irreducible bodies of real knowledge on defence and security exist independently of their ‘context in the world’, and it demonstrates how security policy is articulated authoritatively by the elite keepers of that knowledge, experts trained to recognize enduring, universal wisdom. All others, from this perspective, must accept such wisdom or remain outside the expert domain, tainted by their inability to comply with the ‘rightness’ of the official line. But it is precisely the official line, or at least its image of the world, that needs to be problematised. If the critic responds directly to the demand for policy alternatives, without addressing this image, he or she is tacitly endorsing it. Before engaging in the policy debate the critics need to reframe the basic terms of reference. This book, then, reflects and underlines the importance of Antonio Gramsci and Edward Said’s ‘critical intellectuals’.15 The demand, tacit or otherwise, that the policy-maker’s frame of reference be accepted as the only basis for discussion and analysis ignores a three thousand year old tradition commonly associated with Socrates and purportedly integral to the Western tradition of democratic dialogue. More immediately, it ignores post-seventeenth century democratic traditions which insist that a good society must have within it some way of critically assessing its knowledge and the decisions based upon that knowledge which impact upon citizens of such a society. This is a tradition with a slightly different connotation in contemporary liberal democracies which, during the Cold War, were proclaimed different and superior to the totalitarian enemy precisely because there were institutional checks and balances upon power. In short, one of the major differences between ‘open societies’ and their (closed) counterparts behind the Iron Curtain was that the former encouraged the critical testing of the knowledge and decisions of the powerful and assessing them against liberal democratic principles. The latter tolerated criticism only on rare and limited occasions. For some, this represented the triumph of rational-scientific methods of inquiry and techniques of falsification. For others, especially since positivism and rationalism have lost much of their allure, it meant that for society to become open and liberal, sectors of the population must be independent of the state and free to question its knowledge and power. Though we do not expect this position to be accepted by every reader, contributors to this book believe that critical dialogue is long overdue in Australia and needs to be listened to. For all its liberal democratic trappings, Australia’s security community continues to invoke closed monological narratives on defence and security. This book also questions the distinctions between policy practice and academic theory that inform conventional accounts of Australian security. One of its major concerns, particularly in chapters 1 and 2, is to illustrate how theory is integral to the practice of security analysis and policy prescription. The book also calls on policy-makers, academics and students of defence and security to think critically about what they are reading, writing and saying; to begin to ask, of their work and study, difficult and searching questions raised in other disciplines; to recognise, no matter how uncomfortable it feels, that what is involved in theory and practice is not the ability to identify a replacement for failed models, but a realisation that terms and concepts – state sovereignty, balance of power, security, and so on – are contested and problematic, and that the world is indeterminate, always becoming what is written about it. Critical analysis which shows how particular kinds of theoretical presumptions can effectively exclude vital areas of political life from analysis has direct practical implications for policy-makers, academics and citizens who face the daunting task of steering Australia through some potentially choppy international waters over the next few years. There is also much of interest in the chapters for those struggling to give meaning to a world where so much that has long been taken for granted now demands imaginative, incisive reappraisal. The contributors, too, have struggled to find meaning, often despairing at the terrible human costs of international violence. This is why readers will find no single, fully formed panacea for the world’s ills in general, or Australia’s security in particular. There are none. Every chapter, however, in its own way, offers something more than is found in orthodox literature, often by exposing ritualistic Cold War defence and security mind-sets that are dressed up as new thinking. Chapters 7 and 9, for example, present alternative ways of engaging in security and defence practice. Others (chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8) seek to alert policy-makers, academics and students to alternative theoretical possibilities which might better serve an Australian community pursuing security and prosperity in an uncertain world. All chapters confront the policy community and its counterparts in the academy with a deep awareness of the intellectual and material constraints imposed by dominant traditions of realism, but they avoid dismissive and exclusionary terms which often in the past characterized exchanges between policy-makers and their critics. This is because, as noted earlier, attention needs to be paid to the words and the thought processes of those being criticized. A close reading of this kind draws attention to underlying assumptions, showing they need to be recognized and questioned. A sense of doubt (in place of confident certainty) is a necessary prelude to a genuine search for alternative policies. First comes an awareness of the need for new perspectives, then specific policies may follow. As Jim George argues in the following chapter, we need to look not so much at contending policies as they are made for us but at challenging ‘the discursive process which gives [favoured interpretations of “reality”] their meaning and which direct [Australia’s] policy/analytical/military responses’. This process is not restricted to the small, official defence and security establishment huddled around the US-Australian War Memorial in Canberra. It also encompasses much of Australia’s academic defence and security community located primarily though not exclusively within the Australian National University and the University College of the University of New South Wales. These discursive processes are examined in detail in subsequent chapters as authors attempt to make sense of a politics of exclusion and closure which exercises disciplinary power over Australia’s security community. They also question the discourse of ‘regional security’, ‘security cooperation’, ‘peacekeeping’ and ‘alliance politics’ that are central to Australia’s official and academic security agenda in the 1990s. This is seen as an important task especially when, as is revealed, the disciplines of International Relations and Strategic Studies are under challenge from critical and theoretical debates ranging across the social sciences and humanities; debates that are nowhere to be found in Australian defence and security studies. The chapters graphically illustrate how Australia’s public policies on defence and security are informed, underpinned and legitimised by a narrowly-based intellectual enterprise which draws strength from contested concepts of realism and liberalism, which in turn seek legitimacy through policy-making processes. Contributors ask whether Australia’s policy-makers and their academic advisors are unaware of broader intellectual debates, or resistant to them, or choose not to understand them, and why?</strong><br />

The alternative solves - breaking out of our obsession with security allows alternative relationships to the future - their predictions are ideologically loaded and suspect.<br />

Since then he has published numerous books and articles. His most recent work has been towards the development of a critique of security. “CRITIQUE OF SECURITY” 2008. Pg. 185-186, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The only way out of such a dilemma, to escape the fetish, is perhaps to eschew the logic of security altogether – to reject it as so ideologically loaded in favour of the state that any real political thought other than the authoritarian and reactionary should be pressed to give it up. That is clearly something that can not be achieved within the limits of bourgeois thought and thus could never even begin to be imagined by the security intellectual. It is also something that the constant iteration of the refrain ‘this is an insecure world’ and reiteration of one fear, anxiety and insecurity after another will also make it hard to do. But it is something that the critique of security suggests we may have to consider if we want a political way out of the impasse of security. This impasse exists because security has now become so all-encompassing that it marginalises all else, most notably the constructive conflicts, debates and discussions that animate political life. The constant prioritising of a mythical security as a political end – as the political end – constitutes a rejection of politics in any meaningful sense of the term. That is, as a mode of action in which differences can be articulated, in which the conflicts and struggles that arise from such differences can be fought for and negotiated, in which people might come to believe that another world is possible – that they might transform the world and in turn be transformed. Security politics simply removes this; worse, it removes it while purportedly addressing it. In so doing it suppresses all issues of power and turns political questions into debates about the most efficient way to achieve ‘security’, despite the fact that we are never quite told – never could be told – what might count as having achieved it. Security politics is, in this sense, an anti-politics,141 dominating political discourse in much the same manner as the security state tries to dominate human beings, reinforcing security fetishism and the monopolistic character of security on the political imagination. We therefore need to get beyond security politics, not add yet more ‘sectors’ to it in a way that simply expands the scope of the state and legitimises state intervention in yet more and more areas of our lives. Simon Dalby reports a personal communication with Michael Williams, co-editor of the important text Critical Security Studies, in which the latter asks: if you take away security, what do you put in the hole that’s left behind? But I’m inclined to agree with Dalby: maybe there is no hole.142 The mistake has been to think that there is a hole and that this hole needs to be filled with a new vision or revision of security in which it is re-mapped or civilised or gendered or humanised or expanded or whatever. All of these ultimately remain within the statist political imaginary, and consequently end up re- affirming the state as the terrain of modern politics, the grounds of security. The real task is not to fill the supposed hole with yet another vision of security, but to fight for an alternative political language which takes us beyond the narrow horizon of bourgeois security and which therefore does not constantly throw us into the arms of the state. That’s the point of critical politics: to develop a new political language more adequate to the kind of society we want. Thus while much of what I have said here has been of a negative order, part of the tradition of critical theory is that the negative may be as significant as the positive in setting thought on new paths. For if security really is the supreme concept of bourgeois society and the fundamental thematic of liberalism, then to keep harping on about insecurity and to keep demanding ‘more security’ (while meekly hoping that this increased security doesn’t damage our liberty) is to blind ourselves to the possibility of building real alternatives to the authoritarian tendencies in contemporary politics. To situate ourselves against security politics would allow us to circumvent the debilitating effect achieved through the constant securitising of social and political issues, debilitating in the sense that ‘security’ helps consolidate the power of the existing forms of social domination and justifies the short-circuiting of even the most democratic forms. It would also allow us to forge another kind of politics centred on a different conception of the good. We need a new way of thinking and talking about social being and politics that moves us beyond security. This would perhaps be emancipatory in the true sense of the word. What this might mean, precisely, must be open to debate. But it certainly requires recognising that security is an illusion that has forgotten it is an illusion; it requires recognising that security is not the same as solidarity; it requires accepting that insecurity is part of the human condition, and thus giving up the search for the certainty of security and instead learning to tolerate the uncertainties, ambiguities and ‘insecurities’ that come with being human; it requires accepting that ‘securitizing’ an issue does not mean dealing with it politically, but bracketing it out and handing it to the state; it requires us to be brave enough to return the gift.143</strong><br />

<strong>The next section of this chapter spells out the theoretical framework upon which the analysis is based, explaining why an analytical focus on the role of representations in foreign policy and international relations helps to understand the recent evolution of US policy in West Africa. Then, the chapter analyzes in more details each of the three major US representations through which its decision-makers interpret and conceive of West African politics. The chapter then shows how these representations have made thinkable and possible the set of policies adopted by the American administration towards that region. The argument does not consist here in explaining why one specific policy has been adopted at the expense of another, but rather how representations provide the conditions for the emergence of a certain number of policies, that is, how representations make certain policies conceivable and imaginable in the first place. Finally, the concluding section offers a critical analysis of the three representations, highlighting alternative ways to conceive and imagine West African politics, thus revealing the political and ideological assumptions upon which the Bush administration’s representations are founded. Relations between states are, at least in part, constructed upon representations. Representations are interpretative prisms through which decision-makers make sense of a political reality, through which they define and assign a subjective value to the other states and non-state actors of the international system, and through which they determine what are significant international political issues.2 For instance, officials of a given state will represent other states as 'allies', 'rivals', or simply 'insignificant', thus assigning a subjective value to these states. Such subjective categorizations often derive from representations of these states' domestic politics, which can for instance be perceived as 'unstable*, 'prosperous', or 'ethnically divided'. It must be clear that representations are not objective or truthful depictions of reality; rather they are subjective and political ways of seeing the world, making certain things 'seen' by and significant for an actor while making other things 'unseen' and 'insignificant'.3 In other words, they are founded on each actor's and group of actors' cognitive, cultural-social, and emotional standpoints. Being fundamentally political, representations are the object of tense struggles and tensions, as some actors or groups of actors can impose on others their own representations of the world, of what they consider to be appropriate political orders, or appropriate economic relations, while others may in turn accept, subvert or contest these representations. Representations of a foreign political reality influence how decision-making actors will act upon that reality. In other words, as subjective and politically infused interpretations of reality, representations constrain and enable the policies that decision-makers will adopt vis-a-vis other states; they limit the courses of action that are politically thinkable and imaginable, making certain policies conceivable while relegating other policies to the realm of the unthinkable.4 Accordingly, identifying how a state represents another state or non-state actor helps to understand how and why certain foreign policies have been adopted while other policies have been excluded. To take a now famous example, if a transnational organization is represented as a group of 'freedom fighters', such as the multi-national mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s, then military cooperation is conceivable with that organization; if on the other hand the same organization is represented as a 'terrorist network', such as Al-Qaida, then military cooperation as a policy is simply not an option. In sum. the way in which one sees, interprets and imagines the 'other* delineates the course of action one will adopt in order to deal with this 'other'.</strong><br />

Our alternative solves case better - by de-securitizing we can solve political issues while avoiding the baggage of their representations - It’s not a question of military deployment but the method for such withdrawal.<br />

<br />
<strong>Finally, the approach I have proposed above points toward a study of the mechanisms leading to securitization of certain issues related to identity, especially when and how these problems are handled, by society , in security terms. Such an approach implies that we have to take seriously concerns about identity, but have also to study the specific and often problematic effects of their being framed as security issues. We also have to look at the possibilities of handling some of these problems in nonsecurity terms, that is, to take on the problems, but leave them unsecuritized. This latter approach recognizes that social processes are already under way whereby societies have begun to thematize themselves as security agents that are under threat. This process of social construction can be studied, and the security quality of the phenomenon understood, without thereby actually legitimizing it. With the &quot;as much security as possible&quot; approach, this is hard to handle: one will have either to denounce such issues as not being security phenomena (&quot;misperceptions&quot;), or one will be pulled into the process as co-securitizer.</strong><br />

Disregard their evidence the way they produce knowledge is flawed, they parrot the logic of security from the state disseminating violent capillaries of knowledge that are sustained by government subsidation.<br />

Since then he has published numerous books and articles. His most recent work has been towards the development of a critique of security. “CRITIQUE OF SECURITY” 2008. Pg. 182-184, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I have been arguing, then, that the ideology of security shaped a whole tranche of academic work within the social sciences, which then reinforced the very project being undertaken in the name of security, to the extent that dominant paradigms within the social sciences concerning development, modernisation, mass communication and political culture were in fact part and parcel of the paradigm of domination, as Simpson puts it. This is not to say that every scholar in these disciplines was some kind of political lackey – the US state’s role in Vietnam came under fire from some Southeast Asia specialists, its policy concerning Pakistan came under fire from some within South Asian studies, its role in Latin America came under fire from some of those working in Latin American studies, and the same can be said for its role in Middle East politics.133 My point, rather, is that most of the major and many of the minor concepts used within the disciplines I have been discussing were shaped by a political project that under its broadest label could be called the search for security. Far from being autonomous disciplines, never mind ones founded with a critical political edge, these disciplines were central to the ideological growth of the logic of security, part of the discursive economy built up to project the logic of security across the face of the globe. They became crucial capillaries for the dissemination and articulation of the meaning, production and spread of a certain kind of knowledge oriented around the idea of security, and their key thinkers became the ‘organic intellectuals’ of the security state, accepting, parroting and legitimising the official security policy of the hegemonic power, the political economy of security, and the logic of security as a whole. They were well equipped to serve in this way because their categories of analysis, particularly their conceptions of power, knowledge and order were no different from those found in the political rhetoric of the state itself. This was parallelled in shifts in other more established disciplines, which were encouraged to rethink their approaches and assumptions. In economics, game theory, linear programming and mathematical approaches came to dominate the field as the national security state made available large amounts of research funding to those willing to work in these areas, due to their focus on conflict and decision- making within the context of constrained maximums or minimums. The same is true of rational choice theory, which came to dominate political science.134 And anthropological research was also reshaped in ways of interest to the national security state.135 But the security intellectuals were to find their real home in that newest of new disciplines: ‘security studies’. Security studies became a decisive field in western intellectual labour with the birth and growth of the security state. A whole profession devoted to ‘security’ quickly emerged, initially as a subdiscipline of International Relations (with its own supine relation to the state)136 and gradually in its own right in the university – and now in the twenty-first century the growth discipline par excellence. Security studies, like its sister discipline strategic studies, emerged as part of the discursive economy built up around a politics driven by the logic of security and dominated by the concerns of the hegemonic powers. Existing from its birth as far as could be imagined from the idea of critique, security studies easily adopted some of the key categories of imperial confrontation, especially those which over-lapped with international and area studies, such as ‘deterrence’. ‘Most academics in national security studies were concerned with various issues of deterrence broadly conceived’, reports Deborah Welch Larson, ‘such as the development of strategies to deter Soviet aggression’.137 As such it became an important factor in the dissemination and articulation of security concerns on the part of such powers, not least because its central categories and key conceptions of power, subjectivity and knowledge were no different from those of the rhetoric of hegemonic powers themselves. In its fetish for security and the state, and the geopolitical project being carried out in their name, security studies quickly came to act as a ‘celebratory’ enterprise, valorising liberal values, institutions and political economy and entrenched in a defence of a distinct historical and cultural achievement, sometimes known as ‘the West’ but better understood as capitalist modernity.138 Its central presumption, that the state provides the legitimate framework for negotiating the insecurities of the modern world and capital the basis for this negotiation, makes less sense than it ever did. Anyone well versed in history or with experience of university life will know about the shameful ways in which large numbers of academics have elevated venality into the cardinal academic virtue, complying with the demands of those in power and the wishes of those with money: witness the political scientists, historians, anthro- pologists, geographers, cartographers, sociologists, linguists and many others who reworked their disciplines according to the principles and myths, and the principle myths, of fascism.139 ‘Academic life under fascism’, notes Christopher Hutton, ‘is a dismal . . . episode in an unedifying story of relations between the modern academic and the state, and between academics and power both within and outside the university’.140 But this part of the history of fascism is merely the worst moment in the wider and equally unedifying story of relations between academics and the state more generally, merely one way in which intellectuals have kowtowed to the principles and myths, and the principle myths, concerning security and the state. Spouting the jargon of security and enthralled by the trappings of power, their intellectual labour consists of nothing less than attempts to write hand- books for the princes of the new security state. The death of countless numbers in a more ‘efficient’ bombing of a city, the stationing of troops halfway around the world in order to bring to an end any attempt at collective self-determination, the use of military machines against civilians, the training of police forces in counter-insurgency practices, but more than anything the key concepts and categories used to explain and justify these things – all defended, supported and even ‘improved’ by security intellectuals for whom, ultimately, intellectual labour boils down to little more than the question of the most efficient manner in which to achieve the security demanded by the state and bourgeois order. In rationalising the political and corporate logic of security, the security intellectual conceals the utter irrationality of the system as a whole. The security intellectual, then, is nothing less than the security ideologue, peddling the fetish of our time.</strong><br />

Political reality only comes into being after we describe the world. Thus we have to deal with how the Affirmative represents the world before we can move on to any other question<br />
Blieker <strong>20</strong>00 <strong>(Roland, Professor of IR at University of Queensland, “Contending Images of World Politics”, p. 227-228, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>While the conceptual contours of the postmodern will always remain elusive, the substantial issues that this image of world politics has brought to the forefront have clear and important implications. Critical engagements with modernity have emerged from a dissatisfaction with what Lyotard famously described as a long modern tendency to ground and legitimize knowledge in reference to a grand narrative, that is, a universalizing framework which seeks to emancipate the individual by mastering the conditions of life (Lyotard, 1979, pp. 7-9). Even when such a master narrative seems unquestionably desirable, it inevitably legitimizes and objectivizes certain interpretations and political agendas, thereby excluding everything that does not fit into its corresponding view of life. Authors who are said to represent a postmodern image of the world politics grapple with the implications that emerge from the prevalence of master narratives in world politics. They challenge the way in which scientific discourses that have emerged from the Cartesian separation of the object and subject mask the constituted dimensions of life. They engage prevalent thinking patterns so that we can see the world from more that one perspective, and that marginalized voices can be brought into the realm of dialogue. This search for epistemological tolerance and inclusion is as much political as it is philosophical. And its practical applicability is – needless to say – virtually unlimited. It is in this sense that, for instance, all feminisms can be thought of as a postmodern’ (Sylvester, 1994, p. 16). The purpose of this essay is not to summarize the great variety of postmodern approaches to the world politics. Several authors have already done so (see for instance, Brown, 1994; Devetak, 1996). The main effort of this essay thus revolves around demonstrating how something termed postmodernism may work. From such a perspective the ‘how’ is as important as the ‘is’. In fact, the ‘how’ becomes the ‘is’ insofar as the nature of something is identified primarily as the process through which it works. The prime task of such an approach consists not of looking at modernity or postmodernity as metaphors of contemporary world politics, but of understanding – and acting upon – the more fundamental recognition that all forms of thought are metaphorical in nature. They cannot be anything else, for language itself is a series of metaphors through which we make sense of the world that surrounds us. And since we need language not only to communicate, but also to form our opinions of social phenomena, we inevitably think, live and politicize through a series of metaphors – that is, through forms of conceptualizing that contain inevitable gaps between a representation of an event and the event itself. Various implications follow from an approach that acknowledges the metaphorical nature of our understanding of world politics. At the beginning is perhaps the simple recognition that representation is an essential aspect of the political process. Political reality, F.R. Ankersmit stresses, ‘is’ not first given to us and subsequently represented; political reality only comes into being after and due to representations’ (1996, pg. 47). What this means for an analysis of world politics is that before being able to move to any other question, one has to deal with how the representation has structured the object it seeks to represent.</strong><br />

Pretending to be a policymaker absolves you of individual responsibility for the war which turns case and answers cede the political.<br />
Kappeler <strong>19</strong>95 <strong>(Susanne, Associate Professor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Al Akhawayn University, “The Will to Violence”, p. 10-11, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>We are the war' does not mean that the responsibility for a war is shared collectively and diffusely by an entire society which would be equivalent to exonerating warlords and politicians and profiteers or, as Ulrich Beck says, upholding the notion of `collective irresponsibility', where people are no longer held responsible for their actions, and where the conception of universal responsibility becomes the equival ent of a universal acquittal.' On the contrary, the object is precisely to analyse the specific and differential responsibility of everyone in their diverse situations. Decisions to unleash a war are indeed taken at particular levels of power by those in a position to make them and to command such collective action. We need to hold them clearly responsible for their decisions and actions without lessening theirs by any collective `assumption' of responsibility. Yet our habit of focusing on the stage where the major dramas of power take place tends to obscure our sight in relation to our own sphere of competence, our own power and our own responsibility leading to the well-known illusion of our apparent `powerlessness’ and its accompanying phe nomenon, our so-called political disillusionment. Single citizens even more so those of other nations have come to feel secure in their obvious non-responsibility for such large-scale political events as, say, the wars in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina or Somalia since the decisions for such events are always made elsewhere. Yet our insight that indeed we are not responsible for the decisions of a Serbian general or a Croatian president tends to mislead us into thinking that therefore we have no responsibility at all, not even for forming our own judgement, and thus into underrating the responsibility we do have within our own sphere of action. In particular, it seems to absolve us from having to try to see any relation between our own actions and those events, or to recognize the connections between those political decisions and our own personal decisions. It not only shows that we participate in what Beck calls `organized irresponsibility', upholding the apparent lack of connection between bureaucratically, institutionally, nationally and also individually or ganized separate competences. It also proves the phenomenal and unquestioned alliance of our personal thinking with the thinking of the major powermongers: For we tend to think that we cannot `do' anything, say, about a war, because we deem ourselves to be in the wrong situation; because we are not where the major decisions are made. Which is why many of those not yet entirely disillusioned with politics tend to engage in a form of mental deputy politics, in the style of `What would I do if I were the general, the prime minister, the president, the foreign minister or the minister of defence?' Since we seem to regard their mega spheres of action as the only worthwhile and truly effective ones, and since our political analyses tend to dwell there first of all, any question of what I would do if I were indeed myself tends to peter out in the comparative insignificance of having what is perceived as `virtually no possibilities': what I could do seems petty and futile. For my own action I obviously desire the range of action of a general, a prime minister, or a General Secretary of the UN finding expression in ever more prevalent formulations like `I want to stop this war', `I want military intervention', `I want to stop this backlash', or `I want a moral revolution.&quot; 'We are this war', however, even if we do not command the troops or participate in so-called peace talks, namely as Drakulic says, in our `non-comprehension’: our willed refusal to feel responsible for our own thinking and for working out our own understanding, preferring innocently to drift along the ideological current of prefabricated arguments or less than innocently taking advantage of the advantages these offer. And we `are' the war in our `unconscious cruelty towards you', our tolerance of the `fact that you have a yellow form for refugees and I don't' our readiness, in other words, to build ident ities, one for ourselves and one for refugees, one of our own and one for the `others'. We share in the responsibility for this war and its violence in the way we let them grow inside us, that is, in the way we shape `our feelings, our relationships, our values' according to the structures and the values of war and violence. “destining” of revealing insofar as it “pushes” us in a certain direction. Heidegger does not regard destining as determination (he says it is not a “fate which compels”), but rather as the implicit project within the field of modern practices to subject all aspects of reality to the principles of order and efficiency, and to pursue reality down to the finest detail. Thus, insofar as modern technology aims to order and render calculable, the objectification of reality tends to take the form of an increasing classification, differentiation, and fragmentation of reality. The possibilities for how things appear are increasingly reduced to those that enhance calculative activities. Heidegger perceives the real danger in the modern age to be that human beings will continue to regard technology as a mere instrument and fail to inquire into its essence. He fears that all revealing will become calculative and all relations technical, that the unthought horizon of revealing, namely the “concealed” background practices that make technological thinking possible, will be forgotten. He remarks: The coming to presence of technology threatens revealing, threatens it with the possibility that all revealing will be consumed in ordering and that everything will present itself only in the unconcealedness of standing-reserve.

<br />
<strong>One of the deadliest practices we engage in is that of identifying ourselves with a collective entity. Whether it be the state, a nationality, our race or gender, or any other abstraction, we introduce division – hence, conflict – into our lives as we separate ourselves from those who identify with other groupings. If one observes the state of our world today, this is the pattern that underlies our deadly and destructive social behavior. This mindset was no better articulated than when George W. Bush declared “you’re either with us, or against us.” Through years of careful conditioning, we learn to think of ourselves in terms of agencies and/or abstractions external to our independent being. Or, to express the point more clearly, we have learned to internalize these external forces; to conform our thinking and behavior to the purposes and interests of such entities. We adorn ourselves with flags, mouth shibboleths, and decorate our cars with bumper-stickers, in order to communicate to others our sense of “who we are.” In such ways does our being become indistinguishable from our chosen collective. In this way are institutions born. We discover a particular form of organization through which we are able to cooperate with others for our mutual benefit. Over time, the advantages derived from this system have a sufficient consistency to lead us to the conclusion that our well-being is dependent upon it. Those who manage the organization find it in their self-interests to propagate this belief so that we will become dependent upon its permanency. Like a sculptor working with clay, institutions take over the direction of our minds, twisting, squeezing, and pounding upon them until we have embraced a mindset conducive to their interests. Once this has been accomplished, we find it easy to subvert our will and sense of purpose to the collective. The organization ceases being a mere tool of mutual convenience, and becomes an end in itself. Our lives become “institutionalized,” and we regard it as fanciful to imagine ourselves living in any other way than as constituent parts of a machine that transcends our individual sense. Once we identify ourselves with the state, that collective entity does more than represent who we are; it is who we are. To the politicized mind, the idea that “we are the government” has real meaning, not in the sense of being able to control such an agency, but in the psychological sense. The successes and failures of the state become the subject’s successes and failures; insults or other attacks upon their abstract sense of being – such as the burning of “their” flag – become assaults upon their very personhood. Shortcomings on the part of the state become our failures of character. This is why so many Americans who have belatedly come to criticize the war against Iraq are inclined to treat it as only a “mistake” or the product of “mismanagement,” not as a moral wrong. Our egos can more easily admit to the making of a mistake than to moral transgressions. Such an attitude also helps to explain why, as Milton Mayer wrote in his revealing post-World War II book, <span class="s2"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amazon.com/They-Thought-Were-Free-Germans/dp/0226511928/lewrockwell/" rel="nofollow">They Thought They Were Free</a></span>, most Germans were unable to admit that the Nazi regime had been tyrannical. It is this dynamic that makes it easy for political officials to generate wars, a process that reinforces the sense of identity and attachment people have for “their” state. It also helps to explain why most Americans – though tiring of the war against Iraq – refuse to condemn government leaders for the lies, forgeries, and deceit employed to get the war started: to acknowledge the dishonesty of the system through which they identify themselves is to admit to the dishonest base of their being. The truthfulness of the state’s rationale for war is irrelevant to most of its subjects. It is sufficient that they believe the abstraction with which their lives are intertwined will be benefited in some way by war. Against whom and upon what claim does not matter – except as a factor in assessing the likelihood of success. That most Americans have pipped nary a squeak of protest over Bush administration plans to attack Iran – with nuclear weapons if deemed useful to its ends – reflects the point I am making. Bush could undertake a full-fledged war against Lapland, and most Americans would trot out their flags and bumper-stickers of approval. The “rightness” or “wrongness” of any form of collective behavior becomes interpreted by the standard of whose actions are being considered. During World War II, for example, Japanese kamikaze pilots were regarded as crazed fanatics for crashing their planes into American battleships. At the same time, American war movies (see, e.g., <span class="s2"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amazon.com/Flying-Tigers-John-Wayne/dp/0782011276/lewrockwell/" rel="nofollow">Flying Tigers</a></span>) extolled the heroism of American pilots who did the same thing. One sees this same double-standard in responding to “conspiracy theories.” “Do you think a conspiracy was behind the 9/11 attacks?” It certainly seems so to me, unless one is prepared to treat the disappearance of the World Trade Center buildings as the consequence of a couple pilots having bad navigational experiences! The question that should be asked is: whose conspiracy was it? To those whose identities coincide with the state, such a question is easily answered: others conspire, we do not. It is not the symbiotic relationship between war and the expansion of state power, nor the realization of corporate benefits that could not be obtained in a free market, that mobilize the machinery of war. Without most of us standing behind “our” system, and cheering on “our” troops, and defending “our” leaders, none of this would be possible. What would be your likely response if your neighbor prevailed upon you to join him in a violent attack upon a local convenience store, on the grounds that it hired “illegal aliens?” Your sense of identity would not be implicated in his efforts, and you would likely dismiss him as a lunatic. Only when our ego-identities become wrapped up with some institutional abstraction – such as the state – can we be persuaded to invest our lives and the lives of our children in the collective madness of state action. We do not have such attitudes toward organizations with which we have more transitory relationships. If we find an accounting error in our bank statement, we would not find satisfaction in the proposition “the First National Bank, right or wrong.” Neither would we be inclined to wear a T-shirt that read “Disneyland: love it or leave it.” One of the many adverse consequences of identifying with and attaching ourselves to collective abstractions is our loss of control over not only the meaning and direction in our lives, but of the manner in which we can be efficacious in our efforts to pursue the purposes that have become central to us. We become dependent upon the performance of “our” group; “our” reputation rises or falls on the basis of what institutional leaders do or fail to do. If “our” nation-state loses respect in the world – such as by the use of torture or killing innocent people - we consider ourselves no longer respectable, and scurry to find plausible excuses to redeem our egos. When these expectations are not met, we go in search of new leaders or organizational reforms we believe will restore our sense of purpose and pride that we have allowed abstract entities to personify for us. As the costs and failures of the state become increasingly evident, there is a growing tendency to blame this system. But to do so is to continue playing the same game into which we have allowed ourselves to become conditioned. One of the practices employed by the state to get us to mobilize our “dark side” energies in opposition to the endless recycling of enemies it has chosen for us, is that of psychological projection. Whether we care to acknowledge it or not – and most of us do not – each of us has an unconscious capacity for attitudes or conduct that our conscious minds reject. We fear that, sufficiently provoked, we might engage in violence – even deadly – against others; or that inducements might cause us to become dishonest. We might harbor racist or other bigoted sentiments, or consider ourselves lazy or irresponsible. Though we are unlikely to act upon such inner fears, their presence within us can generate discomforting self-directed feelings of guilt, anger, or unworthiness that we would like to eliminate. The most common way in which humanity has tried to bring about such an exorcism is by subconsciously projecting these traits onto others (i.e., “scapegoats”) and punishing them for what are really our own shortcomings. The state has trained us to behave this way, in order that we may be counted upon to invest our lives, resources, and other energies in pursuit of the enemy du jour. It is somewhat ironic, therefore, that most of us resort to the same practice in our criticism of political systems. After years of mouthing the high-school civics class mantra about the necessity for government – and the bigger the government the better – we begin to experience the unexpected consequences of politicization. Tax burdens continue to escalate; or the state takes our home to make way for a proposed shopping center; or ever-more details of our lives are micromanaged by ever-burgeoning state bureaucracies. Having grown weary of the costs – including the loss of control over our lives – we blame the state for what has befallen us. We condemn the Bush administration for the parade of lies that precipitated the war against Iraq, rather than indicting ourselves for ever believing anything the state tells us. We fault the politicians for the skyrocketing costs of governmental programs, conveniently ignoring our insistence upon this or that benefit whose costs we would prefer having others pay. The statists have helped us accept a world view that conflates our incompetence to manage our own lives with their omniscience to manage the lives of billions of people – along with the planet upon which we live! – and we are now experiencing the costs generated by our own gullibility. We have acted like country bumpkins at the state fair with the egg money who, having been fleeced by a bunch of carnival sharpies, look everywhere for someone to blame other than ourselves. We have been euchred out of our very lives because of our eagerness to believe that benefits can be enjoyed without incurring costs; that the freedom to control one’s life can be separated from the responsibilities for one’s actions; and that two plus two does not have to add up to four if a sizeable public opinion can be amassed against the proposition. By identifying ourselves with any abstraction (such as the state) we give up the integrated life, the sense of wholeness that can be found only within each of us. While the state has manipulated, cajoled, and threatened us to identify ourselves with it, the responsibility for our acceding to its pressures lies within each of us. The statists have – as was their vicious purpose – simply taken over the territory we have abandoned. Our politico-centric pain and suffering has been brought about by our having allowed external forces to move in and occupy the vacuum we created at the center of our being. The only way out of our dilemma involves a retracing of the route that brought us to where we are. We require nothing so much right now as the development of a sense of “who we are” that transcends our institutionalized identities, and returns us – without division and conflict – to a centered, self-directed integrity in our lives.</strong><br />

Political rhetoric comes first and creates political reality framing our understanding - star this card.<br />
Hinds &amp; Windt Jr . <strong>19</strong>91 <strong>(Lynn Boyd, is Associate Professor of Broadcasting at West Virginia University. and Theodore Otto, Professor of Political Rhetoric at the University of Pittsburgh. “The Cold War As Rhetoric: The Beginnings, 1945–1950,” 1991, 6-10, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The primary materials for this examination are the central rhetorical texts that formulated the American cold war consensus in the United States. Our concern is with what Professor Richard Cottam of the University of Pittsburgh has called the &quot;generic moment,&quot; a time when</strong><br />
<strong>perception and rhetoric come together to produce policy, and in the case of the cold war, to produce a universal doctrine. Our theme is taken from Walter Lippmann. In Public Opinion,he wrote: For the most part we do not first see, and then define, we define first and then see. In the great blooming, buzzing confusion of the outer world we pick out what our culture has already defined for us, and we tend to perceive that which we have picked out in the form stereotyped for us by our culture.<span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">14</a></span> If one were to add &quot;political leaders&quot; to &quot;culture,&quot; one would have the orientation to what follows in this book. Definitions require language both to conceive of reality and to express it, and the kind of language people use then shapes the ways in which they see the world. Choosing one set of words to define reality rather than another not only orients people, it also creates a grammar that structures reality and then expands into a rhetoric that justifies that reality. Our thesis is that political rhetoric creates political reality, and in the case of the American cold war, the universal rhetoric created in the aftermath of World War II created a universal reality. Words and arguments chosen to justify policies took on lives of their own which eventually meant -- especially in the late 1940s and in the 1950s -- that perceptions, opinions, attitudes, policies, and even the way people lived, had to be adjusted more or less (and usually more) to be consistent with this universal rhetoric. No more eloquent example of rhetoric taking on its own life can be found than in the history of George F. Kennan's famous article, &quot;The Sources of Soviet Conduct.&quot; Originally written as a private memorandum for James V. Forrestal and based on his private &quot;long telegram,&quot; Kennan's article, when published in Foreign Affairs, became the living doctrine of containment. Kennan recorded in his Memoirs that he watched with great anguish as his term containment &quot;was picked up and elevated, by common agreement of the press, to the status of a 'doctrine', which was then identified with the foreign policy of the administration.&quot; <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">15</a></span> He went on to note that he felt &quot;like one who has inadvertently loosened a large boulder from the top of a cliff and now helplessly witnesses its path of destruction in the valley below, shuddering and wincing at each successive glimpse of disaster.&quot; <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">16</a></span> Such was the vitality of Kennan's language and rhetoric. And so too were the vitality and life of Churchill's &quot;Iron Curtain,&quot; Truman's Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and a variety of other rhetorical acts that when taken together comprise the American version of the cold war reality. METHODS OF ANALYSIS Political rhetoric creates the arena of political reality from which political thought and action proceed. Such a statement has become commonplace. <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">17</a></span> Political language and arguments -- in sum, political rhetoric -- create political consciousness, define political settings, create national identity, stimulate people to act, and give sense and purpose to these actions. <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">18</a></span> Political reality is a persuasive description of &quot;things as they are,&quot; and once situations are so described, certain responses are eliminated and others seem right. Decisions are discussed and debated within the rhetorical description, ever with an eye toward action. Every society has a need to make sense of things, of its identity as a people or a nation and of the world it inhabits. Government leaders need to provide rationales for their decisions in order to govern. Leaders must convince the public &quot;that the government's decisions are legitimate and good and that its foreign policy is correct.&quot; <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">19</a></span> Politics is about power, and political power functions within the context of a perceived political reality. Citizens, likewise, need to make sense of things. Without a sense of political reality, the &quot;way things are,&quot; the individual is helpless to understand the myriad of facts and opinions that one is bombarded with daily, especially the things that are far-off and cannot be experienced directly. This need to make sense of the political world evokes a constant outpouring of rhetoric, not only by political leaders but by opinion leaders from all strata of society. In speeches, newspaper editorials, magazine articles, and the like people make rhetorical efforts to argue and describe the &quot;way things are,&quot; in short, to understand political reality. Such efforts become intensive and extensive when an old order of political reality changes, as when World War II ended, and a new order is needed to make sense out of the confusion that accompanies the fall of the old. For political rhetoric to function in this fashion, three essential conditions must exist: (1) a &quot;raw&quot; event and/or events or its corollary, confusion about events; (2) a rhetoric that clarifies and assigns meanings to these events; (3) publicity for the rhetoric as others share it at the time. All three of these came together to produce the cold war. But a study of political rhetoric as political reality is more than that. If we &quot;define and then see,&quot; such a concept applies both to decisionmakers as well as the general public. The language people use becomes a part of what they see because people cannot have definitions without language. In many respects, we are prepared to see what our language has prepared us to see. We account for the rhetoric used in relation to any event in great part through the preconceptions on which it is based. To a substantial degree the rhetoric that accompanies any event comes from an a priori rhetoric, based on values that have come to be regarded as basic beliefs, on a preexisting language that is always present exerting its influence in shaping our consciousness, on previous interpretations of past events that may or may not be similar to current events. In such ways are we both liberated and imprisoned by language. Government officials and others do not construct a language or a rhetoric out of thin air; they inherit it from the past and modify or adapt it to meet current or future concerns. Robert Funk observed, &quot;Language does not merely stand at our beck and call; it is there before we are, it situates us, it restricts our horizon, it refuses us its total complicity.&quot; <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">20</a></span> Even as the language politicians use can be dynamic and changing, it also is dependent on rhetorical traditions created previously. The rhetoric of the cold war grew in large part out of preexisting rhetorics as diverse as Churchill's long-standing antibolshevism and the war language of World War II, to name only a few. This analysis demonstrates that the events that contributed to the cold war after 1945 had a rhetorical climate that preceded them as well as a rhetorical interpretation that accompanied them. The latter grew out of the former, took a particular direction, and molded the meaning of events to the extent that they created an all-pervasive political reality that not only &quot;explained&quot; events but became landmark events in and of themselves, ordering and interpreting future events as they occurred. Two important points need to be made. First, in the world of practical politics a political rhetoric is often constructed quickly and on an ad hoc basis. George Elsey, a member of President Truman's staff, stated the case for politicians succinctly: &quot;You don't sit down and take time to think through and debate ad nauseam all the points [about an issue]. . . . You don't have time. Later somebody can sit around for days and weeks and figure out how things might have been done differently. This is all very well and very interesting but quite irrelevant.&quot; <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">21</a></span> One must add that it is only irrelevant for those who believe that whatever action is taken and whatever rhetoric constructed to justify that action constituted the most prudent action and rhetoric. For the critic reexamination is always required because language has consequences, often creating the first conception of a political reality of an event and then creating a lasting meaning of that event. Second, the creation of a rhetorical reality is a process, rarely a single event. In the rhetoric of the cold war the reality grew over a period of years before it took hold and became elevated to the level of sacred doctrine, an ideological doctrine whose fundamental principles few dared to challenge and to which almost all had to pay rhetorical respects even when they disagreed about how those principles applied to particular situations. The failures of the architects of the American cold war -- Truman, Acheson, and Kennan -- to restrict the political reality they had created provide compelling illustrations of the power of their own rhetoric. Before getting to the ways in which this rhetorical process worked to define the nature and scope of the cold war, we need to identify the elements that were crucial to its development. Names, Metaphors, and Definitions Thus far we have argued that language is an essential part of reality, not merely a tool to interpret events. Language itself is a creative act, not an added-on interpretation that comes from an act. It is the confluence of act and language that is the first step in creating reality, a &quot;raw&quot; event and the political meaning persuasively expressed that is attached to that event. Language and events cannot be easily separated once they become public currency. Again, we turn to Funk who noted: Language and understanding arise together, are reciprocal. The common [event or actuality] to which they refer both precedes and follows. It makes them possible, and yet the common reality does not become audible without language and understanding. Language and understanding both arise out of and invoke shared reality. <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">22</a></span> This process of uniting the two, we call a language-event, a unity of political language and actual events that creates political reality both in perception and in expression. For this analysis of the cold war reality, there are three important ways in which language created that reality: through naming, through metaphor, and through formal definitions. Kenneth Burke remarked that all language is &quot;magical&quot; or creative because &quot;the mere act of naming an object or situation decrees that it is to be singled out as such-and-such rather than as something-other.&quot; <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">23</a></span> In this understanding of language we are not merely saying something when we use language, we are doing something. When we name an object, it becomes real for us because naming &quot;does not mean inventing a convenient designation, but giving reality to the object, calling it into [meaningful] existence.&quot; <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">24</a></span> This conception of language has its roots in antiquity, and although it was once discarded by the modern scientific world as a mythical understanding of reality, its significance has been rediscovered by Burke and the postmodernists. The scientific conception of language came to be associated with its noetic function, that is, a word was thought of as a symbol that only conveys meaning, a tool separate from the thing it described. Louis Halle used this concept of language in describing the changes that American leaders had to make in foreign policy in the postwar period. He argued that the confusions of that period and Soviet expansionism required a new language to express the new &quot;realities&quot; of tensions in the world: What was required in the first instance, for the replacement of the projected foreign policy by a policy applicable to the developing circumstances, was a conscious recognition of the realities to which it would have to be applicable. The American Government and the American people . . . would then have to accept the need to re-establish a balance of power by filling the remaining power vacuums and thereby limiting the further expansion of the Russian empire. Such a conceptual change as this, while it might take place more rapidly in the subconscious mind, could hardly be explicitly formulated and adopted as such until after an interval of intellectual confusion and inner conflict, during which some persons would continue to adhere with a sort of blind desperation to the outdated concepts and their attendant language, while others would recognize the increasingly manifest realities without being able to find a coherent intellectual pattern or forms of words into which to fit them. <span class="s3"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/14289633" rel="nofollow">25</a></span>Clearly, Halle viewed language as a tool of expression, not as a creative rhetorical process. For Halle, the new cold war &quot;reality&quot; existed waiting only to be &quot;recognized.&quot; Once recognized, the task for U.S. leaders became an independent search for appropriate concepts and language to express that reality. In the older mythic realm, however, language and the comprehension of reality were more deeply fused. This latter conception of language guides our understanding about rhetoric's role in the political construction of reality.</strong><br />

Traditional representations of Afghanistan solidify a notion of Identity that de-contextualizes the subject and sustains imperial workings of power.<br />
Crowe <strong>20</strong>07 <strong>(L.A. Crowe, 2007, New York University. The “Fuzzy Dream”: Discourse, Historical myths, and Militarized (in)Security- Interrogating dangerous myths of Afghanistan and the ‘West’<span class="s2"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://archive.sgir.eu/uploads/Crowe-loricrowe.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://archive.sgir.eu/uploads/Crowe-loricrowe.pdf</a></span>, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The historical production of particular myths of Afghanistan have relied on representations of the country in the West that are largely simplistic, ahistorical, and politically motivated. Afghanistan is a sort of “fuzzy dream” for most in the West: embodied in a series of fabricated images of war and poverty, de-contextualized photos without names or places, numbers and graphs claiming statistical quantification, and disjointed yet often repeated phrases and metaphors. A particular mythic representation of Afghanistan is being (and has been) proliferated in the international community, through media, history books, foreign policy documents, political commentators, academia, and virtually any other body of communication. The vigor with which particular discourses have materialized since 9/11 are representative of their link to the Wests militarized ‘War on Terror’ and more generally of the embedded relationship between political policies and militarized discourses which legitimate the West’s military engagement and development policies. That is, Afghanistan serves as an unfortunate example of the very real power of discourse and myth-making which affect the form that international engagement takes; this in turn reproduces those myths in a cycle of destructive imperial engagement. In trying to understand the current political situation in Afghanistan, and in attempting to formulate international policy in the region, it is vital that we are aware of the dominant narratives or ‘myths’ that are being produced, who it is that is producing them and for what purpose, and what is at stake in failing to interrogate them. Any policy that does not take the role of deliberately constructed narratives and the mediums through which they are disseminated into account will not only continue to replicate them, perhaps unknowingly, but any “securitizing”, “peacebuilding” and “development” efforts built on these terms can never result in long-term success. The emancipatory possibilities of such a critical project of discourse deconstruction lie in: 1) understanding the raced/classed/gendered power hierarchies that are their foundation; 2) uncovering the nationalized militarization and the hypermasculinized and hyperfeminized normativities that are are embedded within these myths, and; 3) the recognition of the detrimental effect of the West’s ‘myths’ and configuring the reconceptualisation of policy alternatives through its contestation. By looking critically at what has become the common language of foreign engagement in Afghanistan, the foundation of historical narratives or ‘myths’ that perpetuate a certain image of Afghanistan, and which in turn results in very particular attitudes that imbue foreign policy, begin to be revealed. I will utilize two broad (and inextricably linked) categorizations which most accurately encapsulate the dominant strains of discourse to help clarify how this relationship is constructed and by thus identifying them as such attempt to de-bunk the myths they create. These ‘myths’ which have become normalized and banal in foreign policy, media, and some academic discourse I define as the ‘heroism’ discourse/myth and the ‘militarization’ discourse/myth.</strong><br />

<br />
Counterterrorism causes a self fulfilling prophecy that ends in the promotion of terrorism because it limits itself to flawed epistemological approaches that ignore culture, the unconscious and other drives.<br />
Zulaika <strong>20</strong>09 <strong>(Joesba, Professor, at the Center for Basque Studies. Ph.D., Anthropology, from Princeton University, has written widely on the issue of Terrorism and culture. “Terrorism: The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy” 2009, p. 1-3, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Counterterrorism has become self-fulfilling and it is now pivotal in promoting terrorism. This book is an attempt to prove it. There is now near consensus, on both the Left and the Right, that the war in Iraq has been a catastrophe and that the War on Terror has made the United States far less secure than before. Yet we barely understand the thinking that, with the generalized approval of the public, led us to this situation. Why the sense of missed opportunities and failure of George W. Bush’s presidency? A response requires understanding the role of counterterrorism in designing public policy. In order to think and write terrorism without thereby further constituting it, the preliminary task at hand is conceptual: What are the impasses and blind spots in counterterrorist thinking that led us to the self-fulfilling nature of the War on Terror? The first part of the book is devoted to the ways in which discourse creates and perpetuates the very thing it abominates. It repeats the call in my book Terror and Taboo (coauthored with William Douglass) for an exorcism against such culture—“Terrorism discourse must be disenchanted if it is to lose its efficacy for all concerned,”1 terrorists and counterterrorists alike. I fully agree with Richard Jackson’s conclusion that “resisting the discourse is not an act of disloyalty; it is an act of political self-determination; and it is absolutely necessary if we are to avoid another stupefying period of fear and violence like the cold war.”2 There is little doubt by now that terrorism discourse creates its own reality. My arguments here go beyond discourse analysis. Terrorism is premised on the will of insurgents, rebels, fighters, terrorists. Terrorism studies are about tactics, financial networks, organizational structures, ideologies, psychological types—the observable expressions of the terrorist agenda. But first we must reckon with the terrorist as an individual subject. We are baffled by his or her seeming madness, the horrific freedom of his amor fati, the willing acceptance of death and killing as one’s mission, the embrace of a truth that can only be expressed in the form of terroristic massacre. And it is a madness that is all the more disconcerting because we know it is strategically willed and aimed directly at us for reasons that we cannot clearly see nor accept. These issues cannot be properly addressed without the awareness that the terrorist subject is deeply engaged in the politics of the unconscious, including the Freudian “death drive” expressed in willfully embracing suicide. Counterterrorism’s ignorance of the languages, cultures, and histories of the people it purports to monitor is proverbial. The crisis of knowledge begins with the quality of the intelligence when the analysts are not able to look into their own ideological investments. What is one to make of the fact that scores of people in the intelligence community had known for months that two of the people who were going to take part in 9/11 were living in the United States, yet nothing was done about it? According to the findings of the 9/11 Commission (officially, the National Commission on Terrorists Attacks upon the United States), “evidence gathered by the panel showed that the attacks could probably have been prevented.”3 Why such blindness? What needs to be established is that the system had sufficient evidence to know about the upcoming plot yet it preferred not to know that it knew. These are problems that derive directly from a faulty epistemology—beginning with the placement of the entire phenomenon in a context of taboo and the willful ignorance of the political subjectivities of the terrorists. They have to do with what counts as a standard of evidence, what is valuable information, what type of experience should be respected, what sort of associative logic links together various kinds of events, and other various contexts and mind-sets. One only has to compare Paul Bremer’s and David Petraeus’s policies in Iraq to become aware of the disastrous self-generating logic of counterterrorism. The counterterrorist Bremer acted as if anything touched by Saddam Hussein was contaminated with evil and drove tens of thousands of former soldiers and officers into the insurgency; the military man Petraeus studied the culture and ended up negotiating with and partially dissolving the enemy. The counterterrorist is typically like the proverbial dumb policeman who, by ignoring the actor’s subjectivity in its complex interaction of cultural background, social motivation, and unconscious desire, is unable to read the evidence in front of his eyes while taking seriously “evidence” deliberately planted by the criminal to fool him. What is required is to make the sweeping change from the policeman’s to the detective’s mind frame. We went to war against Hussein because we did not figure out that he was bluffing. What kind of writing can do justice to the terrorists’ suicidal madness? Since at least the Old Testament, writers have dealt with murder; far from utterly alien human beings, murderers have been depicted by writers as all-too-human members of ordinary communities; at times heroicized, at other times their actions are deplored as tragic, they are always the objects of intense curiosity and study. Before he wrote his “nonfiction novel” In Cold Blood, Truman Capote spent hundreds of hours with the multiple murderers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. They became for him anything but tabooed people. In fact, he projected himself into Perry’s life and concluded that he was too much like himself. The final result is that Capote knew his murderers thoroughly and intimately — they could not lie to him, nor would he underestimate their human potential. Counterterrorism thinking precludes in principle the subjective knowledge of a Truman Capote or a detective or an ethnographer. Hence, I argue in this book, the categorical blunders and the systemic blindness.</strong><br />

Focusing on the privatization of security and returning the gift of security to the state only reproduces this logic a critique of security is necessary to overthrow the whole system.<br />
<u>Neocleous</u> <strong>20</strong><u>08</u> <strong>(Mark is a Professor of the Critique of Political Economy; Head of Department of Politics &amp; History, he joined Brunel University in the Department of Government in 1994. Since then he has published numerous books and articles. His most recent work has been towards the development of a critique of security. “CRITIQUE OF SECURITY” 2008. Pg. 159-160, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Moreover, to think of these issues in terms of the idea of ‘privatisation’ runs the risk of implying that we need to resist such privatisation and ‘return’ security to its supposedly ‘natural’ home and guardian, namely the state. But this is a serious mistake. Rather than ‘return’ security to the state, we need to resist the security fetish per se, for it is partly this that blinds us to the ways in which we might intervene against the forms of domination and exploitation that take place under the label of security. This is what cannot be grasped in thinking about security in terms of its ‘privatisation’, but can be grasped in terms of the critique of security. If the movement against capital is a movement against fetishism, as it must be, then it must set as one of its targets the current fetishism surrounding security. In so doing it must aim at the combined overthrow of the security industry and the security state. Such an overthrow, central to the critique of security, will, however, also have to tackle the extent to which the ideology of security has dominated modern thought, most notably in the key institution of intellectual labour, the university.</strong><br />

 <br />
The United States attempts to define itself as the indispensable nation through achieving an impossible absolute security which defines uncertainty and instability as ‘threats’ that must be combatted against - however this construction is essential to the construction of a dichotomous identity of us and them than causes a self-fulfilling prophecy because it causes an internalization of the label instability.<br />
<u>Pan</u> <strong>20</strong><u>04</u> <strong>(Chengxin, Professor of Political Science at Australia National University, “China Threat In American Self-Imagination” Alternatives Volume 29, number 3, p. 305-331, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The (neo)realist emphasis on survival and security in international relations dovetails perfectly with the U.S. self-imagination, because for the United States to define itself as the indispensable nation in a world of anarchy is often to demand absolute security. As James Chace and Caleb Carr note, &quot;for over two centuries the aspiration toward an eventual condition of absolute security has been viewed as central to an effective American foreign policy.&quot; (50) And this self-identification in turn leads to the definition of not only &quot;tangible&quot; foreign powers but global contingency and uncertainty per se as threats. For example, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush repeatedly said that &quot;the enemy [of America] is unpredictability. The enemy is instability.&quot; (51) Similarly, arguing for the continuation of U.S. Cold War alliances, a high-ranking Pentagon official asked, &quot;if we pull out, who knows what nervousness will result?&quot; (52) Thus understood, by its very uncertain character, China would now automatically constitute a threat to the United States. For example, Bernstein and Munro believe that &quot;China's political unpredictability, the always-present possibility that it will fall into a state of domestic disunion and factional fighting,&quot; constitutes a source of danger. (53) In like manner, Richard Betts and Thomas Christensen write: If the PLA [People's Liberation Army] remains second-rate, should the world breathe a sigh of relief? Not entirely.... Drawing China into the web of global interdependence may do more to encourage peace than war, but it cannot guarantee that the pursuit of heartfelt political interests will be blocked by a fear of economic consequences.... U.S. efforts to create a stable balance across the Taiwan Strait might deter the use of force under certain circumstances, but certainly not all. (54) The upshot, therefore, is that since China displays no absolute certainty for peace, it must be, by definition, an uncertainty, and hence, a threat. In the same way, a multitude of other unpredictable factors (such as ethnic rivalry, local insurgencies, overpopulation, drug trafficking, environmental degradation, rogue states, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and international terrorism) have also been labeled as &quot;threats&quot; to U.S. security. Yet, it seems that in the post-Cold War environment, China represents a kind of uncertainty par excellence. &quot;Whatever the prospects for a more peaceful, more democratic, and more just world order, nothing seems more uncertain today than the future of post-Deng China,&quot; (55) argues Samuel Kim. And such an archetypical uncertainty is crucial to the enterprise of U.S. self-construction, because it seems that only an uncertainty with potentially global consequences such as China could justify U.S. indispensability or its continued world dominance. In this sense, Bruce Cumings aptly suggested in 1996 that China (as a threat) was basically &quot;a metaphor for an enormously expensive Pentagon that has lost its bearings and that requires a formidable 'renegade state' to define its mission (Islam is rather vague, and Iran lacks necessary weights).&quot; (56) It is mainly on the basis of this self-fashioning that many U.S. scholars have for long claimed their &quot;expertise&quot; on China. For example, from his observation (presumably on Western TV networks) of the Chinese protest against the U.S. bombing of their embassy in Belgrade in May 1999, Robert Kagan is confident enough to speak on behalf of the whole Chinese people, claiming that he knows &quot;the fact&quot; of &quot;what [China] really thinks about the United States.&quot; That is, &quot;they consider the United States an enemy--or, more precisely, the enemy.... How else can one interpret the Chinese government's response to the bombing?&quot; he asks, rhetorically. (57) For Kagan, because the Chinese &quot;have no other information&quot; than their government's propaganda, the protesters cannot rationally &quot;know&quot; the whole event as &quot;we&quot; do. Thus, their anger must have been orchestrated, unreal, and hence need not be taken seriously. (58) Given that Kagan heads the U.S. Leadership Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and is very much at the heart of redefining the United States as the benevolent global hegemon, his confidence in speaking for the Chinese &quot;other&quot; is perhaps not surprising. In a similar vein, without producing in-depth analysis, Bernstein and Munro invoke with great ease such all-encompassing notions as &quot;the Chinese tradition&quot; and its &quot;entire three-thousand-year history.&quot; (59) In particular, they repeatedly speak of what China's &quot;real&quot; goal is: &quot;China is an unsatisfied and ambitious power whose goal is to dominate Asia.... China aims at achieving a kind of hegemony.... China is so big and so naturally powerful that [we know] it will tend to dominate its region even if it does not intend to do so as a matter of national policy.&quot; (60) Likewise, with the goal of absolute security for the United States in mind, Richard Betts and Thomas Christensen argue: The truth is that China can pose a grave problem even if it does not become a military power on the American model, does not intend to commit aggression, integrates into a global economy, and liberalizes politically. Similarly, the United States could face a dangerous conflict over Taiwan even if it turns out that Beijing lacks the capacity to conquer the island.... This is true because of geography; because of America's reliance on alliances to project power; and because of China's capacity to harm U.S. forces, U.S. regional allies, and the American homeland, even while losing a war in the technical, military sense. (61) By now, it seems clear that neither China's capabilities nor intentions really matter. Rather, almost by its mere geographical existence, China has been qualified as an absolute strategic &quot;other,&quot; a discursive construct from which it cannot escape. Because of this, &quot;China&quot; in U.S. IR discourse has been objectified and deprived of its own subjectivity and exists mainly in and for the U.S. self. Little wonder that for many U.S. China specialists, China becomes merely a &quot;national security concern&quot; for the United States, with the &quot;severe disproportion between the keen attention to China as a security concern and the intractable neglect of China's [own] security concerns in the current debate.&quot; (62) At this point, at issue here is no longer whether the &quot;China threat&quot; argument is true or false, but is rather its reflection of a shared positivist mentality among mainstream China experts that they know China better than do the Chinese themselves. (63) &quot;We&quot; alone can know for sure that they consider &quot;us&quot; their enemy and thus pose a menace to &quot;us.&quot; Such an account of China, in many ways, strongly seems to resemble Orientalists' problematic distinction between the West and the Orient. Like orientalism, the U.S. construction of the Chinese &quot;other&quot; does not require that China acknowledge the validity of that dichotomous construction. Indeed, as Edward Said point out, &quot;It is enough for 'us' to set up these distinctions in our own minds; [and] 'they' become 'they' accordingly.&quot; (64)</strong><br />

<strong>In the wake of 9/11 the Bush administration has called upon established foreign policy discourses to cement the idea of a nation at war.1 Given the amorphous and often virtual nature of the “war on terror,” in which the adversary is by definition largely unseen, the association of other resistant ele- ments with terrorism has become a mechanism for materializing the threat. Notorious in this regard was the Bush administration’s linking of internal and external threats by aligning individual drug use at home with support for ter- rorism abroad. In itself, this is not a new argument, with alleged links to ter- rorism having been featured in previous episodes of the country’s “war on drugs.”2 However, the Bush administration went one step further by making a causal connection between individual behavior and international danger. In 2002, the Office for National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) launched a campaign of hard-hitting advertisements in which the social choices of hedo- nistic youngsters were said to directly enrich and enable terrorists threatening the United States.3 Others at Home and Abroad Post-9/11 This argument, which was controversial, sought to discipline domestic behavior by linking it to external danger. One ironic response to the campaign, first made by columnist Arianna Huffington, was to argue that if funding terror- ism was the concern, then “soccer moms” driving sports utility vehicles (SUVs) were more easily linked to the problem through the increased revenues for Middle East oil producers their reliance on an uneconomical family vehicle generated. Huffington reported that two Hollywood producers had written spoof scripts for advertisements that parodied the ONDCP campaign. Link- ing individual consumer choice with the international threat of the moment, one of these scripts declared the SUVs parked in families’ driveways to be “the biggest weapons of mass destruction.”4 Huffington’s column generated considerable debate, and a new lobby group—the Detroit Project—was launched so the anti-SUV advertisements could be produced and broadcast as part of a campaign to link improved fuel efficiency with national security. Although most television stations refused to air the commercials (demonstrating a corporate fear of controversy), they gar- nered much attention, and came to highlight the cultural clash between SUV manufacturers and users and those concerned about the vehicles’ communal effects.5 This controversy raged in the months leading up to the U.S.–led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was part of a larger discourse about the relationship between oil and security. While the ONDCP campaign targeted the casual nar- cotic user, the Detroit Project advertisements in effect saw the United States as an addict whose oil habit could be satisfied only by an act of international crime. Both arguments sought to individualize responsibility by positing a tight causal connection between personal choice and political effect, thereby following in a long line of issues whose social and political context have been subsumed by the politics of individualization. While the Detroit Project advertisements simplified issues in a manner akin to the ONDCP campaign, in the context of the relationship between oil and security, they did raise difficult issues with respect to the relationship between the domestic and the foreign. While individual SUV owner-drivers cannot be said to directly endorse terrorism simply as a result of automotive choice, it is the case that the SUV has come to underpin U.S. dependence on imported oil. This dependence in turn underpins the U.S. strategic interest in global oil supply, especially in the Middle East, where the American military presence has generated such animus. As a result, the SUV symbolizes the need for the U.S. to maintain its global military reach. Given the dangers this global military presence provokes, it might be possible to say the SUV is one of America’s greatest national security threats. This article explores the validity of those connections as part of a critical examination and retheorization of the relationship between oil and security. Its aim is to conceptualize the relationship between individual choices and geopolitical effects, yet to do so without adopting the moral level- ing of crude arguments that demonize certain individual behaviors in the correlation of drugs, oil, and terror. Central to this rethinking of the relationship between oil and security is an appreciation of the role law has played in making the SUV possible, and the way different laws have combined to produce a series of cultural, social, and political effects that stretch beyond America’s borders. U.S. environmental legislation in the early 1970s—especially the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975, which established fuel economy stan- dards—permitted the differential treatment of cars and light trucks, which the automakers exploited to the detriment of both efficiency and the environ- ment. The rise of the SUV has also been made possible by building codes, zoning regulations, and legislation such as the Interstate Highways and De- fense Act of 1956, all of which have materialized urban America’s reliance on private transport. Supported further by tax rebates and trade tariffs, the SUV has come to embody a form of radically individualistic citizenship that is be- ing underwritten by new developments in jurisprudence.6 However, the im- pact of domestic law reaches beyond domestic society. Contrary to the new citizenship’s ethos of autonomy and disconnection, the SUV has played a role in creating a number of international legal effects, most notably the United States’ rejection of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Con- vention on Climate Change and the illegal invasion of Iraq. The conceptual starting point for the required rethinking of the relation- ship between oil and security is that the interconnections between what ap- pear as individual consumer preferences for certain vehicles and their geopo- litical effects should be regarded as part of a complex called “automobility.” In John Urry’s assessment, “automobility can be conceptualized as a self-organiz- ing autopoietic, non-linear system that spreads worldwide, and includes cars, car-drivers, roads, petroleum supplies and many novel objects, technologies and signs.”7 As a complex system, automobility has profoundly affected the social and geographical structure of daily life. In the environment it has spawned, the territorialities of home, leisure, and work have been “unbundled” such that urbanism has been “splintered.”8 While automobility is recognized as a worldwide system, notwithstanding the occasional references to oil rich states, petroleum supplies, and import dependence, the focus of the literature is principally domestic, with relatively little attention to the global security context.9 This essay argues that with the unbundling of domestic territorialities in the context of new global networks, we need to appreciate the way (especially though not exclusively in the United States) the “unbounded” consumption of automobility produces an “unbordered” sense of the state in which security interests extend well beyond the national homeland. At the same time, this deterritorialization of the space of automobility and its security effects does not mean we exist above and beyond territory. To the contrary, the globalization of automobility and its security implications results in the creation of new borderlands with uneven consequences. These borderlands are conventionally understood as distant, wild places of insecurity where foreign intervention will be necessary to ensure domestic interests are secured. They include zones of exploration and the spaces traversed by pipelines, both of which involve the further marginalization of impoverished indigenous communities. The fate of these people and places is subsumed by the privilege accorded a resource (oil) that is central to the American way of life, the security of which is regarded as a fundamental strategic issue.10 However, if we understand borderlands as spatially disparate contact zones where practices intersect, actors and issues meld into one another, and conflicts potentially arise, then the translocal borderlands of automobility encom- pass networks that connect cultures of individual consumption with practices of global security. They do so through multiple sites of materialization and territorialization at “home” and “abroad.” As a consequence, this argument intends not only to supplement the automobility literature’s focus on the “in- side,” but also to overcome the way arguments about resource conflicts emphasize the “outside.” This essay thus aims to bring the question of security into the heart of the concern with automobility to demonstrate how these consumer practices contribute to the production of national identity. The first step in this argument is to reconceptualize the relationship be- tween foreign policy, security, and identity so we can appreciate what is at stake in linking internal behaviors with external threats at this juncture in American politics. This allows us to set the grounds for a spatial understand- ing that goes beyond the “domestic” versus the “foreign.” The second step is to consider how the domain of the cultural, social, and political can be conceptualized so that the complexity of the interconnections can be appreciated. Central to this is an understanding of the way “domestic” law, regulation, and policy work to create the geopolitics of identity in the new borderlands of automobility. This is illustrated in this essay’s third and fourth sections, which tell the story of U.S. oil consumption, automobility, and regulation. Regulation refers to more than governmental policy; it encompasses the question of the production of desire. An account of the SUV’s rise to popularity as family transport in the United States thus demonstrates how questions of geopolitics and identity are linked to a cultural politics of desire that exists beyond the institutionalized sites of the state. The SUV is the icon through which the relationship of security to automobility can be best understood, precisely be- cause the SUV constitutes a cultural site that transgresses the inside and out- side of the nation and—through the conceptualizations of security it both embodies and invokes—because the SUV folds the foreign back into the do- mestic, thereby rendering each problematic. Together these elements will demonstrate that the predominant representation of oil as simply an external, material cause of insecurity is insufficient for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of contemporary geopolitics. However, while this article was prompted by and written in the context of the U.S.–led inva- sion of Iraq and its aftermath, the argument is not seeking to explain the causes of and reasons for that invasion (fig. 1).11 In- stead, it seeks to articulate an understanding of the conditions of possibility for the specific decisions that led to that invasion as a particular moment of U.S. (and allied) global strategy. The effect of this U.S.–led security strategy is to “reborder” the state in a multitude of cultural and political sites as a way of containing the social forces that have splintered both conventional locales and frames of reference. Foreign Policy, Security, and Identity: From Geopolitics to Biopolitics As an imagined community, the state can be seen as the effect of formalized practices and ritualized acts that operate in its name or in the service of its ideals. This understanding, which is enabled by shifting our theoretical com- mitments from a belief in pregiven subjects to a concern with the problematic of subjectivity, renders foreign policy as a boundary-producing political performance in which the spatial domains of inside/outside, self/other, and domestic/foreign are constituted through the writing of threats as externalized dangers. The narratives of primary and stable identities that continue to govern much of the social sciences obscure such an understanding. In international rela- tions these concepts of identity limit analysis to a concern with the domestic influences on foreign policy; this perspective allows for a consideration of the influence of the internal forces on state identity, but it assumes that the external is a fixed reality that presents itself to the pregiven state and its agents. In contrast, by assuming that the identity of the state is performatively consti- tuted, we can argue that there are no foundations of state identity that exist prior to the problematic of identity/difference that situates the state within the framework of inside/outside and self/other. Identity is constituted in relation to difference, and difference is constituted in relation to identity, which means that the “state,” the “international system,” and the “dangers” to each are coeval in their construction. Over time, of course, ambiguity is disciplined, contingency is fixed, and dominant meanings are established. In the history of U.S. foreign policy— regardless of the radically different contexts in which it has operated—the formalized practices and ritualized acts of security discourse have worked to produce a conception of the United States in which freedom, liberty, law, democracy, individualism, faith, order, prosperity, and civilization are claimed to exist because of the constant struggle with and often violent suppression of opponents said to embody tyranny, oppression, anarchy, totalitarianism, col- lectivism, atheism, and barbarism. This record demonstrates that the boundary-producing political perfor- mance of foreign policy does more than inscribe a geopolitical marker on a map. This construction of social space also involves an axiological dimension in which the delineation of an inside from an outside gives rise to a moral hierarchy that renders the domestic superior and the foreign inferior. Foreign policy thus incorporates an ethical power of segregation in its performance of identity/difference. While this produces a geography of “foreign” (even “evil”) others in conventional terms, it also requires a disciplining of “domestic” elements on the inside that challenge this state identity. This is achieved through exclusionary practices in which resistant elements to a secure identity on the “inside” are linked through a discourse of “danger” with threats identified and located on the “outside.” Though global in scope, these effects are national in their legitimation.12 The ONDCP drugs and terror campaign was an overt example of this sort of exclusionary practice. However, the boundary-producing political perfor- mances of foreign policy operate within a global context wherein relations of sovereignty are changing. Although Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have overplayed the transition from modern sovereignty to imperial sovereignty in Empire, there is little doubt that new relations of power and identity are present. According to Hardt and Negri, in our current condition, Empire establishes no territorial center of power and does not rely on fixed boundaries or barriers. It is a decentered and deterritorializing apparatus of rule that progressively incor- porates the entire global realm within its open, expanding frontiers. Empire manages hybrid identities, flexible hierarchies, and plural exchanges through modulating networks of com- mand. The distinct national colors of the imperialist map of the world have merged and blended in the imperial global rainbow.13 As shall be argued here, the sense of fading national colors is being resisted by the reassertion of national identity boundaries through foreign policy’s writing of danger in a range of cultural sites. Nonetheless, this takes place within the context of flow, flexibility, and reterritorialization summarized by Hardt and Negri. Moreover, these transformations are part and parcel of change in the relations of production. As Hardt and Negri declare: “In the postmodernization of the global economy, the creation of wealth tends ever more toward what we will call biopolitical production, the production of so- cial life itself, in which the economic, the political, and the cultural increas- ingly overlap and invest one another.”14 While the implied periodization of the term postmodernization renders it problematic, the notion of biopolitics, with its connecting and penetrative networks across and through all domains of life, opens up new possibilities for conceptualizing the complex relation- ships that embrace oil, security, U.S. policy, and the SUV. In Todd Gitlin’s words, “the SUV is the place where foreign policy meets the road.”15 It is also the place where the road affects foreign policy. Biopolitics is a key concept in understanding how those meetings take place. Michel Foucault argues that biopolitics arrives with the historical transfor- mation in waging war from the defense of the sovereign to securing the exist- ence of a population. In Foucault’s argument, this historical shift means that decisions to fight are made in terms of collective survival, and killing is justi- fied by the necessity of preserving life.16 It is this centering of the life of the population rather than the safety of the sovereign or the security of territory that is the hallmark of biopolitical power that distinguishes it from sovereign power. Giorgio Agamben has extended the notion through the concept of the administration of life and argues that the defense of life often takes place in a zone of indistinction between violence and the law such that sovereignty can be violated in the name of life.17 Indeed, the biopolitical privileging of life has provided the rationale for some of the worst cases of mass death, with genocide deemed “understandable” as one group’s life is violently secured through the demise of another group.18 However, the role of biopolitical power in the administration of life is equally obvious and ubiquitous in domains other than the extreme cases of violence or war. The difference between the sovereign and the biopolitical can be un- derstood in terms of the contrast between Foucault’s notion of “disciplinary society” and Gilles Deleuze’s conception of “the society of control,” a distinc- tion that plays an important role in Hardt and Negri’s Empire. According to Hardt and Negri, in the disciplinary society, “social command is constructed through a diffuse network of dispositifs or apparatuses that produce and regu- late customs, habits, and productive practices.” In the society of control, “mechanisms of command become ever more democratic, ever more imma- nent to the social field, distributed throughout the brains and bodies of the citizens.” This means that the society of control is “characterized by an inten- sification and generalization of the normalizing apparatuses of disciplinarity that internally animate our common and daily practices, but in contrast to discipline, this control extends well outside the structured sites of social insti- tutions through flexible and fluctuating networks.”19 Network is, therefore, the prevailing metaphor for social organization in the era of biopolitical power, and it is a conception that permits us to under- stand how the effects of our actions, choices, and life are propagated beyond the boundaries of our time-space location.20 It is also a conception that allows us to appreciate how war has come to have a special prominence in producing the political order of liberal societies. Networks, through their extensive con- nectivity, function in terms of their strategic interactions. This means that “social relations become suffused with considerations of power, calculation, security and threat.”21 As a result, “global biopolitics operates as a strategic game in which the principle of war is assimilated into the very weft and warp of the socio-economic and cultural networks of biopolitical relations.”22 This theoretical concern with biopolitical relations of power in the context of networked societies is consistent with an analytical shift to the problematic of subjectivity as central to understanding the relationship between foreign policy and identity. That is because both are concerned with “a shift from a preoccupation with physical and isolated entities, whose relations are described largely in terms of interactive exchange, to beings-in-relation, whose struc- tures [are] decisively influenced by patterns of connectivity.”23 At the same time, while conceptual approaches are moving away from understandings pre- mised on the existence of physical and isolated entities, the social and political structures that are produced by network patterns of connectivity often appear to be physical and isolated. As Lieven de Cauter argues, we don’t live in net- works; we live in capsules. Capsules are enclaves and envelopes that function as nodes, hubs, and termini in the various networks and contain a multitude of spaces and scales. These enclaves can include states, gated communities, or vehicles—with the latter two manifesting the “SUV model of citizenship” Mitchell has provocatively described.24 Nonetheless, though capsules like these appear physical and isolated, there is “no network without capsules. The more networking, the more capsules. Ergo: the degree of capsularisation is directly proportional to the growth of networks.”25 The result is that biopolitical rela- tions of power produce new borderlands that transgress conventional under- standings of inside/outside and isolated/connected. Together these shifts pose a major theoretical challenge to much of the social sciences, which have adhered ontologically to a distinction between the ideal and the material, which privileges economistic renderings of complex social assemblages.26 As we shall see, overcoming this challenge does not mean denying the importance of materialism but, rather, moving beyond a simplis- tic consideration of objects by reconceptualizing materialism so it is under- stood as interwoven with cultural, social, and political networks. This means that “paying increased attention to the material actually requires a more ex- pansive engagement with the immaterial.”27 The Biopolitics of Oil and Security Most accounts of the role of oil in U.S. foreign policy embody economistic assumptions, rendering oil in materialistic terms as an independent variable that causes states to behave in particular ways. In the prelude to the invasion of Iraq, even the best commentaries represented oil as the real reason motivat- ing the buildup to war.28 In this vein, a Greenpeace campaign pictured the (oil) “drums of war” and invited people to read about “what’s really behind the war on Iraq.”29 In addition to manifesting specific epistemological assumptions, these views regard resource geopolitics as primarily a question of supply. Before we move beyond this frame of reference to explore what goes unex- plained by this focus, we need to appreciate the infrastructure of oil resource geopolitics that makes this issue so important. Securing global oil supply has been a tenet of U.S. foreign policy in the post–World War II era. Because the Middle East holds two-thirds of the known reserves of oil, this objective has made the region an unavoidable concern for successive U.S. administrations. As the largest and most economical supplier of Middle East oil, Saudi Arabia has had a central place in this strategic calculation, with the United States agreeing to defend (internally and externally) the Saudi regime in return for privileged access to Saudi oil. Over the years, this arrangement has cost the United States tens of billions of dollars in mili- tary assistance.30 This strategy was formalized in the Carter Doctrine of 1980, which, in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, declared that any power that threatened to control the Persian Gulf area would be directly chal- lenging fundamental U.S. national security interests and would be seen as engaged in an assault on the United States.None of this would be required if the United States did not rely on im- ported oil for its economic well-being. However, in 2002 oil imports fueled 53 percent of domestic consumption, and the U.S. Department of Energy forecasts only increasing dependence. By 2025 oil import dependence is ex- pected to rise to around 70 percent of domestic needs.31 These percentages mean the United States will consume an additional 8.7 million barrels of oil per day by 2025. Given that total petroleum imports in 2002 were 11.4 mil- lion barrels per day, this is a very substantial increase. In recent years, faced with increased dependence on oil imports, the United States has been seeking to diversify supply, with some paradoxical outcomes. As the country was preparing to go to war with Iraq, the United States was importing half of all Iraqi exports (which satisfied only 8 percent of America’s needs), even though this indirectly funded the regime of Saddam Hussein.32 Some Republicans in Congress used this data to smear then-Democratic Sen- ate leader Tom Daschle as an Iraqi sympathizer, arguing that the Democrat’s failure to support drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)— as the Bush administration desired—forced America into unholy commercial alliances.33 While this argument conveniently overlooked the fact that ANWR’s 3 billion barrels of reserves could supply only six months of the United States’ total oil needs, it demonstrated how the internalization of a cleavage between business and environmental interests is sustained through an association with external threat.34 The drive for diversification is now a major security objective. In the 2001 review of energy policy chaired by Vice President Dick Cheney, the final chapter of the report focused exclusively on strengthening global alliances with energy producers to achieve that goal.35 However, the geopolitical pursuit of energy security is likely to produce new and intensive forms of insecurity for those in the new resource zones, which are located in some of the most strategically unstable global locations.36 As a result, the United States has been providing increased military support to governments in the Caspian Basin area, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa—regardless of their ideological complexion or human rights record.37 A geopolitical understanding of these developments is necessary but not sufficient. That is because the geopolitical frame focuses solely on the supply of oil without interrogating the demand for this resource that makes it so valuable. Possession of a material resource is meaningless unless social net- works value that resource. As such, an analysis of the demand side, and attention to the politics of consumption as much as the problem of production, is a first step toward understanding the biopolitics of security.</strong><br />

‘Green diplomacy’ perpetuates forms of social organization that repress the potential of establishing a stable environment, their spin is a smokescreen that naturalizes oppression.<br />
<u>Broadhead</u> <strong>20</strong><u>02</u> <strong>(Lee-Anne, Associate Professor of Political Science at the University College of Cape Breton. “International Environmental Politics: The Limits of Green Diplomacy” 2002, p. 1-6, MT)</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>In the last quarter of the twentieth century, international political processes have, apparently, become increasingly concerned with a wide range of environmental problems, A common argument can now be heard from the politicians’ offices as well as from within the walls of academe and even corporate boardrooms: the previously unchallenged notion of state sovereignty has given way to new and better forms of international cooperation in the face of environmental problems. Few, if any, of the exponents of this view would argue that the management of this acknowledged interdependence has been straight forward, but hope is continually held out that increased awareness of the fragility of the natural environment has necessitated greater effort on collective measures to halt destructive practices. The governing arrangements it established in this more rational system, we are frequently told by international relations scholars, demonstrate a new reality in interstate relations—one in which state power has been diminished and restructured along more cooperative lines to meet the obviously transnational dimensions of the crisis. If we move care fully and base our arguments on solid knowledge, it is argued, we will continue to take steady steps toward a more ecologically sound world order. Incremental change may not be dramatic, but it is, these scholars reassure, having the inevitable effect of shaping the freedom of maneuverability of both states and institutions. From this perspective we can clearly see the dawn of a new, norm-rich world order from which we will all benefit. In the view of the defenders of incremental change and international &quot;regime formation,&quot;1 we are encouraged to believe in the persuasive ability of scientific knowledge about both the causes and the cures of environmental degradation to lead even me most recalcitrant of polluters into agreements that will limit their actions. We are reassured that, when faced with domestic pressure and scientific evidence, state leaders will make concessions than are in the greater interests of the natural world rather than in their narrower national interest. Furthermore, we are asked to be optimistic about scientific research itself: in its ability to provide us with a neutral, value free picture of the state of the world’s environment and to point to the specific action necessary to turn the corner toward environmental sustainability. And finally, we are asked to celebrate the new forms of technology that are held out as the the savior- of our currently destructive practices: technology transfers to the developing world will assist with pollution reduction, and our own continuing efforts will guarantee that we will find solutions to ongoing problems. The way forward, argues the incrementalist is to focus on one limited and therefore manageable problem at a time. Let us not take on too much at a time; let us take sure steps based on scientific fact and not bite off more than we can chew. Green diplomacy-by which I mean the process of ordering the international governance issues dealing with the natural world and it’s myriad problems and challenges - is now a regular part of the international scene, and as long as we do not push too hard or too fast we can make steady progress. By focusing on one specific and limited issue at in time we will triumph, Small steps are needed to establish a body of law to guarantee environmental standards. It may not be a perfect scenario but we are told to be realistic about the international system and the very obvious difficulties in attempting to negotiate instruments of governance when states define their national interests judiciously while guarding their sovereignty jealously. Machiavelli—taken as shorthand for the brute reality of state power-may be greener now,2 but cooperative interdependence has its limits and sovereignty must be protected. If we set our sights too high and attempt to link issues, we will achieve little, if anything, of substance. Not only is the state presented as being increasingly imbued with this new. Green Enlightenment, but corporations have also, so we are told, turned the same hue, a claim reinforced by their bombardment of consumers with advertisements and merchandise designed and labeled as ecologically sound. Now, if governments and business leaders are in deed serious converts to the cause of saving the environment, what need is there for alternatives, in thought or deed, to incrementalist green diplomacy? We are told that not only are such alternatives superfluous, they are at best naive and at worst counterproductive. This is not the terrain for grassroots movements or small-scale projects; these are huge problems demanding overarching, intergovernmental activity. We are directed to “leave it to the specialists”—those with the oversight of the whole issue-and we need not worry, because we can relax in the knowledge that an agreed framework has been found: that of sustainable development. REFRAMING THE ISSUE Not everyone, of course, is happy with this presentation of the necessary rules of engagement. Increasingly, we see the claims of the international institutions—especially, but not exclusively, those of the economic variety—being contradicted by the results of their policies. As a result, students. farmers, industrial workers, and others from around the world are meeting up: they meet on the streets to protest, at international conferences to think through strategies, and over the Internet to share ideas about tactics. The claims of the international incrementalists ring hollow in these ears, and the responses of the state leaders in their own locale when challenged by the protesters display remarkable similarities: send in the riot police wearing what appears to be standard issue crowd control gear (the globalization of riot fashion?) and carrying a hefty supply of pepper spray. What sense are we to make of this? Which claims are correct and what is the appropriate approach to adopt to deal with the myriad environmental problems that we collectively face? Can we not just adopt the methods that have apparently been used so successfully to gain multilateral agreements 0n ways to deal with serious problems such as global warming and ozone depletion and turn our attention to the other severe ' tasks at hand? What need is there for a fundamental rethink or critique? The beginning point to answering all of these questions is of necessity a consideration of whether the promised transformation of the international rules has indeed occurred. Calling into question me reality of this supposed transformation is the topic of this inquiry. My inquisition stems from a belief that the presentation of such optimism-which is based on the supposedly scientific answers to so-called rational problems- is not only misleading but is actually blinding us to the radical transformation in our thinking and subsequently to the prevalent forms of social organization that must take place before any qualitative improvement in the condition of the natural world can result. Such radical thinking, I argue is not to be limited only to specific technical issues of separate environmental problems but rather must be more wide ranging and more integrated into a consideration of the social context within which these problems exist. Drawing on the insights of Critical Theory? I seek to highlight the way in which the framing of the environmental issue can he seen as both a product and a way of perpetuating a form of societal organization that represses the real possibilities that exist to liberate individuals and establish the preconditions for ecologically sound existence. The argument that will be presented in this book is that the optimism demonstrated by the supporters of green diplomacy is misguided and serves only to maintain environmentally destructive political, economic, and social structures. The very way in which we regard the world has led to and continues to deepen—the destruction of the environment. The existing social structures, based as they are on the perpetuation of the growth model and continual profit seeking, are connected to, embedded in, and act as a reaffirmation of this worldview. Many of the advocates of the incrementalist approach are well intentioned and believe whole heartedly that we must work within the limitations as we find diem; others have a vested interest in ensuring that the questions and issues are not framed in such at manner that they call into question the status quo view of markets, science, and progress.The argument used by those academics who support and encourage the regime formation approach to environmental politics is that we must work toward the goals that can be “realistically” achieved within the boundaries of the current international system. It has been acknowledged by at least one scholar of regime formation that &quot;an emphasis on regimes can be criticized by those for whom anything other than clearly transformatory agendas are inadequate.” 4 Instead of then looking closely at what such a critique would lead to, it is inevitably dismissed because &quot;the scope of such agendas soon extends far beyond specifically environmental issues.” This inquiry into international environ mental problems, which extends beyond the specifics of the individual problems, is in fact the point of such critiques, and this book will argue that it is the green diplomats and their champions who are on the wrong track, a road to environmental hell paved with their overly limited intentions. We need to stop looking at the &quot;new&quot; Machiavelli-—the modern state and its business friends—through green-tinted spectacles. The reality is far uglier and the situation far worse than presented. THE NATURAL WORLD AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS The treatment of the global environmental crisis in the field of international relations is limited by the weakness of the theories that have generally been used to guide both its scholarship as well as me practical construction of international agreements. It can alas be said with certainty that reflexivity—-an essential self-consciousness about the process of theorizing itself—has not traditionally been greatly valued within the field, and although there have been theoretical battles between those holding different perspectives for as long as the discipline has existed, until relatively recently there has been a decided lack of recognition of the role of knowledge claims and the power inherent in the framing of the questions for study. Needless to say, outside academe in the &quot;real world&quot; of international relations, the movement has been even slower. Before turning our attention to the impact that such reflexivity might have on the problem at hand, let us consider the mainstream thinking of the discipline as it pertains to the natural world. The exploitation of natural resources has long played a central part in the musings on interstate power struggles. The dominance of the realist school of thought in the aftermath of World War II echoed the widely held belief that the natural world could be considered as naming more than stocks of resources that could be brought under control in the interests of industrial production (including war-fighting capability) and therefore as an important element in the calculation of power. Hans Morgenthau—widely regarded as the grand master of realist thinking—argued (correctly) that &quot;as the absolute importance of the control of raw mate rials for natural power has increased in proportion to the mechanization of warfare, so certain raw materials have gained importance over others,&quot;6 The objective then was to ensure the national interest of the state by protecting the existing resources and ensuring access to those that were not plentiful within a state’s boundaries. The recognition of the changing need for raw materials did not. needless to say, lead realist international relations scholars to a discussion of the environmental costs of militarism precisely because the major tenet of this theory is that we must take the world as we find it; normative wishes to change the natural order of interstate relations merely cloud issues with potentially disastrous effects, Realism recognized, as Morgenthau informed us. that “politics, like society in general, is governed by objective laws that have their roots in human nature...The operation of these laws being impervious to out preferences, men will change them only at the risk of failure,”7 Much of the literature that now exists on the security costs of environmental degradation reproduces this logic where it refers to water or other resource shortages in terms only of struggles and potential war?</strong><br />

The dominant paradigm of food security while it pays lip service to those starving really is a positivistic component of global liberal governance that utilizes traditional security discourse to create a militaristic mindset centered around the notion of risk, threat, and emergency.<br />

<br />
<strong>Since the 1970s, the concept of ‘food security’ has been the primary lens through which the ongoing prevalence and inherent complexity of global hunger has been viewed. The adoption of the term at the FAO-sanctioned World Food Conference in 1974 has led to a burgeoning literature on the subject, most of which takes ‘food security’ as an unproblematic starting point from which to address the persistence of so-called ‘food insecurity’ (see Gilmore &amp; Huddleston, 1983; Maxwell, 1990; 1991; Devereux &amp; Maxwell, 2001). A common activity pursued by academics specialising in food security is to debate the appropriate definition of the term; a study undertaken by the Institute of Development Studies cites over 200 competing definitions (Smith et al., 1992). This pervasive predilection for empirical clarity is symptomatic of traditional positivist epistemologies and constrains a more far-sighted understanding of the power functions of ‘food security’ itself, a conceptual construct now accorded considerable institutional depth.2 Bradley Klein contends that to understand the political force of organizing principles like food security, a shift of analytical focus is required: ‘Instead of presuming their existence and meaning, we ought to historicize and relativize them as sets of practices with distinct genealogical trajectories’ (1994: 10). The forthcoming analysis traces the emergence and evolution of food security discourse in official publications and interrogates the intertextual relations which pertain between these publications and other key sites of discursive change and/or continuity. Absent from much (if not all) of the academic literature on food security is any reflection on the governmental content of the concept of ‘security’ itself. The notion of food security is received and regurgitated in numerous studies which seek to establish a better, more comprehensive food security paradigm. Simon Maxwell has produced more work of this type than anyone else in the field and his studies are commonly referenced as foundational to food security studies (Shaw, 2005; see Maxwell, 1990; 1991; 1992; 1996; Devereux &amp; Maxwell, 2001). Maxwell has traced the evolution in thinking on food security since the 1970s and distinguishes three paradigm shifts in its meaning: from the global/national to the household/individual, from a food first perspective to a livelihood perspective and from objective indicators to subjective perception (Maxell, 1996; Devereux &amp; Maxwell, 2001). There is something of value in the kind of analysis Maxwell employs and these three paradigm shifts provide a partial framework with which to compare the results of my own analysis of food security discourse. I suggest, however, that the conclusions Maxwell arrives at are severely restricted by his unwillingness to reflect on food security as a governmental mechanism of global liberal governance. As a ‘development expert’ he employs an epistemology infused with concepts borrowed from the modern development discourse; as such, his conclusions reflect a concern with the micro-politics of food security and a failure to reflect on the macro-politics of ‘food security’ as a specific rationality of government. In his article ‘Food Security: A Post-Modern Perspective’ (1996) Maxwell provides a meta-narrative which explains the discursive shifts he distinguishes. He argues that the emerging emphasis on ‘flexibility, diversity and the perceptions of the people concerned’ (1996: 160) in food security discourse is consistent with currents of thought in other spheres which he vaguely labels ‘post-modern’. In line with ‘one of the most popular words in the lexicon of post-modernism’, Maxwell claims to have ‘deconstructed’ the term ‘food security’; in so doing, ‘a new construction has been proposed, a distinctively post-modern view of food security’ (1996: 161-162). This, according to Maxwell, should help to sharpen programmatic policy and bring theory and knowledge closer to what he calls ‘real food insecurity’ (1996: 156). My own research in the forthcoming analysis contains within it an explicit critique of Maxwell’s thesis, based on three main observations. First, Maxwell’s ‘reconstruction’ of food security and re-articulation of its normative criteria reproduce precisely the kind of technical, managerial set of solutions which characterise the positivistic need for definitional certainty that he initially seeks to avoid. Maxwell himself acknowledges ‘the risk of falling into the trap of the meta-narrative’ and that ‘the ice is admittedly very thin’ (1996: 162-163), but finally prefers to ignore these misgivings when faced with the frightening (and more accurately ‘post-modern’) alternative. Second, I suggest that the third shift which Maxwell distinguishes, from objective indicators to subjective perceptions, is a fabrication which stems more from his own normative beliefs than evidence from official literature. To support this part of his argument Maxwell quotes earlier publications of his own work in which his definition incorporates the ‘subjective dimension’ of food security (cf. Maxwell, 1988). As my own analysis reveals, while lip-service is occasionally paid to the lives and faces of hungry people, food security analysis is constituted by increasingly extensive, technological and professedly ‘objective’ methods of identifying and stratifying the ‘food insecure’. This comprises another distinctly positivistic endeavour. Finally, Maxwell’s emphasis on ‘shifts’ in thinking suggests the replacement of old with new – the global/national concern with food supply and production, for example, is replaced by a new and more enlightened concern for the household/individual level of food demand and entitlements. Discursive change, however, defies such linear boundary drawing; the trace of the old is always already present in the form of the new. I suggest that Maxwell’s ‘shifts’ should rather be conceived as ‘additions’; the implication for food security is an increasingly complex agenda, increasingly amorphous definitions and the establishment of new divisions of labour between ‘experts’ in diverse fields. This results in a technocratic discourse which ‘presents policy as if it were directly dictated by matters of fact (thematic patterns) and deflects consideration of values choices and the social, moral and political responsibility for such choices’ (Lemke, 1995: 58, emphasis in original). The dynamics of technocratic discourse are examined further in the forthcoming analysis. These observations inform the explicit critique of contemporary understandings of food security which runs conterminously with the findings of my analysis. I adopt a broad perspective from which to interrogate food security as a discursive technology of global liberal governance. Food security is not conceived as an isolated paradigm, but as a component of overlapping discourses of human security and sustainable development which emerged concurrently in the 1970s. The securitisation process can be regarded in some cases as an extreme form of politicisation, while in others it can lead to a depoliticisation of the issue at hand and a replacement of the political with technological or scientific remedies. I show how the militaristic component of traditional security discourse is reproduced in the wider agenda of food security, through the notions of risk, threat and permanent emergency that constitute its governmental rationale.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 90%; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">In the aftermath of 11 September 2001 (9/11), the Bush administration justified the ‘war on terrorism’, specifically in relation to Afghanistan, in part by the notion that the US must act in order to ‘save Afghan women’ and to restore women’s human rights. The US media built on this justification by flooding the news with images and stories about the plight of women in the Taliban’s Afghanistan. As a result, many in the US were alerted to some of the harsh realities of women’s lives in Afghanistan and this in turn affirmed US military and political intervention as a legitimate method of establishing ‘gender equality’. Feminists were divided over the US response to 9/11, particularly with respect to the invasion of Afghanistan. The Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF), for instance, did not join in the public mobilization against the military invasion but rather welcomed the focus on the Taliban’s gender apartheid and gender violence. The FMF, in conjunction with many other feminist and human rights organizations in the USA, had been spear- heading a ‘Stop Gender Apartheid in Afghanistan’ campaign since the mid-1990s. Thus, they saw the post-9/11 ‘war on terrorism’ as a political opportunity to fulfill their stated goals of ending ‘gender apartheid’ and ‘restoring’ women’s human rights in Afghanistan. In contrast, many other explicitly anti-imperialist feminists in the USA and around the world critically responded to what they saw as the cynical appropriation of feminist ideas by the Bush administration to justify its unjustifiable ‘war on terrorism’ (see Hawthorne and Winter 2002). The Feminist Majority Foundation, despite its counter-hegemonic politics against gender violence, reaffirmed, rather than rejected, the project of US imperialism and retaliatory violence as a method of maintaining US power. Because there are divisions in feminist responses to US wars after 9/11, it is important to speculate about what groups such as the FMF gain from colluding with the hegemonic projects of the US state. In this essay, I explore the relationship between the justification for the US invasion of Afghanistan and its connection to the arguments of the Feminist Majority Foundation’s campaign to ‘Stop Gender Apartheid in Afghanistan’. I examine the mutual constitutiveness between the Bush administration’s rhetorical claim to ‘saving Afghan women’ as a pretext to war and the FMF’s campaign efforts to support women’s rights in Afghanistan. While the FMF’s campaign has brought public attention to some of the realities of women’s lives under the Taliban since the mid-1990s, it does so from a framework of ‘imperial feminism’1 that ultimately serves to bolster US world hegemony and empire. This ‘imperial feminist’ awareness has circulated within US and European feminisms as well as colonialisms from the nineteenth century to the present in relation to empire building (e.g. Ahmed 1992; Terborg-Penn 1998; Koikari 2002). It is a femimism that focuses exclusively on the gender-based oppression of ‘third world’ women and does so ‘without acknowledging the role of racism, colonialism and economic exploitation’; it ‘claims solidarity with Third World women and women of color, but in actuality contributes to the stereotyping of Third World cultures as “barbaric” and “uncivilized”’, which then justifies imperialist intervention (Sudbury 2000, referencing Amos and Parmar 1984). The FMF campaign assumes ‘Western’ superiority through its ahistorical and Orientalist focus on ‘the veil’ and gender segregation as symbolic of women’s oppression and its implicit assumption that the US embodies gender equality and women’s human rights. This Orientalist logic constructs an absolute difference between the ‘West’ and the ‘East’/‘self’ and ‘other’. It does so by erasing the history and politics of Afghanistan and by projecting a cultural barbarity in need of a civilizing mission. Western women and feminism become the embodiment of Afghanis’ hope for democracy. The assumption of superiority and benevolence is possible because the FMF evades its own implication in the politics of the region and condones the terms of imperialism–the right to control, the right to invade and the right to occupy under the guise of ‘liberating’ women and creating a ‘gender equality’ resonant with so-called Western standards (Ahmed 1992; Janiewski 2001). The campaign is mostly silent with respect to a history of US global geopolitical involvement in and contributions to the rise of the Taliban and fundamentalism in Afghanistan. Even in its current critique of the US military’s failure to provide adequate security forces and lack of follow through in supporting women’s rights in Afghanistan, the FMF never questions the underlying premises of the US invasion and the right to control the future of Afghanistan. This analysis is done in the interests of considering the ways in which the Feminist Majority Campaign reifies US hegemony by supporting US imperial control under the illusory guise of ‘protection’ and ‘security’, ‘democracy’ and ‘freedom’. As Sinha points out, ‘neither feminisms nor women are ever articulated outside macropolitical structures that condition and delimit their political effects’ (2000: 1078; emphasis in original). In this case, the geo- politics of US imperialism, packaging itself as a movement to create democ- racy and ‘freedom’ through militarism and force, uses the rhetoric of the Feminist Majority’s Campaign to serve its own interests; and the Feminist Majority Campaign ultimately accepts the terms of this imperialism to serve its own interests–to stop what they conceive as the problem facing women in Afghanistan–gender apartheid2–and to do so by any means necessary. More importantly, the FMF’s efforts affirm its power and positionality within the US as a universal feminist enterprise consistent with US hegemony. Similar to how British middle-class feminism built itself in relation to India, ‘produced within the prevailing and symbiotically connected discourses of empire and nation’ (Sinha 2000: 1079), so the FMF Campaign is built in and through the discourses of contemporary US imperialism. It is imperative for US feminists interested in transnational solidarity to critically interrogate feminist efforts in terms of how they are intricately and integrally tied to US state interests and to the imperialism of US geopolitics. As Janiewski (2001) argues, US-based international feminisms, while seemingly oriented toward solidarity, have often engaged in the projects of imperialist and hegemonic power. Without a recognition and refusal of the terms of empire, the FMF’s campaign bolsters US world hegemony and contributes to the multiple and interlocking systems of oppression and privilege shaping the lives of Afghan women. An explicitly anti-imperialist feminism, by way of contrast, resists US hegemonic and imperial state interests by implicating itself in the working of US power rather than aligning with it. It critically interrogates and dismantles the assumption of ‘Western’ supremacy and superiority with regard to gender equality, democracy and freedom. It comes to the table with recognition of its accountability for its powerful location and recognition of the deeply rooted interconnectedness between the systems of oppres- sion and privilege within and outside of the USA. Thus, as Alexander and Mohanty (1997) argue, transnational feminist solidarity is predicated on a critical analysis of empire with a political praxis that disrupts rather than reproduces relations of domination. Before exploring the FMF’s relationship with US power, I turn first to the specificities of the Bush administration’s hegemonic project of imperial feminism. </span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 110%;">In this essay, I have tried to illustrate how the Feminist Majority ‘Campaign to Stop Gender Apartheid’ is ultimately complicit with and integral to US empire building. By accepting the terms of Bush’s ‘war on terrorism’ and its cynical use of gender, the FMF contributes to a legacy of imperial feminism. The efforts to ‘save’ and ‘rescue’ Afghan women through US militarism and power ultimately contributes to the problems Afghan women face. The myopic and ahistorical understanding of Afghan women’s lives allows US feminists to remain unconcerned and unaccountable for the role of the USA in the conflict and instability of Afghanistan. Instead, the campaign simply reifies the West’s terms of ‘gender equality’ and its own ‘superiority’, which seriously implicates the FMF campaign in the rhetoric legitimizing the expansion of US empire. This analysis is significant because of the status of the Feminist Majority in mainstream liberal and feminist circles in the USA; as a national organization, they are quite visible in shaping the lens through which women’s and gender issues are understood and then acted upon. The implications are far-reaching in terms of the current political context of US empire building and its impact across the world. It seems essential to continue critical and reflective dialogue among feminists about our own beliefs, assumptions and politics in relation to US empire and imperialism, in the past and present (Alexander and Mohanty 1997; Sinha 2000). This includes a deeper interrogation into the ways in which empire shapes and informs US feminist efforts to build connection and solidarity across the divides of race, class, culture and sexuality within and outside of the borders of the USA. As many post-colonial, anti-imperial- ist and anti-racist feminists have argued, feminism must go far beyond an exclusively gender-based analysis of women’s lives in order to build transna- tional solidarity. A feminism that recognizes the ways in which empire inter- sects with patriarchy, white supremacy, capitalism and heterosexuality in terms of both oppression and privilege would provide for and create a broader ethic of accountability in critically challenging its own terms and conditions. As Nayak suggests, ‘in order for feminism to have resistance potential, it must acknowledge its own participation in Orientalism and its self-referential activism during colonialism, conflicts and the War on Terror’ (Nayak 2006: 48). In other words, feminists in the so-called West must recognize our particular location and its impact on our understanding of both ‘self’ and ‘other’ as well as our actions in international and transnational arenas. Moreover, this politics of location must go beyond simple recognition to a space of interrogation and critical reflection and action. Along these lines, Alexander and Mohanty (1997) suggest that feminists based in the USA must critically interrogate our assumption of the USA as a democratic and liberal state with a serious interest in spreading ‘democracy’ and ‘freedom’. This assumption, as evidenced in the FMF campaign, ‘usually leads to the erasure of the centrality of the experiences of colonization in the lives of Third World women and U.S. women of color’ (Alexander and Mohanty 1997: xxxv). Instead, they suggest that feminists need to create a politics where ‘the imperial or colonial actions of the presumably Democratic U.S.’ are made visible and subject to feminist action (Alexander and Mohanty 1997: xxxv). Ultimately, then, the basis of transnational feminist solidarity must be a spirit and practice of equality rather than ‘saving’, respect rather than pity, accountability rather than superiority.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">However, whilst it is important (if only to counter the pessimistic discourse surrounding this issue) to recognise the various disarmament outcomes that have been generated under the current arms limitation system, it is also important to recognise the context in which these have occurred. In particular, both disarmament and broader arms limitation initiatives are now taking place as part of an asymmetrical arms limitation system that has replaced the emphasis on balance between the superpowers that dominated Cold War practice.34 It is sufficient at this juncture to note that what characterizes this system of arms limitation is the way in which it is structured to consolidate and preserve the military superiority of the US in particular and the West in general. Moreover, rather than reinforcing security this profound military imbalance promotes insecurity – both by creating incentives for other actors to pursue asymmetric technologies (NBC) or strategies (terrorism) that offset the US’s conventional superiority,35 and by diverting resources that could be expended on human security to militarism. At best, the contemporary arms limitation system aims to keep the lid on such contradictions by setting in place a variety of disciplinary mechanisms that attempt to constrain asymmetric military responses whilst simultaneously preserving the asymmetrical advantages of the West. At worst, in attempting to contain pressures that may ultimately be uncontainable, the contemporary arms limitation system may promote an illusion of relative security whilst positively fostering a variety of insecurities. However, a few more comments are in order before we proceed to consider this system of asymmetrical arms limitation in more detail. Stuart Croft and arms control as threat construction The corollary of the preceding critique of arms control theory is of course a requirement to develop conceptual frameworks (and framings) that are capable of simultaneously challenging the hegemonic discourse within the discipline and of producing greater explanatory value. To date this attempt has been most convincingly pursued by critical theorists and postmodernists such as Mutimer,36 and Krause and Latham.37 Even within the mainstream literature on arms limitation however, there has been some attempt to reconceptualise arms limitation practice. Most notably, Stuart Croft in Strategies of Arms Control explicitly rejects the distinction between arms control and disarmament as a basis for framing discussions of arms limitation.38 Instead he develops a typology based around five different strategies of arms control: arms control at the conclusion of major conflicts, arms control to strengthen strategic stability, arms control to create norms of behaviour, arms control to manage the proliferation of weapons and arms control by international organisation. This certainly represents an improvement on more traditional discussions of arms limitation. However, there are also a number of problems with his analysis. First, Croft locates his typology in a broader analysis that emphasises the idea that arms control as an activity has been constantly widening (in the sense that there has been a gradual accretion of strategies deployed to achieve it) and that arms control agreements have become ever ‘deeper’ (in the sense that agreements have become more detailed, arrangements for verification have become both more common and more sophisticated, and the likelihood of agreements taking on the qualities of a regime have increased). Consequently, although Croft states that he is determined to avoid making judgements on the success or failure of arms control both as theory and practice, he nevertheless manages to produce a profoundly teleological (and indeed optimistic) account of the history of arms control/arms limitation. However, there has not been a straightforward accretion of arms limitation activity. Partly this is because the relevance of many arms control agreements has simply declined with the advent of new military technology. But even where this has not been the case, politics and power have constantly intruded both to kill off arms limitation initiatives and to influence their depth. Examples include Japanese and German disarmament after the Second World War, and the US decision to renounce the ABM Treaty. Similarly, the two page SORT Treaty highlights how the inexorable increase in depth described by Croft in 1996 was, at best, a function of historically contingent Cold War practices rather than some evolutionary manifest destiny.39 Second, Croft states that investigation of the motivation for arms limitation is outside the remit of his book. Despite noting the influence of politics and power on arms limitation then, what Croft presents is a largely mechanistic and apolitical analysis of the subject. Indeed, the development of arms limitation practice is depicted as an essentially autonomous process – as if, to paraphrase Cox, arms limitation were not always for some purpose and for someone.40 This is not untypical of the majority of the literature in this field which tends to focus on the technical minutiae of military strategy, diplomatic texts or policy battles. The problems that arms limitation deals with are generally taken as given and the purpose of such activity (just like arms control theory itself) is to engage in producing ‘problemsolving’ solutions to these issues. What Croft, and mainstream arms controllers in general ignore, is the role that arms limitation activity plays in both reflecting broader constructions of threat and in reinforcing them. Moreover, whilst the idea that arms limitation represents an arena where political power is exercised is taken as axiomatic, power is generally understood to be expressed in the relations between states (or internal bureaucracies) negotiating (or sometimes imposing) specific treaties, and measured in terms of who wins or loses in these negotiations. The myriad ways in which hegemonic power is expressed through developments in the dominant modes of arms limitation thinking and practice rarely intrude. For example, the power expressed as a result of the role played by discourse and action over arms limitation in affirming hegemonic projects of securitisation; the power manifested in the specific ways in which the system of arms limitation contributes to maintaining particular military and social hierarchies whether internally, within the state, or throughout the global system; and the relationship between the interests of power and the ways in which arms limitation reflects and reinforces powerful political, economic and cultural tools of legitimation/delegitimation surrounding military technology. In other words (from a critical security studies perspective at least), the key questions surrounding arms limitation are not so much who wins or loses in negotiations over a specific treaty or how effective/ineffective that treaty turns out to be. Rather, the principal concern is with how the dominant discourse and practice of arms limitation (not always the same thing) contributes to processes of securitisation and othering as well as military and broader hegemonic practices.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">The idea of poverty as a security issue has been fairly commonplace since the end of the Cold War. In 1993, the United Nations sought to redefine security with individuals as the referent object; a framework in which poverty is one of the principal security threats as it significantly reduces quality and quantity of life. At the same time, poverty was gaining importance in the security agendas of states. This is based on the idea that poverty is a threat to the rich as well as the poor and that an unequal world is an unstable one; a view that has become very powerful in the years since September, 2001. This essay will address the implications of this second type of securitisation – world poverty as a threat to the west. I will use the Copenhagen School approach to show how poverty is being securitised by western leaders in the context of the “War on Terror.” I will then go on to demonstrate that, although the issue of poverty is likely to receive more attention as a result, the securitisation of poverty may also cause many problems. Firstly, aid may be redirected from the non-threatening poor (often those most in need) to those perceived to be dangerous. Secondly, the involvement of the securitising states in the creation of poverty can be hidden as the rich are presented as potential victims. Finally, securitisation necessarily presents the interests of the securitiser as more important than those who will be affected by its actions and therefore encourages an imperialistic approach. Although the securitisation of poverty is directing some much needed attention to the problem, a humanitarian approach is a much more appropriate when considering the needs of the poor. The securitisation of poverty The theory of ‘securitisation’ is the method by which the Copenhagen School approaches security studies; it is the process by which an issue comes to be perceived as a security threat by a group. An issue is securitised by the ‘speech act;’ the point at which the relevant authorities are persuaded that the issue is a security threat and warrants emergency action (Buzan, Waever and de Wilde, 1998: 24-5). Thus the Copenhagen School deals with subjective security – the perception of threat. Abrahamsen makes an addition to this idea to include partial securitisations. She suggests that, instead of security threats being only existential threats, ‘security issues can be seen to move on a continuum from normalcy to worrisome/troublesome to risk and to existential threat—and conversely, from threat to risk and back to normalcy.’ (2005: 5) This is a scale which can include poverty as a security issue. While poverty has not been allocated a place near the ‘existential threat’ end of the spectrum by any Western government, recent rhetoric of world leaders (the ‘speech act’) has created a partial securitisation of poverty. Poverty is increasingly mentioned by world leaders in the context of the “War on Terror,” as a constituent part of this dominant security framework. (Buzan, 2006) In February 2002, US Secretary of State Colin Powell stated, “I fully believe that the root cause of terrorism does come from situations where there is poverty, where there is ignorance, where people see no hope in their lives.” (in Berrebi, 2003: 5) Similarly, Tony Blair claimed in November, 2001, “The dragon’s teeth [with regards to terrorism and terrorists] are planted in the fertile soil of . . . poverty and deprivation.” (in Berrebi, 2003: 6). Furthermore, the World Trade Centre bombings have shown that “No-one in this world can feel comfortable, or safe, while so many are suffering and deprived” (Kofi Annan, BBC, 22/03/02) and that “It is no longer necessary to prove a direct link between a troubled faraway country and the order of our own societies.” (Jack Straw, in Abrahamsen, 2005: 65) The policy response to these ideas has been mixed. Between September 2001 and July 2002, US aid to countries bordering Afghanistan rose dramatically, including a 278% increase for Pakistan. (Looney, 2002) President Bush also promised a 50% increase in all US aid. (BBC, 22/03/02) However, in reality poverty relief has not topped many agendas; the EU, OEDC, Denmark, Australia, Japan and others have rewritten the rules of aid to allow counter-terrorism measures to become an acceptable target of development assistance, therefore militarizing much humanitarian aid. (Christian Aid, 2004) With or without an increase in aid for poverty under the security agenda, I will argue below that this securitisation is not a positive move from a humanitarian perspective. The Non-Threatening Poor Although poverty and terrorism are presented as clearly linked in the quotes above, this is not generally accepted by terrorism experts. Berrebi is one of many who argue that there is, ‘little reason to believe that materialistic or educational improvements would help reduce terrorism. If anything, the correlation I find is that those with higher education and higher living standards are more likely to participate in terrorist activity.’ (2003: 2) Pipes argues that, “…suicide bombers who hurl themselves against foreign enemies offer their lives not to protest financial deprivation but to change the world.” (2002) Terrorism is therefore best understood as ‘a response to political conditions and long-standing feelings (either perceived or real) of indignity and frustration that have little to do with economics.” (Krueger and Maleckova, 2002: 1) A vast body of literature, some carried out by government bodies themselves, points to the perpetrators of terrorism as predominantly educated young men who perceive injustice and who feel that they have no option other than terrorism to address the problem. Importantly, it is widely recognised that terrorism is a product of middle income people in middle income countries. (Berrebi, 2003: 3) Poverty may still be an important factor however, because other people’s poverty may be a motivation for terrorism. One Hamas leader identified the ‘poverty-stricken outskirts of Algiers or the refugee camps in Gaza’ as the principal motivations for Islamic and, more specifically, Palestinian terrorism. (in Pipes, 2002) What this suggests is that it is the combination of political grievance and poverty which may become dangerous by inspiring terrorism, not poverty per se. So which types of poverty are dangerous to those afraid of terrorism? Firstly, the poverty linked to clear political injustice. This is the poverty found alongside prosperity where educated, mostly middle class people engage in terrorism on behalf of politically and economically marginalised communities. And secondly, the poverty that angers young men – the most likely group to participate in terrorist activities. This is the poverty linked to masculine humiliation. While both these types of poverty clearly need to be addressed, looking at poverty from a security point of view can overlook much poverty that is not seen to be threatening. For example, very poor countries tend to be less susceptible to terrorism; people must focus on survival and have little time for politics. (Lazarsfeld and Zeisal in Gurr, 1970: 34) Under a security agenda, the poverty of these people would not need to be addressed. The UK Department for International Development notes that a disproportionately large amount of the world’s bilateral aid already goes to the middle income countries where terrorism is most likely. (2005: 15) Further, in 2003, the UK gave a disproportionate amount of its allocated aid for poor communities in middle income countries to Iraq, showing a further politicisation of aid. (Christian Aid, 2004: 2) Similarly, the poverty of women will not be seen as important through the security lens since it is men that are the primary terrorist threat. In contrast both very poor countries and women are particular targets of non-securitised development aid. (UN, 1997) Thus a securitisation of poverty could easily overlook the ‘non-dangerous poor’ on behalf of the ‘dangerous’ The finite pool of resources allocated to poverty reduction is unlikely to ever be able to address all forms of poverty. More money is, and may further be allocated to those NGO’s and governments that stress the security aspect of their development work than those who work for purely humanitarian concerns. (Christian Aid, 2004: 2-3) Duffield argues that escaping the logic of this security regime is already very difficult, emphasising ‘the increasingly overt and accepted politicisation of aid.’ (2001: 16) ‘Aid, in other words, is being co-opted to serve in the global ‘War on Terror’.’ (Christian Aid, 2004: 1) What may be at stake is the allocation of resources away from the most needy on the behalf of those perceived to be most dangerous. Externalising poverty Some theorists suggest that securitised issues always carry with them a logic of ‘us’ against ‘them’. A threat to our existence is something that we must be protected from, those threatening us are external ‘others’ whose aims are incompatible with ours. This is clear in the rhetoric surrounding terrorism and, increasingly, in the securitisation of poverty. This can have serious implications for the attitude that is taken towards these issues; in a study of the securitisation of the African continent, Abrahamsen identifies an important process of shifting attitudes from a cooperative humanitarian approach to an ‘us against them’ approach which accompanies securitisations; ‘otherness’ is becoming something to fear and policies are increasingly driven by this. (2005: 60, 65 The ‘us against them’ logic that is so central to ideas of security involves a necessary privileging of ‘our’ interests over ‘theirs’. This is accepted logic in relation to perceived existential threats but becomes more problematic when attached to partial securitisations and non-traditional threats. That ‘our’ security is considered to be important when dealing with poverty is already clear; the UK’s foreign office minister for Africa argued that there are “sound practical reasons why we cannot afford to ignore the state of Africa. The most immediate of these is terrorism.” (in Abrahamsen, 2005: 67) What are not clear are the extents that western governments are prepared to go to ensure this security. Recent ideas of global policing and ‘voluntary imperialism’ that have emerged from the British government suggest that, in theory at least, the UK is prepared to take extensive measures. (Cooper, 2002) The combination of privileging our interests over the interests of impoverished others and a potential ‘voluntary imperialism’ is perhaps the central problem of securitising poverty. If western society is to be the referent object in addressing poverty, the needs and wishes of those on the receiving end are necessarily subordinate to the requirements of the west. The further the west is prepared to intervene in poor countries to protect its own security with little consideration for the people on the receiving end, the further the choice, democracy and diversity of those people will be eroded. While poverty and related problems need to be addressed, it is important, for the sake of the people receiving aid, that problems are addressed on their terms and not on the terms of others. Conclusion The securitisation of poverty is a trend that the western world has seen in the years since the World Trade Centre bombings. That poverty is a threat to ‘us’ is increasingly emphasised in political rhetoric particularly in relation to terrorism, of which it is seen to be a cause. More detailed examinations of the subject see a subjective understanding of inequality as the root cause of terrorism and so, while poverty may be a part of this, necessarily some types of poverty (those linked to conflict and political discrimination on the national or global scale) are more likely to be a threat than others. The securitisation of poverty can lead to various problems. Firstly, aid may be redirected from the non-threatening poor (often those most in need) to those perceived to be a threat. Secondly, the involvement of the securitising states in the creation of poverty can be hidden as the threat is increasingly presented in external terms. Finally, securitisation necessarily presents the interests of the securitiser as more important than those who will be affected by its actions. Recent ideas of ‘voluntary imperialism’, if carried through, could potentially be very damaging to those under their control.The securitisation of poverty is a trend that we can see in the political rhetoric of today but it is as yet only a partial securitisation. What we can see is possibly the beginnings of a new, securitised approach to poverty or possibly just a passing phase. The UK Department for International Development remains careful to distance itself from UK security issues as do many other organisations giving bilateral aid. However, securitisation can be seen as a sliding scale; the problems addressed in this essay are emerging issues that may or may not become very problematic. Some, such as the distribution of aid, are already more pronounced than others. In light of these potential problems and despite the increased attention that poverty can get as a result of being presented as a security threat, humanitarian approaches to the issue are preferable.</span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">Contemporary ‘terrorism’ discourse is used for moralistic purposes, instead of reporting the event it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy – moral and political obligation to avoid it.</span><br />
<u><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">Zulaika</span></u> <strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">20</span></strong><u>09</u> <strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 9pt;">(Joesba, Professor, at the Center for Basque Studies Ph.D., Anthropology, from Princeton University, has written widely on the issue of Terrorism and culture. “Terrorism: The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy” 2009, p. 17-20, MT)</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">“President Abraham Lincoln was shot dead in 1865. President John F. Kennedy fell victim to an assassination in 1963. A terrorist shot and wounded President Ronald Reagan in 1981.” This report from Pravda on January 19, 2007, typifies the transition: the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy were “assassinations;” the failed assassination attempt on Reagan was “terrorism.” Why was the third attack more “terroristic” than the first two? Because during the 1970s a new discourse had taken hold of international politics. Until that decade newspapers had no entries for the statistical indices of “terrorism” and therefore there were no “terrorist acts” (only kidnappings, assassinations, bomb explosions, threats, and the like). Since then terrorism has turned into a news staple. This is a simple example of how counting and writing constitutes the thing itself. Consider another notorious case that underlines the link between terrorism events and statistics: while a 1979 CIA report on terrorism claimed that there had been 3,336 terrorist incidents since 1968, the 1980 report claimed that there were 6,714 incidents over the same period. The doubling of terrorism was the result of including “threats” and “hoaxes” in the statistics. This is reminiscent of the paradox studied by Gottlob Frege regarding set theory: his numbers assume that the categories of counting create the objects that fall under those categories. This is also what power does in using statistics: by counting varieties of people, it not only accounts for but constitutes them. It can be said that modern nations are thus the product of counting, of collecting diverse peoples basically as citizens, that is, as members of an identical set after having discounted all their particularities. Terrorism is another instance in which the powers that be create, by numbering and writing, the objects described as “terrorist.” In short, if there was no statistical category of terrorism, no terrorist incident would be possible—only murders, assassinations, kidnappings, and so forth. In Terror and Taboo,1 William Douglass and I came close to this position in which the category subsumes the essence. In part II I will argue that one has to go beyond discourse to grasp the particular nature of terrorism. Hayden White called this inaugural aspect of language “tropic,” namely, it relies on the presence of tropes (metaphor,2 metonym, synecdoche, irony) used in “the process by which all discourse constitutes the objects which it pretends only to describe realistically and to analyze objectively.”3 “Terrorism” has become the dominant tropic space in contemporary political and journalistic discourse. Such tropics of terror, by which attention is paid to the conceptual premises, emplotted stories, and the very “illusion of sequence” of terrorist narrativity, should be of primary concern to any study of terrorism—in particular to one that seeks to unveil how terrorism discourse further creates the very thing it abominates. One decisive question that emerges from this perspective is: Does the new discourse of “terrorism” really add something—in terms of report- ing, knowledge, or political will—to what we already know about the facts? There is a radical difference at the level of discourse, rhetorically as well as legally and morally, between calling an event, say, a “threat” and calling it “terrorism.” The hypothesis of this chapter is that, not only do we not contribute anything substantive whether cognitive or political by labeling as “terrorism” acts that until the 1970s were described as “assassinations,” “kidnappings,” “attacks,” “threats,” and so on, but that the new overweening discourse, with its implications of essential Evil, taboo, and a logic of contagion, is a return to a form of thinking that is closer to the mental world of medieval witchcraft and inquisitorial nonsense. It is the type of discourse that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. This raises the issue of the writer’s betrayal (i.e., the journalist, the scholar, the politician, the expert, the intellectual). When examining how the United States made the blunder of going to war in Iraq, the easy answer is to point fingers at the Bush administration. What needs to be explained is how the large majority of Americans identified with Bush’s conflation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and terrorism. The difficult task is accounting for the ways counterterrorism culture has taken root at the core of American thinking and politics—a culture that, from a skeptical perspective, is plagued by spectacular semantic errors combined with a flawed self-fulfilling prophecy. How? Clearly, the constitutive power of discourse is germane to any understanding of such an outcome. But then, again, how could so many well-informed politicians, journalists, and writers fall for a blindly self-righteous discourse? “Terrorism” rhetoric can so easily become a massively self-serving discourse because, at the core, we still hold on to the perspectival dichotomy between their “barbarism” and our “civilization,” while believing that they are prone to mad, murderous in- humanity in ways that we don’t recognize in ourselves — despite, of course, the historical evidence. Such blindness begins by tabooing their voices and desires, by categorizing their madness, suicides, and killings as qualitatively distinct from ours — in short, by denying “them” a complex subjectivity like ours. Should our writing help to further constitute or, on the contrary, undermine the entire terrorism discourse? Following the lead of a distinguished list of anthropologists and social theorists,4 Terror and Taboo clearly took the latter stance; our arguments, based on the ethnographic proximity we had enjoyed as anthropologists among “terrorists,” centered on the rhetorical nature of counterterrorism and, more significantly, on the convulsive reality-making power of a discourse that played on the fears of taboo and imaginary apocalypse. If the book predicted 9/11 in its “Epilogue as Prologue: The Apotheosis of Terrorism Foretold,” post-9/11 counterterrorism discourse has fulfilled our worst predictions. Richard Jackson’s study examines in depth the massive discursive investment in the new “war on terrorism” and how it hinders rather than helps the search for solutions. A crucial requirement of the discourse is the creation of the “myth of exceptional grievance” by which the United States should be seen as the primary victim of terrorism. Public officials, such as Un- dersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, considered that “[t]his threat is as great as any we faced during the Cold War,” national security adviser Condoleezza Rice spoke of “that mushroom cloud,” and Vice President Dick Cheney made specific references to terrorists who may “detonate a nuclear weapon in one of our cities” and “who are willing to sacrifice their own lives in order to kill millions of others.”5 But, for our purposes of examining counterterrorist discourse and its new full-blown “war,” the complete subservience of the media and the scholarly community is just as crucial. Every TV network, through story after story, proclaims the “War against Terrorism” and “America’s New War”— in just the first month fol- lowing the 9/11 attacks, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and NPR had a total of 797 such stories. Similarly, there were 5,814 printed articles, employing both “war” and “terrorism.” Up to October 23, 2001, 754 articles were published by the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tri- bune, and the Los Angeles Times with references to World War II or Nazi Germany.6 Jackson concludes: “The ‘war on terrorism’ was, in one sense, ‘written’ by the networks as a Hollywood blockbuster—an immediate se- quel to 2001’s widely anticipated Pearl Harbor.”7 Did the main TV chan- nels challenge, say, the dangers of the Patriot Act for civil liberties? NBC and CBS did not have a single story on it during the process leading to its adoption.8 This was a period when a bastion of liberalism such as the New York Times had columnists writing that the new war on terrorism was the beginning of World War III and printed on the front page false news about Saddam Hussein possessing weapons of mass destruction. Not surprisingly, by early March 2003, according to a Gallup poll, 88 percent of Americans believed that 9/11 was the product of terrorists supported by Saddam Hussein, or that 79 percent believed him to either possess or to be close to possessing nuclear weapons. Counterterrorist thinking is so haunted by the phantoms of the Terrorist monster that there is no other alternative than a crusade against the “forces of Evil.” The ultimate outcome of such discourse is the justification as inevitable of the just war against the phantom of terrorism, presumably the only just war in the nuclear era. It therefore becomes an intellectual and political imperative to resist counterterrorist discourse and practice. Chapter 7 will dwell on the deceptive rhetorics of “war” and the all too obvious displacements of our own military’s nuclear fears to the threat of nuclear terrorism. This first chapter will focus on terrorism discourse and rhetorics per se.</span></strong><br />

The aff’s reductionist view of Iran produces a self-fulfilling prophecy - contrasting the free west to the enemy east.<br />

<strong>The literature on Iran treats modernity and tradition as fixed and immutable concepts. Therefore, depending on the perspective of various authors, the Islamic Republic is treated as either good or evil. This predominant ontological assumption drives not only theories that either value modernity or tradition, but also generates the types of questions, hypotheses, data, and conclusions. In other words, treating values as facts has produced different images of the same picture that do not fit together at all. A great example of this ontological perspective driving and creating its own facts was when Iran arrested 15 British soldiers. The divergences of statement of facts illustrated that facts are value-driven rather than based on some generalizable objectives. In that dispute, both material and conceptual facts such as technology, geography, witnesses, words, images, and narratives merely reinforced two different existential realities embedded in two contending discourses. Hence, facts were not about verification of some objective, verifiable, or tangible reality that could be proven. Instead facts were driven by values. That incident was one more example of how ontology drove facts. In other words, my argument in this paper is not to prove, falsify, or verify the “trueness” of these realities are the, it is rather to question and deconstruct them. In other words, I would like to offer a better understanding of the content of how both U.S. and Iranian political pundits and parishioners reproduce this animosity because, by default, they are also embedded in, and driven by, the same reductionist ontological worldview that have inflicted the main body of the literature on Iran. That is, representing the Islamic Republic of Iran as a failure of modernity or a return to a Shi’i Islamic tradition. What do Political Pundits Say About Iran? In regards to Iran’s relations with the West in general and the United States in particular, political pundits, who have extensively written on Iran, also have a reductionist worldview of good versus evil. From this reductionist worldview, the solution to confront Iran is also reductionistic. Generally, it is about two approaches—confronting Iran or containing Iran. However, both of these policies essentially presuppose Iran as an enemy, and this presupposition has become a productive self-fulfilled prophecy. 4For example, on the right, Michael Ledeen, argues that there is a natural contrast between the West as a freedom lover and Iran as “an enemy that never [hides] its intention to destroy or dominate us.” 3 Then Ledeen, off course, calls for an immediate confrontation with Iran before it is too late. On the left, Kenneth Pollack, former advisor to the National Security Council during both Clinton and Bush administrations, attempts to reveal the complexity of US-Iran relations by examining the historical circumstances that have helped construct what he labels as an Iranian “pathological nationalism.” Then he argues that since Iranians have already “mis-learned” their history, it is highly unlikely that the “truth” of history would be revealed to them, therefore, the U.S. must lead a multilateral policy to contain the Iranian menace. 4 In the same way, in the official state discourse in Iran, there are only two approaches to the U.S. For some, the best way to deal with the U.S. is to contain its inherent menace by not provoking it, but simultaneously not allowing it to expand its influence in Iran or the region. On the other hand, in a manner very similar to how, for example, Ledeen represents Iran, there are Iranian confrontationalists, who symbolize the U.S. as belligerent power that aims to exploit, corrupt, dominate, and destroy Iran or Islam. Labels such as “the Great Satan,” “the Arrogant America,” “Death to American,” “America the Bully (Amerikay-yah zoor gu),” “Murderous America (Amerika-yah Jani), etc. are abundant in their language. It appears that for confrontationalists on both sides, each is not only the most serious threat to the other, but also the most serious threat to the world. These two dominant approaches are reflected in the popular media too. 3 4 5For example, from Oct 10, to Nov. 11, 2007, I examined the front pages of the largest mainstream daily in Iran, the word “America” showed up in 48 titles, forty-six of which depicted American as a threat. In contrast, in the same period, the word “Iran” showed up in thirty-eight titles of the New York Times, thirty-six of which presupposed Iran as a negative force for both Iranians and Americans. In the final analysis, these representations and analyses are embedded in the construction of a simplistic worldview of good versus evil that cannot and have not contributed to reducing either tension or resolving the conflicts. Instead, they have reproduced themselves. Moreover, since both have used demonizing the other as a way of defeating their domestic rivals, for the past 29 years, these policies have had self-fulfilling prophecies. As such, in this research, I allow the empirical evidence to speak for itself. This does not mean that I am completely neutral in my values. It only means that I consciously try to analyze texts dialogically.</strong><br />

By framing China policy as an issue of crisis management promulgates China threat discourse and a policy of controlling China behind a veil of management.<br />
Pan <strong>20</strong>04 <strong>(Chengxin, Professor of Political Science at Australia National University, “China Threat In American Self-Imagination” Alternatives Volume 29, number 3, p. 305-331, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Containing China is of course not the only option arising from the &quot;China threat&quot; literature. More often than not, there is a subtle, business-style &quot;crisis management&quot; policy. For example, Bernstein and Munro shy away from the word containment, preferring to call their China policy management. (69) Yet, what remains unchanged in the management formula is a continued promotion of controlling China. For instance, a perusal of Bernstein and Munro's texts reveals that what they mean by management is no different than Krauthammer's explicit containment stance. (70) By framing U.S.-China relations as an issue of &quot;crisis management,&quot; they leave little doubt of who is the &quot;manager&quot; and who is to be &quot;managed.&quot; In a more straightforward manner, Betts and Christensen state that coercion and war must be part and parcel of the China management policy: In addressing the China challenge, the United States needs to think hard about three related questions: first, how to avoid crises and war through prudent, coercive diplomacy; second, how to manage crises and fight a war if the avoidance effort fails; third, how to end crises and terminate war at costs acceptable to the United States and its allies. (71) This is not to imply that the kind of perspectives outlined above will automatically be translated into actual China policy, but one does not have to be exceedingly perceptive to note that the &quot;China threat&quot; perspective does exert enormous influence on U.S. policy making on China. To illustrate this point, I want now to examine some specific implications of U.S. representations of the &quot;China threat&quot; for U.S.-China relations in relation to the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis and the &quot;spy plane&quot; incident of 2001. Theory as Practice 1: The Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis In the eyes of many U.S. China watchers, China's approach to the Taiwan question is a microcosm of its grand strategy to dominate Asia. The argument is that nowhere is the threatening ambition more palpable than in China's saber-rattling missile tests near Taiwan's coast in 1995-1996, in addition to its long-standing refusal to renounce the use of force as a last resort to settle the dispute. (72) While the 1995-1996 missile crisis has been a favorite &quot;starting point&quot; for many pundits and practitioners to paint a frightening picture of China and to justify U.S. firm response to it, what is often conveniently overlooked is the question of how the &quot;China threat&quot; discourse itself had played a constitutive role in the lead-up to that crisis. Limits of space forbid exploring this complex issue here. Simply put, the Taiwan question was created largely as a result of widespread U.S. perceptions of China as a &quot;Red Menace&quot; in the wake of the &quot;loss of China&quot; and the outbreak of the Korean War. To thwart what it saw as an orchestrated Communist offensive in Asia, the United States deployed the U.S. Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait as part of its Cold War containment strategy, thereby effectively preventing the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. While the United States abandoned its containment and isolation policy toward China in the 1970s and the two countries established full diplomatic relations in 1979, the conventional image of the &quot;Red Menace&quot; lingered on in the United States. To manage such a &quot;threat,&quot; the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act shortly after the normalization of U.S.-China relations, renewing U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense even though diplomatic ties with the island had been severed. (73) This confrontational policy serves not only to shore up Taiwan's defense capabilities but also to induce its independent ambition and further complicate cross-strait relations. As former U.S. defense official Chas Freeman remarked, &quot;U.S. arms sales to Taiwan no longer work to boost Taipei's confidence that it can work out its differences with Beijing. Instead, they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its own way.&quot; (74) For instance, amid growing sympathy from the Republican-dominated Congress and the elite media as well as the expanded ties with the United States, Taiwan responded coolly to Beijing's call for dialogue in January 1995. In June 1995, Taiwan's flexible diplomacy, designed to burnish its independent image, culminated in its president Lee Teng-hui's high-profile visit to the United States. This in turn reinforced Beijing's suspicion that the real U.S. intention was to frustrate its reunification goal, leaving it apparently no other choice but to prepare militarily for what it saw as a worst-case scenario. All this constituted the major context in which the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait missile exercises took place. For most Chinese, the carrying out of these military exercises, well within their own territory, had little to do with attacking Taiwan, much less with challenging U.S. security interests in the western Pacific, Rather, it was about China's long-cherished dream of national unity, with its &quot;sabre rattling&quot; tactics serving merely as a warning to the United States, as well as to Taiwan. However, interpreting such exercises as China's muscle-flexing with direct security implications for the region, with &quot;an almost 19th-century display of gunboat diplomacy,&quot; (75) the United States dispatched two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers to the region of Taiwan. While not denying the potential security repercussions of China's missile tests for the region, I suggest that the flashpoint of Taiwan says as much about the danger of this U.S. approach to China as about the threat of Beijing's display of force itself. &quot;Had Bill Clinton projected a constancy of purpose and vision in China policy ... in 1993-1994,&quot; David M. Lampton argues, &quot;he might not have been challenged in the Taiwan Strait in 1995-1996 with missile exercises.&quot; (76) Indeed, it was primarily in the context of this U.S. intervention that Zhongguo keyi shuo bu (China can say no), one of the most anti-U.S. books ever produced in China, emerged and quickly became a best-seller in the Chinese reading world. (77) Mean-while, some Chinese strategic thinkers were so alarmed by the U.S. show of strength that they told Helmut Sonnenfeldt, one of Henry Kissinger's close associates, that they were rereading the early works of George F. Kennan because &quot;containment had been the basis of American policy toward the Soviet Union; now that the United States was turning containment against China, they wanted to learn how it had started and evolved.&quot; (78) If such a scary interaction between the United States and China remained somehow obscured here, it would soon be manifested again in another standoff in U.S.-China relations; namely, the spy-plane incident of 2001.</strong><br />

The idea Russia is a threat is a dirty lie that conflates the current system with a paranoid fear that triggers the threat spiral causing a self fulfilling prophecy.<br />

<br />
<strong>Security is a field of practice into which subject matters can be inserted as well as exempted. Security is a code for going about a particular business in very particular ways. By labeling an issue a security issue, that is, a threat to security, one legitimises the employment of extraordinary measures to counter the threat, because it threatens security. In other words, security is a self-referential practice that carries its own legitimisation and justification. Security issues are allotted priority above everything else because everything else is irrelevant if sovereignty is lost, the state loses independence and ceases to exist. This makes for the point that it is not security as an objective or a state of affairs that is the crux of understanding security, but rather the typical operations and modalities by which security comes into play, Wæver (1995) notes.15 The typical operations are speech-acts and the modality threat-defence sequences. That is, perceiving and conveying threats and calling upon defence hold back the alleged threat. This is also a self-referential practice with the dynamic of a security dilemma: Defensive measures taken with reference to a perceived threat cause increased sense of insecurity and new calls for defence, and so forth. Wæver’s argument is that this logic is at work also in other fields than those busying themselves with military defence of sovereignty. Moreover, viewing security as a speech act not only makes it possible to include different sectors in a study of security, and thus open up the concept. It also clears the way for resolving security concerns by desecuritising issues which through securitisation have raised the concern in the first place. Knowing the logic of securitisation and pinning it down when it is at work carries the possibility of reversing the process by advocating other modalities for dealing with a given issue unluckily cast as a matter of security. What is perceived as a threat and therefore invoking defence, triggering the spiral, might be perceived of otherwise, namely as a matter of political discord to be resolved by means of ordinary political conduct, (i.e. not by rallying in defence of sovereignty). A call for more security will not eliminate threats and dangers. It is a call for more insecurity as it will reproduce threats and perpetuate a security problem. As Wæver (1994:8)16 puts it:&quot;Transcending a security problem, politicizing a problem can therefore not happen through thematization in terms of security, only away from it.&quot; That is what de-securitisation is about. David Campbell (1992) has taken the discursive approach to security one step further. He demonstrates that security is pretty much the business of (state) identity. His argument is developed from the claim that foreign policy is a discourse of danger that came to replace Christianity’s evangelism of fear in the wake of the Westphalian peace. But the effects of a &quot;evangelism of fear&quot; and a discourse of danger are similar – namely to produce a certitude of identity by depicting difference as otherness. As the Peace of Westphalia signified the replacement of church by state, faith by reason, religion by science, intuition by experience and tradition by modernity, the religious identity of salvation by othering evil (&quot;think continually about death in order to avoid sin, because sin plus death will land you in hell&quot;17 –so better beware of Jews, heretics, witches and temptations of the flesh) was replaced by a hidden ambiguity of the state. Since modernity’s privileging of reason erased the possibility of grounding social organisation in faith, it had to be propped up by reason and the sovereign state as a anthropomorphic representation of sovereign Man was offered as a resolution. But state identity cannot easily be produced by reason alone. The problem was, however, that once the &quot;death of God&quot; had been proclaimed, the link between the world, &quot;man&quot; and certitude had been broken (Campbell 1992: 53). Thus ambiguity prevailed in the modernist imperative that every presumption grounded in faith be revealed by reason, and on the other hand, that the privileging of modernity, the state, and reason itself is not possible without an element of faith. In Campbell’s (1992: 54) words: In this context of incipient ambiguity brought upon by an insistence that can no longer be grounded, securing identity in the form of the state requires an emphasis on the unfinished and endangered nature of the world. In other words, discourses of &quot;danger&quot; are central to the discourses of the &quot;state&quot; and the discourses of &quot;man&quot;. In place of the spiritual certitude that provided the vertical intensity to support the horizontal extenciveness of Christendom, the state requires discourses of &quot;danger&quot; to provide a new theology of truth about who and what &quot;we&quot; are by highlighting who and what &quot;we&quot; are not, and what &quot;we&quot; have to fear. The mode through which the Campbellian discourse of danger is employed in foreign (and security) policy, can then be seen as practices of Wæverian securitisation. Securitisation is the mode of discourse and the discourse is a &quot;discourse of danger&quot; identifying and naming threats, thereby delineating Self from Other and thus making it clear what it is &quot;we&quot; are protecting, (i.e. what is &quot;us&quot;, what is our identity and therefore – as representation – what is state identity). This is done by pointing out danger, threats and enemies, internal and external alike, and – by linking the two (Campbell 1992: 239): For the state, identity can be understood as the outcome of exclusionary practices in which resistant elements to a secure identity on the &quot;inside&quot; are linked through a discourse of danger (such as Foreign Policy) with threats identified and located on the &quot;outside&quot;. To speak security is then to employ a discourse of danger inter-subjectively depicting that which is different from Self as an existential threat – and therefore as Other to Self. Securitisation is about the identity of that which is securitised on behalf of, a discursive practice to (re)produce the identity of the state. Securitising implies &quot;othering&quot; difference – making difference the Other in a binary opposition constituting Self (Neumann 1996b: 167). Turning to the Baltic Sea Region, one cannot help noting the rather loose fitting between the undeniable – indeed underscored – state focus in the works of both David Campbell and the Copenhagen School on the one hand, and the somewhat wishful speculations of regionality beyond the state – transcending sovereignty – on the other. Coupling the two is not necessarily an analytical problem. It only makes a rather weak case for regionality. But exactly that becomes a theoretical problem in undermining the very theoretical substance, and by implication – empirical viability – of regionality. There are of course indications that the role of states are relativised in late modern (or post- modern) politics. And there is reason to expect current developments in the security problematique of the Baltic states – firmly connected to the dynamic of NATO’s enlargement – to exert an impact on regional co-operation in the Baltic Sea Region, possibly even on regionality. NATO moving east, engaging Russia and carrying elements of the post-modernist security agenda with it in the process, is likely to narrow the gap between the two agendas. Moreover, since the Baltic states are not included in a first round of expansion, they might in this very fact (failure, some would say) find an incentive for shifting focus from international to regional levels. Involving Poland and engaging Russia, the enlargement of NATO will in fact bring the Alliance as such (not only individual NATO countries as the case has been) to bear increasingly on the regional setting as well as on regional activity. That might add significance to the regional level. It does not, however, necessarily imply that the state as actor and state centric approaches will succumb to regionality. Neither does it do away with the state as the prime referent for, and producer of, collective identity, so central to the approaches of both Wæver and Campbell. But it might spur a parallel to sovereignty. A way out of this theoretical impasse would then be not to stress the either or of regionality/sovereignty, but to see the two as organising principles at work side by side, complementing each other in parallelity rather than excluding one another in contrariety. The Discourse of Danger: The Russian war on Chechnya is one event that was widely interpreted in the Baltic as a ominous sign of what Russia has in store for the Baltic states (see Rebas 1996: 27; Nekrasas 1996: 58; Tarand 1996: 24; cf. Haab 1997). The constitutional ban in all three states on any kind of association with post-Soviet political structures is indicative of a threat perception that confuses Soviet and post- Soviet, conflating Russia with the USSR and casting everything Russian as a threat through what Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe (1985) call a discursive &quot;chain of equivalence&quot;. In this the value of one side in a binary opposition is reiterated in other denotations of the same binary opposition. Thus, the value &quot;Russia&quot; in a Russia/Europe-opposition is also denoted by &quot;instability&quot;, &quot;Asia&quot;, &quot;invasion&quot;, &quot;chaos&quot;, &quot;incitement of ethnic minorities&quot;, &quot;unpredictability&quot;, &quot;imperialism&quot;, &quot;slander campaign&quot;, &quot;migration&quot;, and so forth. The opposite value of these markers (&quot;stability&quot;, &quot;Europe&quot;, &quot;defence&quot;, &quot;order&quot;, and so on) would then denote the Self and thus conjure up an identity. When identity is precarious, this discursive practice intensifies by shifting onto a security mode, treating the oppositions as if they were questions of political existence, sovereignty, and survival. Identity is (re)produced more effectively when the oppositions are employed in a discourse of in-security and danger, that is, made into questions of national security and thus securitised in the Wæverian sense. In the Baltic cases, especially the Lithuanian National Security Concept is knitting a chain of equivalence in a ferocious discourse of danger. Not only does it establish &quot;[t]hat the defence of Lithuania is total and unconditional,&quot; and that &quot;[s]hould there be no higher command, self-controlled combat actions of armed units and citizens shall be considered legal.&quot; (National Security Concept, Lithuania, Ch. 7, Sc. 1, 2) It also posits that [t]he power of civic resistance is constituted of the Nation’s Will and self-determination to fight for own freedom, of everyone citizen’s resolution to resist to [an] assailant or invader by all possible ways, despite citizen’s age and [or] profession, of taking part in Lithuania’s defence (National Security Concept, Lithuania, Ch. 7, Sc. 4). When this is added to the identifying of the objects of national security as &quot;human and citizen rights, fundamental freedoms and personal security; state sovereignty; rights of the nation, prerequisites for a free development; the state independence; the constitutional order; state territory and its integrity, and; cultural heritage,&quot; and the subjects as &quot;the state, the armed forces and other institutions thereof; the citizens and their associations, and; non governmental organisations,&quot;(National Security Concept, Lithuania, Ch. 2, Sc. 1, 2) one approaches a conception of security in which the distinction between state and nation has disappeared in all-encompassing securitisation. Everyone is expected to defend everything with every possible means. And when the list of identified threats to national security that follows range from &quot;overt (military) aggression&quot;, via &quot;personal insecurity&quot;, to &quot;ignoring of national values,&quot;(National Security Concept, Lithuania, Ch. 10) the National Security Concept of Lithuania has become a totalising one taking everything to be a question of national security. The chain of equivalence is established when the very introduction of the National Security Concept is devoted to a denotation of Lithuania’s century-old sameness to &quot;Europe&quot; and resistance to &quot;occupation and subjugation&quot; (see quotation below), whereby Russia is depicted and installed as the first link in the discursive chain that follows.</strong><br />

Traditional policymaking and security analyst studies within the discipline makes an effective solution impossible because it refuses to acknowledge the West’s role in the conflict and understand North Korea’s point of view.<br />

<strong>Few conflicts are as protracted as the one in Korea, where deeply hostile and anachronistic Cold War attitudes have posed major security problems for half a century. To be more precise, two specters haunt the peninsula: a military escalation, even outright war, and a North Korean collapse, which could easily destabilize the northeast Asian region.1 Dealing with North Korea is perhaps one of the most difficult security challenges in global politics today. Totalitarian and reclusive, ideologically isolated and economically ruined, it is the inherent “other” in a globalized and neoliberal world order. Yet North Korea survives, not least because its leaders periodically rely on threats, such as nuclear brinkmanship, to gain concessions from the international community. The latest such attempt occurred in the autumn of 2002, when Pyongyang admitted to a secret nuclear weapons program and subsequently withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. From then on, the situation rapidly deteriorated. By early 2003 both the United States and North Korea were threatening each other with outright war. Even Japan, in its most militaristic posture in decades, publicly contemplated the possibility of a preemptive strike against North Korea.2 The dangers of North Korea’s nuclear brinkmanship are evident and much discussed. Miscalculations or a sudden escalation could precipitate a human disaster at any moment. Equally dangerous, although much less evident, are the confrontational and militaristic attitudes with which some of the key regional and global players seek to contain the volatile situation. Particularly problematic is the approach of the most influential external actor on the peninsula, the United States. Washington’s inability to see North Korea as anything but a threatening “rogue state” seriously hinders both an adequate understanding and potential resolution of the conflict. Few policy makers, security analysts, and journalists ever try to imagine how North Korean decision makers perceive these threats and how these perceptions are part of an interactive security dilemma in which the West is implicated as much as is the vilified regime in Pyongyang. Particularly significant is the current policy of preemptive strikes against rogue states, for it reinforces half a century of American nuclear threats toward North Korea. The problematic role of these threats has been largely obscured, not least because the highly technical discourse of security analysis has managed to present the strategic situation on the peninsula in a manner that attributes responsibility for the crisis solely to North Korea’s actions, even if the situation is in reality far more complex and interactive. A fundamental rethinking of security is required if the current culture of insecurity is to give way to a more stable and peaceful environment. Contributing to this task is my main objective of this book. I do so by exploring insights and options broader than those articulated by most security studies specialists. While pursuing this objective I offer neither a comprehensive take on the Korean security situation nor a detailed update on the latest events. Various excel- lent books have already done so.3 I seek not new facts and data but new perspectives. I identify broad patterns of conflict and embark on a conceptual engagement with some of the ensuing dilemmas. I aspire to what Gertrude Stein sought to capture through a poetic metaphor:4 the political and moral obligation to question the im- mutability of the status quo; the need to replace old and highly problematic Cold War thinking patterns with new and more sensitive attempts to address the dilemmas of Korean security.</strong><br />

NATO utilizes a grammar of security and is premised off of maintaining deterrence.<br />

<strong>Language games of family structure the public texts of both alliances during the Cold War in slightly different ways. Both rely on a grammar of security, but the structuring rules of each family are different. This does not mean that any one writer is forced to use exactly the same words, but that they draw on a shared language comprising clusters of concepts belonging to a grammar of families and security. The following story illustrates the structure of relationships underlying this versatile grammar at the beginning of the I980s. A main point is that these do not represent the interpretations of individuals but, rather, a public language that reappears again and again and, subsequently, constitutes the identities of NATO and the Warsaw Pact as well as knowledge of what they do. The relationship between the NATO discourse of security and the construction of NATO as a family is evident from the texts of this organization in the early 1980s. The nuclear family of the West is built on a commitment between a stronger partner and a weaker one. The title of one article in the NATO Review, “The Atlantic Family—Managing Its Problems,” names the metaphor directly.10 This family includes partners whose stable relationship is characterized by commitment, faithfulness, duties, responsibilities, common burdens, and obligations. The stronger partner has gotten into the habit of making most of the decisions, however, partly because of his more global responsibilities, in contrast to the primarily domestic responsibilities of the other. This relationship, which “is now an old one,”11 has become no less intense over the years. The partners are bound by what bound them forty years ago, and they would not feel safe if they could not rely on each other. As one partner described it, “their safety and ours are one.”12; “we were with you and are with you now, our hopes are your hopes, your destiny is our destiny.”13 The stable and secure relationship of NATO’S nuclear family is based on a foundation of values and friendship, as well as inequality, given that the two differ in capabilities. The stronger one offers protection and ensures the security of the weaker, who cannot feel secure on her own, in the face of the Soviet Union, who wants to isolate the two, making the feminine partner docile, productive, and supportive. The main objective of the Soviet Union is to split or decouple the partners. The neighboring enemy to the East also refers to its unit as a family, although based on different values. They occupy a home, but it seems to be a very masculine family, fraternal and attached to a fatherland, where everyone is said to be equal. It is a particular kind of individual that is protected by the fraternal family, the laborer, and the socialist system in which he labors. Like NATO, the Soviet Union is concerned with preventing a shattering of the unity of this family by an interference in its domestic space. Poland, in the early I980s, is a key concern precisely because it is the place where this interference is said to be most evident, and a space most vital to the maintenance of international security. Actors in both households are concerned that their unity is being shattered; both are protecting a set of values. This difference in values is said to be the cause of conflict between them. In the West, security was inseparable from the need to secure the space of Western Europe, the securing of a feminine object by a masculine subject, the United States. The relationship was consensual, based on a shared history and culture, and less imposed by the Americans than desired by the Europeans—although the balance between these two was precarious—but the relationship, nonetheless, involved the securing of a larger continental space by an external power. While the Warsaw Pact also presents itself as a family, the Soviet Union actually focuses its gaze, like the United States, on Western Europe and its relationship with the United States. The Soviet Union transforms the hierarchical commitment and need expressed by NATO into the imposed obedience of Western Europe to the diktat of the United States. For the Soviet Union, the Western alliance is a form of imprisonment, done by people overseas, not present, not part of the European continent. While Western Europe was the feminine object that held each superpower’s attention, Eastern Europe lacked any identity whatsoever, largely invisible, nondescript, historically abandoned, visible only as a domestic space in which the West should not interfere. The two family spheres in East and West, as well as the security dilemma constituted between them, were mutually reinforcing, a family feud in which the Other was not to be trusted because of the lack of correspondence between words and deeds. In the early 1980s, both East and West are consumed by the need to keep their families together, in light of a renewed threat from the Other and the activities of a “younger generation,” which begins to question the fundamental values on which each family is based. The naming of oppositional movements as a younger generation is particularly evident in NATO documents, in which the Western peace movement is characterized, among other things, as “immature, naive, and irresponsible.”14 The connotation of this particular label is that these movements are made up of rebellious kids reminiscent of the 1960s.15 Participants in the peace movements have not been necessarily young, however, as various opinion polls have demonstrated.16 This labeling effort on the part of NATO communicates a particular image of these movements and what they are about, that is, overturning a set of values by which peace has been maintained in Europe since World War II. While Eastern European dissidents are cast in less familial terms by state officials, the conflict has been discussed by many as the difference between the World War II generation and those who grew up in the relative wealth and security of the postwar period.17 While the two families are concerned with providing security for their domestic spaces, the younger generation in each house is attempting to emancipate itself from the destructive practices of its respective family. In this sense the critical movements take these language games of security very seriously: while the families claim to provide security, the oppositional movements expose or rename this security as a source of insecurity. Their actions relate to this same grammar of families or intimate relationships, but they make a different move in the game, based on a renaming of the relationship. Emancipation, and the cluster of concepts belonging to it, is a game that can belong to a grammar of families,18 but it is not within the realm of possibility in alliance games based on the permanence of a particular family structure. The structuring role of these concepts is evident in the texts of Solidarity and the Western European peace movement. The central value of the Eastern house is protecting workers in the process of building socialism. Yet as the protector becomes a source of threat to workers, KOR (Worker’s Defence Committee), and later Solidarity in Poland, attempt to expose abuse by the party and state of those rights that the latter has promised to protect, both in its own constitution and in signing the international Helsinki accords. The younger generation is revolting against the oppressive control of the family over all spheres of life and wants to open up a dialogue with the government so that society can take its fate into its own hands, speak with its own voice, and develop its own self-governing and independent institutions. In the West, while the alliance partners claim to be protecting the Western family, the acquisition of more and more sophisticated weapons as well as heightened tensions between the two families are making many feel insecure. While the family names the neighbor as the source of threat, the peace movement names the deployment of a new generation of weapons, as well as nuclear weapons and deterrence in general, as the primary threat. Like Solidarity, the Western peace movement is busy exposing a distinction between the words and the deeds of the older generation. Social movements in both houses are calling for emancipation from a particular form of politics, a politics that has become a source of insecurity. At the international level, talk between the two households, in its present form, serves only to fix the antagonistic relationship between them. The main function of this antagonism, and the negotiations by which it is preserved, is in their view to discipline the younger generation and the alliance partners. That which the alliance names a relationship of security and protection, the Western European peace movement renames a relationship of dependence and submission. They call on Europeans within each alliance to reclaim responsibility for their own lives by taking a more independent role, disengaging from the military side of the relationship, and liberating themselves from the ideology of the Cold War. Common security between East and West requires loosening the hold of the two families and opening up spaces for more voices to speak. The foundations of each bloc enclose two different kinds of families—neighbors who cannot get along because of a difference in values. In both houses the younger generation is making different moves within these family games, pointing out the distinction between the claim to provide security and protection and what is in fact being done. The analysis can be broadened by looking at the relationship between these family games and a structural change over a longer period of time. The structural grammar was recovered from a larger range of documents, involving the same actors, covering the period from 1975 to 1991? when the Soviet Union collapsed. This involved pulling out predicates related to a range of attributes, from ceilings to walls to foundations, as well as a range of possible moves, both active and passive (for instance, maintaining, building, eroding, undermining, restoring, and so on), and attempting to delineate patterns of action attached to specific actors. What follows is a rough sketch of moves in language games by which the structures of the Cold War were dismantled. Following this I will return to the further transformation of both security grammars in the post-Cold War world. DISMANTLING THE COLD WAR STRUCTURES In the mid–1970s, at the height of detente, following the signing of the Helsinki Final Act by the states participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), both superpowers engage in acts of structural maintenance. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization provides a framework that rests on the foundations of deterrence capability and transatlantic ties; NATO is a political structure furnished with military means, a structure whose central task is one of maintaining deterrence, defense capabilities, and the political cohesion that provides the cement of the foundation. Likewise, the socialist family of the Eastern bloc also provides a framework that rests on the foundations of socialist production, Marxism-Leninism, and the unity of the socialist countries. The socialist alliance is the cornerstone of relations between the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. As in NATO, maintenance is a central task of the Warsaw Pact, in this case the object of which is socialism, peace, and equilibrium. Detente also provides a framework that needs to be maintained.</strong><br />

‘Economic Security’ provides the foundation for national security co-opting the left in it’s project of deeming ‘threats’ to the new liberal order.<br />
Neocleous <strong>20</strong>06 <strong>(Mark, Professor in the Department of Politics and History at Brunel University “From Social to National Security: On the Fabrication of Economic Order” Security Dialogue 2006; 37; pdf, p. 376-380, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Robert Pollard (1985: 13) has suggested that ‘the concept of “economic security” – the idea that American interests would be best served by an open and integrated economic system, as opposed to a large peacetime military establishment – was firmly established during the wartime period’. In fact, the concept of ‘economic security’ became a concept of international politics in this period, becoming liberalism’s strategic weapon of choice and the main policy instrument from 1945 (Latham, 1997: 143; Pollard, 1985: 3), but the concept itself had longer history, as we have seen. Economic security, in this sense, provides the important link between social and national security. As a weapon of choice, it would be used as diplomatic leverage in arguments for international aid. As one State Department memo of February 1944 put it, ‘the development of sound international economic relations is closely related to the problem of security’ (cited in Pollard, 1985: 13). But, it would also continue to be used to think about the political administration of internal order. Hence Roosevelt’s comment in December 1943 that ‘we must plan for, and help to bring about, an expanded economy which will result in more security . . . so that the conditions of 1932 and the beginning of 1933 won’t come back again’ (Roosevelt, 1950b: 574). On security grounds, inside and outside were constantly folding into one another, the domestic and the foreign never quite properly distinguishable. The reason why lay in the kind of economic order that was being secured. Take, as a starting point, the European Recovery Program (ERP, or Marshall Plan). This has generally been understood as a huge economic panacea, ‘saving’ Europe from economic disaster. However, Alan Milward has sug- gested that this conventional reading of the Marshall Plan and US aid tends to accept the picture of postwar Europe on the verge of collapse and with serious social and economic discontent, such that it needed to be rescued by US aid. In fact, excluding Germany, no country was actually on the verge of collapse. There were no bank crashes and very few bankruptcies, and the evidence of a slowdown in industrial production is unconvincing. There is also little evidence of grave distress or a general deterioration in the standard of living. By late 1946, production had roughly equalled prewar levels in all countries except Germany. And yet Marshall Aid came about. Milward argues that the Marshall Plan was designed not to increase the rate of recovery in European countries or to prevent European economies from deteriorating, but to sustain ambitious, new, expansionary economic and social policies in Western European countries (which were already in full bloom conditions). In other words, the Marshall Plan was predominantly designed for political objectives (Milward, 1984; Kolko &amp; Kolko, 1972; Leffler, 1992). This is why the Marshall Plan was so inextricably linked to the Truman Doctrine’s strategy of new global commitment, at the heart of which was the possibility of intervention in the affairs of other countries in order to rebut a perceived worldwide trend away from the ‘system of free enterprise’. The point here is not just that the Marshall Plan was ‘political’. It is fairly clear that the Marshall Plan was multidimensional, and to distinguish reasons that are ‘economic’ from reasons that are ‘political’ misses the extent to which the economic, political and military were entwined. The point is that it was very much a project driven by the ideology of ‘security’. The referent object of ‘security’ in this context is ‘economic order’, viz., capitalist order. The government and the emerging national security bureaucracy saw the major threat as economic – or, at least, the potential of a counter-hegemonic power exploiting economic disorder – as far more important and likely than military confrontation. As Latham (1997: 175) notes, at first glance the idea of military security within a broad context of economic containment appears to be one more dimension of strength within the liberal order. But, in another respect, the project of economic security might itself be viewed as the very force that made military security appear to be necessary. In this sense, the priority given to economic security was the driving force behind the US commitment to underwrite military security for Western Europe. More to the point, however, is that the Marshall Plan and Truman Doctrine implied not just a programme for ‘economic security’, but an attempt at reordering global capital. And this project was also undertaken in the guise of national security. NSC-68, the most significant national security document to emerge in this period, stated that the ‘overall policy at the present time may be described as one designed to foster a world environment in which the American system can survive and flourish’ (National Security Council, 1950: 401). In this sense, we can also read the Bretton Woods institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of 1947, as part and parcel of the security project (Mastanduno, 1998; Pollard, 1985). The key institutions of ‘international order’ in this period invoked a particular vision of order, with a view to reshaping global capital as a means of bringing social order and thus security – political, social and economic – from the communist threat. ‘Communist’, that is, as opposed to ‘Soviet’. Communism, of course, pre-dates and exceeds the Soviet Union. But, the nature of the military threat ascribed to the latter is related to the character of the former as a more gen- eral threat to the system of private property. The implication drawn from this by David Campbell (1992: 159) is that ‘the well-developed antipathy towards communism within the United States stems from the way in which the danger to the private ownership of property it embodies is a code for distinguishing the “civilized” from the “barbaric”’. This, Campbell suggests, is the basis for the interpretive framework that constituted the Soviet Union as a danger independent of its actual military capacity. Thus, the rise of the national security state was not dependent on any supposed military threat posed by the Soviet Union; even the US national security managers correctly identified this at the time as both limited and weak. Indeed, in many ways the Soviet Union was a side issue. NSC-68, the most significant national security document to emerge in this period, stated that the policy of creating a world environment in which the American system can survive and flourish embraces two subsidiary polices: ‘One is a policy which we would probably pursue even if there were no Soviet threat. It is a policy of attempting to develop a healthy international community. The other is the policy of “containing” the Soviet system’. Thus, the document later adds, ‘even if there were no Soviet Union we would face the problem of the free society . . . of reconciling order, security, the need for participation, with the requirements of freedom’ (National Security Council, 1950: 401, 412). The policies would have been followed, then, even if there were no Soviet threat. The issue was communism as a threat to private property, and thus to the vision of an ‘economic order’ of the ‘civilized West’; that is, communism as an alternative socio-economic order, not the Soviets as a military threat. And the real danger of this communism was that it might reside within the civilized West rather than ‘over there’ in the East. Just as communism was/is a problem of the ‘inside’ as well as the outside, so the security solution had to straddle the domestic and the foreign. The mediating link between inside and outside, the concept through which the attempt to reshape capital could oscillate between the domestic and foreign, the national and international, was ‘economic security’. Just as the doctrine of containment looked to economic aid to produce the necessary resistance to communism in Europe and elsewhere, policies such as the Marshall Plan mirrored the doctrine of containment, with the Truman government seeking to overcome Congressional recalcitrance to the ERP by promoting it as a security measure (Gaddis, 1982; Latham, 1997; Pollard, 1985; Ambrose, 1985). The major National Security Council documents from 1948 through to 1950 all highlight this dimension of the security project. NSC-20/1 (National Security Council, 1948: 102), for example, noted approv- ingly of the role of the ERP in limiting Soviet influence and thereby securing the USA in its objectives, while NSC-68 (National Security Council, 1950: 408) noted that ‘foreign economic policy is . . . an instrument which can power- fully influence the world environment in ways favourable to the security and welfare of this country’, again citing the ERP as a principle feature of the policy. Similarly, the ‘Military Aid Program’ (MAP) to help rearm Western Europe in the light of an emerging NATO was administered by the State Department rather than the Defense Department because MAP’s main pur- pose was to continue the Marshall Plan’s policy of buttressing economic stability and thus political order in Western Europe. The Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949 explicitly stated this: ‘Congress recognizes that eco- nomic recovery is essential to international peace and security and must be given clear priority’ (cited in Pollard, 1985: 227–228). And, in conjoining security and economy in such ways, the USA was able to gain ideological support for both the politico-strategic and economic dimensions of liberal order- building. The conceptual consistency between the strategy of economic security and liberal order-building meant that ‘economic security’ could be justified on liberal grounds, emphasizing economic (and thus ‘human’) needs over military ones. The fabrication of the new order of global capital could thus look decidedly liberal and humanitarian, an appearance which helped co-opt the liberal Left into the process and, of course, played on indi- viduals’ desire for personal and ‘social’ security by using notions such as ‘personal freedom’ and ‘social equality’ (Latham, 1997: 144–146). All of this is to suggest that although the late 1940s saw the emergence of what has become known as the ‘national security state’, this emergence was heavily driven by the notion of ‘economic security’. In other words, the emerging global power moved very quickly to reassert the connection between economic and national security: the commitment to the former was simultaneously a commitment to the latter, and vice versa. As the doctrine of national security was being born, the major player on the international stage would aim to use perhaps its most important power of all – its economic strength – in order to fabricate a certain vision of economic order, both inter- nally and internationally. Marx and Engels (1848) once highlighted the historical role of the bourgeoisie in shaping the world according to its own interests, pointing out that the need for a constantly expanding market for its products forces the bourgeoisie across the whole surface of the globe and compels all nations to adopt the bourgeois mode of economic order. From the mid-20th century onwards, this project would increasingly be conducted under the guise of security, through which the USA has seen fit to reorder – either overtly or covertly – the affairs of myriad nation-states, even those with democratically elected governments, and to thereby restructure inter- national order more generally. Far from merely ‘reacting’ or ‘responding’ to events, under the guise of national security, the USA has sought to reshape international society, administering global order according to a security doctrine behind which lies a commitment to capital accumulation.</strong><br />

The affirmative treats the environment as a security threat—this guarantees military interventions and collapse of the environment.<br />

<strong>In recent years, presentation of environmental degradation as a security problem has become increasingly common. Environmental activists are not the only ones to use this slogan; the security establishment seems to have become more receptive to the idea, as well. But does it make sense? I would argue &quot;no,&quot; if we follow the logic laid out above. During the 1980s, any idea about &quot;nonmilitary aspects of security&quot; was guaranteed to generate establishment suspicions. The following sequence of reasoning seemed, with some justification, threatening to security elites: (1) security is a broad concept and, therefore, many things are threatening in security terms; (2) in the light of a broader perspective, there exists a biased distribution of resources toward military concerns; and (3) this bias is relevant only for a limited portion of security threats as defined in this broader sense. 38 ....Continued Later In Article.... For example, in late 1989, a special issue of Survival , the journal of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which has always been a good indicator of mainstream, Western security thinking, addressed &quot;Nonmilitary Aspects of Strategy.&quot; Articles in the journal addressed the panoply or possibilities of threats--economy, environment, migration, and drugs 39 --in a search for new security problems to replace the old ones. Notions about environmental security also emerged at the political level, as when James Baker, Secretary of State in the Bush Administration, named environmental problems as &quot;threats to the security of our citizens,&quot; 40 and in the Brundtland Commission's report, Our Common Future , which used explicitly the concept of &quot;environmental security.&quot; Central to the arguments for the conceptual innovation of environmental or ecological security 41 is its mobilization potential....Continued later in article...The security label is a useful way both of signalling bias idanger and setting priority, and for this reason alone it is likely to persist in the environmental debates.&quot; 42 Several analysts have, however, warned against securitization of the environmental issue for some of these very reasons, and some of the arguments I present here fit into the principled issue of securitization/desecuritization as discussed earlier in this chapter. A first argument against the environment as a security issue, mentioned, for example, by Buzan, is that environmental threats are generally unintentional. 43 This, by itself, does not make the threats any less serious , although it does take them out of the realm of will . As I pointed out earlier, the field of security is constituted around relationships between wills: It has been, conventionally, about the efforts of one will to (allegedly) override the sovereignty of another, forcing or tempting the latter not to assert its will in defense of its sovereignty. The contest of concern, in other words, is among strategic actors imbued with intentionality, and this has been the logic around which the whole issue of security has been framed. In light of my earlier discussion, in which I stressed that &quot;security&quot; is not a reflection of our everyday sense of the word but, rather, a specific field with traditions, the jump to environmental security becomes much larger than might appear at first to be the case. I do not present this as an argument against the concept but, rather, as a way of illuminating or even explaining the debate over it. Second in his critique of the notion of environmental security, Richard Moss points out that the concept of &quot;security&quot; tends to imply that defense from the problem is to be provided by the state: The most serious consequence of thinking of global change and other environmental problems as threats to security is that the sorts of centralized governmental responses by powerful and autonomous state organizations that are appropriate for security threats are inappropriate for addressing most environmental problems. When one is reacting to the threat of organized external violence, military and intelligence institutions are empowered to take the measures required to repel the threat. By this same logic, when responding to environmental threats, response by centralized regulatory agencies would seem to be logical. Unfortunately, in most cases this sort of response is not the most efficient or effective way of addressing environmental problems, particularly those that have a global character. 44 Moss goes on to warn that &quot;the instinct for centralized state responses to security threats is highly inappropriate for responding effectively to global environmental problems.&quot; 45 It might, he points out, even lead to militarization of environmental problems. A third warning, not unrelated to the previous two, is the tendency for the concept of security to produce thinking in terms of us-them, which could then be captured by the logic of nationalism. Dan Deudney writes that &quot;the `nation' is not an empty vessel or blank slate waiting to be filled or scripted, but is instead profoundly linked to war and `usvs . them' thinking ( . . . ) Of course, taking the war and `us vs . them' thinking out of nationalism is a noble goal. But this may be like taking sex out of `rock and roll,' a project whose feasibility declines when one remembers that `rock and roll' was originally coined as a euphemism for sex.&quot; 47 The tendency toward &quot;us vs . them&quot; thinking, and the general tradition of viewing threats as coming from outside a state's own borders, are, in this instance, also likely to direct attention away from one's own contributions to environmental problems. 48 Finally, there is the more political warning that the concept of security is basically defensive in nature, a status quo concept defending that which is , even though it does not necessarily deserve to be protected. In a paradoxical way, this politically conservative bias has also led to warnings by some that the concept of environmental security could become a dangerous tool of the &quot;totalitarian left,&quot; which might attempt to relaunch itself on the basis of environmental collectivism. 49 Certainly, there is some risk that the logic of ecology, with its religious potentials and references to holistic categories, survival and the linked significance of everything, might easily lend itself to totalitarian projects, where also the science of ecology has focused largely on how to constrain, limit, and control activities in the name of the environment. 50 These observations point back toward a more general question: Is it a good idea to frame as many problems as possible in terms of security? Does not such a strategy present the negative prospect of, in a metaphorical sense, militarizing our thinking and seeing problems in terms of threat-vulnerability-defense, when there are good reasons for not treating them according to this formula? 51 Use of the slogan &quot;environmental security&quot; is tempting, because it is an effective way of dramatizing environmental problems. In the longer run, however, the practices resulting from the slogan might lead to an inappropriate social construction of the environment, as a threat/defense problem. We might find it more constructive, instead, to thematize the problem in terms of an economy-ecology nexus, where decisions are actually interlinked. 52 Use of the security label does not merely reflect whether a problem is a security problem, it is also a political choice, that is, a decision for conceptualization in a special way. When a problem is &quot;securitized,&quot; the act tends to lead to specific ways of addressing it: Threat, defense, and often state-centered solutions. This, of course, leaves the environmental agenda, with its labelling problem, unresolved. One alternative is to view the emerging values of environmentalism as establishing their own moral basis. As his basis for optimism, for example, Buzan suggests that such values are already emerging as new norms of international society. 53 Deudney, more lyrically, talks about ecological awareness being linked to &quot;a powerful set of values and symbols&quot; that &quot;draw upon basic human desires and aspirations,&quot; and argues that this, and not regressive security logic, should be the basis for mobilization.</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Discourses of danger write american identity in response to otherness and sustains missile hysteria in security discourse.</span><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Few, to be sure, would doubt the sincerity of Secretary Rumsfeld when he averred last June: “I don’t think vulnerability is a (viable) policy.”84 Clearly, Washington’s preoccupation with missile defence has much to do with the Bush Administration’s concern over what it perceives as the strategic vulnerability of America to potential ballistic missile attack. Nonetheless, as important as debates over whether or not the “missile threat” actually exists are to the study and practice of international relations, what is equally if not more fundamental is the question of how discourses of danger figure in the incessant writing of “America” – a particular and quite problematic identity that owes its materiality to textual inscriptions of difference and Otherness. Missile hysteria in US national security discourse cannot be simplistically reduced to the level of an ideological explanation – certainly not according to the classic formulation of Mannheim’s.85 Rather, what this paper has demonstrated is the centrality of difference and deferral in discourse to the identity of America – a discourse of danger, fear, and vulnerability posed by potential missile attacks against the US from “rogue states” and accidental or unauthorized missile launches from a particular “China” or “Russia.” The argument maintained here has been that a particular representation of America does not exist apart from the very differences that allegedly threaten that representation, just as the particular America of recent lore did not exist apart from Cold War-related discourses of danger. If missile defence is (as Bauman, cited earlier, has put it) the “foolproof recipe” for exorcising the ghosts or demons of missile hysteria, then Bush’s national security advisors are the exorcists and shamans as well as the constructors of national insecurity via missile hysteria.86 However, the argument has not been that the Administration, the Rumsfeld Commission, and other missile defence enthusiasts fabricated, ex nihilo, a ballistic missile threat against the US by means of a singular, deliberate “act,” which is what some constructivists in international relations, conspiracy theorists, and partisan Democrats – an interesting if not motley collectivity – would have us believe. Nor has it been that language and discourse is “everything” as linguistic idealists would have us imagine. Rather, through reiterative and coordinated practices by which discourse produces the effects that it names, a certain normative representation of America “emerges” – wrought, as it were, by fear and written into being by missile hysteria.</span></strong><br />

The American ethic causes nuclear war and extinction.<br />

<strong>Awaiting the impending U.S. government's concocted &quot;preventive&quot; war against Iraq (indeed, against the world), this is perhaps one of the most frightening moments in human history. In a surreal scenario, the U.S. government is renewing active threats of using nuclear weapons and reviving use of anti-personnel land mines, and is introducing new technological weapons of death we can only imagine, and some we cannot. As grim as this scene is, I believe it must be the inevitable and logical extension of the continued growth ad nauseum of the American Way Of Life (AWOL) in particular, and the Western Way Of Life in general. Premeditated murder of thousands--perhaps millions--of innocents is the price for AWOL's insatiable consumption and its bloodthirsty vengeance, totally abdicating responsibility for lethal consequences to the planet and its species, including, ironically, our own. Perhaps Gaia is presenting the current transparent dangers to us as like a cosmic gift so that we might actually be able to see the extraordinary folly of our ways in time to creatively &quot;storm the Bastille.&quot;U.S. Terrorist Roots U.S. civilization was founded on and has been sustained by terrorism, facilitated by Eurocentric racism, classism, and arrogant ethnocentrism. The grossest irony of all, of course, is that the &quot;War on Terror,&quot; to be successful, must focus on our own civilization, the most egregious proponent of terror the world has even known. Terror was systematically utilized since our country's beginnings in the 1600s. The following instructions, facilitated by a cruel racism, are part of the historic record: &quot;burning and spoiling the [Indian] country,&quot; (Captain John Underhill, Massachusetts Bay Colony, 1636); &quot;put to death the [Pequot Indian] men of Block Island&quot; (Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop's order to Captain John Endecott, 1637); &quot;laying waste,&quot; and instilling &quot;terror...by any means&quot; among the Indians (General George Washington, 1779); &quot;[with] malice enough in our hearts to destroy everything that contributes to their support&quot; (General John Sullivan, 1779). In a prominent history book published in 1906 (The History of the United States, James Wilford Garner, Ph.D. and Henry Cabot Lodge, Ph.D, L.L.D), the &quot;destruction&quot; of the American Indian is explained as follows: &quot;History teaches that inferior people must yield to a superior civilization....They must take on civilization or pass out. The Negro was able to endure slavery while learning the rudiments of civilization; the Indian could not endure slavery, and...refused to be taught.&quot; Attitudes uttered by white, Puritan, Christian men, civilian and military, thus set the tone for our civilization, sentiments that to this day have not been seriously renounced. We remain primarily a white male supremacy society with overtly expressed as well as suppressed sentiments of racism and classism dominating much of our political life and foreign policy. How can someone drop a bomb knowing that thousands of innocents will be murdered if the bomber is not possessed by cruel racism and/or ugly ethnocentrism? Conveniently left out of the historical record is the fact that our civilization has been founded on three holocausts, the first being theft of virtually all our land base at gunpoint while murdering millions of the original inhabitants. The second brought us &quot;free&quot; labor from Africa, but resulted in two-thirds of all those originally targeted for apprehension being murdered in the process of trying to escape or from being stowed as human cargo in slave ships known as floating coffins. The third holocaust took place during what the founder and publisher of Time and Life magazines, Thomas Luce, called &quot;The American Century.&quot; This century witnessed more than 300 military and perhaps 10,000 covert interventions by the U.S. into more than 100 countries, stealing resources at gunpoint while murdering millions of the increasing numbers of impoverished people struggling for independence. &quot;American exceptionalism&quot; must succeed at any cost. In the process, the three Buddhist &quot;poisons&quot; are employed: greed -- for profit at any cost of human suffering; hatred -- of any obstacles to profit; ignorance -- of the intimate link between Western corporations/governments and &quot;Third World&quot; repressive regimes. U.S. Oligarchy It does not matter which of the two parties, the republocrats or demoblicans, is in power. They both easily consented to the selection of their chief executive officer in violation of the rights of thousands of illegally disenfranchised Black voters, and of their Constitutional system itself that makes no provision for the Supreme Court to make such selection. Both believe in preserving the &quot;national security&quot; of AWOL, which means continued, unabated acceleration of extraction, consumption and pollution patterns, and obscene profits for the plutocrats and their bribed oligarchs in Washington. For all this to happen, Mr. Bush, indeed, has laid out the necessary plans for a world imperium to assure, in his and his cohorts' minds, continuation of our Western way of life, business- and profits-as-usual. These oligarchs are not able to perceive the fact that further continuation of AWOL guarantees our destruction. They are not able to even consider the need for radical contraction and creative alternatives. They act as if blind drunk with their personal and political values of money and power, under the cloak of their disfigured version of Jesus. Unfortunately, the inevitable consequences of their business-as-usual forces are systematic destruction of virtually all sustainable ecosystems and human-created institutions. Origins of &quot;Civilization&quot; Some history. As the revolution of urban civilization took root some 5,000 years ago the basic ingredients of &quot;Western civilization&quot; were introduced into our human evolutionary journey. The basic model of &quot;civilization,&quot; for all but the most isolated and exceptional Indigenous groups, has seen the advent of powerful male oligarchs surrounded by elite bureaucracies of scribes and priests, overseeing hierarchies that involuntarily enforced large numbers of laborers, often violently captured during wars, to construct large projects for the pleasure of the king. Wars, systematic violence, and harsh class division originated with &quot;civilizations.&quot; Secrecy of priestly knowledge about cosmic regularities and calendar-making assured that knowledge was monopolized by the small elite surrounding the oligarch. And the maxim, &quot;the best defense is attack,&quot; was often used in early warfare, roots of our preventive strikes of today. According to Asian and Scandinavian scholars there have been nearly 15,000 wars during the last 5,000 years. Extraordinarily Dangerous Trends The U.S. economy reveals increasing vulnerabilities to the fiction and hot air behind Wall Street and the continued exploitation and creation of misery upon which it is based. The U.S. regime has chosen to protect its illusion of omnipotence under the veil of fighting &quot;terrorism&quot; and its curtailing of civil liberties is similar to a police state. Increasingly desperate means used by people in power to maintain that power is a historically typical, predictable phenomenon. Never before, however, have oligarchs commanded so much power and possessed so many weapons of mass destruction, with explicit intentions to use such weapons preventively rather than defensively. I believe that we are at a pivotal point in history. We sit precariously perched on a ledge overlooking imminent extinction as a very real possibility at this juncture in our long, 7- to 8-million-year human evolutionary journey. Academics often talk about how history is cyclical, but two demonstrable trends, clearly not cyclical, indicate that we are dangerously near the end of our evolutionary branch.</strong><br />

<strong>It often takes a catastrophe to reveal the illusory beliefs we continue to harbor in national and homeland security. To keep us safe, we place our faith in national borders and guards, bureaucracies and experts, technologies and armies. These and other instruments of national security are empowered and legitimated by the assumption that it falls upon the sovereign country to protect us from the turbulent state of nature and anarchy that permanently lies in wait offshore and over the horizon for the unprepared and inadequately defended. But this parochial fear, posing as a realistic worldview, has recently taken some very hard knocks. Prior to September 11, 2001, national borders were thought to be necessary and sufficient to keep our enemies at bay; upon entry to Baghdad, a virtuous triumphalism and a revolution in military affairs were touted as the best means to bring peace and democracy to the Middle East; and before Hurricane Katrina, emergency preparedness and an intricate system of levees were supposed to keep New Orleans safe and dry. The intractability of disaster, especially its unexpected, unplanned, unprecedented nature, erodes not only the very distinction of the local, national, and global, but, assisted and amplified by an unblinking global media, reveals the contingent and highly interconnected character of life in general. Yet when it comes to dealing with natural and unnatural disasters, we continue to expect (and, in the absence of a credible alternative, understandably so) if not certainty and total safety at least a high level of probability and competence from our national and homeland security experts However, between the mixed metaphors and behind the metaphysical concepts given voice by US Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff early into the Katrina crisis, there lurks an uneasy recognition that this administration—and perhaps no national government—is up to the task of managing incidents that so rapidly cascade into global events. Indeed, they suggest that our national plans and preparations for the “big one”—a force-five hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic disease—have become part of the problem, not the solution. His use of hyberbolic terms like “ultra-catastrophe” and “fall-out” is telling: such events exceed not only local and national capabilities, but the capacity of conventional language itself. An easy deflection would be to lay the blame on the neoconservative faithful of the first term of US President George W. Bush, who, viewing through an inverted Wilsonian prism the world as they would wish it to be, have now been forced by natural and unnatural disasters to face the world as it really is—and not even the most sophisticated public affairs machine of dissimulations, distortions, and lies can close this gap. However, the discourse of the second Bush term has increasingly returned to the dominant worldview of national security, realism. And if language is, as Nietzsche claimed, a prisonhouse, realism is its supermax penitentiary. Based on linear notions of causality, a correspondence theory of truth, and the materiality of power, how can realism possibly account—let alone prepare or provide remedies—for complex catastrophes, like the toppling of the World Trade Center and attack on the Pentagon by a handful of jihadists armed with box-cutters and a few months of flight-training? A force-five hurricane that might well have begun with the flapping of a butterfly’s wings? A northeast electrical blackout that started with a falling tree limb in Ohio? A possible pandemic triggered by the mutation of an avian virus? How, for instance, are we to measure the immaterial power of the CNN-effect on the first Gulf War, the Al-Jazeera-effect on the Iraq War, or the Nokia-effect on the London terrorist bombings? For events of such complex, non-linear origins and with such tightly-coupled, quantum effects, the national security discourse of realism is simply not up to the task. Worse, what if the “failure of imagination” identified by the 9/11 Commission is built into our national and homeland security systems? What if the reliance on planning for the catastrophe that never came reduced our capability to flexibly respond and improvise for the “ultra-catastrophe” that did? What if worse-case scenarios, simulation training, and disaster exercises—as well as border guards, concrete barriers and earthen levees—not only prove inadequate but might well act as force-multipliers—what organizational theorists identify as “negative synergy” and “cascading effects” —that produce the automated bungling (think Federal Emergency Management Agency) that transform isolated events and singular attacks into global disasters? Just as “normal accidents” are built into new technologies—from the Titanic sinking to the Chernobyl meltdown to the Challenger explosion—we must ask whether “ultra-catastrophes” are no longer the exception but now part and parcel of densely networked systems that defy national management; in other words, “planned disasters.” What, then, is to be done? A first step is to move beyond the wheel-spinning debates that perennially keep security discourse always one step behind the global event. It might well be uni-, bi-, or multi-polar, but it is time to recognize that the power configuration of the states-system is rapidly being subsumed by a heteropolar matrix, in which a wide range of different actors and technological drivers are producing profound global effects through interconnectivity. Varying in identity, interests, and strength, these new actors and drivers gain advantage through the broad bandwidth of information technology, for networked communication systems provide the means to traverse political, economic, religious, and cultural boundaries, changing not only how we interpret events, but making it ever more difficult to maintain the very distinction of intended from accidental events. According to the legal philosopher of Nazi Germany, Carl Schmitt, when the state is unable to deliver on its traditional promissory notes of safety, security, and well-being through legal, democratic means, it will necessarily exercise the sovereign “exception:” declaring a state of emergency, defining friend from foe, and, if necessary, eradicating the threat to the state. But what if the state, facing the global event, cannot discern the accidental from the intentional? An external attack from an internal auto-immune response? The natural as opposed to the “planned disaster”? The enemy within from the enemy without? We can, as the United States has done since September 11, continue to treat catastrophic threats as issues of national rather than global security, and go it alone. However, once declared, bureaucratically installed, and repetitively gamed, national states of emergency grow recalcitrant and become prone to even worse disasters. As Paul Virilio, master theorist of the war machine and the integral accident once told me: “The full-scale accident is now the prolongation of total war by other means.”</strong><br />

Framing DA - Discourse that humanizes security by utilizing it and trying to change it only strengthens the elite strategy that remains within the ontological confines of security sustaining contemporary political order.<br />
Burke <strong>20</strong>02 <strong>(Anthony, School of Political Science and International Studies, University of Queensland , “Aporias of Security”, Questia, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>My particular concern with humanist discourses of security is that, whatever their critical value, they leave in place (and possibly strengthen) a key structural feature of the elite strategy they oppose: its claim to embody truth and fix the contours of the real. In particular, the ontology of security/threat or security/insecurity--which forms the basic condition of the real for mainstream discourses of international policy--remains powerfully in place, and security's broader function as a defining condition of human experience and modern political life remains invisible and unexamined. This is to abjure a powerful critical approach that is able to question the very categories in which our thinking, our experience, and actions remain confined. This article remains focused on the aporias that lie at the heart of security, rather than pushing into the spaces that lie beyond. The contours of this project are already becoming clearer. (15) What is still required is a properly genealogical account of security's ability to provide what Walker calls a &quot;constitutive account of the political&quot;: as Walker says, &quot;claims about common security, collective security, or world security do little more than fudge the contradictions written into the heart of modern politics: we can only become humans or anything else, after we have given up our humanity, or any other attachments, to the greater good of citizenship.&quot; (16) Thus, before we can effectively rewrite security, we have to properly understand how security has written us-how it has shaped and limited our very possibility, the possibilities for our selves, our relationships, and our available images of political, social, and economic order. This, as Walker intriguingly hints, is also to explore the aporetic distance that modernity establishes between our &quot;humanity&quot; and a secure identity bounded and defined by the state. In short, security needs to be placed alongside a range of other economic, political, technological, philosophic, and scientific developments as one of the central constitutive events of our modernity, and it remains one of its essential underpinnings. Security derives its enormous cultural power from its place at the center of modern political thought--at the center of a thought that, after first establishing the founding myths of modern political society, has further sought to think the juridical basis and function of the state, its enabling relation to a broader cultural and economic modernity, and to the imagination of &quot;progressive&quot; forms of modern political and economic subjectivity. Just as Foucault sought, through the idea of governmentality, to trace the emergence of simultaneously totalizing and individualizing forms of state power, I would argue that security occupies a key enabling position at their junction. The remainder of this article elucidates security's &quot;constitutive account of the political&quot; through a reading of Hobbes, Locke, the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham, and Hegel, using Foucault's writings on governmental reason as a loose template.</strong><br />

5. Masking DA<br />
A: The language we utilize can reinforce the status quo by attempting to assimilate critical terms which deprives them of their critical intent - they silence critical dissent.<br />
Broadhead <strong>20</strong>02 <strong>(Lee-Anne, Associate Professor of Political Science at the University College of Cape Breton. “International Environmental Politics: The Limits of Green Diplomacy” 2002, p. 18-19, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In addition to recognizing the extent of the domination of technical rationality, it is also important to consider the way in which the very language we speak serves to reinforce the status quo by becoming closed to the potential dynamic inherent in discourse. The language of fact and description, Marcuse argues, leaves no space for a discussion potentially disruptive alternatives. Marcuse examines in illuminating detail the ability of the closed language of the type of discourse so often seen in modern societies to unify opposites and to assimilate potentially critical terms in a manner that deprives them of any critical intent. 37 Language, Marcuse argues, reflects the technical and rational, but it also becomes an instrument of control precisely because it reduces activity and relationships to operational terms. Acronyms take on loaded and fixed meaning, and concepts sanctioned by intellectuals shape the discourse in pre-determined ways that determined ways that &quot;govern the analysis of human reality.” 38 Language can become a key means of silencing critical dissent when concepts are deployed to reduce the tension between the existing reality and radical challenges to it. The operational treatment of the concept of sustainable development will be shown to assume such a political function and will&quot; be analyzed as an example of a “therapeutic and operational concept designed to pacify protest and absorb critical thinking. 39</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
B: The prevailing order maintains control over the debate by masking dangerous security practice packaging the debate to obscure their violent rhetoric designed at containing critique instead of confronting it - This evidence is the bees knees.<br />
Broadhead <strong>20</strong>02 <strong>(Lee-Anne, Associate Professor of Political Science at the University College of Cape Breton. “International Environmental Politics: The Limits of Green Diplomacy” 2002, p. 20-21, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Critical Theory also provides the necessary tools for examining the many ways in which the prevailing order maintains its control of the debate by masking dangerous practices and packaging the debate in ways that obscure the destructive forces at work in the system; by containing, in short, the impact and radicalism of critiques aimed at it. As mentioned above, economics is considered only to the extent met its relations are seen be beneficial to the environment. In addition to a critique of the dubious logic utilized to make that claim, it is also important to destabilize the popular concept of sustainable development so favored by the advocates of this concept of green diplomacy. It is with the widespread acceptance of this concept that the status quo has had the most success in containing and stabilizing earlier green critiques of society and in supporting and reaffirming existing structures and power relations - both at the state level as well as at the level of global relations. Indeed, the response to mass protest movements in a number of (mostly western) states in the 1960s and 1970s, movements that examined the environmental costs of economic growth, was the suggestion that the way to avoid ecological destruction was to trade more and ensure the continued economic growth patterns of the world system. Thus defined, sustainable development is an interesting concept and has been adopted by international organizations, multilateral economic bodies, governments, and even many environmental organizations. It bears a staggering resemblance (as I shall demonstrate in greater detail in Chapter 2) to Herbert Marcuse<span class="s2">ʼ</span>s concept of one-dimensional thought.</strong><br />

The state creates threats based in imagined enemies constructed through a view of security that is epistemologically flawed always searching for new ways to secure ourselves against false threats which creates a self fulfilling prophecy.<br />

<br />
<strong>A second part of the security paradox is that security and insecurity are not binary opposites. On a micro-level, if security is the state of being secure, than insecurity should be the state of not being secure. However, what we do feel secure about is neither part of the national security agenda nor a conscious thought or feeling. The state of being secure is thus, not conceptualized as an absence of insecurity. On a policymaking level, Robert Lipschutz (1995, 27), Associate Professor of Politics at University of California, Santa Cruz, notes in On Security that our desire to achieve security through the acquisition of arms and a national missile “defense” system, serves to insecure those whom we label and treat as threats. This encourages the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and offensive posturing by those we wish to secure ourselves against, causing us to feel more insecure as the end result of our search for security. More recently, when George W. Bush included North Korea in his illogical “Axis of Evil” and named it as a threat to the United States, the peripheral state had no nuclear capability and would never have thought to use the threat of weapons of mass destruction to blackmail Western powers into giving aid. However, alarmed at the thought of being the next Afghanistan or Iraq, North Korea retaliated within a year by revealing its nuclear arsenal. The United States watched helplessly as one more previously benign nation became a real security problem. As a consequence, imagined enemies become real threats due to the ongoing threat construction by the state, and this poses the security dilemma of creating self-fulfilling prophecies in the current framework of security. Our notion of security is what the state says it is, rather than what we feel it is. Yet, this entrenched view of security is epistemologically flawed, which is our second dilemma; meaning that our knowledge of security as it is defined is based in certain realist assumptions that do not hold up under scrutiny. Our perception of what and from whom we need to be secured is not based on the actual threats that exist, but on the threats that we are told to perceive by the state. Thus, terrorists, drugs, illegal immigrants, “Third World” dictators, rogue states, blacks, non-Christians, and the Other, are considered as threats to the national security apparatus, and consequently, as threats to the individual American. This state construction of threats pervades our minds, causing a trickle-down effect that encourages a culture of fear, where the only limit to the coming danger is our imagination. Lipschutz (2000, 44-45) concludes in After Authority: War, Peace, and Global Politics in the 21st Century, “the national security state is brought down to the level of the household, and each one arms itself against the security dilemma posed by its neighbor across the hedge of fence.” Lipschutz seems to be saying that it is national security that eventually encourages the creation of a dichotomy between the self and the Other in our everyday lives. Indeed, it is the discourse of security by the rulers and elites, which creates and sustains our bipolar mindset of the world. A final dilemma presented by the current security framework is that security is ontologically unstable, unable to exist on its own, requiring the creation of certain conditions and categories, specifically, the creation of the Other. James Der Derian (1995, 25), Associate Professor of Political Science at U Mass (Amherst), notes in On Security that we are taught to consider security as “an a priori argument that proves the existence and necessity of only one form of security because there currently happens to be a widespread belief in it.” Yet, national security is a highly unstable concept and changes over time, with the construction of new threats and enemies. Due to its unstable nature, security can then, be considered as a constant fluid that is constructed and re- defined by the discourse of the state and security elites. Ole Waever, a senior researcher at the Center for Peace and Conflict Research, contends that the very act of uttering “security” places it on the security agenda, thereby giving the state and its elite, power over the issue. In On Security, he notes that “in naming a certain development a security problem, the state can claim a special right, one that in the final instance, always be defined by the state and its elites” (1995, 55). This process is termed as “securitization,” which simply means treating an event or issue as a problem of national security rather than first questioning whether it should even be treated as a security issue. Such an act serves the interests of the state and its elites, starting with security discourse by the state, which constructs and perpetuates state identity and existence.</strong><br />

Threat construction only fuels the conflict.<br />
Bleiker <strong>20</strong>05 <strong>(Roland, Ph.D in international relations from the Australian National University, currently is a Professor of international relations at the University of Queensland. “Divided Korea” 2005 p. 36-38, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I will pay particular attention the role of the United States, for nothing about the past and present dilemmas on the peninsula can be addressed or even understood without recourse to the United States. This is why China repeatedly stressed that the latest nuclear crisis was primarily an issue between North Korea and the United States.4 Kim Dae-jung, in his final speech as South Korea’s presi- dent, reiterated the same theme: “more than anything, dialogue between North Korea and the United States is the important key to a solution.”5 A solution is, however, far from imminent. Both the United States and North Korea see each other as a threat. And each has good reason for doing so. But each is also implicated in the production of this threat. The problem is that these interactive dynamics are hard to see, for the West tends to project a very one-sided image of North Korea, one that sees it solely as a rogue and thus a source of danger and instability. Nicholas Eberstadt, for instance, stresses that “North Korean policies and practices have accounted for most of the volatility within the Northeast Asian region since the end of the Cold War.”6 The deeply entrenched image of North Korea as a rogue state is part of an identity-driven political attitude that severely hinders both an adequate understanding and potential resolution of the crisis. The rhetoric of rogue states is indicative of how U.S. foreign policy continues to be dominated by dualistic and militaristic Cold War thinking patterns. The “evil empire” may be gone but not the underlying need to define safety and security with reference to an external threat. Rogues are among the new threat perceptions that serve to demarcate the line between good and evil, identity and difference. As during the Cold War, building up a strong military arsenal is viewed as the key means through which this line is to be defended. In the absence of a global power that matches the United States, this militaristic attitude has, if anything, intensified. Look at Washington’s recent promulgation of a preemptive strike policy against rogue states. The consequences of this posture are particularly fateful in Korea, for it reinforces half a century of explicit and repeated nuclear threats against the government in Pyongyang. The effect of these threats has been largely obscured, in part because the highly specialized discourse of security analysis has managed to attribute responsibility for the crisis solely to North Korea’s actions, even if the situation is in reality far more complex and interactive. Drawing attention to the interactive dimension of security dynam- ics, and the role of the United States in it, is not to absolve North Korea of responsibility. Pyongyang bears perhaps the lion’s share for much of the culture of insecurity that still persists on the penin- sula. Over fifty years it has committed at least a dozen terrorist acts, from bombings of civilian airliners to tunnel and submarine infiltrations across the DMZ, not to speak of countless other provo- cations and verbal aggressions. The production of crises has become a hallmark of North Korean politics, designed both to fortify its authoritarian rule and to win concessions from the international community. But this does not mean developments take place in a vacuum. Indeed, in an almost mirror image of North Korea’s vili- fied brinkmanship tactic, the U.S. administration under President George W. Bush has embarked on a form of crisis diplomacy that explicitly generates threats in order to improve its negotiation position and force its opponent into submission.</strong><br />

4. The North Korean ‘threat’ was sustained by securitizing political discourse.<br />

<strong>The task of this book is not to search for and develop a position somewhere along this spectrum of policy approaches to North Korea. Doing so could hardly add substance to a debate that is already as extensive as it is polarized. The point of rethinking security is, rather, to understand and investigate why this debate has come to be framed in this particularly polarized manner in the first place. The need for a reframing of debates becomes clearer if we recall an argument that Robert Cox once made in the general context of inter- national politics. He distinguished between two types of approaches: problem-solving approaches and those that are critical.49 Problem-solving theories consider the prevailing structures of the world as the given framework for action. They study the workings and influences of a political system or address the problems that it creates. They assume, as is the case of the realist ideology, that one can and should “deal with human nature as it is and not as it ought to be.”50 But such theories not only accept the existing political dilemmas as given but also, intentionally or unintentionally, sustain them. Critical theories, by contrast, attempt to transcend the existing order with the objective of comprehending how it was created and how it could give way to less violent alternative political constellations. Doing so is the task of a rethinking process, and it inevitably entails deemphasizing some political issues hitherto perceived as central while moving other, more marginal, concerns to a prominent position. Among the issues that move to the background are diplomatic negotiations or debates about the nuclear issue, which have so far preoccupied analysts of Korean security. This is not to say that they are not important or that a potential military escalation should not be of utmost concern. The point, rather, is that these dangers must be seen as symptoms, rather than causes. The nuclear threat, for instance, does not exist primarily because of the proliferation of weapons. The threat has emerged and persists to a large extent because the underlying political discourse led the two Korean states into a situation in which conflict has become the modus operandi of political interactions. What, then, are the potentials and limits of a critical rethinking of Korea security? How, exactly, is such an effort different from prevailing problem-solving approaches? First, let me address the limits of this study. It offers neither a comprehensive review of the Korean security situation nor a detailed engagement with the most current events. There will be no systematic survey of great power policies toward the Korean peninsula, no thorough analysis of the technicalities and negotiation tactics surrounding the latest nuclear crisis. Various monographs and articles have done this already in a highly competent manner. I seek to chart a different route, identify- ing broad patterns of conflict and possibilities for peace that emerge from rethinking the policies that sustain these patterns.</strong><br />

The threat they name isn’t based on objective facts but discursive threat inflation, prefer our evidence it’s comparative.<br />
Zulaika <strong>20</strong>09 <strong>(Joesba, Professor, at the Center for Basque Studies Ph.D., Anthropology, from Princeton University, has written widely on the issue of Terrorism and culture. “Terrorism: The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy” 2009, p. 28-30, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The media confronts us daily with the realities of terrorism, as well as with the discursive nature of many of the “facts.” As noted, far from being a mere mirror of the facts on the ground, discourse may create its own reality. The alleged plot uncovered by the British police in London in August 2006 to blow up as many as ten airplanes over the Atlantic with liquid explosives illustrates the point. Having arrested twenty-one people, the alarm could not have been more ominous. Paul Stephenson, the deputy chief of the Metropolitan Police in London, declared on August 10 that the plotters were intent on “mass murder on an unimaginable scale”; John Reid, the British home secretary, predicted that, as the result of the “highly likely” attacks, the loss of life would have been on an “unprecedented scale.” I had to fly from Spain to the United States with my family ten days after this front-page news; the anticipation became dreadful as daily re- ports detailed the hours of delay at the airports, the prohibition on carrying hand luggage, the repeated cases of flights aborted or returned to their point of departure because of the hysteria provoked by some unruly passenger. After we made it home safely, a report in the New York Times proclaimed that the plotters had left “a trove of evidence,” thus fully vindicating the initial concern.33 Yet, a careful reading of the report provided a very different picture of the events. It admitted that, according to five senior British officials, “the suspects were not prepared to strike immedi- ately. Instead, the reactions of Britain and the United States in the wake of the arrests of 21 people on Aug. 10 were driven less by information about a specific, imminent attack than fear that other, unknown terror- ists might strike.” That is, fear of unspecified terrorists, not the ones ar- rested, had been the real reason for the apocalyptic alarm that turned the world’s air traffic into chaos. In fact, “Despite the charges, officials said they were still unsure of one critical question: whether any of the suspects was technically capable of assembling and detonating liquid explosives while airborne.” Some of the suspects had been under police surveillance for over a year and what had triggered the police action was that one of the key suspects, Rashid Rauf, who holds dual British and Pakistani citizen- ship, had been arrested in Pakistan. Initially, it was said by one official and later disclaimed by another that upon Rauf’s arrest an explicit message to the plotters to “Go now” had been issued. This prompted the decision by Scotland Yard to proceed to arrest the entire group when, in fact, British investigators would have preferred to monitor the suspects longer. In short, the group was under close police surveillance; having installed video cameras and audio recordings in their “bomb factory,” the police knew the group was not ready to attack (some of them did not even have passports yet, let alone tickets to fly) and, by the police’s own admission, they even questioned the group’s capacity to detonate a device. So we are left with the question: Was the threat, which must have cost the aviation industry billions, so credible as to create the air traffic chaos worldwide? The same senior official characterized the apocalyptic remarks of two weeks earlier as “unfortunate.” After his dire predictions of August 10, Mr. Reid sought to calm the public by lowering the threat level from “critical” to “severe,” and by acknowledging that “[t]hreat level assessments are intelligence-led. It is not a process where scientific precision is possible. They involve judgments.” Here we have a typical case of terrorism’s hyperreality in which the facts are there (the alleged plotters were clearly up to something) but they take shape against a background of threats and fears that then become constitutive of subsequent events themselves. That is, the scare was as much or more the product of the interpretation of messages as of the actual immediacy of the threat. In short, we are confronted with a new epistemic space; a new act of naming was deemed to be necessary for a new historical reality. Awareness that reality is up for grabs, and that the U.S. administration’s rationales for the war on terror have only the most tenuous connections to reality, has become a staple of the mainstream political debate as reflected in the daily media’s coverage of the administration’s political agenda. The big scare produced by the uncovered British plot ultimately had as much to do with the rhetorical dimension of terrorism as with the actual danger posed by those arrested on August 10, half of whom were later released without charges. Some evidence for the plot was there, but its apocalyptic nature became credible because of the rhetorical power of terrorism. To talk of its rhetorical dimension means that the link between actions and goals is mediated by perceptions and interpretations; that is, the primary persuasions that matter to the terrorist are the reactions themselves. Counterterrorism is equally rhetorical in that a primary concern for officials in their War on Terror is how the public perceives their actions. There is a long history of politicians using terrorism to their advantage. The British terror case, for example, is credited with having improved President Bush’s approval ratings, certainly not a negligible result in itself. Now, imagine the temptation when such rhetorical power, by which you can largely control the public’s interpretation of a certain threat or potential action, is available to politicians. Such dimension becomes even more critical in a situation in which the activities of the terrorists, as well as those of the counterterrorists, are clouded in secrecy and classified information. In this crucial sense—what matters are the reactions and interpretations terrorism provokes—it is primarily a rhetorical phenomenon. In the 2008 U.S. elections, the last attempt by the McCain campaign to offset Obama’s advantage in the polls was to associate him with “the former terrorist” Bill Ayers. Rhetorics and discourse become constitutive of the reality itself. The writing of terror becomes inaugural.</strong><br />

Nuclear terrorism discourse isn’t based in an objective reality and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br />

<br />
<strong>The risk of nuclear terrorism is the final apocalyptic fear in current political discourse. Such ultimate taboo of the terrorist madman was a decisive element in granting credibility to President Bush’s doctrine of “the axis of evil” and in justifying going to war against Saddam Hussein. He announced it solemnly in his 2002 State of the Union address: “States like these [Iran, Iraq, and North Korea], and their terrorist allies, constitute the “axis of evil,” arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred.” The symbiotic relationship between nuclear power and terrorism could not be stated more forcefully. John Mueller has shown convincingly how “overblown” the threat of terrorism is; he writes that the likelihood of dying from terrorism is about the same as dying from the impact of an asteroid on the Earth or from an allergic reaction to peanuts.1 The actual capacity for terrorists to develop a nuclear device is considered by the experts to be extremely low.2 The technological sophistication of the 9/11 attacks rested on box cutters. But such healthy factualness does not address key components of the terrorist phenomenon—those having to do with the imaginative and subjective aspects of the threat. They constitute the context of madness in which both nuclear proliferation and the feared nemesis of its terrorist displacement transpire. What accounts for the self-righteousness of a preventive just war in the nuclear era? It is presented as legitimate on the grounds that other countries, such as Iraq under Saddam Hussein, desire the weapons of mass destruction of which we already possess mountains of stockpiles. The war in Iraq is not only the frontline of the War on Terror; it also marks, as the testing ground for the complicity between nuclearism and terrorism, a radical change in nuclear nonproliferation—it was no longer a matter of eliminating nuclear arsenals but evil regimes.3 It is in this war that WMDs and the figure of the Terrorist emerged as systemically linked and in full force. Nuclear nonproliferation was no longer an end in itself but part of the War on Terror. The only problem with nonproliferation was suddenly not the very existence of the nuclear arsenals and the foot-dragging to fulfil the promises to dismantle them, let alone the double standard of a policy by which the United States determines who has the right to possess nuclear weapons and who does not, but the existence of rogue states and their potential links to terrorist groups. Much as for the earlier cold warriors there were “good” and “bad” atomic bombs, for the new counterterrorists the real issue is no longer the obscenity of the tens of thousands of nuclear warheads ready to be used and a renewed armaments race that could lead to the collapse of nonproliferation, but the terrorists’ desire to have them. Remember the mantra: “It is not if, but when.” What such ominous prediction does is to concentrate the danger of nuclearism in the tabooed figure of the terrorist to the exclusion of its historical context and current nonproliferation issues. Even liberal authors such as Michael Walzer have come to differentiate categorically between the aerial bombing of German cities during World War II (wars as such are not in principle immoral) and terrorist suicide bombings that are in principle and always evil.4 Remove that figure of madness, the Terrorist, and the entire crusade (“the defining issue of our times”) collapses. Remove the fatalistic prophecy that nuclear terrorism is a certainty waiting to happen and the entire armaments race appears for what it is—madness. Such blindness to history and common sense is the precondition for the prophecy to become self-fulfilling.</strong><br />

<strong>The point is not to attribute responsibility for the reemergence of a nuclear crisis on the peninsula. Both the United States and North Korea have contributed a great deal to fuel each other’s fears. But decision makers in Washington have clearly not been sufficiently aware of their own role in generating fears and counterreactions. Nor have they learned much from the lesson of the first nuclear crisis. Consider, for instance, how the United States has quickly forgotten, or ignored, a number of rather striking concessions that Pyongyang made in the period leading up to the second crisis. North Korea started to open up its borders: it accommodated several hundred representatives of foreign aid organizations, increased cooperation with (capitalist) Russia, sought to normalize talks with Japan, and entered into diplomatic relations with a dozen Western countries. There were steps toward domestic reform, such as the introduction of quasi–market principles and the opening of special economic zones. There was also progress toward a rapprochement with the South, most notably in domains such as family exchanges, busi- ness contacts, and cultural exchanges. Pyongyang started to clear mines in the DMZ and worked toward establishing road and rail- way links with the South. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Il, even publicly acknowledged the importance of a continuous deployment of U.S. troops in South Korea. He stressed that their presence is a threat only so long as the relationship between North Korea and the United States remains hostile.62 This in itself could be seen as the “mother of all concessions,” for the removal of U.S. troops had been one of North Korea’s key demands for decades.63 Instead of appreciating and building on these concessions, U.S. foreign policy toward North Korea focused on Pyongyang’s linger- ing nuclear ambition. But not everyone believed Pyongyang when it declared in October 2002 that it had never ceased its nuclear program. The Russian foreign minister, for instance, called it a North Korean tactical maneuver.64 Neither claim could at this stage be empirically verified, but that is not the main point anyway. More important is that the United States failed to pay attention to a series of rather obvious North Korean gestures long before the crisis came to be seen as a crisis in October. North Korea’s worry began to grow with Bush’s “axis of evil” speech earlier that year, in February. At that time an unofficial North Korean representa- tive, Kim Myong Chol, told a New York Times journalist, Nicholas Kristof, that he foresaw “a crisis beginning in the latter half of this year.” North Korea, Kim mentioned, “will respond to the break- down of the nuclear deal . . . by starting its nuclear program and resuming its missiles tests.”65 That is, of course, precisely what hap- pened eight months later. It is striking how North Korea’s approach in 2002–2003 paral- leled its behavior during the crisis of 1993–1994. Pyongyang most likely assumed, as it did a decade earlier, that a hard-line U.S. administration would not engage in serious dialogue until North Korea threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Scott Snyder, in an extensive study of Pyongyang’s approach during the first crisis, speaks of a “crisis-oriented negotiation style” that is rooted in North Korea’s particular historical experience, most notably its partisan guerrilla legacy. Snyder writes of a remarkably rational and entirely consistent approach, one that relies on “threats, bluff, and forms of blackmail to extract maximal concession from a negotiating counterpart.”66 Even the dramatic language that shocked the world media in early 2003 was entirely predictable. The apoca- lyptic threat of turning Seoul into a “sea of fire,” for instance, was literally a rehearsed metaphor from the first crisis.67 It is part of an all-too-predictable emotional vocabulary that has prevailed in North Korea’s press for decades. Once translated into standard English, it is not much different from the more rationally expressed U.S. threat of preemptive nuclear strikes.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Gathering the courage to start a large research project on Korean security was not easy, for few topics have produced as much litera- ture. Taking on this massive body of knowledge as a mere “hobby Koreanist” was a rather daunting idea, no matter how passionately I felt about it all. This was all the more the case because increasing attention was now given to work by more critically inclined authors, such as Moon Chung-in, Paik Nak-chung, Bruce Cumings, Leon Sigal, Katherine Moon, Scott Snyder, and Hazel Smith, to name just a few. Add to this the insufficiency of my Korean-language competence, despite sustained and rather laborious attempts to acquire and then update my rudimentary linguistic skills. In the end I simply decided to take the plunge, dilettantish as my dive (and subsequent landing) may well be. I jumped into the void mostly because I had a long and strong passion for Korea and because I had an equally strong and passionate conviction that the puzzles of Korean security need to be scrutinized in a novel and radically different manner. Perhaps there is even an advantage in not being a specialist, for one’s mind is not yet molded by well-rehearsed disciplinary conventions, nor does one have a professional reputation and career at stake, at least not in that particular discipline. An outsider may thus pronounce what an insider cannot, which is why some commentators argue that a rethinking process actually requires a “stranger’s account.”6</span></strong><br />

<strong>Again, given their realist perspective, it is hard for Walt and Mearsheimer to understand a conflict that seems to defy their categories. After all, it would seem from a superficial examination that rational considerations would make Arab states want to end the struggle, while Palestinian leaders would be expected to seek to obtain a state even if this required considerable compromise. To them, then, the conflict would seem easy to solve and it would be in the U.S. interest--and within its capabilities--to solve it. Explaining how the United States failed to achieve this goal would therefore appear to require some malevolent force which pushed American policy off course. As a result, the authors argue that the Israel lobby has blocked the United States from resolving the conflict, thereby generating anti-American animosity in the region and beyond, since supposedly all Arab states and Muslims would also want to achieve a quick resolution. They assert that upon taking office, George W. Bush, &quot;who understood that it is in the American national interest&quot; to settle the conflict, tried but &quot;has not come close to achieving that goal&quot; because &quot;there has been little change in the balance of power between Bush and the lobby. &quot; Mearsheimer and Walt credited the effectiveness of Elliott Abrams, an official on the National Security Council, and two other lobby members, John Hanna and David Wurmser, with undermining the efforts of Condoleezza Rice to reach out to Arafat's successor, Mahmud Abbas. They charge that the same individuals, working with the Israeli government, prevented Rice from negotiating with Hamas, triggering the takeover of the Gaza Strip by the Islamists in 2007. &quot;Absent the lobby&quot; the United States &quot;could hold out the promise of fulfilling their [Palestinians] dream of a viable state in the Occupied Territories coupled with massive long-term economic aid. &quot; The authors suggest that the United States could have pressured Israel by withdrawing aid and, if necessary, isolated it as they did the apartheid regime in South Africa. [12] Again, this rationalist account shows little or no understanding of how Middle East politics and ideology works, nor does it comprehend the true interests of most Arab regimes. It treats the Palestinians as a unitary rational actor that seeks not Israel's elimination and total victory but merely wants to obtain a state as quickly and easily as possible. This view ignores or misrepresents the complexities of the Oslo process, the goals and governing style of PLO leader Yasir Arafat, and the nature of Palestinian political culture and ideology.</strong><br />

The belief that humans are inherently violent is flawed and has been disproven by experts multiple times.

<strong>Peace activists can tell when it's coming. Tipped off by a helpless shrug or a patronizing smile, they brace themselves to hear the phrase once again. &quot;Sure, I'm in favor of stopping the arms race. But aren't you being idealistic? After all, aggression is just&quot; - here it comes - &quot;part of human nature.&quot; Like the animals, -- &quot;red in tooth and claw,&quot; as Tennyson put it - human beings are thought to be unavoidably violent creatures. Surveys of adults, undergraduates, and high school students have found that about 60 percent agree with this statement. &quot;Human nature being what it is, there will always be war.&quot; It may be part of our society's folk wisdom, but it sets most of the expert's heads to shaking. Take the belief, popularized by Sigmund Freud and animal researcher Konrad Lorenz, that we have within us, naturally and spontaneously, a reservoir of aggressive energy. This force, which builds by itself, must be periodically drained off - by participating in competitive sports, for instance - lest we explode into violence. It is an appealing model because it is easy to visualize. It is also false. John Paul Scott, professor emeritus at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, has written: &quot;All of our present data indicate that fighting behavior among higher mammals, including man, originates in external stimulation and that there is no evidence of spontaneous internal stimulation.&quot; Clearly, many individuals - and whole cultures - manage quite well without behaving aggressively, and there is no evidence of the inexorable buildup of pressure this &quot;hydraulic&quot; model would predict. The theory also predicts that venting aggressive energy should make us less aggressive - an effect known as &quot;catharsis,&quot; which follows Aristotle's idea that we can be purged of unpleasant emotions by watching tragic dramas. But one study after another has shown that we are likely to become more violent after watching or participating in such pastimes. Although the hydraulic model has been discredited, the more general belief in an innate human propensity for violence has not been so easily shaken. Among the arguments one hears is these: Animals are aggressive and we cannot escape the legacy of our evolutionary ancestors; human history is dominated by takes of war and cruelty, and certain areas of the brain and particular hormones are linked to aggression, proving a biological basis for such behavior. First, we should be cautious in drawing lessons from other species to explain our own behavior, given the mediating force of culture and our capacity for reflection. But even animals are not as aggressive as some people think - unless the term &quot;aggression&quot; includes killing to eat. Organized group aggression is rare in other species, and the aggression that does exist is typically a function of the environment in which animals find themselves. Scientists have discovered that altering animals' environment, or the way they are reared, can have a profound impact on the level of aggression found in virtually all species. Furthermore, animals cooperate both within and among species far more than many of us may assume on the basis of watching nature documentaries. When we turn to human history, we find an alarming number of aggressive behaviors, but we do not find reason to believe the problem is innate. Here are some of the points made by critics of biological determinism: Even if a given behavior is universal, we cannot automatically conclude that it is part of our biological nature. All known cultures may produce pottery, but that does not mean that there is a gene for pottery-making. Aggression is no where near universal. Many hunter-gatherer societies in particular are entirely peaceful. And the cultures that are &quot;closer to nature&quot; would be expected to be the most warlike if the proclivity for war were really part of that nature. Just the reverse seems to be true. While it is indisputable that wars have been fought, the fact that they seem to dominate our history may say more about how history is presented than about what actually happened. Many people have claimed that human nature is aggressive after having lumped together a wide range of emotions and behavior under the label of aggression. While cannibalism, for example, is sometimes perceived as aggression, it might represent a religious ritual rather than an expression of hostility. It is true that the presence of some hormones or the stimulation of certain sections of the brain has been experimentally linked with aggression. But after describing these mechanisms in some detail, K.E. Moyer, a physiologist at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, emphasizes that &quot;aggressive behavior is stimulus-bound. That is, even though the neural system specific to a particular kind of aggression is well activated, the behavior does not occur unless an appropriate target is available (and even then) it can be inhibited.&quot; Regardless of the evolutionary or neurological factors said to underlie aggression, &quot;biological&quot; simply does not mean &quot;unavoidable.&quot; The fact that people voluntarily fast or remain celibate shows that even hunger and sex drives can be overridden. All this concerns the matter of aggressiveness in general. The idea that war in particular is biologically determined is even more far-fetched. To begin with, we tend to make generalizations about the whole species on the basis of our own experience. &quot;People in a highly warlike society are likely to overestimate the propensity toward war in human nature,&quot; says Donald Greenberg, a sociologist at the University of Missouri. The historical record, according to the Congressional Research Service, shows the United States is one of the most warlike societies on the planet, having intervened militarily around the world more than 150 times since 1850. Within such a society, not surprisingly, the intellectual traditions supporting the view that aggression is more a function of nature than nurture have found a ready audience. The mass media also play a significant role in perpetuating outdated views on violence, according to Jeffrey Goldstein, a psychologist at Temple University. Because it is relatively easy to describe and makes for a snappier news story, reporters seem to prefer explanations of aggression that invoke biological necessity, he says. An international conference of experts concluded in 1986 that war is not an inevitable part of human nature. When one member tried to convince reporters that this finding was newsworthy, few news organizations in the United States were interested. One reporter told him, &quot;Call us back when you find a gene for war.&quot; Leonard Eron, a psychologist at the University of Illinois in Chicago, observes, &quot;TV teaches people that aggressive behavior is normative, that the world around you is a jungle when it is actually not so.&quot; In fact, research at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communications has shown that the more television an individual watches, the more likely he or she is to believe that &quot;most people would take advantage of you if they got the chance.&quot; The belief that violence in unavoidable, while disturbing at first glance, actually holds a curious attraction for some people. It also allows individuals to excuse their own acts of aggression by suggesting that they have little choice. &quot;In order to justify, accept, and live with war, we have created a psychology that makes it inevitable,&quot; says Dr. Bernard Lown, co-chairman of International Physicians for th4e Prevention of Nuclear War, which received the Nobel peace Prize in 1985. &quot;It is a rationalization for accepting war as a system of resolving human conflict.&quot; To understand these explanations for the war-is-inevitable belief is to realize its consequences. Treating any behavior as inevitable sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy: By assuming we are bound to be aggressive, we are more likely to act that way and provide evidence for the assumption. People who believe that humans are naturally aggressive may also be unlikely to oppose particular wars. The evidence suggests, then, that humans do have a choice with respect to aggression and war. To an extent, such destructiveness is due to the mistaken assumption that we are helpless to control an essentially violent nature. &quot;We live in a time,&quot; says Lown, &quot;when accepting this as inevitable is no longer possible without courting extinction.&quot;</strong><br />

<strong>“In order to justify, accept and live with war, we've created a psychology that makes it inevitable,” Lown says. “It's a rationalization for accepting war as a system of resolving human conflict.” To accept this explanation for the war-is-inevitable belief is simultaneously to realize its consequences. Treating any behavior as inevitable sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy: By assuming we are bound to be aggressive, we are more likely to act that way and provide evidence for the assumption. People who believe that humans are naturally aggressive may also be relatively unlikely to oppose particular wars or get involved in the peace movement. Some observers insist that this belief functions only as an excuse for their unwillingness to become active. But others attribute some effect to the attitude itself. “The belief that war is inevitable leads people to rely on armament rather than working for disarmament,” says M. Brewster Smith, professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. There is some empirical support for this position. In a 1985 Finnish study of 375 young people, Riitta Wahlstrom found that those who considered war to be part of human nature were less inclined to support the idea of teaching peace or of personally working for it. David Adams and Sarah Bosch got similar results with a smaller study of U.S. college students. Forty percent said they thought war was “intrinsic to human nature,” and those students were slightly less likely than others to have worked on a peace-related activity. Based on his own research during the Vietnam War, Granberg says, “If a war broke out tomorrow, the people protesting it would probably be those who did not believe that war is inevitable and rooted in human nature.” Those who do believe this are “more likely to accept the idea [of war] or at least unlikely to protest when a particular war occurs.” The evidence suggests, then, that we do have a choice with respect to aggression and war. To an extent, such destructiveness is due precisely to the mistaken assumption that we are helpless to control an essentially violent nature. “We live in a time,” Lown says, “when accepting this as inevitable is no longer possible without courting extinction.” THE SEVILLE STATEMENT PEACE ACTIVISTS can tell when it’s coming: Tipped off by a helpless shrug or a patronizing smile, they brace themselves to hear the phrase yet again. “Sure, I’m all in favor of stopping the arms race. But aren’t you being idealistic? After all, aggression is just” – here it comes – part of human nature.&quot; Like the animals – “red in tooth and claw,” as Tennyson put it – human beings are thought to be unavoidably violent creatures. Surveys of adults, undergraduates and high school students have found that 60 percent agree with the statement, “Human nature being what it is, there will always be war.” It may be part of our society’s folk wisdom, but it sets most of the expert’s heads to shaking. A number of researchers who have spent their lives working on the problem of aggression have concluded that violence, like selfishness, is “in human nature in the same way that David was in the marble before Michelangelo touched it,” in the words of psychologist Barry Schwartz of Tulane Medical School. The problem is that most people are unaware of this scientific consensus. So two years ago, 20 scientists from 12 nations gathered in Seville, Spain, to hammer out a statement on the issue. The resulting declaration represents the wisdom of some of the world’s leading psychologists, neurophysiologists, ethologists and others from the natural and social sciences. It has since been endorsed by the American Psychological Association and the American Anthropological Association, among other organizations. The following are excerpts from the Seville Statement: * It is scientifically incorrect to say we have inherited a tendency to make war from our animal ancestors. Warfare is a peculiarly human phenomenon and does not occur in other animals. War is biologically possible, but it is not inevitable, as evidenced by its variation in occurrence and nature over time and space. * It is scientifically incorrect to say that war or any other violent behavior is genetically programmed into our human nature. Except for rare pathologies the genes do not produce individuals necessarily predisposed to violence. Neither do they determine the opposite. * It is scientifically incorrect to say that in the course of human evolution there has been a selection for aggressive behavior more than for other kinds of behavior. In all well-studied species, status within the group is achieved by the ability to cooperate and to fulfill social functions relevant to the structure of that group. * It is scientifically incorrect to say that humans have a “violent brain.” While we do have the neural apparatus to act violently, there is nothing in our neurophysiology that compels us to [do so]. * It is scientifically incorrect to say that war is caused by “instinct” or any single motivation. The technology of modern war has exaggerated traits associated with violence both in the training of actual combatants and in the preparation of support for war in the general population. * We conclude that biology does not condemn humanity to war, and that humanity can be freed from the bondage of biological pessimism. Violence is neither in our evolutionary legacy nor in our genes. The same species [that] invented war is capable of inventing peace.</strong><br />

Critical theory has never killed a progressive movement - it only invigorates them.<br />
Brown <strong>20</strong>05 <strong>(Wendy, Edgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge and Politics, Professor of Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>On the one hand, critical theory cannot let itself be bound by political exigency; indeed, it has something of an obligation to refuse such exigency. While there are always decisive choices to be made in the political realm (whom to vote for, what policies to support or oppose, what action to take or defer), these very delimitations of choice are often themselves the material of critical theory. Here we might remind ourselves that prying apart immediate political constraints from intellectual ones is one path to being &quot;governed a little less&quot; in Foucault's sense. Yet allowing thinking its wildness beyond the immediate in order to reset the possibilities of the immediate is also how this degoverning rearticulates critical theory and politics after disarticulating them; critical theory comes back to politics offering a different sense of the times and a different sense of time. It is also important to remember that the &quot;immediate choices&quot; are just that and often last no longer than a political season (exemplified by the fact that the political conundrums with which this essay opened will be dated if not forgotten by the time this book is published). Nor is the argument convincing that critical theory threatens the possibility of holding back the political dark. It is difficult to name a single instance in which critical theory has killed off a progressive political project. Critical theory is not what makes progressive political projects fail; at worst it might give them bad conscience, at best it renews their imaginative reach and vigor.</strong><br />

Our argument subsumes their argument, even if there is a material reality with objective social structures that produce policy - it is only through mediation by discourse.<br />

<br />
<strong>In this light, poststructural practices are used critically to investigate how the subject of international relations is constituted in and through the discourses and texts of global politics. Treating theory as discourse opens up the possibility of historicizing it. It is a myth that theory can be abstracted from its socio-historical context, from reality, so to speak, as neorealists and neoclassical realists believe. It is a political practice which needs to be contextualized and stripped of its purportedly neutral status. It must be understood with respect to its role in preserving and reproducing the structures and power relations present in all language forms. Dominant theories are, in this view, dominant discourses that shape our view of the world (the “subject”) and our ways of understanding it. Given my poststructuralist inclinations, I do not subscribe to the positivistic social scientific enterprise which aspires to test hypotheses against the “real world”. I therefore reject epistemological empiricism. Since epistemology is closely intertwined with methodology, especially with positivism, I eschew naturalism as a methodology. I study discourses and discursive practices that take shape in texts. This does not mean that there is no material world as such, only that it must be understood as mediated by language, which in the end means that it is always interpreted once framed by discourse (through the spoken word or in written form).2 “A discourse, then, is not a way of learning ‘about’ something out there in the ‘real world’; it is rather a way of producing that some- thing as real, as identifiable, classifiable, knowable, and therefore, meaningful. Discourse creates the conditions of knowing” (Klein quoted in George, 1994: 30). We consider “real” what we consider significant: a discourse is always an interpretation, a narrative of multiple realities inscribed in a specific social or symbolic order. Discursive representation is therefore not neutral; individuals in power are those who are “authorized” to produce “reality”, and therefore, knowledge. In this context, power is knowledge and the ability to produce that which is considered “true”. A realist discourse will produce the socio- linguistic conditions that will allow it to correspond, in theory as in practice, to “reality”. Evidently, this “reality” will be nothing but the “realist discourse” that one has constituted oneself. This is why, from a poststructuralist perspective, discourse may be considered as ontology.</strong><br />

They say institutions we have specific evidence that they are premised off of discourse to create change.<br />

<br />
<strong>There is by now a broad consensus that discourse analysis has proven ‘a useful theoretical framework for understanding the social production of organizational and interorganizational phenomena’ (Phillips et al., 2004: 636; see also Grant et al., 1998). In their study ‘Discourse and Institutions’, Phillips et al. develop a discursive model of institutionalisation based on Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis approach (see Fairclough, 1992; 1995). According to Fairclough, discourse constructs specific conventions by ruling in or disallowing certain ways of thinking and acting: A social institution is an apparatus of verbal interaction or an ‘order of discourse’. . . It is, I suggest, necessary to see the institution as simultaneously facilitating and constraining the social action of its members: it provides them with a frame for action, without which they could not act, but it thereby constrains them to act within that frame (Fairclough, 1995: 38, quoted in Phillips et al, 2004: 638). From this perspective the FAO can be conceived as being primarily constructed through the production and dissemination of its texts, rather than directly through its ‘actions’. The annual publication of The State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA) and the more recent annually published The State of Food Insecurity in the World (SOFI) are the primary texts where social categories and norms relating to what has been called the ‘global food regime’ are produced (on the concept of food regimes see Friedmann, 1987; McMichael, 2009). Using an analytic process which politicises, historicises and deconstructs the categories and norms found in contemporary editions of these texts it becomes possible to contest and destabilise their ‘factual’ content.</strong><br />

 <br />
Wæver’s approach is state-centric, ignores the interpretive element of security and attempts to fix the object of the speech act.<br />
Jones <strong>19</strong>99 <strong>(Richard Wyn, Lecturer in the Department of International Politics at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth and Director of the University’s Wales Governance Centre, “Security, Strategy, and Critical Theory”, Chapter 4, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>State–centrism is the point at issue in the next section. Suffice it to say here that in his initial formulation of the speech act theory of security, Wæver attempted to yoke his insights concerning securitization to a thoroughgoing state–centrism (Wæver 1994, 1995). As we have seen, he was interested only in how states securitized issues in order to justify extraordinary measures by states: Wæver viewed the grammar of security as inherently statist. In doing so he actually undermined much of the usefulness of the speech act approach. Its (potential) great strength is that it encourages analysts to interrogate the politics of how particular threats are securitized in order to mobilize and legitimate particular responses to them. States, or even state elites, are not the only actors who use the grammar of security in this way. All kinds of social groups, at both sub– and supra–state levels, attempt to securitize many different types of issues, often with far–reaching sociocultural, political, and economic implications. Consider, for example, how the peace movement of the 1980s identified nuclearism as a threat to security (e.g., Falk and Lifton 1982; E. Thompson 1982b) and generated massive public support for its cause despite bitter opposition from governments. Or the way in which some Welsh–language activists have identified the flow of substantial numbers of so–called lifestyle migrants from England to rural Wales as a threat to the survival of the language and thus, in their view, to Welsh nationhood. Adopting a speech act approach to the politics of security as practiced by groups other than the state is a fruitful avenue for exploration. Yet Wæver’s state–centrism initially led him to attempt to delegitimate any effort in this direction. Significantly, however, this position has now been reversed. In his collaborative study Security: A New Framework for Analysis, Wæver and his co–authors, Buzan and de Wilde, have decoupled the speech act approach from state–centrism, correctly acknowledging the distinction between “a state–centric approach and a state–dominated field [of study]” (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998: 37). 1 It is arguable, however, that a more fundamental problem remains in Wæver’s particular understanding of speech act theory itself. Wæver seems to regard the content of security as fixed; that is, he believes that the implications of calling an issue a “security problem” cannot be challenged, only the objects to which that label is applied. In the earlier, avowedly state–centric version of speech act theory, Wæver viewed the consequences of securitization as inherently conservative:“The language game of security is... a jus necessitatis for threatened elites, and this it must remain” (Wæver 1995: 56). This broad thrust has been retained (including the state–centrism?) in the latest formulation of the theory, which argues that to securitize an issue is to render it “so important that it should not be exposed to the normal haggling of politics but should be dealt with decisively by top leaders prior to other issues” (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998: 29). But the notion that the implications of securitization—the meaning of security—are fixed can be challenged at both the empirical level and at the level of the theory of language. Empirically, there can be no doubt that the theory and practice of traditional security have come under unprecedented scrutiny over the past twenty or so years. In particular,notions of “common security” have been advanced based on the argument that there can be no long–term resolution of threats through unilateral, militarized, zero–sum action. Rather, it is only a holistic and empathetic approach to security that can hope to ameliorate threats (the emergence of such an approach can be traced through the following independent, international commissions: the Commission on International Development Issues [1980]; the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues [1982]; the Commission on Global Governance [1995]). Moreover, the experience of the end of the Cold War demonstrates that such a conception of security can become influential(a point returned to and developed further in Chapter 6). This suggests that contrary to the opinions of Wæver or indeed Deudney, the meaning of security is not necessarily fixed but is open to argumentation and dispute. Theoretically, this criticism of Wæver is buttressed by a Habermasian understanding of speech acts. Habermas’s “universal pragmatics,” which forms the general framework for his understanding of speech acts, was outlined in Chapter 3. His specific views on speech acts are summarized by Outhwaite: Contra conceptions of language as just a factual representation of states of affairs, or their negative counterpart in which it is seen as mere rhetoric, [in Habermas’s approach] the three validity–claims of truth, normative rightness and expressive truthfulness or sincerity are given equal importance. (Outhwaite 1994: 131) This understanding of speech acts has major implications for alternative approaches to the theory and practice of security. It suggests that when the label “security” is attached to particular issues, it generates validity–claims that are open to redemption or refutation through argumentation. Thus, for example, if a state treats the continued existence of a minority language within its borders as a threat to national security (as is the case with Turkey and Kurdish, and as was the case until recently with the United Kingdom and Irish), this behavior is susceptible to critique on the grounds of truth, rightness, and sincerity. In this case, the truth of the claim that a minority language is a threat to the state may be questioned. The normative rightness of persecuting a minority culture in the name of national security may also be called into doubt, as well the sincerity of those advocating this policy (whose interests are really being served by such a claim?). Another example of how validity–claims are brought into play through the use of the term “security” is a decision by a government to base another state’s nuclear weapons on its territory to counter a threat that it perceives as emanating from a third country (as was the case with the deployment of U.S. cruise missiles in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s). In this case the questions that might arise during the process of redeeming the validity–claims implicit in this scenario would include: Does the third country really pose a threat to the state deciding to host nuclear weapons? What is the evidence concerning both material capabilities and intentions? Could not nuclear weapons and nuclearism pose a greater threat to security than any putative aggressor? Is it right to threaten death and destruction to millions of innocents in the name of national security? Should a state be privileged in this way? Is the decision to deploy nuclear weapons a sincere response to a perceived threat, or is it a result of intra–alliance politics? Or does it reflect pressure from a self–interested military–industrial–academic complex? As these examples demonstrate, once security discourse is viewed in terms of a series of validity–claims subject to redemption through argumentation rather than a take–it–or–leave–it package of militarized assumptions and responses, a more fluid picture emerges than the one presented by Wæver or Deudney. Understood in Habermasian terms, the speech act of security cannot simply be narrowed by prior definition to exclude all threats other than those that are military in nature—rather, the breadth of the concept is subject to debate. Similarly, the meaning—the implications—of securitizing a particular issue cannot be regarded as fixed. However, I am not arguing that it is easy to challenge the traditions that are attached to a particular concept. Simply to talk about something differently does not necessarily lead to different forms of behavior: Practice cannot simply be reduced to theory. But argumentation and disputation can have—and have had—profound effects even on the practice of security (a theme pursued in Chapter 6). When anchored in Habermasian pragmatics, the speech act approach to security supports arguments for broadening the understanding of the concept and certainly undermines attempts at closure as a result of prior definition rather than argumentation and discussion. More generally, the focus on how arguments concerning truth, rightness, and sincerity are brought into play by security discourse provides powerful theoretical support for the project of critical security studies.</strong><br />

<strong>During the Cold War, Western security specialists were particularly deferential to the worldview and agendas of governments. Politicians, diplomats, and military establishments have their own identities and interests that are not always shared by those for whom they supposedly speak. This is particularly the case where state and society do not coincide. This is why the growth of civil society is so important for security, cooperation, and development, whether regionally or globally. Within civil society, academics in many countries have a special and privileged role: they have knowledge and they are removed from the daily pressures of political life. With this in mind the role of academics in the “intellectual enterprise of security studies” might be defined as follows: to provide new knowledge and more helpful accounts of world affairs and human lives; to look at old facts in new ways; to unsilence the silenced; to help give longer—term perspectives than decision makers concerned with the next election; to expose the hypocrisies, inconsistencies, and power plays in language, relationships, and policies; to provide a more sophisticated language with which to analyze events and problems; to engage in dialogues with policy makers in order to try to open the latter’s imaginations and minds about the ways in which concepts might be translated into better (more friendly to people and nature) policies; to expose false ideas and reveal the unstated assumptions of policies; to open up space for thought and action; to help students think for themselves; to develop new and more rational theories about global security; to cast a critical eye on all theories and all exercises of power, including one’s own; and to speak for cosmopolitan values and to speak up for those who do not have a voice. To attempt to do less is to commit ourselves as university teachers and researchers to being clerks of the powerful, the priests of necessity (rather than architects of possibility), and fatalists about the geography of meaning.</strong><br />

Security is not emancipatory it’s the opposite - it cedes authority and mastery to the state and destroys freedom and emancipation.<br />
Neocleous <strong>20</strong>08 <strong>(Mark is a Professor of the Critique of Political Economy; Head of Department of Politics &amp; History, he joined Brunel University in the Department of Government in 1994. Since then he has published numerous books and articles. His most recent work has been towards the development of a critique of security. “CRITIQUE OF SECURITY” 2008. Pg. 3-5, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>To speak of different ‘security fields’ such as the environment, migration, energy, and so on, often fails to open up the analysis to the ways in which spaces and places, processes and categories, are imagined through the lens of insecurity and in turn appropriated and colonised by the project of security. Given the centrality of the state to the political imagination, to imagine the whole social order through the lens of insecurity is to hand it over to the key entity which is said to be the ground of security, namely the state.17 This is related to the second lack, which is that for all the critical edge employed by the authors in question, the running assumption underpinning the work is that security is still a good thing, still necessary despite how much we interrogate it. The assumption seems to be that while we might engage in a critical interrogation of security, we could never quite be against it. ‘Why we might want “security” after all’ is how one of the most influential essays in this area ends.18 As Didier Bigo points out, how to maximise security always seems to remain the core issue.19 And so there is a danger that these approaches do not quite manage to shake off the managerialism prevalent in more traditional security studies: the desire to ‘do’ security better. The common assumption remains that security is the foundation of freedom, democracy and the good society, and that the real question is how to improve the power of the state to ‘secure’ us. But what if at the heart of the logic of security lies not a vision of freedom or emancipation, but a means of modelling the whole of human society around a particular vision of order? What if security is little more than a semantic and semiotic black hole allowing authority to inscribe itself deeply into human experience? What if the magic word ‘security’ serves merely to neutralise political action, encouraging us to surrender ourselves to the state in a thoroughly conservative fashion?20 And what if this surrender facilitates an ongoing concession to authority and the institutional violence which underpins the authority in question, and thus constitutes the first key step in learning how to treat people not as human beings, but as objects to be administered? In other words, what if the major requirement of our time is less an expanded, refined, or redefined vision of security, and nothing less than a critique of security? Corey Robin points out that when a particular idea routinely accompanies atrocities then some real critical engagement with the idea would seem to be in order.21 And since there is a clear and not particularly long line linking the idea of security and the atrocities being carried out in Guantánamo, Abu Ghraib and the other ‘security centres’ at which people are currently being held, never mind the long history of states slaughtering millions in the name of security, then the time must be right for a critique of security. The starting point of the critique is to see it not as some kind of universal or transcendental value, but rather as a mode of governing, a political technology through which individuals, groups, classes, and, ultimately, modern capital is reshaped and reordered. As a principle of formation, as Mick Dillon calls it,22 security is a technique of power; a political enactment deployed and mobilised in the exercise of power. Extending an argument I have made elsewhere,23 I want to show the extent to which security has facilitated a form of liberal order-building, and to develop a critique of the constant re-ordering of politics and reshaping of society in the name of security. In so doing I aim to challenge the ways in which security has become the master narrative through which the state shapes our lives and imaginations (security risks here, security measures there, security police everywhere), producing and organising subjects in a way that is always already predisposed towards the exercise of violence in defence of the established order. As such, the critique of security is part and parcel of a wider critique of power. This requires taking on the thinkers, groups and classes which have accepted and peddled the security fetish: security-obsessed politicians and policy wonks, the security and intelligence services, the security industry and security intellectuals; the ‘security Fuckers’, as James Kelman calls them.</strong><br />

One of the paradoxes that few faculty recognize is that the ideal of the autonomous individual who has not learned the value of the intergenerational knowledge, skills, and mutually supportive relationships that are the basis of greater community self-reliance, is the kind of individual required by the industrial system of production and consumption. Overcoming faculty resistance to recognizing how many of the ideas and values that have guided their own approaches to education contribute to the consumer dependent lifestyle that is one of the major contributors to degrading the ability of natural systems to renew themselves will be a difficult challenge—especially since </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">many will claim that academic freedom protects their right to promote educational reforms even though the reforms contribute to overshooting the sustaining capacity of natural systems.

Before spelling out the broader implications of basing educational reforms in teacher education and other areas of study on ecologically sustainable ideas and values, it is necessary to summarize the nature of the changes that the Earth’s natural systems are undergoing. It is important to keep in mind that this summary must take account of the realities of the world in which we now live. Changes in natural systems:</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">The industrial system</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">of production and consumption,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">along with the decline in the ability of species and habitats to regenerate themselves, are increasing the rate of global warming as well as changing the chemistry of the world’s oceans</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">Degraded habitats in oceans and in different regions of the world are leading to the disappearance of species</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> (including a rapid decline in the viability of the world’s fisheries). </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">Other environmental changesinclude the spread of deserts, the melting of glaciers that are the source of water for hundreds of millions of people. The loss of <em>topsoil</em>, depletion of major <em>aquifers</em>, and the destruction of <em>forests</em>, are also major sources of change</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> already </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">influencing the <em>prospects of the current and future generations</em></span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. Increase in world population and the spread of poverty: Over the last hundred years the world population has increased by five and a half billion people at the same time the natural resources have been exploited in ways that have led to the impoverishment of more people. The current estimate is that over 2 billion people live on less than two dollars a day. For the different groups in American society, the era of cheap food is over—which, along with the rising cost of fuel and other basic services will force many people further into poverty. Changes in Lifetime Employment: Economic globalization, along with the spread of the morally unrestrained culture of corporations, will cause more people to outlive their savings in the increasingly privatized retirement programs. The lack of health insurance now experienced by nearly forty-seven million Americans is the leading cause of bankruptcy and homelessness. Youth entering the job market will find that the outsourcing of work to low wage regions of the world, even in highly skilled occupations, will limit their possibilities—and thus their ability to educate their children, to own a decent house, and to save for retirement. The present plight of older workers will also be the plight of younger workers as the government safety nets become further overwhelmed by the current shift in the distribution of wealth in society. </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">The <em>future is made</em> </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">even more</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">uncertain</span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;"> by</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">the current globalization of</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">an industrial/consumer oriented lifestyle</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. While economic globalization is being viewed as the expression of progress,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">it is increasing the rate of <em>global warming</em> and the depletion of the Earth’s natural resources. Unfortunately, scientists </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">and other experts </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">have no way of knowing the regenerative capacity of the natural systems that are being exploited at an accelerating rate</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. How long with it take for various fish stocks, such as the codfish once so abundant and the blue fin tuna now on the verge of extinction, to recover? Can the aquifers that are being mined as though they are an infinite resource regenerate themselves within our lifetimes—or even the seventh generation from now? Can the world’s oceans reverse the acidic levels and warmer temperatures that are now contributing to the death of coral reefs that nearly 25 percent of fish species depend upon? What is the time frame for regenerating the glaciers that are the source of fresh water for hundreds of millions of people? Even though we do not have the answers to these questions, more of the world’s governments have made the adoption of the American consumer lifestyle their goal. </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">Many regions of the world are already experiencing the degradation of</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">natural systems that were assumed to be inexhaustible—such as</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">potable <em>water</em>, forest cover, topsoil, <em>fisheries</em>, <em>petroleum</em>, and other natural <em>minerals</em>.</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Pg. 182-184 </span></span><br />

<span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">In conducting a workshop,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">it is important to remember that</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">the disciplinary perspectives of faculty will influence</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">the</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">initial</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">discussion of curriculum reform</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. Unfortunately, the disciplinary background of faculty too often results in the exchange of views that do not take account of what others have said, and</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">too often end with nothing really accomplished in terms of addressing the main issue</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">—which is how</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">to initiate educational reforms that will lead to reducing people’s dependency upon consumerismwhile</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">at the same time</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">strengthening the self-reliance and local democracy of communities</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. One critic suggested that it was foolish to think that “ethical consumerism” would reverse global warming, while others have voiced concern that the commons were enclosed centuries ago, and that there is no point in discussing them now. The response from some faculty I have encountered at different universities is truly amazing, with the most egregious being the criticism that I am proposing that we no longer use technologies. These comments, and even some that relied upon scatological language to express what they think of my proposals, bring out an important issue that needs to be recognized. Although classroom teachers and most professors in non-scientific and technologically oriented disciplines will be unable to contribute to the development of the energy efficient technologies, and to the retrofitting of our culture’s infrastructure, the one educational reform they can undertake, beyond the courses that now have an environmental focus, is to introduce students to the importance of conserving the linguistic diversity of the world’s cultures, and to learning how these diverse approaches to the cultural commons enable people to live less consumer dependent lives.That is, the major responsibility of classroom </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">teachers </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">and university professors is to help students understand the non-monetary sources of wealth that accompany participation in most activities of the local cultural commons. They also </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">have a <em>special responsibility</em> for ensuring that students understand the historical forces</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">—ideologies, religious traditions of thinking, technological developments, market forces, and so forth,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">that are threatening the further enclosure of both the cultural and environmental commons</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Why a Workshop is Needed My experience in promoting among faculty from different disciplines a discussion of educational reforms that address the revitalization of the cultural commons has led to the recognition that </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">there are effective as well as totally ineffective ways of getting participants to move beyond the mind-set they bring to the discussion</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">Because the discussion of the nature of the </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">cultural </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">commons involves a different <em>theoretical framework</em> than most faculty are accustomed to thinking within</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">—that is, a different understanding of language, of the nature of taken-for-granted patterns of belief and behavior, and of the nature and importance of intergenerational knowledge, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">it is vital that the conceptual organization</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">of the workshop </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">outlined herebe followed—and that the person facilitating </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">the workshop </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">understands how to reframe</span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;"> the discussion so that </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">learning about the cultural traditions that represent </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">alternatives to a consumer-dependent lifestyle <em>remains the central focus</em>. Controlling the frame </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">is not a matter of being authoritarian. Rather, it </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">is a matter of <em>recognizing when the discussion is drifting from the main theme</em>, and knowing when to restate the main theme and </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">then to help faculty recognize the connections or disconnections between their line of thinking and the main theme—which is to </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">help students recognize the alternatives to consumer-dependent livesand to help them to develop the communicative competence necessary for resisting various forms of enclosure. </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Order in Which Themes and Theory Should be Introduced </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">Moving</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">from a discussion of the nature of the ecological crises, and how current cultural practices are major contributors, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">to a discussion of educational reforms that reduce the current level of dependency upon consumerism </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">also </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">requires careful attention to the starting point</span></em></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">of the workshop. It also involves knowing when the discussion of cultural practices needs to be supplemented by the introduction of theory that explains relationships and consequences that may otherwise go unnoticed. The discussion of local cultural practices is crucial to keeping the discussion from becoming abstract, which then makes it more difficult for participants in the workshop to recognize the changes they can introduce in their mediating role between the cultural commons and the culture of consumerism. In addition to suggesting the order of presentation of themes and theory, this handbook will include as part of the appendix short readings that summarize the relevant theory, as well as suggestions for showing videos that highlight the differences between more self-reliant and consumer-oriented cultures. </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Pg. 3-5<em>1nc </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> </span></span><br />

<span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">It is important to acknowledge that the rise of</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">liberal/</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">Enlightenment ideas</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">in the late 18th and 19th century led to basic improvements in the lives of the people of Western Europe who had been oppressed by feudal ideas and institutions—and by the authoritarian political systems that were equally resistant to change. The emphasis on the authority and power of critical reflection to overturn unjust traditions, the idea that change can lead to social progress, the view of the individual as having the power of self-determination, and the idea that new forms of knowledge will mitigate the ravages of the illness and the stultifying nature of work, led to important advances. But it also needs to be kept in mind that the widespread acceptance in the West of these ideas also</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">coincided with the rise of the Industrial Revolution.And </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">more importantly, these </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">liberal ideas had no self-limiting principle</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">. That is, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">the dominant motivation has been to achieve more and faster progress, more reliance on critical reflection </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">(increasingly by experts promoting the development of new technologies and markets), more labor saving technologies (and now the elimination of the need for workers), newer drugs (and the control of the American Congress to ensure the growing dominance of the drug industry), </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">and more </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">self-determination—including </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">self-determinationin the construction of knowledge and values. The lack of any self-limiting principles</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">, which made these liberal ideas even more problematic when they were merged with the market liberalism of John Locke, Adam Smith, and, later, Herbert Spencer, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">becomes especiallyevident when we consider the current drive to turn every aspect of the environmental andcultural commons into market opportunities—and to convert the entire world to a survival ofthe fittest business mentality</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">. To reiterate a point that I have been making in the earlier part of my critique, in basing their interpretations of transformative learning on these liberal assumptions Freire, Dewey, Gadotti, and the current group of </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">critical pedagogy </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">fundamentalists not only reproduce the contradictions that arise when relying on abstract ideas for reforming a culturally diverse world, but they also </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">reproduce </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">in their interpretations of transformative learning </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">the silences that characterized the earlier phase of</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">liberal/</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">Enlightenment</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">thinking. </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">These silences </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">in the writings of the earlier liberal/Enlightenment thinkers </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">led to ignoring thedifferences in cultural ways of knowing</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">. In reality, it was not really a case of ignoring these differences. Rather, in the early phase of liberal thinking it was a matter of viewing other cultures as primitive, uncivilized, and as heathens that needed to be turned into Christians. The deficit model of culture has in more recent times been revised so that they are now viewed a pre-literate, pre-scientific, economically and technologically undeveloped, limited by a spectator approach to knowledge, and locked into a semi-intransitive state of consciousness</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. <span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">What</span></span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">earlier and present</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">liberal theorists</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">have </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">overlook</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ed <span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">is that many</span></span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">of these</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">non-Western culture have developed in ways that have a smaller ecological footprint</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, <span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">and many of them place more emphasis on the forms of knowledge and relationships thatsustain the commons in ways that reduce the dependence upon consumerism</span></span>. <span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">The reductionism ways in which</span></span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">various traditions of</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">liberal thinking</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> have</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">categorized non-Western cultures</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">, as well as marginalized cultures in the West, have </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">led to ignoring the need for an in-depth understanding of their approaches to knowledge and intergenerational renewa</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">l. <span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">This</span></span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> reductionist way of thinking, as I have been arguing, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">is part of the reason for the imperialist orientation of transformative learning </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">theorists such as Freire and Dewey, and the professors of education who are now promoting transformative learning in 29 non-Western countries. More importantly, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">this bias which shows up in the messianicnature of transformative learning theorists should also be understood as one of the reasonsthat, when theorists </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">such as Gadotti, O’Sullivan, and McLaren </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">do address environmental issues, their panacea is to promote the global acceptance of an even more culturally uninformed interpretations of liberal ideals</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">. That is, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">their response</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">to the industrial culture that is accelerating the rate of change in the Earth’s natural system, and in making the people of the world more dependent upon consumerism, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">is to <em>promote more change</em> through anapproach to education that fosters a rootless form of individualism.</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> But they add to the crisis of the commons that is spreading around the world in other ways. </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">Their </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">uncritical embrace of various </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">explanations</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> --</span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">current versions of Social Darwinism, the oppressive (banking) nature of all cultural models of learning other than their own, the messianic drive to share (impose) our highest ideals on other cultures, the effort to enable other cultures to achieve a Western interpretation of what constitutes the fullest expression of their humanity, and so forth—</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">all add up to a thinking of other cultures asfundamentally deficient</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">—<span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">and</span></span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">thus, as Derek Rasmussen points out, as </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">in need of being rescued</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">(</span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">Bowers, Apffel-Marglin, pp. 115-131). This way of thinking does not take account of the fact that there are still nearly 6000 languages still spoken in the world today—with a third of them in danger of becoming extinct in the near future. Conserving this diversity in language/knowledge systemsis directly related to conserving biological diversity, as these languages encode knowledge accumulated over many generations of living in one place and from observing the interdependent relationships that make up the natural and cultural ecology. Unfortunately, transformative learning theorists have not become a voice for educational reforms that support linguistic and, by extension, biological diversity.</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">As long asthey maintain their core ideas about learning being only a transformative, emancipatoryexperience, any references to the importance of cultural diversity is simply empty rhetoric that has as its real purpose the need to represent themselves as being on the politically correct side of the social justice and environmental debate. </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">In effect, Freire and the other transformative learning theorists should be understood as having accepted themselves as being subjects of the banking process of education that they reject for others. That is, their professors imposed upon them a restricted political language that neither they nor their professors have thought critically about. And one of the primary characteristic of this political language, which I have earlier identified with classical liberalism (sans Adams Smith’s emphasis on the progressive nature of a market economy) is that it lacks a vocabulary for naming those aspects of culture that are now the only real source of resistance to the imperialism of market liberalism. It is especially noteworthy that the word “commons” is not part of the emancipatory liberal discourse. The problem with the language of liberalism can be seen in Gadotti’s way of addressing the ecological crisis. Globalizing the romantic idea of a planetary consciousness emerging from the grand journey into the individual’s subjective universe simply does not address the genuine sources of resistance to economic globalization and its impact on natural systems. What from the beginning of human history has been understood as the commons, and which exists today in various state of viability in the diverse cultures of the world, is the only alternative to the way in which the West’s industrial culture is creating greater dependence upon Western style consumerism and technologies. The nature of the commons varies from culture to culture, and from bioregion to bioregion. What they have in common is that much of the culture’s symbolic patterns as well as the natural systems of the bioregion are available to the members of the community on a non-monetary basis. That is, they have not been enclosed—that is, privatized, commodified, monetized, incorporated into an industrial process, and so forth. This general account of the commons does not mean that all of the culturally diverse commons where entirely free of political systems that gave certain groups special advantages—including the right to restrict the commons to the bare essentials for sustaining life, such as access to water, soil for growing small crops, animals, traditions of ceremonies, patterns of reciprocity, intergenerational knowledge of how to use medical plants, preparing food, and so forth. To make the point more directly, the commons should not be understood as always free of status systems and the unequal use of power. On the other hand, many of the cultural commons have been and still are characterized by local decision-making—an important phenomena that is now being undermined by the World Trade Organization and capitalistic forms of enclosure where decision about the use of the commons is now made by corporations and private owners who are unaffected by their decisions. The enclosure (privatization) of municipal water systems, as well as the corporate ownership and sale of supposedly “pure” bottled water, are examples of how the process of enclosing the commons also undermines local democracy. </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">In terms of the discussion of the relevance of transformative learning theories foraddressing the ecological crisis, what is important to consider is how the liberal discourse </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">of Freire, Dewey, Gadotti, and the critical pedagogy fundamentalists (Giroux, McLaren, Peter Roberts, and so forth) </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">lacks the language for representing in other than pejorative terms what is distinctive about the commons. This includes their inability to recognize that the commonsare dependent upon intergenerational knowledge</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">-- which can also be understood as traditions. As mentioned earlier,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">the word tradition has a pejorative meaning for</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">all of the</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">transformative learning theorists </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">even though they are entirely dependent upon the reenactment of traditions in their use of language and most other areas of their daily lives. </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">By associating intergenerational knowledge with oppression</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">(and some of it is oppressive), and in not recognizing the many ways different cultures encode and renew it, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">they are unable toclarify how the revitalization of the commons</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">of various communities in North America, and in other parts of the world, are both sites of resistance to economic globalization—</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">and </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">at the same times</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">sites of affirmation of the possibilities </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">of local decision-making, the importance maintaining cultural diversity,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">and the possibilities of living less environmentally destructivelives. </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">Instead of being able to recognize that critical reflection is essential to clarifying which aspects of intergenerational knowledge and traditions should be conserved (such as the gains in the labor movement, civil rights, gender and racial equality, local democracy, ethnic alternatives to industrially processed food, and so forth) </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">the transformative learning theoristsrepresent critical reflection as the way of overturning all traditions—including the traditionsthat are essential to sustaining what remains of the world’s diverse commons</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">. Recall Freire’s claim that each individual and generation should rename the reality of the previous generation, Gadotti’s warning about the oppressive nature of cultural transmission, Giroux’s teachers whose only responsibility is to function as“transformative intellectuals”, McLaren’s “pedagogical negativism which translates into the need to doubt everything, and Dewey’s equating of traditions with mindless habits. In effect,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">the major weakness of transformativelearning theorists is that they lack the conceptual basis for recognizing that resistance to the imperialistic nature of </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">market </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">liberalism, in all of its cultural and ecological destructiveness, requires a more balanced understanding of the dual role of critical reflection</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">—<span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">which is tooverturn the sources of eco-injustice</span></span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">(which encompasses social justice issues) </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">and to renewthe traditions and intergenerational knowledge that strengthens the commons</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">. They also ignore that critical reflection is not the only legitimate approach to intergenerational renewal, and that many aspects of the cultural construction of everyday reality are sources empowerment and the basis of moral reciprocity.</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> <span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">The implications of their </span></span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">collective </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">silences and reductionist thinking is that they havenothing to say about the need to re-direct curriculum reform in ways that help students recognize the different aspects of the commons that they take-for-granted</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">. In not being given the language for naming the commons they take-for-granted, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">they are unable to recognizeand thus challenge politically when the commons are being further enclosed</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">. That is, in addition to not understanding their rights within the commons, as well as their responsibility to future generations for ensuring that a commons are not further diminished by corporate capitalism,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">their</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">present</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">form of education</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">(which will become even more limited as transformative learning becomes more widespread) now</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">leaves them largely ignorant of thenon-monetized face-to-face alternatives to consumerism within</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">their</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">communities</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">. </span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">The other irony is that the use of</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">the restrictive</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">liberal political</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;">vocabulary that the transformativelearning theorists reinforce</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;"> in teacher education classes, which in turn is reinforced in public schools, is that a significant number of Americans call themselves conservatives while supporting the imperialistic assumptions and practices of market liberals.

<span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Yet there continue to be differences between how liberals understand the nature of progress. A useful way of identifying these differences is to identify liberals working to alleviate poverty and various forms of exploitation as </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">social justice liberals. </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Liberals who use critical inquiry to develop new technologies and to exploit new markets should be labeled as market liberals. The former were and continue to be critical of the exploitive nature of the free enterprise system, while the latter were and still are willing to let the “invisible hand” supposedly operating in the free market system distribute the benefits to the deserving—which usually means those who are already privileged. Given these differences, and they are hugely important, the two groups of liberals nevertheless </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">share a common set of silences and prejudices. Already mentioned is their shared <em>prejudice of the knowledge systems of other cultures</em>—particularly indigenous cultures. They also sharea</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">very narrow and thus </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">basic misunderstanding of the nature and importance of cultural traditions</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.

And both </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">social justice </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">and market </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">liberals fail to understand that language is not simply a conduit in a sender/receiver process of communication, but instead is <em>metaphorically layered in ways that reproduce past misconceptions</em> in today’s taken-for-granted patterns of thinking. This latter oversight accounts for how</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">both </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">social justice</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">and market</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">liberals are continually <em>embracing whatever is represented as a progressive step forward—and not asking about which traditions are vital</em> </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">to the well-being of community and </span></span><span class="berief"><em><span style="font-family: Georgia;">to a sustainable future </span></em></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">are being lost. There are many unrecognized assumptions that are shared by students on university campuses who identify themselves as conservatives and the professors whom they regard as subverting the American way of life. Again, the failure to recognize the shared assumptions and silences can, in part, be traced to the failure of universities to engage students in a discussion of the writings of the early political theorists whose influence continues to today. The misunderstandings resulting from this lack of historical knowledge are particularly evident when the beliefs and values of the self-identified conservative students are compared with the market liberal agenda promoted by the CATO and American Enterprise Institutes. Indeed, they turn out to be nearly identical—though some of these students balk at the idea of open debate as advocated by the American Enterprise Institute. As most university faculty embrace social justice liberalism they see no reason to introduce students to the thinking of philosophical conservatives or to the ideas of classical liberal thinkers. And the few social justice faculty who are introducing their students to the writings of environmental writers such as Rachel Carson, Aldo Leopold, Wendell Berry, and Vandana Shiva fail to clarify for students that these are essentially conservative environmental thinkers. By not engaging students in discussions of the different forms of conservatism, including the faux conservatism of President George W. Bush and his religious, corporate, and military base of support, students are more likely to accept without question Lakoff’s designation of environmentalists as liberal progressive activists. And they will continue to perpetuate the silences and prejudices that have been an aspect of liberal thinking since the time of the Enlightenment—which will keep them from recognizing that revitalizing the diversity of the world’s cultural commons will be a necessary part of achieving a sustainable future. </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The reports of the I</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">ntergovernmental </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">P</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">anel on </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">C</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">limate</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> C</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">ontrol, </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">which reflect the consensus thinking of 600 scientists from more than 100 countries on the nature and causes of global warming, brings into focus</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">another aspect of </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">the slippery slope that</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">both the market and </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">social justice liberals are greasing.

What is not usually recognized is that the emergence of fascism between the two world wars resulted when democratic institutions became so weakened that they were no longer able to address the sources of economic and social unrest. </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">People have demonstrated time and again that they prefer order over chaos, and they have often embraced the strong political leader who, </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">as the supreme “decider”, </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">does away with the seemingly endless debates which are at the center of the democratic process</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.

There are many other analogs than those associated with the ideas and policies of market liberals that need to be considered in determining the different meanings of the word “conservatism”. Briefly, learning to think and communicate in the language of one’s cultural groups conserves its many taken-for-granted patterns of thinking and values. Our DNA is also a powerful conserving force that influences the most fundamental aspects of our biology. The taken-for-granted nature of most of our cultural knowledge and values is also an inescapable aspect of what can be referred to as embodied conservatism. And then there is temperamental conservatism which is expressed in a preference for certain foods, wearing certain clothes, having certain friends, and so forth. These different expressions of conservatism are largely part of our embodied experiences, and are different in fundamental ways from conservative ideas of how societies should be organized and governed.In order to conserve the gains in social justice and civil liberties it is important to keep in mind that not all of conservative ideas, such as those advocating the right of states to enforce racist policies, the cultural tradition of child brides, honor killings, and poll taxes, should be carried forward. On the other hand, the current practice of using the word to stigmatize individuals and groups who are more aware of the traditions that are the basis of their mutually supportive and intergenerationally connected communities should not be continued. In order to make more informed judgments of about the different expressions of conservatism—judgments about what should be supported and what should be resisted—we need to expand our political vocabulary. In addition to rectifying our use of political terminology so that labels accurately reflect the beliefs and practices of different groups, we need to follow the practice of different religious groups who use adjectives that identify the religious group’s specific orientation or the tradition it is part of. Examples include the distinction between Orthodox and Reform Judaism, Greek Orthodox Christians and Evangelical Christians, moderate and fundamentalists Muslims, and so forth. The adjectives are not always as accurate as we would like, but they avoid the problem of including a wide range of interpretations and agendas under a single rubric. The distinction between market and social justice liberals is an example that has been introduced here. Other examples might include environmental conservatives and indigenous conservatives. The problem of relying upon a single rubric can be seen in Thomas Frank’s reference to the Christians in Kansas who support President George W. Bush’s efforts to dismantle the separation of powers and the Constitution as conservative. Referring to them as members of the religious right would have brought into focus their political agenda, which included abolishing abortion, gays, separation of church and state, and equal opportunities for women and other previously marginalized groups. Journalists and media pundits need to use the label of extremists if it accurately represents the political agenda of certain individuals and groups. For example, Vice-President Richard Cheney and David Addington need to be identified as extremists. And there is a need to use the label of fascist when it accurately fits the ideas and political agenda of an individual or group. It is important to note that few graduates of our universities possess a knowledge of the core ideas and practices shared by different fascist regimes, and thus are unable to recognize political trends that are moving the society in that direction. Most of all, we need to avoid the intellectual laziness that characterizes so much of our formulaic use of conservative and liberal.</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> There is an urgent need for the more reflective people to criticize our universities for their failure to educate students about the </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">history of ideas we now refer to as ideologies—including the need for them to understand which </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">ideologies</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">are </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">contributing to overshooting the sustaining capacity of the Earth’s natural systems</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.

<span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The chief connection between the two questions has to do with the historical roots of the Titanic mind-set; particularly how earlier influential Western philosophers and political theorists influenced the distinction that Western universities now make between high and low status knowledge—a distinction that is reproduced by most public school teachers. The high status knowledge was, and continues to be, the basis of the industrial/scientific way of thinking that produced the Titanic as well the majority of today’s technologies that are putting us on the collision course of exceeding what the Earth’s natural systems can sustain. These</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;"> early philosophers and</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">political</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">theorists <em>set the intellectual and moral agenda</em> through the language they used, as well as by the silences required by their theories</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. The combination of their ideas and analogies became the dominant discourses among the West’s industrially oriented elites and, for reasons that are difficult to explain, the dominant way of thinking of men and women who possess only a surface knowledge of the writings of these philosophers. And in many instances, the knowledge of the latter group is limited to words and phrases, taken out of historical context, that are used to justify world shaping economic and political policies.</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">Words and phrases such as “freedom</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">,” “free-markets,” “the invisible hand,” “private property,”</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> “</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">individualism,” “progress</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">,” “natural resource,” “survival of the fittest” (now replaced by “Darwinian fitness”)</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">and so on, can be traced back to the ethnocentric thinking of the West’s most influential thinkers</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">The widespread silences in the thinking of today’s</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">public school</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">teachers</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">and university professors </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">about the nature of traditions</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, the cultural and</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">environmental commons</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">cultural differences in ways of knowing,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">and the complexity and importance of intergenerational knowledge</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">(including the many ways in which it is renewed)</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">can</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">also </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">be traced back to the silences and biases that have been part of the</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">largely unrecognized </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">legacy of Western philosophers and</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">political </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">theorists</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">While the process of how complex systems of thinking passed on in university classes becomes reduced to the guiding metaphors that politicians and members of the public rely upon cannot be fully explained,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">it is</span></em></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">nevertheless</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">important to begin the task of identifying the sources of the biases and silences</span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;"> that now are putting us on a collision course with the environment. The micro-ecology of words, analogies, and interpretative frameworks</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">that are the basis</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">of today’s discourses</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, always</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">have a history</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">To be more specific, they have their origins in earlier culturally specific ways of thinking. We may not be able to explain the direct causal connections between the language/thought processes of earlier theorists, but there is one thing of which we can be certain. The conduit view of language promoted in our public schools and universities has conditioned the public, including today’s intellectual elites as well as the Christian fundamentalist and NASCAR sub-cultures, to ignore how the thought patterns and values of the past continue to be the basis of how most people think. The conduit view of language sustains one of the myths that impedes the ability of most educators at all levels to recognize that the high-status forms of knowledge will replicate the fate of the Titanic –but on a vastly larger scale. In effect, the conduit view of language reinforces the naïve understanding that language is part of a sender/receiver process of communication. This myth, in turn, is essential to sustaining other myths, including the idea of objective data and information—as though neither have their origins in human observation and interpretation. Other myths that the conduit view of language helps to obscure include the idea of the rational process as free of cultural influence, the autonomous nature of the individual (at least, that is the goal to be attained through education), that machines serve as the best model for understanding organic processes. While it is impossible to establish a direct causal link between the micro-linguistic ecologies created by philosophers such as Plato and Descartes, who made a virtue of abstract and ethnocentric thinking, and the way their </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">early vocabularies continue to be reproduced in today’s Titanic mind-set</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, it is possible to provide an overview of how </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">the silences and biases of these early theorists </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">continue to marginalize an understanding of the nature and importance of the cultural and environmental commons. Perhaps, marginalize is not the best word here, as what the tradition of Western philosophers and political theorists accomplished was to help perpetuate a prejudice against the forms of knowledge and interdependent face-to-face relationships that exist largely outside of a money economy. Most important is that these prejudices </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">stand in the way of recognizing</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">the diversity of cultural patterns and </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">relationships that hold the promise of a sustainable existence</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The suggestion that</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">the ideas, values, and silences encoded in the language that </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">has </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">come </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">down </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">to us from influential philosophers of the distant past <em>continue to influence how powerful groups think today</em></span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">may imply that I am making an argument for linguistic determinism. This is definitely not the case. As all languages are metaphorical in nature, with the process of analogic thinking being framed by the root metaphors (mythopoetic narratives and powerful evocative experiences that differ from culture to culture), and with image words that encode the key idea or model of thinking derived from the analogy that survived over others, language and the accompanying need for analogic thinking, are always changing. Some change faster than others.</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">A form of linguistic determinism does occur when the language, and the conceptual templates it reproduces, are taken-for-granted</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. For example,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">when current thinkers take-for-granted</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">that machines provide</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">the</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">best </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">interpretative framework</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">for understanding the mental/cultural processes of the brain,</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">they are complicit in perpetuating the misconceptions encoded in the language handed down from the past</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">—and in this case, the failure of Newton, Kepler, and the other founders of the scientific revolution to recognize the limitations of reducing all forms of life to what fits an mechanistic explanatory framework. </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">Complicity in reproducing the misconceptions of the past takes on added importance</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">when we consider the ways in which the industrial/consumer-oriented culture continues to transform the intergenerational knowledge that sustains the cultural and environmental commons into new exploitable markets</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Although the boundaries between the two cultures, the cultural commons and the industrial culture that requires reliance on a money economy, are not absolute, there are fundamental differences in their respective impacts on the self-renewing capacity of natural systems. Participating in both subcultures, including the ways in which they are interdependent, often involves taking-for-granted the values and ideas that are at the core of both cultures—even when these ideas and values are in direct conflict with each other. To make this point in a more concrete manner, most people participate in the intergenerational approaches to the preparation and sharing of a meal, while at other times frequenting the neighborhood fastfood outlet. Thinking about the differences in the experiences--such as in social relationships, development of skills, the adverse impact on the environment, and dependence upon a money economy is seldom given more than superficial attention. In the areas of the creative arts, healing practices, crafts, and so forth, there are similar differences between the largely nonmonetized cultural commons and the monetized industrial/consumer dependent culture. Yet, the taken-for-granted state of consciousness results in moving between these two subcultures without an awareness of how one is a source of personal and community empowerment while the other leads to different forms of dependency.The tacit (taken-for-granted) nature of how most individuals experience everyday life is directly connected to the languaging processes of the culture into which they are born.</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">If individuals are not aware </span></em></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">that the language they rely upon in everyday activities influences what they will be aware of, </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">what will be taken for granted, and what will exist as the culture’s zones of silence, </span></em><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">they will be <em>less likely to recognize what is ecologically sustainable, and what is putting them on a collision course with environmental limits</em></span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">.

<span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt;">The typical response of academics to this proposal for reform will likely be one of resistance, as they will (and as I have witnessed) assume that by making the commons and the processes of enclosure by market liberals the central focus of study their specialized areas of interest will become marginalized.

The tradition of Western philosophers, as well asphilosophers and wisdom traditions of other cultures can be studied from a variety of perspectives relating to whether they understood, promoted, undermined, or were silent about the nature of the interdependence between the cultural and environmental commons. Similarly, courses in journalism, political science, economics, history, business, psychology, and so forth, can add to the students’ understanding of the commons—including the past misconceptions that have led to various forms of enclosure and cultural domination.</span></span><span class="Card-Underline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 11pt; text-decoration: none;"> </span></span><br />

Unfortunately, as pointed out before, these assumptions about the individual as an autonomous thinker (who must cite the source of borrowed ideas), change as the linear expression of progress, an anthropocentric world, a hubris driven ethnocentrism, and a conduit view of language, make it unnecessary to recognize the cultural nature of intelligence.</span></span>While the explicit course content may differ, the underlying deep cultural assumptions that the professors take-for-granted continue to reinforce among students a taken-for-granted way of thinking of the industrial culture that has now reached a critical tipping point<span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. What can be said for certain is that the </em>networking<em></span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">of environmentally oriented faculty </span></span><span class="berief"></em><span style="font-family: Georgia;">has not succeeded</span><em><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> in developing an</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">undergraduate or graduate </span></span>program of study that provides an interdisciplinary understanding of the complex forces that historically and are currently undermining<span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> both </span></span>the <span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">cultural and environmental </span></span>commons<span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">, as well as an understanding of</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> how the cultural commons represents</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">a sustainable alternative to the unsustainable industrial culture that market-liberals are promoting in the name of progress</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. In the Culture of Denial, I suggest that because of the hierarchical organization of</span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">universities </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">that determines the allocation of resources, university presidents </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">need to </span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">provide leadership by allocating extra resources in ways that will </span></span><span class="beriefunderline"><span style="font-family: Georgia; text-decoration: none;">encourage the development of programs of study that address the cultural roots of the ecological crisis</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">. At that time the evidence of global warming was less visible than it is now, and corporations were actively funding scientists who were willing to dispute the evidence that the early scientific warnings were based upon. Many corporations are now taking global warming seriously by promoting research in alternative sources of energy. Unfortunately,</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">there is little evidence that university</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">presidents are</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">willing to go</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">much</span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">beyond</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">signing their names to documents that commit universities to address environmental issues—which is little more than </span></span><span class="berief"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">a ritualized gesture</span></span><span class="Brief-Smalltext"><span style="font-family: Georgia;">in the direction of political correctness. </span></span></em>Urging<em> faculty to declare </em>a moratorium<em> on teaching courses that reinforce the same deep cultural assumptions that underlie the industrial culture that is a major contributor to global warming,and to use the moratorium to rethink the university’s responsibility forpromoting a more ecologically responsible citizen, appears to be beyond the current ability of university presidents and deans of departments to recognize that we have reached a tipping point that other cultures have ignored—with the results that Diamond documents in his recent book, Collapse. The difference between cultures such as the Anasazi, Mayan, and the Norse outposts in Greenland that could not develop the form of intelligence that would enable them to live within the limits and possibilities of their habit, and our current situation, is that the further degradation of the world’s cultural and environmental commons will be an all-encompassing form of collapse. It seems, however, that fund-raising and ensuring that the alumni can take pride in a winning team as they arrive at the university’s sports venues in oversize SUVs and cars that communicate that their university education paid off big-time, now consume most of the time and energy of university presidents. They seem indifferent to making the hard decisions by asking </em>which programs<em>and departments </em>should be eliminated<em>, thus freeing up fundsfor adegree program that addresses the culturalchanges that contribute to our prospects of reversing the trend line that indicate that modern cultures are exceeding the sustaining capacity of natural systems. Their lack of leadership can also be seen in their failure to educate the alumni that spending millions of dollars on the salaries of winning coaches and the building of new stadiums represent a gross misplacement of what should be the highest university priority in this era of global warming. Given the lack of leadership at the top, as well as the market and social justice liberalism that characterize the thinking of most academics deans (both of which foster the myopia with regard to the environmental crises that is so widespread among the university graduates that support President George W. Bush), faculty networking seems to be the only approach that might lead to the curricular reforms suggested here. But unlike the networking I have participated in at several universities, and observed at a number of other universities, a more successful approach requires a systematic approach to educating the faculty about how the cultural commons represent a proven alternative to the further expansion of the industrial, consumer-dependent culture that is increasing the rate of environmental degradation and the spread of poverty. That is, instead of the networking being based on faculty who integrate environmental issues into their traditional disciplinary concerns, which creates a patchwork of perspectivesand degrees of emphasisthat still </em>reinforce the deep cultural assumptions<em> that are the basis of modernity, it would be more effective to start with educating the faculty about the nature, importance, and threats to the cultural and environmental commons. My experience is that few faculty, even environmentally oriented faculty, understand the cultural commons—and their understanding of the environmental commons too often has been influenced by the misconceptions that Garrett Hardin reproduced in his famous article, “The Tragedy of the Commons.” A possible approach to expanding the faculty’s understanding ofthe interconnections between the cultural and environmental commons, andhow the modern cultural assumptionsthat are reinforced at a taken-for-granted level contribute tothe further enclosure of both commons—and tothe deepening ecological crises, would be for a department to sponsor a seminar for facultythat addresses the complex nature of the commons and how they are being enclosed. With this shared background of understandingthe facultydiscussions can then move to the next stage of reform, and that would be to identify how existing courses can be reconceptualized in ways that were suggested in the earlier discussion of a degree program based on an interdisciplinary approach to revitalizing the cultural and environmental commons. As faculty begin to recognize that their discipline, </em>when framed by a different set of questions<em>, has a great deal to offer to an understanding of the history and current importance of the cultural commons, they are more likely to give their support to a degree program of study.When faculty do not have a shared understanding of the cultural and environmental commons, the exchange of ideas at the networking sessions </em>seldom go<em> much </em>beyond<em>ideas being bounced around that reflect </em>an add-on way of thinking about<em>introducing students to </em>environmental issues<em>. As I suggested before, the minority of university graduates that have taken a course or two that address environmental issues, or have pursued an entire degree in environmental studies that has a heavy emphasis on a scientific perspective, seldom have any understanding of the nature and importance of the cultural commons.

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> In practice, the existence of patriarchy in western religious societies not only ensures the greatest degree of equality between men and women, it also engenders the greatest levels of freedom, personal power, happiness, and economic progress. We can say decisively that America's addiction to feminism has enslaved about half of men to families without giving them anything in return, left more women and children in poverty than at any other time in American history, and forced women to &quot;do it all&quot; as full-time mothers and workers. In-effect, we have done to over half of American men what the Taliban do to women: created an arbitrary, forceful system of family laws and policies that gives tremendous power to one sex, while leaving the other at the mercy of a tyrannical and punitive government. Restoration of patriarchy in Western cultures must begin within the major religions. We can predict America's future if churches fail to remove radical feminist activists from positions of authority. We are only one law away from creating the feminist equivalent of a Talibanic state. Let everyone who believes in salvation begin this great healing task now.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Throughout the broad sweep of human history, there are many examples of people, or classes of people, who chose to avoid the costs of parenthood. Indeed, falling fertility is a recurring tendency of human civilization. Why then did humans not become extinct long ago? The short answer is patriarchy. Patriarchy does not simply mean that men rule. Indeed, it is a particular value system that not only requires men to marry but to marry a woman of proper station. It competes with many other male visions of the good life, and for that reason alone is prone to come in cycles. Yet before it degenerates, it is a cultural regime that serves to keep birthrates high among the affluent, while also maximizing parents’ investments in their children. No advanced civilization has yet learned how to endure without it. Through a process of cultural evolution, societies that adopted this particular social system—which involves far more than simple male domination—maximized their population and therefore their power, whereas those that didn’t were either overrun or absorbed. This cycle in human history may be obnoxious to the enlightened, but it is set to make a comeback. The Conservative Baby Boom The historical relation between patriarchy, population, and power has deep implications for our own time. As the United States is discovering today in Iraq, population is still power. Smart bombs, laser-guided missiles, and unmanned drones may vastly extend the violent reach of a hegemonic power. But ultimately, it is often the number of boots on the ground that changes history. Even with a fertility rate near replacement level, the United States lacks the amount of people necessary to sustain an imperial role in the world, just as Britain lost its ability to do so after its birthrates collapsed in the early 20th century. For countries such as China, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain, in which one-child families are now the norm, the quality of human capital may be high, but it has literally become too rare to put at risk. Falling fertility is also responsible for many financial and economic problems that dominate today’s headlines. The long-term financing of social security schemes, private pension plans, and healthcare systems has little to do with people living longer. Gains in life expectancy at older ages have actually been quite modest, and the rate of improvement in the United States has diminished for each of the last three decades. Instead, the falling ratio of workers to retirees is overwhelmingly caused by workers who were never born. As governments raise taxes on a dwindling working-age population to cover the growing burdens of supporting the elderly, young couples may conclude they are even less able to afford children than their parents were, thereby setting off a new cycle of population aging and decline. Declining birthrates also change national temperament. In the United States, for example, the percentage of women born in the late 1930s who remained childless was near 10 percent. By comparison, nearly 20 percent of women born in the late 1950s are reaching the end of their reproductive lives without having had children. The greatly expanded childless segment of contemporary society, whose members are drawn disproportionately from the feminist and countercultural movements of the 1960s and 70s, will leave no genetic legacy. Nor will their emotional or psychological influence on the next generation compare with that of their parents. Meanwhile, single-child families are prone to extinction. A single child replaces one of his or her parents, but not both. Nor do single-child families contribute much to future population. The 17.4 percent of baby boomer women who had only one child account for a mere 7.8 percent of children born in the next generation. By contrast, nearly a quarter of the children of baby boomers descend from the mere 11 percent of baby boomer women who had four or more children. These circumstances are leading to the emergence of a new society whose members will disproportionately be descended from parents who rejected the social tendencies that once made childlessness and small families the norm. These values include an adherence to traditional, patriarchal religion, and a strong identification with one’s own folk or nation. This dynamic helps explain, for example, the gradual drift of American culture away from secular individualism and toward religious fundamentalism. Among states that voted for President George W. Bush in 2004, fertility rates are 12 percent higher than in states that voted for Sen. John Kerry. It may also help to explain the increasing popular resistance among rank-and-file Europeans to such crown jewels of secular liberalism as the European Union. It turns out that Europeans who are most likely to identify themselves as “world citizens” are also those least likely to have children. Does this mean that today’s enlightened but slow-breeding societies face extinction? Probably not, but only because they face a dramatic, demographically driven transformation of their cultures. As has happened many times before in history, it is a transformation that occurs as secular and libertarian elements in society fail to reproduce, and as people adhering to more traditional, patriarchal values inherit society by default.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Which is excellent news for pornographers. Porn is the direct result of culturally-mandated misogyny. When the glazed, bloodshot eyes are poked out of the “male gaze” and women are accorded fully human status, rather than sex class status, by our oppressive patriarchal culture—i.e., never— pornography will cease to exist.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> As exciting as podcasting is, it may be iBods that drive the next wave of iPod and iPod-like device adoption. iBods are soft porn offered by Playboy for downloading and viewing on iPod Photo. Pornography often drives new technologies over the chasm to mass markets. This is a marketing observation on my part, not a moral one. On the web, the “adult” sites have the kind of successful paid model which almost no other content providers have been able to achieve. All of us who were involved with ISPs know that viewing porn was one of the important drivers of early demand for dial access. Demand for broadband is similarly goosed by the desire to download more porn faster. Camera phones are significantly used for both personal and commercial porn. One great advantage of a digital camera is that no nosy developer gets to look at the pictures you take. A generation ago, Polaroid filled this niche successfully. One of the many advantages of cable and satellite and soon-to-be Internet TV are that wardrobe malfunctions are permitted here. The most important revenue source for AT&amp;T’s “intelligent network” was 900 service which was used mainly for – surprise, surprise – sex talk. In fact, the PC boards first used for VoIP are direct descendants of boards developed by Dialogic, Brooktrout and others for VARs whose major applications supported call-for-sex. Going back to ancient history, the skin flick trade was a huge early adopter of video tape technology – beta and VHS. They produced content which drove VCR sales. Consumer video cameras helped expand the cottage porn industry. The popularization of the Super 8 projector was boosted by the pornographic content which was quickly available for it. The Super 8 camera was a favorite for fraternity house “home movies” although it was a drawback that the film had to be developed. Why does porn have such a key role in driving the mass adoption of new technologies? One reason is obvious: sex sells. A corollary is that sex sells particularly well to almost the same demographic as new technology: young men. Very early adopters typically care more about the technology they are buying than the content available for it. That’s a good thing because there never is sufficient content until there is a market of people with the right players to look at and/or listen to it. The high margin and guaranteed demand for porn encourages its production early in the technology adoption cycle. Just when the market of early adopters is depleted, sexual content vastly expands the market for the device. More devices mean both more content and lower unit cost for the devices. Ironically, “sin” plays a major role in closing the virtuous circle of: 1. more content creates a broader market for the device 2. which leads to lower prices 3. and an even better market for the content 4. both of which further broaden the market for the device. Populations obviously wouldn’t grow without sex; many technologies wouldn’t either.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> I am not, to say it once more, advocating an uncritical technophilia as a desirable alternative. Technology is too heedless of human values, and the history of technology is too saturated with unintended consequences, for that to be either morally or intellectually tenable. I am constrained by the realization that the globe now contains more than five billion members of our species- large, aggressive, wily mammals who are extremely irritable when hungry, and who frequently resort to violence under far less extreme deprivation. I am further constrained in that, unlike some “deep ecologists,” I am ethically unable to accept a “Malthusian” solution to the problems posed by these huge numbers. Consequently, I’m driven by both hopefulness and realism to the notion that an intense commitment to technology, along with a degree of faith that its nasty side can be mastered, is the only possible path to a decent human future. To put it another way, any serious move to abandon technology or to constrict it seriously is absolutely certain to bring about disasters as severe as those that haunt the nightmares of technophobes. </span></strong><br />

Biopolitical control is necessary for technology and economic productivity globally.<br />
<u>Clough 2004</u> <strong>(Patricia, Professor of Sociology at City University for NY, “Technoscience, Global Politics, and Cultural Criticism” Project Muse, MT)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Control is a deployment of biopower dispersed over networks of information and communication, where the targets of control are not subjects or their behavioral expression of internalized social norms; rather, control is aimed at populations, a never-ending modulation of moods, capacities, affects, potentialities statistically assembled in genetic codes, identification numbers, ratings profiles, preference listings, risk statuses, that is, bodies of data and information (including human bodies as data and information). Control works at the subindividual, molecular level of bodies and not necessarily, or only, human bodies. Control therefore points to the increasing abandonment of support for socialization and education of the individual subject through interpellation to and through national and familial ideological apparatuses. The production of normalization is not only, or even primarily, a matter of socializing the subject; increasingly, it is a matter of directly bringing bodies and bodily affective capacities under an expanded grid of control, especially through the marketization of affective capacity. As such, control accompanies the subsumption of affective capacity, or life itself, into capital. That is, the subsumption of labor into capital is now transforming the Fordist-Keynesian regime of accumulation, when the laborers’ social reproduction had itself become a force of production and where laborers’ demands for higher wages, shorter hours, increased job security, and a raised standard of living for themselves and their families had been met with technological development and the expansion of consumer markets for the demanded products and services. With the transformation of the Fordist-Keynesian regime, in what has been called postmodern or global capitalism, there is ongoing investment in technologies, including biotechnologies, and a deepening of the commodification of human services through their biomedicalization. This is not only the case of the political economies of the first world; the biopolitics of an affect economy is felt globally with profound effects. Accordingly, capitalist accumulation has shifted to the domain of affective, subindividual bodily capacities (body parts, functions, and powers). There is a collectivization or socialization of affectivity, so that affect, as Brian Massumi (a symposium participant) puts it, must be thought of as “an impersonal flow before it is a subjective content.”32 The collectivization of affectivity allows for the realization of value in the modulation of affect, in the realization of the multiple force of time on bodies, that is, in the affective switching of bodies from one mode to another in terms of attention, arousal, interest, receptivity, stimulation, attentiveness, action, reaction, and inaction. In an affect economy, value is not only a matter of consuming products; rather, value is sought in the expansion or contraction of affective capacity. Therefore, affect is “beyond measure.” It not only is beyond the measure of the consumption of use value in the production of surplus value; affect is beyond measure because it is power or potential that cannot be limited. It faces obstacles, not limits.33 While beyond measure, affect is susceptible, however, to biopolitical control, or what Massumi refers to as the “powering-up—or the powering-away—of potential,” such that the effort to capture the intensity of each, often short-lived, outburst of resistance in the struggle over the biopolitical control is the very stuff of economic productivity in the becoming of a worldwide or global political economy of affect.34</strong><br />

Economic decline causes nuclear war, isolationism and kills heg.<br />
<u>Friedberg &amp; Schoenfeld 2008</u> <strong>(Aaron, Professor of Politics and IR at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School, Gabriel, Senior editor of Commentary and visiting scholar at the Witherspoon Institute at Princeton, Wall Street Journal, “The dangers of a diminished America”, 10/21,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122455074012352571.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122455074012352571.html</a>, MT)</strong><br />

<strong>With the global financial system in serious trouble, is America's geostrategic dominance likely to diminish? If so, what would that mean? One immediate implication of the crisis that began on Wall Street and spread across the world is that the primary instruments of U.S. foreign policy will be crimped. The next president will face an entirely new and adverse fiscal position. Estimates of this year's federal budget deficit already show that it has jumped $237 billion from last year, to $407 billion. With families and businesses hurting, there will be calls for various and expensive domestic relief programs. In the face of this onrushing river of red ink, both Barack Obama and John McCain have been reluctant to lay out what portions of their programmatic wish list they might defer or delete. Only Joe Biden has suggested a possible reduction -- foreign aid. This would be one of the few popular cuts, but in budgetary terms it is a mere grain of sand. Still, Sen. Biden's comment hints at where we may be headed: toward a major reduction in America's world role, and perhaps even a new era of financially-induced isolationism. Pressures to cut defense spending, and to dodge the cost of waging two wars, already intense before this crisis, are likely to mount. Despite the success of the surge, the war in Iraq remains deeply unpopular. Precipitous withdrawal -- attractive to a sizable swath of the electorate before the financial implosion -- might well become even more popular with annual war bills running in the hundreds of billions. Protectionist sentiments are sure to grow stronger as jobs disappear in the coming slowdown. Even before our current woes, calls to save jobs by restricting imports had begun to gather support among many Democrats and some Republicans. In a prolonged recession, gale-force winds of protectionism will blow. Then there are the dolorous consequences of a potential collapse of the world's financial architecture. For decades now, Americans have enjoyed the advantages of being at the center of that system. The worldwide use of the dollar, and the stability of our economy, among other things, made it easier for us to run huge budget deficits, as we counted on foreigners to pick up the tab by buying dollar-denominated assets as a safe haven. Will this be possible in the future? Meanwhile, traditional foreign-policy challenges are multiplying. The threat from al Qaeda and Islamic terrorist affiliates has not been extinguished. Iran and North Korea are continuing on their bellicose paths, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are progressing smartly down the road to chaos. Russia's new militancy and China's seemingly relentless rise also give cause for concern. If America now tries to pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power vacuum. The stabilizing effects of our presence in Asia, our continuing commitment to Europe, and our position as defender of last resort for Middle East energy sources and supply lines could all be placed at risk. In such a scenario there are shades of the 1930s, when global trade and finance ground nearly to a halt, the peaceful democracies failed to cooperate, and aggressive powers led by the remorseless fanatics who rose up on the crest of economic disaster exploited their divisions. Today we run the risk that rogue states may choose to become ever more reckless with their nuclear toys, just at our moment of maximum vulnerability. The aftershocks of the financial crisis will almost certainly rock our principal strategic competitors even harder than they will rock us. The dramatic free fall of the Russian stock market has demonstrated the fragility of a state whose economic performance hinges on high oil prices, now driven down by the global slowdown. China is perhaps even more fragile, its economic growth depending heavily on foreign investment and access to foreign markets. Both will now be constricted, inflicting economic pain and perhaps even sparking unrest in a country where political legitimacy rests on progress in the long march to prosperity. None of this is good news if the authoritarian leaders of these countries seek to divert attention from internal travails with external adventures. As for our democratic friends, the present crisis comes when many European nations are struggling to deal with decades of anemic growth, sclerotic governance and an impending demographic crisis. Despite its past dynamism, Japan faces similar challenges. India is still in the early stages of its emergence as a world economic and geopolitical power. What does this all mean? There is no substitute for America on the world stage. The choice we have before us is between the potentially disastrous effects of disengagement and the stiff price tag of continued American leadership.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The point is not to attribute responsibility for the reemergence of a nuclear crisis on the peninsula. Both the United States and North Korea have contributed a great deal to fuel each other’s fears. But decision makers in Washington have clearly not been sufficiently aware of their own role in generating fears and counterreactions. Nor have they learned much from the lesson of the first nuclear crisis. Consider, for instance, how the United States has quickly forgotten, or ignored, a number of rather striking concessions that Pyongyang made in the period leading up to the second crisis. North Korea started to open up its borders: it accommodated several hundred representatives of foreign aid organizations, increased cooperation with (capitalist) Russia, sought to normalize talks with Japan, and entered into diplomatic relations with a dozen Western countries. There were steps toward domestic reform, such as the introduction of quasi–market principles and the opening of special economic zones. There was also progress toward a rapprochement with the South, most notably in domains such as family exchanges, busi- ness contacts, and cultural exchanges. Pyongyang started to clear mines in the DMZ and worked toward establishing road and rail- way links with the South. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Il, even publicly acknowledged the importance of a continuous deployment of U.S. troops in South Korea. He stressed that their presence is a threat only so long as the relationship between North Korea and the United States remains hostile.62 This in itself could be seen as the “mother of all concessions,” for the removal of U.S. troops had been one of North Korea’s key demands for decades.63 Instead of appreciating and building on these concessions, U.S. foreign policy toward North Korea focused on Pyongyang’s linger- ing nuclear ambition. But not everyone believed Pyongyang when it declared in October 2002 that it had never ceased its nuclear program. The Russian foreign minister, for instance, called it a North Korean tactical maneuver.64 Neither claim could at this stage be empirically verified, but that is not the main point anyway. More important is that the United States failed to pay attention to a series of rather obvious North Korean gestures long before the crisis came to be seen as a crisis in October. North Korea’s worry began to grow with Bush’s “axis of evil” speech earlier that year, in February. At that time an unofficial North Korean representa- tive, Kim Myong Chol, told a New York Times journalist, Nicholas Kristof, that he foresaw “a crisis beginning in the latter half of this year.” North Korea, Kim mentioned, “will respond to the break- down of the nuclear deal . . . by starting its nuclear program and resuming its missiles tests.”65 That is, of course, precisely what hap- pened eight months later. It is striking how North Korea’s approach in 2002–2003 paral- leled its behavior during the crisis of 1993–1994. Pyongyang most likely assumed, as it did a decade earlier, that a hard-line U.S. administration would not engage in serious dialogue until North Korea threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Scott Snyder, in an extensive study of Pyongyang’s approach during the first crisis, speaks of a “crisis-oriented negotiation style” that is rooted in North Korea’s particular historical experience, most notably its partisan guerrilla legacy. Snyder writes of a remarkably rational and entirely consistent approach, one that relies on “threats, bluff, and forms of blackmail to extract maximal concession from a negotiating counterpart.”66 Even the dramatic language that shocked the world media in early 2003 was entirely predictable. The apoca- lyptic threat of turning Seoul into a “sea of fire,” for instance, was literally a rehearsed metaphor from the first crisis.67 It is part of an all-too-predictable emotional vocabulary that has prevailed in North Korea’s press for decades. Once translated into standard English, it is not much different from the more rationally expressed U.S. threat of preemptive nuclear strikes.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The legacy of the Korean War has decisively shaped the last fifty years of political discourses and practices on the peninsula. Much can be said, and countless books have been written, about the highly volatile competition between the two Korean states. Particularly revealing, but not sufficiently acknowledged, is the role of identities in this process. The identities that developed during the long period of Cold War tensions on the peninsula are not only deeply en- trenched but also lie at the heart of current security dilemmas. This is why a closer look at the emergence and nature of these identities is in order. To start with a simplification: identities in Korea are articulated largely in negative terms. To be South Korean means, above all, not to be Communist. To be North Korean means not to be part of a capitalist and imperialist order. Each state bases its legitimacy, as Leon Sigal puts it, “on being the antithesis and antagonist of the other.”32 Or, as the South Korean president Park Chung Hee once said: “Unfortunately, the north Korean communists have chosen a path diametrically opposed to what we have been pursuing.”33 The situation is, of course, not quite as straightforward. Koreans derive their identity from a variety of sources. Depending on the situation, a person may, for instance, be identified primarily as a man or a woman, an elder or a youth, a manager or a peasant.34 These and many other forms of identification are embedded in the Korean language, which possesses verb and noun suffixes that structur- ally force a speaker to identify specific hierarchy relationships in all verbal interactions. The Cold War did not eradicate these aspects of Korean culture. Rather, it created a situation in which a very spe- cific, externally imposed, and ideological identification has come to prevail over all others. Whereas gender, age, education, or regional affiliation continue to be key factors in determining a person’s so- cial status and possibilities, his or her ideological identification has literally turned into a matter of life and death, or at least freedom and imprisonment. As Chun Chae-sung observes: “The Korean war put an end to multi-identity competition at various levels only to make the Cold War identity the most dominant one.”35 The domain of education is particularly illustrative of how the two Korean states managed to infuse their populations with their respective ideological mind-sets. By examining North and South Korean school textbooks, Denis Hart notes how essential the process of incorporation of a “national other” has become to the construction of identity on each side. Preoccupied with the need to present itself as the only legitimate government on the peninsula, with the desire to win the “hearts and minds” of its people, each side promotes ideo- logically based historical narratives aimed at discrediting the legiti- macy of its national rival. As a result many aspects of the educational system in both parts of the peninsula have encouraged students to feel estranged from their brothers and sisters on the other side.36 Education is one of the most central societal mechanisms through which histories and political identities are being produced, reproduced, and entrenched. Laura Hein and Mark Selden stress that “schools and textbooks are important vehicles through which contemporary societies transmit ideas of citizenship and both the idealized past and the promised future of a community.”37 What students learn during the first few years of their lives inevitably influences their political and social attitudes for decades to come. While narratives of nationhood create boundaries between self and other from the very beginning of the educational cycle, secondary school education plays a particularly crucial political role. It is at this level that historical narratives are first taught, thereby providing a detailed interpretative and factual foundation for the previously established sense of identity.38 School education is thus one of the most powerful ways of promoting a particular form of political socialization. The objectives of a state can in fact often be achieved most effective- ly “at a distance,” through various mechanisms that seem, at first sight, to be of an apolitical nature. They include not only education but also the organization of welfare, health, urban planning, and the regulation of crime and the economy.39 Given the intense conflict on the Korean peninsula, it is not surprising that both states have exerted an unusually high degree of control over the process through which historical awareness is taught in schools. In North Korea textbooks are, predictably, published by the government, which also controls all aspects of the teaching pro- cess. But in the South too, many aspects of education are state con- trolled. There are two systems for publishing textbooks. Under the first system textbooks are published by the South Korean Ministry of Education itself. The second system allows private companies to publish textbooks. But the publication process is still strongly regu- lated by the Ministry of Education, ensuring government control over the teaching of history. During its five decades of existence South Korea has oscillated between direct governmental publica- tion of textbooks (especially during the more authoritarian periods, when nation building was considered a direct state-sponsored proj- ect) and a more decentralized and privatized phase.40 At the mo- ment the latter system is being promoted. Each school can choose from among several state or privately published textbooks (current- ly about five versions), but, given the tight governmental control of the publication process, this amounts to little substantive influence. The political appropriation of education in Korea is as obvious as the control of textbooks and curriculum design. Denis Hart stresses that school textbooks present “tales of national identity” that reflect, above all, the specific and politically motivated preferences of each Korean state. The so-sponsored historical narratives are thus not authentic representations of the past. They “tell that nation what their memories are supposed to be.”41 Each state, he points out, “felt free to teach its citizens to forget the past and instead learn history.”42 This, of course, amounts to a very particular, ideologically driven notion of history. Both Korean states do indeed openly admit that they use education for political purposes. The North Korean dictionary, for instance, defines education as “something that produces revolutionaries, who . . . [uphold] the communist principle of one for all, all for one.”43 Kim Il Sung repeatedly reinforced this position in public, pointing out that the purpose of education is “to influence people so that they serve the societal order.”44 And a few years later he stressed that “we must intensify the political- ideological education of pupils and thus make all of them workers and revolutionaries who . . . fight vigorously for socialism and com- munism.”45 Things are no less explicit in South Korea, as illustrated by the earlier example of education at the Tae Sung Dong Primary School: “love your country and lead the way in anti-communism.” IDENTITY PATTERNS IN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA: How, exactly, have these political and educational manipulations shaped contemporary Korean identity? Anticommunism clearly was the leitmotif of each South Korean government. No alternative visions were allowed, to the point that “socialist discourse was legally forbidden.”46 At some stage North Korea was actually seen as not belonging to the same nation. Park Chung Hee, who gained power through a military coup in 1961 and ruled the country until his assassination in 1979, literally believed that the North lost its Korean national identity because commu- nism is an ideology “wholly alien to the tradition and history of our nation.”47 Anticommunism has become far more than a government policy. It has penetrated every aspect of South Korea’s national conscious- ness, to the point that it reached, as one commentator puts it, “a hegemonic hold over civil society.”48 Choi Chungmoo stresses how, “for more than two decades after national partition, South Korean schoolchildren visually depicted North Koreans literally to be red-bodied demons with horns and long fingernails on their hairy, grabbing hands, as represented in anti-communist posters.”49 Hart’s extensive study of South Korean primary school textbooks identifies roughly one-fifth of the material as explicitly anti-Northern. He ex- amines a range of stories, some quite graphic and violent, that represent the North in a dehumanized way and as a direct threat to Southern safety. Stories such as “The Beastlike Communist Spy” or “I Hate Communists” implicitly suggest the need to free the people of the North from the Communist demons that have taken hold of their government.50 The anticommunism that pervades school textbooks is so exhaustive that various important historical features, such as the role of Korean Communist guerillas in the struggle against the Japanese colonial occupation, are simply left out.51 Anticommunism penetrates not only the teaching of history but virtually all domains of study, from biology (the need for democracy to develop a healthy mind and body) to mathematics (using numbers of Communist infil- trators to illustrate numerical puzzles).52</span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">North Korean Juche ideology inherently constructs external threats.</span><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The situation in the North is comparable, for an anti-imperialist and anticapitalist discourse prevails in an equally strong manner. “In order to understand North Korea,” one commentator argues, “one only needs to look at the South, for whatever characterizes the South is denounced and demonized in the North.”53 One key difference, though, is that North Korea’s Juche, or self-reliance ideology, is based as much on anti-imperialist values as it is on an opposition to South Korea. Here too an analysis of school textbooks is highly revealing. Hart speaks of “multiple others,” consisting mostly of Japan, the former colonial occupant, and, with increasing vigor dur- ing the last few years, the United States. A journalist who visited the North in 2003 remarked that “the fixation on everything American is stunning.”54 Both the United States and Japan are represented as evil imperial forces that constitute a direct threat to Korean people. The North Korean press, distinguished by its extraordinary rhetorical flourish, then supplements these images with corresponding metaphors, ranging from “warhawks,” to “warmongers,” “fascists,” “imperialists,” and “reactionaries.”55 When the North Korean press is speaking of South Korea, it too makes a distinction between the government and its people. The latter are seen as victims to be liber- ated from colonial occupation, the former as a corrupt and danger- ous “puppet regime.” Juche is perhaps the most central element of North Korea’s attempt to define its identity with reference to threats from the outside world. Often interpreted as “self-reliance” in all aspects of life, Juche emerged in the mid-1950s. It became the state’s leitmotif a decade later, when Kim Il Sung sought to pursue an increasingly independent position from both of North Korea’s key Communist allies, the Soviet Union and China. Juche, then, is above all a form of nationalism, an attempt to place “Korean things first,” as Cumings puts it.56 Its three core elements do indeed contain strong national- istic tones: political independence, economic self-sustenance, and military self-defense.57 The compulsion to construct an authentic and self-contained national discourse included minimizing the central in- fluence that China exerted on Korea. This is illustrated, for instance, by archeological efforts to deny the existence of Han commanderies on the peninsula58 or by Pyongyang’s “language purification movement.” The latter was introduced in 1949 and abolished the use of Chinese characters in favor of an exclusive reliance on Korea’s own hangul script. Meant as a way of cleansing Korean society of foreign elements, this practice is seen by some as a prime example of a state’s use of language planning to promote a particular political ideology.59 These practices are part of a larger pattern, visible, for instance, in how both Korean states have tightly controlled the collection and dis- play of archaeological artifacts in an attempt to construct a national- ist version of a pure and authentic Korean identity.60 Many commentators, such as Oh Kongdan and Ralph Hassig, stress that Juche ideology is “riddled with falsehood and lies.”61 Self-sufficiency is, indeed, hardly the order of the day in North Korea, where humanitarian aid is needed to feed a significant part of the populace today. But that does not detract from the centrality of Juche to North Korea’s understanding of itself and the outside world. Oh and Hassig recognize that Pyongyang’s attempt to establish a strong and reclusive “fortress” and a unitary ideology, as absurd and anach- ronistic as it may appear, is nevertheless hardly surprising, given Korea’s history as a victim of foreign aggression, subjugation, and conquest.62</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Another form of ethics is necessary to deal with this problematic remainder—not an ethics of dialogue but an ethics of accepting the other as other, of not subsuming her/him/it into one’s own view- point. The task ahead thus consists of articulating identity in less antagonistic ways and in rendering these articulations politically acceptable. The work of Emmanuel Levinas offers some guidelines here, for it revolves around an attempt to develop an ethics of responsibility that refuses to hammer difference into sameness. Ethics then becomes a question of developing a relationship to alterity that displays understanding of and respect for the other’s different identity performances.9 In an ideal scenario such respect would go beyond tolerance, for tolerance assumes a basic standard against which anything else is to be judged. Accepting alterity, by contrast, requires abandoning this privileged standpoint, perhaps even at those moments when one is deeply convinced of the superiority of one’s own moral position. Some even argue that an engagement with alterity is most crucial precisely at those moments when the other’s position poses a fundamental danger to one’s own values.10 The antagonistic identity constructs that have emerged and evolved during the five decades of Korea’s division cannot simply be erased by a redrawing of political boundaries. Differences between the two Koreas are too deeply rooted to be merged into one common form of identity, at least in the near future. In the context of such a well- entrenched and well-protected separation of diametrically opposed identity performances, it is imperative that an ethical position on national division and unification be based on an approach that does not subsume the other into the self. As a result the security situation on the Korean peninsula will remain volatile as long as current identity constructs continue to guide policy formation. A soft landing approach may well be the most reasonable and desirable scenario, but it can unfold and develop to its fullest potential only once it in- corporates, in a central manner, issues of identity and difference. The key is not to deny difference but to make it part of a new, more pluralistically defined vision of identity and unity that may one day replace the present, violence-prone demarcation of self and other. A few isolated Korean scholars occasionally draw attention to the need for such an approach. Kwon Hyeok-beom, for instance, argues for a “politics of difference” or a “discourse of difference.” Although this would require both Korean states to renounce “the assumption that they have the superior system,” he stresses that it would not require that the South accept everything about the North and its current governing style.11 Perhaps the most sustained, book- length defense of an ethics of difference, at least in English, has been advanced by the anthropologist Roy Richard Grinker. He calls upon Koreans to abandon the myth of homogeneity and embark on a process of mourning—that is, accept that Korea has been divided for half a century and that different identity practices have emerged during this period. Grinker therefore argues for a vision of hetero- geneity and a “plural society in which north and south Koreans can one day live.”12 </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Conflict is heavily embedded and will take decades to solve we o/w on timeframe – your own author Bleiker indicates children in both countries are indoctrinated into a culture that in it’s text books defines the other side as a monster who feeds on violence and political repression which proves regardless of the U.S. the other sides will securitize. </span><br />
<u>B</u> leiker <u>2005</u>** (Roland, Ph.D in international relations from the Australian National University, currently is a Professor of international relations at the University of Queensland. “Divided Korea” 2005, p. 21-22, MT) <br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"> Both Korean states have used their power to promote and legitimize their particular worldviews. Through a variety of mechanisms, from ideology-based education to a tightly controlled media environment, both states were highly successful in disseminating a very peculiar form of nationalism that portrays the political system on the opposite side of the divided peninsula as threatening, perhaps even inherently evil. What Bruce Cumings wrote of the immediate postwar period has remained valid for the decades that followed: not one good thing could be said about the leader on the other side of the dividing line. “To do so was to get a jail sentence.”14 Little does it matter, of course, that in the almost total absence of interactions between North and South, the construction of hostile perceptions is based far more on fiction than on fact. Indeed, the practice of constructing a threatening other is greatly facilitated by the unusu- ally hermetic Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas, for average citizens cannot verify what everyday life looks like in the vilified other half.15 It is not unusual for states to use their privileged position to ad- vance particular political objectives. For centuries states all over the world have promoted, legitimized, and protected identity constructs, particularly those essential for the process of nation building. The state provides mythological and institutional frameworks that sepa- rate self from other, inside from outside, safe from threatening.16 But these constructions are particularly fateful in Korea, where the state is unusually dominant, where identities are unusually antago- nistic, and where the presence of a large arsenal of weapons on both sides creates a constant danger of a military escalation.</span>
