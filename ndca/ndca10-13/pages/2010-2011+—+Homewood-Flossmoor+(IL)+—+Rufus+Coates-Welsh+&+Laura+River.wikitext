==War on Terror- IHSA== 

**Contention 1 is the Status Quo**
**Following the attacks on September 11th, 2001, The United States declared an unending War on Terror, one that blends the lines between war and politics, creating an endless state of exception in which the sovereign is free to militarize, securitize, and exterminate those in the “inferior Middle East” and violently replace a shadowy threat with democracy.**

<span class="underline0">When, in the weeks <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">following</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">September 11</span> attacks, …. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">undermine the successful spread of</span> liberal <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">democracy</span> in the long term.</span> (14)

**The discourse surrounding this “war” culminates in and normalizes unimaginable violence based on a politics that justifies war by us, the victims of the world – millions are written off as collateral damage as we lose the frame of reference to voice doubts to the atrocities, and are silenced by the national security state writing off all dissenters as “siding with the terrorists” – we must stand outside of the rhetoric, discourse, and cycles of violence muddled up in the language of “Terror”**

**Thus Rufus and I demand that the United States federal government eliminate its military and police presence in Iraq and Afghanistan.**

**Part 2 is Solvency**

**The aff tells a new story, one not wrapped up in the fantasies and threat construction. By stepping outside of the war on terror’s constructed nature, and recognizing it as simply a fantasy monster created to give us something to destroy, the aff breaks down the biggest symbolic vehicle of the current politics of fear and provides a new future and a prospect of a world not defined by endless war**

**From within this War on Terror, we become militarists- as it infects the debate sphere, the public becomes indoctrinated with a violent knowledge production that pervades us all- we are a pedagogical re-opening of our sphere and an individual protest movement that reclaims politics**

**Our military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan is itself the extension of biopolitical control over the rest of the world- only it allows the shaping of other nations into the frame of western conceptions of security- but this project is founded upon violence and a flawed conception of the origin of states, which can only end in absolute war that destroys all life on earth**

**Reasons why the War on Terrorism is good rely on a flawed conception of responsibility- while we do not condone acts of violence, we need to recognize that these military solutions created terrorism in the first place- refusal to examine this genealogical root of violence turns their impacts**

So, is <span class="underline0"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt;">there a way</span></span>, in Roy's terms, <span class="underline0"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt;">to understand bin Laden as "born" from</span></span> the rib of <span class="underline0"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">US <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">imperialism</span></span></span> …..acting radically and well about global options.

**In the face of the implacable terrorist threat, the state becomes the terrorist itself in an attempt to obtain an epistemological advantage- in this preemptive mode of thought, the state cannot act defensively, launching an offensive war against all possible threats- but the enemy cannot be detected until it moves, and so the paradoxical aim of the war on terror becomes to //create// terrorism- but this entails a politics of preemption that violently eliminates, taking as its premise a tautological truth that can never be disproved**

**Biopolitics has fundamentally shifted- in the new world the sovereign defines and excersises its control over populations through threats of it’s own invention- through the imagined threat of terrorists, wars become truly genocidal as the global borderlands become a place to kill without reprimand, sacrificed to the altar of Western society**

**The discourse surrounding this “war” culminates in and normalizes unimaginable violence based on a politics of exclusion that justifies war by us, the victims of the world – millions are written off as collateral damage as we lose the frame of reference to voice doubts to the atrocities, and are silenced by the national security state writing off all dissenters as “siding with the terrorists” – we must stand outside of the rhetoric, discourse, and cycles of violence muddled up in the language of “Terror”**

Applying a ‘critical’ perspective....power masquerading as the ‘war on terrorism’.

**T****hus the plan: The United States federal government should withdraw the United States federal government’s military presence from Iraq and Afghanistan.**


**Part II is Solvency**

**The War on Terror is sustained by our discourse. Language has power, and constitutes our reality and perceptions of how things exist – the construction of Americans as heroes saving the world from the evil terrorists guarantees constant normalization and justification of violence**
**Jackson ‘5** (Richard, Lecturer in Politics – U. Manchester, 49th Parallel, “Language Power and Politics: Critical Discourse Analysis and the War on Terrorism”, January, http://www.49thparallel.bham.ac.uk/back/issue15/jackson1.htm Rufus)

How does language co-constitute reality?.....look strikingly similar to the victims of October 7, 2001.


**The aff tells a new story, one not wrapped up in fantasies and threat construction. By challenging the War on Terror and recognizing it as a fantasy monster created to give us something to destroy, the aff breaks down the biggest symbolic vehicle of the current politics of fear and provides the prospect of a new future and world not defined by endless war**

The twin towers of the World Trade Center are gone, but the national insecurity state still stands....the difference between the two.

**The construct of terrorism is cloaked in securitizing logic that has dominated the political sphere, deferring attention away from systemic problems that are far more significant**

**If you focus on minute probabilities, all actions can have catastrophic consequences – absolute risk avoidance would stifle all assessment – even if we cannot draw a perfect line, we should still act on probabilities**

**The Negative’s impact analysis relies on the Tyranny of Illusory Precision – the refusal to assign zero risk to low probability impacts is based on a false belief in objectivity and a tendency to compromise. This destroys the value of probability and divorces debate from the real world**

====Heg Links==== 


**The methodology of violent US leadership is flawed- making hegemony work “better” simply greases the wheels of future interventions. It’s essential to challenge their neoconservative logic to demilitarize American politics**

The invasion of <span class="underline">Iraq was a defining moment</span> for the United States. This was <span class="underline">the kind of war...distortions upon its own domestic life</span>.


**Their pursuit of hegemony is based on a fantasy of control that relies upon the existence of threatening monsters to maintain the illusion of personal strength and discipline. This prompts resistance and creates a permanent state of conflict, turning constructed enemies into real enemies.**
