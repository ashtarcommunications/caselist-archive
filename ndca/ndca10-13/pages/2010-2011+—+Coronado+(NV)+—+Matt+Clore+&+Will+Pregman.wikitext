==Afghanistan 1AC - Read at Golden Desert== 

Plan:

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military presence in Afghanistan by shifting from a counter-insurgency strategy to a counter-terrorism strategy that reduces its military footprint <span class="apple-style-span">to the minimum level needed to train Afghan security forces and engage in robust counter-terrorism operations. This </span>would include a decrease to 68,000 troops or less by October 2011 and 30,000 or less by July 2012. </span>**



**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Observation 1 is Inherency </span>**

**<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">The December Review offers no major shift in strategy – promises of troop reductions are a vague afterthought and a substantial withdrawal isn’t coming in 2011 </span>**

==**Afghanistan COIN 1AC - Read at Meadows**== 


**Observation 1 is Inherency**

**First, General Petraeus is challenging President Obama’s timetable for military withdrawal from Afghanistan – the July 2011 deadline will not be met**
**Filkins, 10** (Dexter, foreign correspondent for the New York Times, fellow at the Carr Center for Human Rights, “Petraeus Opposes a Rapid Pullout in Afghanistan”, August 15, 2010, [[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/world/asia/16petraeus.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print]])


Gen. David H. Petraeus, . . . “That is just not the case.” 

**And, the counterinsurgency strategy is doomed to failure – the mountainous terrain and impossible troop requirements mean the Taliban can hide forever**
**Stewart, 10** (Rory, Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard, “Afghanistan: What Could Work”, New York Review of Books, 1/14, http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jan/14/afghanistan-what-could-work/?page=3)


The counterinsurgency strategy and surge . . .country and its political structures.


**Thus the Plan: The United States Congress should mandate an unconditional phase-out of its military presence assigned to counterinsurgency in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to the point of elimination by August 2011.**

**Advantage 1 is International Credibility**

**First, the international community is counting on Obama to deliver – other countries perceived the announcement of the July deadline as a meaningful change in foreign policy**
**Rubin, 10** (Michael, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute; senior lecturer at the Naval Postgraduate School's Center for Civil-Military Relations; and a senior editor of the //Middle East Quarterly//, Public Square, 3/8, “The Afghanistan Withdrawal: Why Obama Was Wrong to Insist on a Deadline,” http://www.michaelrubin.org/7033/afghanistan-withdrawal-deadline)



It is true, as Schlesinger points out . . .Pakistan, Iran, and even Russia.

**And, failure to keep our word will affect the entirety of US foreign policy and prevent Obama from exercising any leadership**
**Fernholz, 10** (Tim, writing fellow at the American Prospect and Research Fellow at the New America Foundation, The American Prospect, “The Ultimate Test Case,” March, 2010, lexis) 

Obama's final decision in December . . .execute any of his other initiatives. 

**And, international credibility is the key internal links to effective soft power – it’s more important than hard power due to recent free flow of information in the modern world**
**Nye, 8** (Joseph S. Nye Jr. - Distinguished Service Professor and former Dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, co-founder of neoliberalist theory in IR, former Deputy to the Undersecretary of State for Security Assistance, Science, and Technology, former chair of the National Security Council Group on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, former chair of the National Intelligence Council, and former chair of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, “Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,” The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volume 616 Number 1, p. 94-109)


Politics has become a contest . . .spent or slick production packages.

**And, soft power is necessary to avoid multiple scenarios for extinction**
**Barlow, 2** (Jeffrey, Director of the Berglund Center for Internet Studies, holds the Matsushita Chair of Asian Studies at Pacific University, Ph.D. in history from UC Berkeley, March, “American Power, Globalism, and the Internet: Editorial Essay”, The Journal of Education, Community and Values, [[http://bcis.pacificu.edu/journal/2002/03/editorial.php#6]])


Much of Nye’s analysis is . . .state autonomy in a networked system.

**Advantage 2 is Military Overstretch**

**First, counterinsurgency is overstretching the US military and exhausting our strength – shifting to a counterterrorism strategy is vital to preventing challengers to our primacy**
**Kretkowski, 10** (Paul, frequently assists think tank in conferences and other work products that aid DoD's long-term thinking about threats that may not be addressable via weapons platforms.

Over the winter break I . . .power (China, a reinvigorated Russia).

**And, arguments that withdrawal will make the US look weak are false – any short term loss of resolve is nothing compared to the loss we will suffer later. Afghanistan is a quagmire of attrition warfare that is destroying US morale and readiness**
**Kuhner, 9** (Jeffrey, the president of the Edmund Burke Institute for American Renewal, Washington Times, “Obama’s quagmire; US should look to its own interests,” 9/7, Lexis Academic) 


America is losing the war . . .evil, welcoming arms of extremists.


**And, the loss of US military leadership ensures instability and war**
**Kagan, 7** (Robert, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “End of Dreams, Return of History”, 7/19, <span style="color: blue;">[[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/07/end_of_dreams_return_of_histor.html]]</span>)


Finally, there is the United States . . .will provide an easier path.

**Advantage 3 is the Dollar**

**First, maintaining a large counterinsurgency strategy will bankrupt the US, end the dollar and collapse global US financial influence**
**Corn, 9** <span style="font-weight: normal;">(Tony, Ph.D. from the University of Paris and is a graduate of the U.S. Naval War College, currently on leave from the US State Department, “Toward a Kilcullen-Biden Plan? Bounding Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan,” Small Wars Journal, 10/21,</span>


http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/2009/10/toward-a-kilcullenbiden-plan/)

Just do the math - with . . .by Vice-President Joe Biden. 

**And, US economic leadership prevents global economic collapse**
**Mandelbaum,** **5** (Professor and Director of the American Foreign Policy Program at Johns Hopkins – 2005, Michael, The Case for Goliath: How America Acts As the World’s Government in the Twenty-First Century, p. 192-195)




Although the spread of nuclear . . .fleet of cars without gasoline.


**And, economic collapse leads to a new round of global wars**
**Mead, 9** (Walter Russell Mead, Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, 2/4/2009, The New Republic, “Only Makes You Stronger,” http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=571cbbb9-2887-4d81-8542-92e83915f5f8&p=2)


So far, such half-hearted experiments . . .may still have to fight.


**And, the plan solves – reducing to a counterterrorism focus creates sustainable presence, and prevents vacillations between engagement and isolationism**
**Stewart, 9** (Rory, Ryan Family Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro, 9/16/09, “The Future of Afghanistan,” http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan)


The best Afghan policy would . . .long-term, less will be more.

**Advantage 4 is Pakistan Stability**

**First, a large military footprint combined with the perception of an illegitimate government make crushing the Taliban impossible – they can recruit faster than we can kill**
**Galston, 10** ( William, Senior Fellow of Governance Studies @ Brookings, Senior Fellow of Governance Studies @ Brookings, “A Question of Life and Death: U.S. Policy in Afghanistan,” Brookings, June 15th, http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2010/0615_afghanistan_galston.aspx)

If it is a war against . . .moment, thus destabilizing the state.

**And, Pakistan collapse would cause global nuclear conflict that will draw in China, India and Russia – and that war will be without survivors**
