<br />
OUR CENTRAL IDEA is the construction of situations, that is to say, the concrete construction of momentary ambiances of life and their transformation into a superior passional quality. We must develop a systematic intervention based on the complex factors of two components in perpetual interaction: the material environment of life and the behaviors which it gives rise to and which radically transform it.<br />
--Guy Debord<br />
<br />
Here is the situation…<br />
<br />
We were in Boston to attend the Harvard debate tournament. We had left a couple of days early. This meant that we had time to be the typical tourists. Not that we are ever entirely typical. We went to the important sights. Went to see worshippers touch the highly polished shoe of the Harvard founder that some mischievous college student likely pissed on the night before. We went to several cool bookstores…perused the newsstands astonished at the wide selection. We walked the streets stopping for a moment to watch a street artist turn spray paint into a vision of space from another planet complete with Panda…thoughts about debate circulate through our heads and we cut short our tourist vacation and get down to business…back on the bus…red line…the bus-stop by Starbucks…get off and hike through the cold to the Super 8…do not disturb…we have debate work to do…<br />
<br />
<br />
We aren’t going to talk about the tournament except to say that there was plenty of talk about space… we went 3-4…our worst tournament of the year…we should have been debating out rounds…we should have been talking about space…but very shortly space would the farthest thing from our minds…<br />
By this point in the trip everyone wanted to leave…one more day…Dana says next year we are going to Cali…I won’t be here next year…Jake and I had to make Boston matter…<br />
<br />
<br />
We spent the first part of the day walking the city with our entire group…<br />
<br />
<br />
Did I know what a Derive was then?<br />
<br />
<br />
No…<br />
<br />
<br />
But we went on a derive…<br />
<br />
<br />
Jake and I left the group behind…we took to the city with no purpose other than to wander…go to the places that drew us in and damn the rest…there was no purpose to this exploration…no ultimate goal…we were not seeking some product or place but rather seeing what this place had to say to us…<br />
Guy Debord said of derivement that there is a:<br />
<br />
“…sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters; the evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres; the path of least resistance that is automatically followed in aimless strolls (and which has no relation to the physical contour of the terrain); the appealing or repelling character of certain places — these phenomena all seem to be neglected. In any case they are never envisaged as depending on causes that can be uncovered by careful analysis and turned to account.”<br />
<br />
Simulations hide in our thoughts like secret militias peering out of street corners waiting to suck us dry...pulling at our already dwindling souls. They slip in without us noticing but like any machine there are glitches … it was a Monday night in Harvard square… We had been exploring the ins and outs of Boston in the beginning it was like our tourist romp. We wandered again in astonishment… My fantasy had become reality. Elite scholarship, great legacies… We walked through the city not knowing if we could find our way back…<br />
<br />
But then that sudden change Debord speaks about on a Derive began to happen like a modified vision…or perception…somehow our unproductive walk had turned our eyes away from the Non-Stop-Ivy-League-Red-Brick-Façade to the people and things that lived in the city but were also apart from it…they didn’t participate the same way the rest of these people did…some were starving artists strumming guitars and singing with happy eyes and open guitar cases, others sold paintings or crafts they had made from found objects on the streets or bought with money they panhandled for the night before. Still the only piece of art I remember was not for sale and it didn’t belong to a starving artist with happy eyes…the art was drawn on a cardboard box opened up lengthwise so it could act as a large blanket or shelter. On it was drawn a face with a mouth carved into a long smile like a Cheshire grin teeth blacked out like broken factory windows. (SHOW THE ART WE DID ON THE PLANE) Under the masterpiece that would never hang on a museum wall like the Rothko’s Jake visited at the beginning of the year was a man half fallen off of a park bench…still asleep…vomit from the night before frozen fast to his chin…we left him sleeping…he still hasn’t left us…<br />
It was like a door into a world I knew existed but never took a walk through…<br />
<br />
We came across many men and women sleeping on the streets clenching on to their blankets pulling them up over their heads…one man had been reading a book... We gave money when we could but change couldn’t help…even a bandage couldn’t repair the shallowest of wounds. They were silent…dead in the eyes with sunken in faces hiding families and childhoods behind them just like the rest of our memories…but at some point they were thrown to the streets…not a place where the rest of society were people but ghastly spectators convincing them that they are the ghosts of the city. Hideous poverty and undeniable ignorance had been revealed…but somehow we were taken back in by the machine’s trick…keep wandering…soon enough the mythological Harvard would be shattered… we spent the evening walking through the streets watching the sun to go down while the artificial lights went up. It was frigid… we thought that we should go back but continued to walk and take the red line in …we found a paper on the train and flipped through it seeing the usual articles about Santorum calling someone a whore along with Iran’s nuclear news and horrifying success for Newt Gingrich giving us a better picture of the world we didn’t want to see…we arrived back in Harvard Square there was people surrounding the center, we peered around the news-stand…someone was yelling…we thought that there was some kind of Shakespearean play happening, maybe some street theatre. We had seen a camera crew in the square earlier…we didn’t want to ruin their shot, we didn’t want to walk through the play and ruin the entertainment for the audience. So we walked the other way around the newsstand, the same newsstand we had been in for half an hour, marveling at how many different literature journals it carried. As we came to the play, we saw a crowd, someone lying on the ground, someone standing and yelling…what WAS this? I asked a man nearby…he looked normal enough, he replied “Don’t worry about it…it’s just a hobo fight”….just a hobo fight. It was just a hobo fight. Just a hobo fight…nothing more than a cockfight, two animals tearing each other apart. As I looked, still trying to figure out what was happening, I noticed the man on the ground was bloody…unconscious…the man standing shouted “DON’T EVER FUCKING TOUCH ME AGAIN!” and he stalked towards the one on the ground…picked him up by the front of his bloody jacket…yanked him into a sitting position…drew back his leg…there was a dull, moist thud as boot met face, another as back of skull met pavement…there were gasps but mainly silence, the man lay on the ground not breathing. Our exploration was over. The city was no longer a wonderland for us to explore…we didn’t wander around the streets…we ran. We ran like our lives depended on it, they very well might have…I called 911, the first time in my privileged life I have ever called 911, reported what was a likely murder…called in the violence I had seen in a city I supposedly had grown to know so well, but I couldn’t figure out the address to tell the operator…the fantasy was broken, we had seen past the red-brick academic buildings, the stone carvings around the windows, to the beach beneath the street…we shivered as if it were a blizzard as we descended below to the subway street and boarded the red line.<br />
<br />
No more space. We have had enough… if our dream lines are continually cut down on earth and tied to the will of the invisible hands of power we must first confront the spaces down here; the spaces where violence, the mundane, repetition all come into a distant concentration of power relations; the space where children are subject to the harsh reality of the streets. The space where we can no longer live fulfilling lives without flogging ourselves to death waiting, not for a savior to swoop down and take us away from all of it, but for a paycheck to feed ourselves. We certainly think that exploration is good…even when it forces us to confront horrible truths about ourselves…and in this sense perhaps we should explore space in the same way we explored Boston…but this debate is not about exploring space…it is about being caught in a situation that doesn’t allow us to escape until we resolve our position in relation to what we have experienced…as we rode the bus shaking there was no talk of space…or debate…I didn’t for one moment think about satellites that monitor racist weather…or the dumb asteroid that was coming to wipe us out…this situation had trapped us…swallowed us whole…<br />
The bus-stop by Starbucks…get off and hike through the cold to the Super 8…<br />
I laugh with tears in my eyes at the do not disturb sign…<br />
<br />
We walk in tell the story for the first time…<br />
It puts the adults around us in tears…we hold onto each other like the family we are…<br />
<br />
<br />
We told the story and they were thrust into the situation…we realized that our experience could place others in the situation as well…and while it is not comfortable…in fact while it is horrifying it is really the first time that structural violence wasn’t just a concept for me…it was REAL…this for me was the most profound realization that structural violence is a problem we must struggle with before we can extract ourselves from this situation…we must stop being spectators who only speak on behalf of power<br />
<br />
<br />
“it’s just a bum fight”…please still shop at our news stand…please don’t lose your appetite and abandon eating at our fine establishments…don’t alarm…it is only a bum fight…look at Harvard over there twenty yards away…the world must be ok… “It’s only a bum fight…” be another spectator here or move along there is nothing to see.<br />
<br />
But we know there was something to see…there were real people there and we are real people as well. We need to give up on being spectators and become “Livers” who are a part of the situations we find ourselves in and then take those situations with us to others whose own situations will resonate with the space we occupied in Boston on that fateful Monday. This is the most portable form of education debate offers and our method for this debate.<br />
<br />
This is Guy Debord-<br />
<br />
The powers of a situation will certainly expand considerably in both time and space with the realizations of unitary urbanism or the education of a situationist generation. The construction of situations begins beyond the ruins of the modern spectacle. It is easy to see how much the very principle of the spectacle — nonintervention — is linked to the alienation of the old world. Conversely, the most pertinent revolutionary experiments in culture have sought to break the spectators’ psychological identification with the hero so as to draw them into activity by provoking their capacities to revolutionize their own lives. The situation is thus designed to be lived by its constructors. The role played by a passive or merely bit-part playing “public” must constantly diminish, while that played by those who cannot be called actors, but rather, in a new sense of the term, “livers,” must steadily increase. We have to multiply poetic subjects and objects — which are now unfortunately so rare that the slightest ones take on an exaggerated emotional importance — and we have to organize games for these poetic subjects to play with these poetic objects. This is our entire program, which is essentially transitory. Our situations will be ephemeral, without a future. Passageways. Our only concern is real life; we care nothing about the permanence of art or of anything else. Eternity is the grossest idea a person can conceive of in connection with his acts. Situationist techniques have yet to be invented. But we know that a task presents itself only when the material conditions necessary to its realization already exist, or at least are in the process of formation. We have to begin with a phase of small-scale experimentation. It will probably be necessary to prepare plans or scenarios for the creation of situations, despite their inevitable inadequacy at the beginning. To this end we must develop a system of notations, which will become more precise as we learn more from the experiences of construction. We will also need to discover or verify certain laws, such as that according to which situationist emotions depend on extreme concentration or extreme dispersal of actions (classical tragedy giving a rough idea of the former, dérives of the latter). In addition to the direct means that will be used for specific ends, the positive phase of the construction of situations will require a new application of reproductive technologies. One can envisage, for example, televised images of certain aspects of one situation being communicated live to people taking part in another situation somewhere else, thereby producing various modifications and interferences between the two.<br />

<br />
The Earth...is our creator...it is the point of origin for all of us...<br />
Primordial creatures crawl nameless through a sludge onto an endless featureless plain brought to life by some distant spark...many recall a God...others recall some magnificent bolt of lightning...crude matter is brought to life. I try to think back to the moment of creation...the truth is I can’t remember anything except for the sound my television makes when it turns on. All memory is lost with the exception of this bare earth. It is this humble dirt that binds us to the earth and creation. Toes plunge deep into tilled soil...fingers penetrate reaching out for the source of life like hands pleading to the sky asking favors from a silent god...they reach into the ground expecting to pull up a beating heart but they come up only with a handful of cool dirt and the faint scent of matter turned to decay. The magic of life is no longer a spectacle of Gods and lightning...it is the most mundane of things...dirt...water...and the scent of death. Somehow what it means to be alive is trapped in this earth like a cypher built into nature and yet despite this awesome gift we are still trapped here. Life it seems can only struggle...bowing its back out against the forces not of death, which is a condition of life, but of never having been in the first place...there are voids that aren’t this empty...in fact the void is the matter of this confrontation. How can we take the fragile act of living and remove it from the soil from whence it came? How do we leave our creator? How can life be uprooted and cast into the permanent vertigo of deep space?<br />
<br />
In space there is no up and down...no right or left...it is only confusion...<br />
Amidst the confusion the sound of a television turning on...<br />
This is Eraserhead by David Lynch.<br />
Eraserhead is the drain into which vertigo collects after it runs down from the high places circulating its madness like a flock of blackbirds. Madness is present everywhere in Eraserhead but for the moment we are not interested in some central aspect of the narrative of the film but rather an image that appears in the background. An ancillary detail...an image never intended to be the center circles with the blackbirds inside my head where ideas consolidate before they slip through the grate into irredeemable loss...erasure...This idea manages to kick itself loose and through its own brand of mundane magic has brought itself life and grown the necessary legs (freak legs anyone?) to travel to this plot of Earth in Fremont-Mills Iowa. This is the image of a tree in space. A tree removed from the Earth. Uprooted. There it sits on a common nightstand...in an average bedroom...almost forgettable and yet just strange and wild enough to cast its spell...<br />
<br />
This is no longer going to be the common in-door house plant that some forlorn housewife whispers her deepest regrets to while listening to an episode of Regis and Kelly blare in the background like the sound of static from jet engines firing. That tree is trapped just like the people that live around it. It is bound firm to earth by the presence of a pot...roots gnarl and twist against the limits...in space there are no limits...there it sits in the matrix of the world at its place and time dreaming of space...it called out to us...there is no coincidence in the world of magic...it found its way here...the potted tree mimics the sick astronaut who believes because they have gone outside the boundaries of the earth’s mesosphere they have experienced the feeling of being in deep space...in space there are no limits...the unbound life energy of the astronaut turns slavishly back upon itself once it hits the slick impermeable surface of the spacesuit. The only thing the astronaut smells is the technology of recycling and its own stench. This is not life exploring space but rather life slammed into artificial stasis and launched into space...the equivalent of a fish pushing an aquarium onto land and claiming that it has explored land...Thanks Bill!<br />
<br />
The tree like the human must go into space naked...without limits...no boundaries...face to face with death and the unimaginable expanse of space.<br />
<br />
The sane or logical person at this point might raise an objection...but the tree cannot survive in space...it will freeze, or starve...this is true for the meantime, but this Tree will never become so tired of where it has been that it will lose its motivation to live...it will never give up on life because it has been choked to death by the forced proximity to itself...it can leave its creator and still live...it knows the cold rush of the void...it has been starved and neglected and still clings to life...it knows the loneliness of freedom...it has seen the darkest of nighttimes and been thrust into the scorching proximity of nebula that give birth to the furnaces at the hearts of stars. Any one of which contains revelations that are worthy of trading ones life for and yet still the presence of life is so unique in the vastness of space that the tree should hold on...and so should we for in space is the next stage of human freedom and the expansion of human experience to the edges of absolute extremity.<br />
<br />
But we cannot go into the void like a march to our death. We must come up with a way of going to space that preserves the life of the being in space and likewise affords them the ability to touch infinity. Remember the magic of life is not a spectacle...there are no Gods and no need for lightning. We are interested in the magic present in life that is more ordinary...soil...water...the scent of death and a touch of some unexplainable intent. Trees incidentally have always had a special purpose...they are houses of spirits...cites of rituals...places where we come to turn our human intent into reality. Many cultures have taken up the practice of driving a nail into a sacred tree as a way of affirming some hope they have for the world or themselves or as a means to ward of some evil. In a practice born of slavery and colonialism a magic named Palo Mayombe was produced that would see objects covered in nails...We came to this place with one nail in the tree whose wish no one gets to know...even us. The second nail is a prayer that must come to pass if we are ever to come in contact with space and free ourselves from the trappings that keep us as we are. It is a prayer for safe travel...a prayer for survival...a prayer for freedom. The tree then becomes a magical object covered in nails. It is proof that true exploration of space is possible. It is a reminder of the fact that even the most meager of objects can find its way to space given the correct intent. It is evidence that human beings can become something more wild and free. It is all here with us now...the tree of life...the dark immanence of death...somewhere between these poles there is a secret locked in nature...the exact content of the secret that sparks life is not relevant...we don’t need to know...fortunately, this tree is a fountain from which the secrets of nature spring without reason...this tree holds the possibility of life turned loose into space...it has no limits...it rushes out to look upon the face of death and the universe...it has come back to us here to hold out the possibility that we could do the same.<br />
<br />
Upon the return of the tree and the ritual complete we will place this tree back into the ground where it can bury its roots in the earth...we may plant a dead tree...that is a risk that we must take if we are willing to risk to look upon the face of the infinite...we are not afraid to die...this tree may be wounded but it is from those wounds that is learns how to live in space...away from its creator...it should remind us that we too can crawl out of our pots and with the kind of legs that you can’t see learn to walk in a world that might wound us but can never determine our fate...<br />
<br />
There is one more film that flashes before the sound of the television powering down...it is from a movie called Offret by director Andrey Tarkovskiy. The opening scene of this movie connects back to the vision of the unpotted tree by some invisible strand of energy. The movie depicts a father and son on the shores of a shining sea planting a dead tree. When the child inquires about the intelligence of planting a dead tree the father remarks to him about the importance of ritual. He tells his child if you do something with the proper intent everyday for a long enough time it must change the world. The father then dutifully waters the tree and cares for it. He dreams one day it will come back to life...<br />

<br />
This is a 1908 Burroughs Company adding machine. It was invented, patented, and distributed by the Grandfather of Astronaut William Seward Burroughs; it was broken on Saturday December 10th during our mission to liberate the control center designated Dowling by a fucking cop masquerading as a Marxist Revolutionary. The ugly death suckers thought the machine too dangerous and thus sent in their secret agent to destroy it in the name of control and offer us a cash payment to kill it forever, keep your money but strike us down and we will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.<br />
<br />
Nietzsche himself claimed to be born posthumously. What does it mean to be born after your death? How could such a thing ever happen? Perhaps a demonstration…<br />
<br />
This adding machine spent its first life in the bowels of capital…eating money and shitting out bank notes. We are here with the purpose of speaking this machine back to life. We invoke the same mutant force that caused William to realize his biological function and leave the gravitational pull of Earth, and a comfortable life as a maker of banking equipment for outer space. The adding machine likewise gives into the force of mutation…the forces of control only broke a syndicate calculator…it too, like Nietzsche, has been born after its death as a control panel for our spaceship. This diversion turns the machine against its original purpose liberating it from the slavery of control forever…<br />
<br />
Our experience is falling to pieces about our ears, and its disintegration is a direct consequence of the development of consumer society. The phase of devaluation, and thus the possibility of diversion, is the work of contemporary history. Diversion has become part of the tactics of supersession; an essentially positive act. While the abundance of consumer goods is hailed everywhere as a major step forward in evolution, the way these goods are used by society, as we know, invalidates all their positive aspects. Because the gadget is primarily a source of profit for capitalism and the socialist bureaucracies, it cannot be used for any other ends. The ideology of consumerism acts like a fault in its manufacture, it sabotages the commodity coated in it; it turns what could be the material equipment of happiness into a new form of slavery. In this context, diversion broadcasts new ways of using commodities; it invents superior uses of goods, uses by which subjectivity can strengthen itself with something that was originally marketed to weaken it. The problems of tactics and strategy revolve around our ability to turn against capitalism the weapons that commercial necessity has forced it to distribute. Methods of diversion should be spread as an ABC Of The Consumer Who Wishes To Stop Being So. Diversion, which forged its first weapons from art, has now become the art of handling every sort of weapon. Having first appeared amidst the cultural crisis of the years 1910-25, it has gradually spread to every area touched by social decomposition. Despite which, art still offers a field of valid experiment for the techniques of diversion; and there's still much to be learnt from the past. Surrealism failed because it tried to reinvest dadaist anti-values which had not been completely reduced to zero. Any other attempt to build on values which have not been thoroughly purged by a nihilistic crisis will end in the same way; with recuperation. Contemporary cyberneticians have taken their 'combinatory' attitude towards art so far as to believe in the value of any accumulation of disparate elements whatsoever, even if the particular elements haven't been devalued at all. Pop Art or Jean-Luc Godard, it's the same apologetics of the junk-yard. Diversion, self-critical language, is our only possible means of communication. There are no limits to creativity. There is no end to diversion.<br />

Control employs a word virus that uses machine logic to replicate itself endlessly…the vulgar final vision of control…fortunately by redirecting the machine and cutting word lines we can achieve a vision of space where the agents of control collapse under the weight of their own consumption. Transcripted from a recording during one of Bill’s trips beyond the mesosphere.<br />
<br />
What does virus do wherever it can dissolve a hole and find traction? - It starts eating - And what does it do with what it eats? - It makes exact copies of itself that start eating to make more copies that start eating to make more copies that start eating and so forth to the virus power the fear heat virus slowly replaces the host with virus copies - Program empty body - A vast tapeworm of bring down word and image moving through your mind screen always at the same speed on a slow hydraulic-spine axis like the cylinder gimmick in the adding machine - How do you make someone feel stupid? - You present to him all the times he talked and acted and felt stupid against and again any number of times fed into the combo of the soft calculating machine geared to find more and more punch cards and fed in more and more images of stupidity disgust propitiation grief apathy death - The recording leave electromagnetic patterns - That is any situation that causes rage will magnetize rage patterns and draw around the rage word and image recording - Or some disgusting sex practice once the connection is made in childhood whenever the patterns are magnetized by sex desire the same word and image will be presented - And so forth - The counter move is very simple - This is machine strategy and the machine can be redirected - Record for ten minutes on a tape recorder - Now run the tape back without playing and cut in other words at random - Where you have cut in and re-recorded words are wiped off the tape and new words in their place - You have turned time back ten minutes and wiped electromagnetic word patterns off the tape and substituted other patterns - You can do the same with mind tape after working with the tape recorder - (this takes some experimentation) - The old mind tapes can be wiped clean - Magnetic word dust falling from old patterns - Word falling - Photo falling Palomar Observatories reported some answers to the riddle of exploding stars - Invariably he found the exploding star was locked by gravity to a nearby star - The two stars are in a strange symbiotic relationship - One is a small hot blue star - (Mr. Bradly) Its companion is a larger red star - (Mr. Martin) - Because the stellar twins are so close together the blue star continually pulls fuel in the form of hydrogen into an incandescent figure eight - One circle of the eight encloses one star - The other circle encloses the other - supplied with new fuel the blue star ignites.&quot; - Quote, Newseek, Feb. 12, 1962 –<br />
<br />
Now let us be clear, this is not metaphorical, human beings are biologically designed for space travel. By breaking the systems of control and opening ourselves to risk and mutation we make possible the next stage of human evolution. The adding machine paves the way…if it can survive after death then so can we. The earth is a death camp…true freedom and immortality is only possible in space.<br />
<br />
William S. Burroughs in 1998. “Immortality.” Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader. Edited by James Grauerholz and Ira Silverberg. Pp. 344-352<br />
<br />
I postulate that true immortality can only be found in space. Space exploration is the only goal worth striving for. Over the hills and far away. You will know your enemies by those who block your path. Vampiric monopolists would keep you in time like their cattle. “It’s a good thing cows don’t fly,” they say with an evil chuckle. The evil intelligent slave gods. The gullible confused and stupid pose an equal threat owing to the obstructive potential of vast numbers. I have an interesting slip in my scrapbook. News clipping from The Boulder Camera. Picture of an old woman with a death’s head false teeth smile. She is speaking for the Women’s Christian Temperance Union. “WE OPPOSE CHILD ABUSE, INTEMPERANCE AND IMMORTALITY.” The way to immortality is in space and Christianity is buried under slag heaps of dead dogma, sniveling prayers; and empty prayers must oppose immortality in space as the counterfeit always fears and hates the real thing. Resurgent Islam . . . born-again Christians . . . creeds outworn . . . excess baggage . . . 'raus 'mit!<br />
Immortality is prolonged future, and the future of any artifact lies in the direction of increased flexibility capacity for change and ultimately mutation. Immortality may be seen as a by-product of function: &quot;to shine in use.&quot; Mutation involves changes that are literally unimaginable from the perspective of the future mutant. Coldblooded, non-dreaming creatures living in the comparatively weightless medium of water could not conceive of breathing air, dreaming, and experiencing the force of gravity as a basic fact of life. There will be new fears like the fear of falling, new pleasures, and new necessities. There are distinct advantages to living in a supportive medium like water. Mutation is not a matter of logical choices.<br />
The human mutants must take a step into the unknown, a step that no human has taken before.<br />
&quot;We were the first that ever burst into that silent sea.&quot;<br />
“We are such stuff as dreams are made on.”<br />
Recent dream research has turned up a wealth of data but no one has assembled the pieces into a workable field theory. By far the most significant discovery to emerge from precise dream research with volunteer subjects is the fact that dreams are a biological necessity for all warm-blooded animals. Deprived from REM sleep, they show all the symptoms of sleeplessness no matter how much dreamless sleep they are allowed. Continued deprivation would result in death. All dreams in male subjects except nightmares are accompanied by erection. No one has proffered an explanation. It is interesting to not that a male chimpanzee who did finger dab paintings, and was quite good too, went into a sexual frenzy during his creative acts. Cold-blooded animals do not dream. All warm-blooded creatures including birds do dream. John Dunne discovered that dreams contain references to future time as experienced by the dreamer. He published his findings An Experiment With Time in 1924. Dream references, he points out, relate not to the event itself but to the time when the subject learns of the event. The dream refers to the future of the dreamer. He says that anybody who will write his dreams down over a period of time will turn up precognitive references. Dreams involve time travel. Does it follow then that time travel is a necessity? I quote from an article summarizing the discoveries of Professor Michel Jouvet. Jouvet, using rapid eye movement techniques, has been able to detect dreaming in animals in the womb, even developing birds in the egg. He found that animals like calves and foals, who can fend for themselves immediately after birth, dream a lot in the womb and relatively little after that. Humans and kittens dream less in the womb and are unable to fend for themselves at birth.<br />
He concluded that human babies could not walk or feed themselves until they had enough practice in dreams. This indicates that the function of dreams is the train the being for future conditions. I postulate that the human artifact is biologically designed for space travel. So human dreams can be seen as training for space conditions. Deprived of this vital link with our future in space, with no reason for living, we die.<br />
Art serves the same function as dreams. Plato’s Republic is a blueprint for a death camp. An alien invader, or domestic elite, bent on conquest and extermination, would rapidly immobilize the earth by cutting dream lines, just the way we took care of the Indians. I quote from Black Elk Speaks by John Neihardt (Pocket Books):<br />
“The nation’s hoop is broken and scattered like a ring of smoke. There is no center any more. The sacred tree is dead and all its birds are gone.”<br />
<br />
The spaceship rattles in the background…tapping buttons…alien cranks…enigmatic rumblings…the cut-up is preparation for liftoff…<br />
<br />
Lydenberg ’87 (Robin, Associate Prof of English at Boston College, “Word Cultures: Radical Theory and Practice in William S. Burroughs’ Fiction.” p. 52-53)<br />
<br />
The reversibility and flexibility of the cut-up text suggests the possibility of a flight, of continual evolution and change. Instead of condensed liquefaction into a single image, Burroughs creates in his experimental writing- particularly in the cut-up narratives- a random and infinite variety of implosions and explosions, the pulsing rhythm of life itself. Medical experiements in Naked Lunch amuse themselves by arresting or cutting off the life cycle of “tension discharge rest” at the moment of extreme tension: “what would be result of administering curare plus iron lung during acute mania? Possibly the subject, unable to discharge his tensions in motor activity, would succumb on the spot like a jungle rat. Interesting cause of death, what?” (NL 131). The cut-up texts offer[s] an antidote to this terminal paralylsis in metonymic condensations that always lead to explosion, dissemination, expansion. The cycle is always recharged: “You in the Word and the Word in You is a word-lock […] the word-lock that is You, Stop, Change. Start again. Lighten your own life sentence” (TM 61). On a most concrete and obvious level, Burroughs’ own texts resist finality by being constantly reissued in different versions, fragments large and small surfacing in new works and new contexts. The original publication dates of three cut-up novels- The Soft Machine (1961), The Ticket That Exploded (1962) and Nova Express (1964)- suggest a sequence in which the critic might discover some coherent progression or development. Burroughs’ habit of substantially revising manuscripts for each new edition, however, makes any rigid adherence to such a linear model rather awkward. Thus, in addition to the common base of fictional material which feeds all the cut-up novels and thus blurs their boundaries, each individual text is subject to the indeterminancy of continual revision. Beyond his challenge to the limitations of conventional linear narrative, Burroughs also attacks the equally restrictive linearity of literary history. A bibliography of Burroughs’ work reads rather like Borges’ catalogue of the writings of the apocryphal Pierre Menard, whose technique of “deliberate anocronism” turns history inside out. The trilogy of cut-up novels has been described by Philippe Mikriammos as a false trilogy, a single book completed in three versions, under three different angles (William Burroughs 77). As we shall see in examining th three novels, the prose itself reflects this resistance to closure. Burroughs’ style tends to “anamorphosis,” “It rubs itself out and rewrites itself” (Lemaire 23). The Method: Vigilance and the Risks of Chance. Released from the burden of subjectivity, of authorship and ownership, the cut-up text opens up possibilities for what Burroughs calls “space/time travel.” Such futuristic journeys call for detachment, for scientific rigor and control. While Burroughs had already brought literature and science together in Naked Lunch, in the cut-up narratives he makes this connection even more explicit. He insists, for example, that his cut-up techniques are not arguments or “positions” but scientific experiments. The practical work of the writer is a continuous experiment; daily life is transcribed by Burroughs into scrapbook mosaics of word and image, into notebooks and diaries where clippings and photographs are accumulated and coordinated with a variety of texts.<br />

This is a 1908 Burroughs Company adding machine. It was invented, patented, and distributed by the Grandfather of Astronaut William Seward Burroughs. This machine spent its first life in the bowels of capital...eating money and crapping out bank receipts. We are here with the purpose of speaking this machine back to life. We invoke the same mutant force that caused William to realize his biological function and leave the gravitational pull of Earth, and a comfortable life as a maker of banking equipment for outer space. The adding machine likewise gives into the force of mutation…it is no longer a syndicate calculator…it is the control panel to our spaceship. This diversion turns the machine against its original purpose liberating it from the slavery of control…<br />
<br />
Our experience is falling to pieces about our ears, and its disintegration is a direct consequence of the development of consumer society. The phase of devaluation, and thus the possibility of diversion, is the work of contemporary history. Diversion has become part of the tactics of supersession; an essentially positive act. While the abundance of consumer goods is hailed everywhere as a major step forward in evolution, the way these goods are used by society, as we know, invalidates all their positive aspects. Because the gadget is primarily a source of profit for capitalism and the socialist bureaucracies, it cannot be used for any other ends. The ideology of consumerism acts like a fault in its manufacture, it sabotages the commodity coated in it; it turns what could be the material equipment of happiness into a new form of slavery. In this context, diversion broadcasts new ways of using commodities; it invents superior uses of goods, uses by which subjectivity can strengthen itself with something that was originally marketed to weaken it. The problems of tactics and strategy revolve around our ability to turn against capitalism the weapons that commercial necessity has forced it to distribute. Methods of diversion should be spread as an ABC Of The Consumer Who Wishes To Stop Being So. Diversion, which forged its first weapons from art, has now become the art of handling every sort of weapon. Having first appeared amidst the cultural crisis of the years 1910-25, it has gradually spread to every area touched by social decomposition. Despite which, art still offers a field of valid experiment for the techniques of diversion; and there's still much to be learnt from the past. Surrealism failed because it tried to reinvest dadaist anti-values which had not been completely reduced to zero. Any other attempt to build on values which have not been thoroughly purged by a nihilistic crisis will end in the same way; with recuperation. Contemporary cyberneticians have taken their 'combinatory' attitude towards art so far as to believe in the value of any accumulation of disparate elements whatsoever, even if the particular elements haven't been devalued at all. Pop Art or Jean-Luc Godard, it's the same apologetics of the junk-yard. Diversion, self-critical language, is our only possible means of communication. There are no limits to creativity. There is no end to diversion.<br />

Now let us be clear, this is not metaphorical, human beings are biologically designed for space travel. By breaking the systems of control and opening ourselves to risk and mutation we make possible the next stage of human evolution. The earth is a death camp…true freedom and immortality is only possible in space.<br />
<br />
William S. Burroughs in 1998. “Immortality.” Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader. Edited by James Grauerholz and Ira Silverberg. Pp. 344-352<br />
<br />
I postulate that true immortality can only be found in space. Space exploration is the only goal worth striving for. Over the hills and far away. You will know your enemies by those who block your path. Vampiric monopolists would keep you in time like their cattle. “It’s a good thing cows don’t fly,” they say with an evil chuckle. The evil intelligent slave gods. The gullible confused and stupid pose an equal threat owing to the obstructive potential of vast numbers. I have an interesting slip in my scrapbook. News clipping from The Boulder Camera. Picture of an old woman with a death’s head false teeth smile. She is speaking for the Women’s Christian Temperance Union. “WE OPPOSE CHILD ABUSE, INTEMPERANCE AND IMMORTALITY.” The way to immortality is in space and Christianity is buried under slag heaps of dead dogma, sniveling prayers; and empty prayers must oppose immortality in space as the counterfeit always fears and hates the real thing. Resurgent Islam . . . born-again Christians . . . creeds outworn . . . excess baggage . . . 'raus 'mit!<br />
Immortality is prolonged future, and the future of any artifact lies in the direction of increased flexibility capacity for change and ultimately mutation. Immortality may be seen as a by-product of function: &quot;to shine in use.&quot; Mutation involves changes that are literally unimaginable from the perspective of the future mutant. Coldblooded, non-dreaming creatures living in the comparatively weightless medium of water could not conceive of breathing air, dreaming, and experiencing the force of gravity as a basic fact of life. There will be new fears like the fear of falling, new pleasures, and new necessities. There are distinct advantages to living in a supportive medium like water. Mutation is not a matter of logical choices.<br />
The human mutants must take a step into the unknown, a step that no human has taken before.<br />
&quot;We were the first that ever burst into that silent sea.&quot;<br />
“We are such stuff as dreams are made on.”<br />
Recent dream research has turned up a wealth of data but no one has assembled the pieces into a workable field theory. By far the most significant discovery to emerge from precise dream research with volunteer subjects is the fact that dreams are a biological necessity for all warm-blooded animals. Deprived from REM sleep, they show all the symptoms of sleeplessness no matter how much dreamless sleep they are allowed. Continued deprivation would result in death. All dreams in male subjects except nightmares are accompanied by erection. No one has proffered an explanation. It is interesting to not that a male chimpanzee who did finger dab paintings, and was quite good too, went into a sexual frenzy during his creative acts. Cold-blooded animals do not dream. All warm-blooded creatures including birds do dream. John Dunne discovered that dreams contain references to future time as experienced by the dreamer. He published his findings An Experiment With Time in 1924. Dream references, he points out, relate not to the event itself but to the time when the subject learns of the event. The dream refers to the future of the dreamer. He says that anybody who will write his dreams down over a period of time will turn up precognitive references. Dreams involve time travel. Does it follow then that time travel is a necessity? I quote from an article summarizing the discoveries of Professor Michel Jouvet. Jouvet, using rapid eye movement techniques, has been able to detect dreaming in animals in the womb, even developing birds in the egg. He found that animals like calves and foals, who can fend for themselves immediately after birth, dream a lot in the womb and relatively little after that. Humans and kittens dream less in the womb and are unable to fend for themselves at birth.<br />
He concluded that human babies could not walk or feed themselves until they had enough practice in dreams. This indicates that the function of dreams is the train the being for future conditions. I postulate that the human artifact is biologically designed for space travel. So human dreams can be seen as training for space conditions. Deprived of this vital link with our future in space, with no reason for living, we die.<br />
Art serves the same function as dreams. Plato’s Republic is a blueprint for a death camp. An alien invader, or domestic elite, bent on conquest and extermination, would rapidly immobilize the earth by cutting dream lines, just the way we took care of the Indians. I quote from Black Elk Speaks by John Neihardt (Pocket Books):<br />
“The nation’s hoop is broken and scattered like a ring of smoke. There is no center any more. The sacred tree is dead and all its birds are gone.”<br />
<br />
The space ship rattles in the background…tapping buttons…alien cranks…enigmatic rumblings…the cut-up is preparation for liftoff…<br />
<br />
Lydenberg ’87 (Robin, Associate Prof of English at Boston College, “Word Cultures: Radical Theory and Practice in William S. Burroughs’ Fiction.” p. 52-53)<br />
<br />
The reversibility and flexibility of the cut-up text suggests the possibility of a flight, of continual evolution and change. Instead of condensed liquefaction into a single image, Burroughs creates in his experimental writing- particularly in the cut-up narratives- a random and infinite variety of implosions and explosions, the pulsing rhythm of life itself. Medical experiements in Naked Lunch amuse themselves by arresting or cutting off the life cycle of “tension discharge rest” at the moment of extreme tension: “what would be result of administering curare plus iron lung during acute mania? Possibly the subject, unable to discharge his tensions in motor activity, would succumb on the spot like a jungle rat. Interesting cause of death, what?” (NL 131). The cut-up texts offer[s] an antidote to this terminal paralylsis in metonymic condensations that always lead to explosion, dissemination, expansion. The cycle is always recharged: “You in the Word and the Word in You is a word-lock […] the word-lock that is You, Stop, Change. Start again. Lighten your own life sentence” (TM 61). On a most concrete and obvious level, Burroughs’ own texts resist finality by being constantly reissued in different versions, fragments large and small surfacing in new works and new contexts. The original publication dates of three cut-up novels- The Soft Machine (1961), The Ticket That Exploded (1962) and Nova Express (1964)- suggest a sequence in which the critic might discover some coherent progression or development. Burroughs’ habit of substantially revising manuscripts for each new edition, however, makes any rigid adherence to such a linear model rather awkward. Thus, in addition to the common base of fictional material which feeds all the cut-up novels and thus blurs their boundaries, each individual text is subject to the indeterminancy of continual revision. Beyond his challenge to the limitations of conventional linear narrative, Burroughs also attacks the equally restrictive linearity of literary history. A bibliography of Burroughs’ work reads rather like Borges’ catalogue of the writings of the apocryphal Pierre Menard, whose technique of “deliberate anocronism” turns history inside out. The trilogy of cut-up novels has been described by Philippe Mikriammos as a false trilogy, a single book completed in three versions, under three different angles (William Burroughs 77). As we shall see in examining th three novels, the prose itself reflects this resistance to closure. Burroughs’ style tends to “anamorphosis,” “It rubs itself out and rewrites itself” (Lemaire 23). The Method: Vigilance and the Risks of Chance. Released from the burden of subjectivity, of authorship and ownership, the cut-up text opens up possibilities for what Burroughs calls “space/time travel.” Such futuristic journeys call for detachment, for scientific rigor and control. While Burroughs had already brought literature and science together in Naked Lunch, in the cut-up narratives he makes this connection even more explicit. He insists, for example, that his cut-up techniques are not arguments or “positions” but scientific experiments. The practical work of the writer is a continuous experiment; daily life is transcribed by Burroughs into scrapbook mosaics of word and image, into notebooks and diaries where clippings and photographs are accumulated and coordinated with a variety of texts.<br />

 <br />
We begin our discussion of this year’s resolution in a place about as far away from space as possible. Madrid Spain the 27th of February 1819, Franscisco Goya purchases the Quinta del Sordo. This desolate outpost was a home but Goya’s mad visions poured out off of the canvas and onto the very walls themselves…these were not the portraits for which he had become famous with the elites but grotesque images that conjure up the darkest content of the human soul…<br />
<br />
Glendinning reflects on these “Black Paintings:”<br />
It is not a religious mystery that one finds in his work. Rather he looks for new areas of mystery, scaling the highest points in the landscape, from which unusual phenomena can be seen. The chief magnetic force acting on fantasy, working upon it in the reverse direction from gravity and pointing its head to the sky, is the force which drives us to intuit, glimpse or even touch things which are above human existence. It is this which brings us to surrealism from time to time: a surrealism which has always been at work in Spanish minds. Because our spirit is especially realistic, its excursions into fantasy have always been made from a base of realism, so that the creations of Spanish genius turn out to be surreal rather than superfantastic. Ours is a time of thirst and aspiration. We need to disturb life, make it problematical, create our own miniature monsters, reach beyond the normal possibilities, seeking a kind of delirious rhythm which will raise us above everyday life. After a period of naturalism in which everything tended to be seen in terms of clear-cut mathematics, we feel impelled to bifurcate reality, burst its limits, tremulate it…We must exercise the rights of miniature monsters and drive reality mad. Humor is the way to do it since the surreal grin (very different from the unreal is half serious and half tragic.) Goya is nearest to this mysterious realism in his Proverbios or Disparates, the pages of his work which dived deepest into heights and depths previously unplumbed: those which even to-day we explore in our planes and submarines. These powerful, disquieting, superb proverbs spring from collective fears and fights in which monsters come down to the plains. These plates are larger than the Caprichos; like strange squares opening out from the hemmed-in alleys of his drawings. The fact that they have no ultimate explanation makes them all richer in meaning…In my view Goya reaches heights in his Disparates: capital letters engraved and adorned for a book which has yet to be written; a formidable book for which he has provided the first letters of chapters which the next generation will write.<br />
<br />
Here is the first of them the black silhouette of the he-goat looms omnipresent and yet invisible in the cover of blackness…he presides over the grotesque mass of humanity like the practioner of a long forbidden ritual of unspeakable evil…the faces contort…snarl…both repulsed and fascinated…<br />
<br />
The devil is in the inky black…<br />
Goya turns his eyes to the heavens…Saturn wild eyed consumes one of his creations as if Goya is reminding us that the Gods too are mad…<br />
In place of salvation from the dark forces that Goya conjures his Saturn offers only a glare of hopeless surrender to the frenzy…as if to tell us without equivocation that the gods too are subject to the irrational mystery of the void. The black of the paintings then fulfill a duplicate role…we experience both suffocation and isolation. The suffocation of the mass of humanity and the bodies of our gods and demons piled on top of each other…the heat of another’s breath…the stench, sweat, and decay of death…a rapturous noise.<br />
Behind the din we can hear him whispering:<br />
<br />
I am Goya<br />
of the bare field, by the enemy’s beak gorged<br />
till the craters of my eyes gape<br />
I am grief.<br />
<br />
I am the tongue<br />
of war, the embers of cities<br />
on the snows of the year 1941<br />
I am hunger.<br />
<br />
I am the gullet<br />
of a woman hanged whose body like a bell<br />
tolled over a black square<br />
I am Goya<br />
<br />
O grapes of wrath!<br />
I have hurled westward<br />
the ashes of the uninvited guest!<br />
and hammered stars into the unforgetting sky like nails.<br />
I am Goya.<br />
<br />
Goya is indeed the tongue of war. He speaks of other sources of human suffering too, and their causes in human behavior, social and political attitudes and the nature of things. Goya is also the tongue of beauty and joy. There is laughter as well as anger in his work; hope and despair. We listen to the tongue, we try to interpret it. We say what we see in the pictures. We say how line or color or texture seem to be. Yet still in the end, as Wittgenstein said: ‘Whatever we see could be other than it is. Whatever we can describe at all could be other than it is.<br />
<br />
Now look at The Dog…<br />
Here for the first time we see a painting not of blackness but of space…the hollow echo of the void…The rest of the series is raging, violent, tortured…this one is different; the content is almost missing…sunken into the earth or the sea…more accurately swallowed by the horizon. The dog feels the banal hopelessness of crude material reality depicted in the other works…alone…his eyes turn ever so slightly to heaven…looking for its master…searching for God…But where are the gods this time? No chariots…or winged angels…no easy salvation…he looks up into the mottled yellow void that dominates the majority of the painting. This is the sensation of emersion…he feels the cold rush of the void and we are transported right along with him…<br />
<br />
Against all of that darkness Goya leaves us art…and his art transports us but another artist radicalizes the notion of travel…in an echo from the dark corner of Goya’s world Mark Rothko begins to explore the emptying of content from his paintings until they share an almost uncanny relationship to the strange vacant world of our worried dog. He began with large fields of color burning with intense light viewed as if they were on the other side of some ethereal fog. The works pulse with life beckoning the viewer to come into their softly permeable surfaces…<br />
<br />
On the other hand, that morning I had a yen to see Francis Bacon; so into the Tate I went, down the grand processional space of the Duveen Gallery, took a wrong turn and there they were. It was definitely not love at first sight. Sight was in any case a problem, Rothko having insisted that the lighting be kept almost pretentiously low. But that, of course, was a clever prescription. One's eyes took their leave from the white glare of the gallery wall, and, as they adjusted to the velvety obscurity, entered an altogether different optical realm. It was rather like going into a cinema where the main feature had had the sound turned down: expectation in the dimness. Something crimson and purple in there was doing a steady throb, like the valve of a body part. Rothko had said of his paintings that they were 'an adventure into an unknown world which can only be explored by those willing to take risks'. The longer I stared, the more powerful was the magnetic pull through the black columnar forms towards the interior of Rothko's world. I still wasn't sure it was somewhere I wanted to be; only that by some sorcery of vision I had no choice but to go on. And that the destination might not prove to be a picnic.<br />
<br />
Our method for this debate then is to use these paintings and the creative will that gave birth to them to performatively enact an exploration of space. Our affirmation is likewise in this spirit of artistic exploration…the resolution fades into a Rothko mist…it pulses with primordial energy…it obscures and reveals itself…it is like the inside of a Rothko painting…a place for artistic creation…both the nightmare and the sublime… “We the people” have now approached the stage in question of what it means to be in our own skin, what it means to be creative.<br />
<br />
The bright colors of Rothko fade…this is what the void looks like…<br />
The Houston Chapel:<br />
This is the claustrophobia of death. A face to face visit with the beyond. Like Goya’s Dog we are swallowed by these paintings…they come and get us…force us to look. This is the darkest night of the artist’s soul. Alone with the cool darkness the skin ripples and the senses elevate…the artist is a totally vulnerable now…childlike…the portal opens once again and the artist who is willing to risk everything throws itself into the night time…Rothko thankfully does not leave us in the dark…an alien planet rises recreating the moment of original creation…somewhere a god whispers “let there be light.”<br />
<br />
So when, finally, he did break out of his old style, it was to go raven-black; as black as Texas oil. In 1964, when Dominique and John de Menil, enthusiastic collectors of modern art from a family that had become hugely wealthy through selling drilling equipment, offered Rothko exactly what he wanted – a chapel, custom-built to his specifications – he jumped at the opportunity. But what he had built, and the pictures he made for it, sucked away the warm light of the Seagram pictures and seemed to replace them with a sepulchre of the spirit. At first sight, the stark octagonal room feels like a chamber of live burial, a black full stop to Rothko's journey through radiance. The rippling flares of light at the edges of the colour panels, his sunspots, have been wiped out. Instead there are hard-edged panels covered with opaque layers of black paint. But this isn't the end of the story visually. Between the two crow-wing panels of one of the triptychs is a brushy purple panel, with more forgiving stainings and soakings. Although the modulation seems slight, the relief from the hard black seems like an invitation to a different universe. And as one's eyes adjust, it's this velvety tone that expands and diffuses, like air entering a sealed chamber. An American actress friend of mine (from a long line of butchers), about to film a famously difficult part on location in Texas some years ago, decided to get into the role by spending the night in the Rothko chapel – an experience that would not, I suspect, have most of us on our toes in the morning, bright, breezy and ready for action. But no, she said, it was wonderful: 'Coming out, I felt so light.' Rothko would have loved that. He, however, got heavier. In 1968 he suffered an aortic aneurysm that nearly killed him. Then he turned to drink in a serious way. His marriage to Melt fell apart. But he resisted the clichés. Instead of a complete extinction of light, the very opposite happened. Brilliance was reborn. It was not the luminous explosion of the early 1950s – in the late 1960s the radiance is almost always challenged by areas of inky darkness. But that only gives it startlingly augmented force, as if the painter were himself on the threshold between two worlds. In the lower section of painting Rothko after painting made in 1969 he laid down a zone of milky grey, like the rim of the moon – a way station to the universe, still soaked with light and somehow tethered to the known world, but on the very lip of infinity. It's as if Rothko had himself already gone into deep space and was looking back, presiding god-like over a moment of creation, dividing the light from the darkness. That he was not at all running out of creative juice is suggested by the party Rothko gave for friends in December 1969 so that they could voice their reaction to these new paintings. He was also suffering from emphysema. After the aneurysm doctors had advised that (apart from giving up smoking and drinking) he should paint nothing taller than two feet. He responded, in the few months before he cut his wrists and arms open, with gestures of heroic defiance against any enclosing of the night. Both chromatically and conceptually the acrylics on paper are some of the most brilliant things he ever did, poetically compressed and lyrically intense. A celestial cobalt breaks into the black and pushes into the advancing darkness, blue flame licking at the edges. The very last canvas is a blaze of vermilion light, a warrior cremation.<br />
<br />
So contemplate…the Goat…Saturn…the Dog…human violence and cruelty…birth and joy…eternity…the void…it is all here with us now. It is in this place where we come to engage in the project of being human beings…to celebrate…morn…to cope…and in the face of all of that to finally live…and die…<br />
<br />
So how wrong did I get it that morning in 1970, just before I collided with Mark Rothko? About as wrong as I could. If there was one word I might have ignorantly used to sum up his late paintings, it would have been 'forbidding'. But in fact they are embracing. No artist in the modern canon, at any rate, went to such lengths to include us, the spectators, in the enactment of the work. If ever we think of Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, van Gogh and even Picasso at his Guernica moment as virtuoso solo turns, off doing their own thing, heedless of anyone else, we couldn't be more mistaken. All of them assumed our participating presence. But perhaps none, not even the master of unfinish, Rembrandt, not even the sweetly hand-shaking Vincent van Gogh, took such pains to make us partners, not just in the beholding, but in the creation of his art. Without our becoming enfolded within his mantle of light, Rothko thought, there was no art. His greatest paintings, and especially the Seagram murals, are, then, performance pieces, the work of someone who never stopped talking about their drama. For some critics, then and now, this theatricality smacks of visual posturing. Not for me, though. The artist's reach through the canvas seems, as it does for Caravaggio and Turner, a gesture of humane inclusiveness. We, as much as the artist, are players. We enter stage left. We stick around. We are moved by what happens. And when we exit stage right, the rest of our lives are marked by that performance. The greatest compliment that Rothko (who wasn't free with them) handed out was to describe someone as a 'human being'. How moving, then, to discover that he needed us ordinary human beings to make his art just as much as we certainly need the extraordinary one who was Mark Rothko. I believe that one reason we need the `place' that did eventually get made in Tate Modern is that it goes so much against the grain of the contemporary fetish of Now. It's ironic, given how much fissile creative energy has been generated by contemporary British art, that when Rothko was looking for somewhere he might place the last series of nine Seagram murals, he settled on Britain as perhaps the place farthest from the commercial hustle and critical blood sports that animated its counterpart in New York. (And this was 1969!) But then Rothko had last visited England ten years before, and then his pilgrimage had been to the cosy art enclave of St Ives in Cornwall. But the fierce buzz of Tate Modern, of course, only makes the effect of its fade-out in the Rothko room, where the Seagram paintings have been reinstalled, the more complete. Whatever that room is about, it's certainly not Now. More like forever. This is a place where we come to sit –on the kind of bench Rothko specified, naturally – in the low light, and sense the aeons rolling by; where we can feel beckoned towards those hanging veils with their mysterious interior glimmer; or through the portals that seem to suggest both a vision of infinity and its unattainability. One of the words Rothko used most often about his art – but it could be extended to all art – is 'poignant', for the best of it is suffused both with a sense of the inevitable passing of things, including us, and with art's determination to trap, consolingly, those fugitive visions. It's impossible, then, to come to this room and not be touched by that poignancy: of our comings and goings, entrances and exits, womb, tomb and everything in between. Which only makes the discrepancy between writing and looking the more pitiful. One of the words that Mark Rothko used with greatest disdain was the dismissive word about words: 'verbiage'. If there is any commandment hanging in the place that he (with help from the Tate, but also from all of us) eventually made, it is, finally, to please shut up. So just for once I will.<br />

Voting affirmative specifically limits a politics of imagination because it is never willing to consider the alternatives to space policy that revolve around things other than an outright rejection of space in general. Voting affirmative is the refusal to look up, and imagine the possibilities of what the universe can mean.<br />

I remember a time when the imagination did not seem so blatantly political. I remember staring, as a child, at Buzz Aldrin, who gazed contently from a picture on my brother's wall. Dreams at that age didn't have to be balanced, in the way an adult balances a cheque book. Was all that money I made last year for Whitey on the moon? Now we live in a postmodern world, a silent, incomprehensible world in which a Cape Town child flies nearly to the moon, while poor millions watch from under zinc roofs freezing in the winter moonlight. Balancing budgets with dreams has become so hard, now that the divide is no longer just economic and racial, but also pharmaceutical, genetic, digital.I went to the same elite private school as Mark Shuttleworth, and while there I buried myself in books, science fiction and fantasy especially. Mostly I tried not to think about race. The ordinariness of the race of the three astronauts gazing from my brother's wall. My more indeterminate race. Instead I believed in the haunting landscapes and distant moons of the pulp science fiction and comics I read. The ships landed long ago: they already laid waste whole societies, abducted and genetically altered swathes of citizenry, imposed without surcease their values. Whenever I traveled the schizophrenic distance between the leafy suburbs of my school and the arid landscapes of coloured ghettoes, I superimposed, translated, those fictive vistas. I remember hot summer afternoons sitting in the backseat of my mother's old Renault, my head buried in a comic book. Back then Marvel and DC were the only choices, so my brother and I carefully staked out our choices; I went for DC's Warlord and Star Trek, my brother for Marvel's Atari Force and X-Men. I can still almost lose myself remembering that sense of total immersion; oblivious to the radio and my mother's conversation, drowning in parallel universes.<br />

The Role of The Ballot for this debate is to acknowledge the possibilities that Space and afrofuturist imagination offers us which the affirmative willingly chooses to forget.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to lift off from this world and instead understand this year’s resolution as a piece of afro futurist science fiction capable of liberating those of us who are willing to learn and create. This allows space for an understanding of the duality of the resolution rather than limiting it to a static interpretation that results in constant dis belief in the power of imagination and creativity. Science fiction also allows us to use the idea of space in order to draw parallels and find solutions to real world issues such as racism and other forms of structural violence. <br />
Julian Jonker 2002 (Black Secret Technology (The Whitey On The Moon Dub))<br />
Science fiction seeps into a child's imagination by an extension of belief rather than by a suspension of disbelief. The things contained in imaginary tales felt more true than not, perhaps in some alternate, somehow better dimension. Nowadays the literary intelligentsias assert the same thing, though in a more mundane way. They recognize that sci fi mirrors the contemporary world, not the future world.    Sf is 'paraliterature' -- despite the sneers of cognoscenti, it is the literature that is actually read. Serious writers call it, enviously, the 'golden ghetto' of literature; pulp fiction. It sells; moreover, it is read. Given the size and dedication of the sf readership, it is hard to deny that it doesn't tell fans something about their world, that it doesn't feed into some structure of feeling. The recurring scenarios that dominate sf give a clue: themes like alien-ness, colonisation and technology as a disciplinary epistemology indicate that sf reflects the American racial psyche. Sf mirrors the silent history of the New World, and the alienation of the black populations forcibly taken there. They inhabit a sci-fi nightmare in which unseen but no less impassable force fields of intolerance frustrate their movements; official histories undo what has been done to them; and technology, be it branding, forced sterilization, the Tuskegee experiment, or tasers, is too often brought to bear on black bodies.<br />

Our embracement of science fiction is channeled through the music of the Martian Kid Cudi aka the real man on the moon. Science fiction channeled through hip hop has become the black secret technology capable of liberating the mind and creating hope that we one day find a solution to the issues that haunt and creep over our societies. <br />

In retrospect, the arc that my tastes traced, from pulp sf to the vanguard of electronic dance, seems to possess some internal logic. This is where black science fiction has hidden itself instead: on vinyl. Some critics wonder why there are not many black sf writers, given the subtexts of even the most predictable genre sf. Few of these debates operate at the interface of science and aesthetics which is the required starting point of contemporary black cultural expression and the digital technology of its social dissemination and reproduction. To talk about black sf, it might be better to abandon the literary and look at what cultural theorist Kodwo Eshun has called 'sonic fictions'; the gamut of black futurist sounds which have charted the course of pre- and post-rave electronica. Sf in black music goes beyond film references, although there are plenty of those: from Canibus announcing that he's &quot;liquid aluminum like the T2&quot;, to the influence of movies like Predator and its sequel through the soundbytes included in jungle classics (such as the famous &quot;fucking voodoo magic&quot; clip). Hip-hop has always constructed a fantasy world for its fans, both visually and sonically. The album cover for Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet was a literal interpretation of the title, showing the Earth eclipsed by what could pass for a Death Star inscribed with PE's sniper target insignia. More recently, Kool Keith took the sf fantasy persona to self-conscious absurdity with his Dr Octagon alter ego: a mad gynaecologist who, like Sun Ra, is from Saturn, but bumps and grinds like 2 Live Crew from the year 3000. Hip-hop infiltrates the sf intertext with these distorted pulp references and ganja-induced delusions, making a sonic architecture with the surrealism of Nintendo. Science fiction in black music is not limited to camp hip-hop imagery. There is music which takes this fetish seriously, either because of its supposed technological advancement or its aesthetic break with past musical concepts. A self-conscious futurism is immediately apparent in the techniques and sensibilities of the black electronic music of the last two decades. Whether it's the future breakbeat of 4Hero's Parallel Universe album or the warm analogue groove of Stacy Pullen's otherworldly spiritual techno, or even Afrika Bambaata's Planet Rock and M/A/R/S/S's Pump Up The Volume, avant-garde black diaspora music in the last two decades has been propelled by a sense that it has returned to earth carrying a vision of the future.<br />

The Judeo-Christian religion- specifically the book of Genesis- has become the source for understanding humanity’s relation to nature in the Western world. Adam claimed dominion over nature through a process of naming based on the unimpeachable authority of God. Our project of postsustainability is to find a counter book to this dominant discourse.<br />
<br />
Stoekl 2007 (Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University. “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability.” P. 151-152)<br />
<br />
Now one could certainly argue that White’s thesis bears some similarity to Heidegger’s in “The Question concerning Technology,” while no doubt lacking the mastery’s subtlety. While White is not concerned with physis and the various modes of “revealing,” his critique nevertheless has a real power since it points to a single text, and a single section within a text, as the cause of the problem. For White, it is Genesis that gives us to understand that God has created nature for us. Adam names the animals, gives them their particularity, gives them, as Hegel and Blanchot argue, their morality, since the name is the possibility of abstraction, the possibility of constituting something by separating it from the necessity of its undifferentiated existence. The natural world as configured through language by humans is already dead, already merely a resource at our disposal, and it has been created precisely to fulfill that role: God would have it no other way. Outside of Man, his desires and needs, his objectifying speech act, nature would have no existence. God created nature so that it could be delineated through naming and put to use.<br />
White therefore argues that there is a simple source for misunderstanding man’s role in nature and the very being of nature itself: a certain religion, one that links monotheism, the Book, and the subordination of nature to the human. For the Book is implied as well and is central to the drama White outlines: without the Book, without the single, unambiguous story told in Genesis, there might be room for “guardian spirits” to reassert themselves. But the written text warns us, attempting to prevent this: there is only God, his Word, and creation, and creation is for Man. By presenting the problem so unambiguously, White invites us to undertake a straightforward project: reconceiving a single religious tradition, rejecting a large portion of it, and embracing, as we learn at the end of White’s essay, one figure who runs against it and who can still offer us some hope: St. Francis of Assisi.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, current humanist modes of environmental ethics fail to provide this counter-book. Rather, these ethics have rewritten the book in a way that maintains the trace of absolute divinity. Humanity In effect replaces God. This humanist construction of religion represents the worst of both worlds; the Environment is bent to the will of humanity, while the motives underlying this action remain unassailable.<br />
<br />
Stoekl 2007 (Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University. “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability.” P. 158-160)<br />
<br />
However, again we have the problem of bad faith. Religion owes its very power to its absoluteness: God is not made by us; we are made by God. The strictures of religion are meaningful and valid because we believe they come from a higher authority. Of course one can argue that secular documents are objects of belief and reverence (the U.S. Constitution, for example), and that they are in a sense “obeyed.” But McKibben wants more than the secular authority of the Constitution: he wants the absolute power, the limitless authority, of God. That authority, the authority of the sacred, not the reasoned laws of man, will tear us away from inherently immoral activites (such as accumulation), ones from which, apparently, we cannot be weaned by reasoned arguments alone. But the only way McKibben can get the divine authority he needs for ecoreligion is by consciously tailoring the religions tradition. What authority will such religion have after it results from the obviously pragmatic (hence the emphasis on “practical”) strategies of ecoauthorities such as McKibben himself? “There’s a real opportunity here, one not yet fully tried,” McKibben tells us (304), and we can’t help but be swept up in his enthusiaism, at least until we stop short, feeling a bit guilty, before this glow of sheer boosterism.<br />
Perhaps, this is why religion and science can lie down together so easily: the message of religion proposed by McKibben has already been confected with that practical goal in mind. Now all we have to do is forget about all that and go to church and worship.<br />
We might consider for a moment the role of the Book (the Bible) that McKibben proposes. The Book must be absolute, have the value of overarching authority, but at the same time it is wholly contingent upon readings carried out at specific historical conjectures by the community of faith (of readers). (Indeed, the process of reading that McKibben affirms may very well have been used all along- but McKibben is cynical- or practical- enough to affirm it openly.) It is those acts of reading, based on recent events, on the needs of the moment, that are exercises of the will- they determine, in short, how the Book will be read and what the larger values of the religion are. Don’t like a God who creates the plant and animal world as resources for man? No problem- here’s another God, in another passage, one who has given us, and the animals, a quite different position in creation.<br />
In other words, through our own reading, we have written the Book. And yet its practical value is that it is absolute: it is the word of God. The Book is not just another human document. We accept its power, its status, but at the same time, as practical beings, we cannot ignore that we have (re)written the Book with a purpose in mind: saving the world for Man. We are happy to have it both ways: we write the Book we want, then accept its Word as usefully definitive. And it can never be a question just of saving the world, because we could literally do that by doing nothing or, more accurately, by dying off. “Saving” the world as a human activity necessarily still places Man at the center, we are saving it for ourselves, so that we can flourish in an ecology that is (relatively) healthy. We are saving it after we have nearly destroyed it.<br />
The Book, in other words, situates our subjectivity as liars; we ourselves have authored a Book that we then take to be absolute, for our own good. The Book is supremely powerful only at the cost of our recognition that we ourselves are weak, hypocritical: why indeed do we need a sacred text to do for us what we cannot do on our own? The Book’s coldness, its power, erives first from what it would do for us, but ultimately from its merciless revelation of our own duplicity. It is as strong as we are weak, or, like God as analyzed by Bataille, its very strength, its authority, is our weakness, our need for some transcendent guarantee.<br />
We are not that far, in fact, from Sade’s Book in which the absolute, cold Book was both an obvious concoction resulting from human desires (a desire for an economy based on, as we have seen, a rigorous, orgiastic recycling) and at the same time an absolute of power before which we, as readers, are revealed as weak fantasists with quibbling, moralistic doubts: in other words, as victims, sharing the fictionality of the ultimate weakling and victim, God himself.<br />
From anti-Bible (Sade) to postmodern Bible (McKibben), from cold and cruel black star of immorality to the pick and choose gospel of current Christianity- we have not gone that far. Both texts situate the author/reader as powerful: Sade’s reader imagines himself or herself a great “libertine,” McKibben’s Christian sees himself or herself as the Human that saves the world, the subjectivity that is the world. But in both cases, as the Book becomes more powerful, the reader is resituated: now she or he is a creature of bad faith, wracked by doubt, a victim of the monster he or she has created through reading. The Book stares back, absolute, but now it is the human that is contingent, false, precisely because the Book itself is the very pinnacle of falseness, of fiction. The Book is now invincible in its silence accusation of Man. Human “libertine” desire, humanized ecological harmony, both can be purchased only at the cost of creating something dependent on evident fictions, needing the fabulations of a subjectivity that situates itself as omnipotent, but cannot help but know itself in the falsehood of that position. In the knowledge of one’s own fictionality, it is now the arbirtrarily created Book that takes the upper hand, reveals itself and revels in its final power. It is the Book that dispenses that knowledge, the knowledge of Man’s own good and evil, the inescapability of one’s lies, the mendacity of one’s “virtue.” This is the final and ultimate truth of the Book.<br />
If humanist religion- epitomized by ecoreligion- is a testament to Man’s bad faith, the solution must lie in another faith and another Book. If we dethrone Man by arguing for the supremacy of God, then the text must be, is, authored by God and not Man. Literalism is the simple realization that a humanist Christianity (for example) is an oxymoron. Man is created in God’s image, not vice versa. And the truth of that image is given to us, without any possible ambiguity, in the Book. Human life is sacred not in and of itself, not because it is human, but because it is in God’s image. The sacred is divine, not human. And so on.<br />

This desire to save the planet reduces all energy/resources on the planet to the role of work. This is the logic of the standing reserve. This austere cult of sustainability ignores the accursed share of energy that resists this utter classification. Only a mode of expenditure that puts us in touch with this cursed energy and thus loss can liberate us from the slavery of work. The unintended consequence of such expenditure is the salvation of the planet from ecological destruction.<br />
<br />
Stoekl 2007 (Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University. “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability.” P. 141-143)<br />
<br />
If we read Bataille from a Heideggerian perspective, we can therefore propose another giving, another expenditure. This one too will not, cannot, know what it is doing, but it will be consonant with the post-Sadean conceptions of matter and energy that Bataille develops in his early writings. Bataille’s alternative to the standing reserve is virulent, unlike Heidegger’s, no doubt because Bataille, following Sade, emphasizes the violence of the energy at play in ritual. Bataille’s world is intimate, and through this intimacy it gains a ferocity lacking in Heidegger’s cool and calm chalice or windmill (though both represent, in different ways, the lavish expenditure of unproductive energy). Bataille’s matter now is certainly not quantified stockpilable; it is a “circular agitation” that risks, rather than preserves the self. Through contact with this energy-charged matter, and the non-knowledge inseperable from it, the dominion of the head, of reason, of man’s self-certainty, is overthrown: God doubts himself, reveals his truth to be that of atheism; the human opens him – or herself to the other, communicates in eroticism, in the agony of death of atheistic sacrifice.<br />
Just as in The Accursed Share, where the survival of the planet will be the unforeseen, unintended consequence of a gift giving (energy expenditure) oriented not around a weapons buildup but around a squandering (give away) of wealth, so too in the future we can posit sustainability as an unitended aftereffect ofa politics of giving. Such a politics would entail not a cult of resource conservation and austere selfhood but, instead, a sacrificial prctice of exalted expenditure and irresistible glory. Energy expenditure, fundamental to the human (the human as the greatest burner of energy of all the animals), would be flaunted on the intimate level, that of the body, that of charged filth. The object would not be paraded as something useful, something that fulfills our needs; its virulence would give the lie to all at attempts at establishing and guaranteeing the dominion of the imperial self.<br />
One cannot deny the tendency to expend on the part of humans; on the contrary, following Bataille, we can say that this conscious tendency to lose is what both ties us to the cataclysmic loss of the universe, of the endless, pointless giving of stars, and at the same time distinguishes us through our awareness, our savior, of what cannot be known, sheer loss) It is vain to try to deny this tendency, to argue that destruction is ultimately somehow useful, that our role here on the planet is necessary, and necessarily stingy. Parsimonious sustainability theory ends only in a cult of the self, jealous in its marshalling of all available resources. We are, on the contrary gratuitous losers (like any other animal, but more so, and conscious of it), and this is our glory, our pleasure, our death trip, our finitude, our end. If on the other hand we try to substitute a mechanized, quantified, objectified verson of expenditure and claim that it addreses all of our needs, our freedom, extravagance will be subordinated to our personal demand, energy will become more refined power, and we end up running the risk of destroying ourselves on a planet where every atom has been put to work, and made to fulfill human goals – and where every usable resource has been pushed to the point of depletion. But most of all, in wasting in this way, engaging in this blind travesty of the tendency to expend, we deny any communication with and through the intimate world, the other torn in erotic ecstasy, the movement of celestial bodies, the agony of God.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our mode of expenditure predicated on cursed objects/energy disinvests and reinvests the standing reserve- returning it from the world of work- tearing us from our projects and placing us into a community of those who expend on an intimate level. It is time to accept our madness.<br />
<br />
Stoekl 2007 (Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University. “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability.” P. 148-149)<br />
<br />
If there is to be a postsustainable world, it will open itself as the after-effect of gleaning: of the charged object, the charged body, the collision of past and future in and through death. It is a realm where there is convergence of responsible recycling, defiant ritual, the sacrificial destruction of use and meaning, and social commitment beyond the narrow desires of the self. Community is an aftereffect of such postsustainable generosity. Recycling, as in Varda’s film, will entail not just a practical reuse of a salvaged standing reserve (reused material: plastic, steel, paper, etc.) but, more profoundly, a kind of erotic reinvestment and disinvestment, in which the object takes on a meaning that defeats our demand that it be a simple tool, a simple means to the end of status, individuality, comfort. Food itself (what today we call garbage) will be a sacrament of the death of God, barely edible trash reborn as a symbolic crux of life and death, meaning and non-knowledge. This will be a moment in which the aesthetic- many of Varda’s gleaners are artists- intersects with the religious (the orgiastic, the sacred) and the practical (the only “stuff” available is what can be recycled). In a “depleted” (postcarbon) world where, eventually, everything will be junk, and in which there will be little official energy to create new junk, orgiastic recycling will tear us from our projects and project us into communication with others, with the void. The tossed object will be consumed in an intimate world. “Bits” will be everywhere, the traces of the lost world of seemingly infinite standing reserves; they will be reused and they will command their reuse, talking to us, signifying our own loss and our own glory in reusing them to live, to play, to do nothing. “Bits,” like walking or cycling, will both enable us to go on living and, as modes of squandering (burn-off of time, of effort, of sanity), constellate an intimate world.<br />
To paraphrase Bataille, only a madman would see such possibilities in the recycling of a few bits of refuse, “I am that madman” (OC, 7: 179; AS, 197, note 22).<br />
<br />
Our attachment to cursed energy/matter reveals the nature of our counter-book- one not based on the unimpeachable authority of God, but one rather based in the moment when God realizes his own insufficiency and thus dies a humored atheist.<br />
<br />
Stoekl 2007 (Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University. “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability.” P. 20-23)<br />
<br />
The intellect, then- science- excretes and devours, and this process is no different from what Sade’s “libertines” do. The process of “scientific heterology” entails nothing other than the rigorous study of all forms of rejection of inassimilable elements, be they “intellectual” (monstrous theories, grotesque art works, hideous poetry) or “physical” (shit, flies, big toes, spiders, spit). The product of such study- Bataille’s own writing- will similarly be heterogeneous: disgusting and unassimilable.<br />
Rather than discovering the rational bases of collective enthusiaism- Durkheim’s goal- Bataille seeks to “study” the very matter whose unjustifiable, a priori exclusion makes possible the coherence of rigorous, hierarchical systems of classification and thought. There is nothing inherently heterogeneous- repulsive, nonappropriable- in shirt or in anything else. It is the relation of that element, that object, to a system in which it cannot be given a stable position that makes it “rotten.” Its excluded rottenness is necessary in the coherence of the system. As Bataille puts it: “rottenness is not just a middle term between the ear and the wheat. The inability to envisage, in this case, rottenness as an end in itself is the result not exactly of the human point of view but of the specifically intellectual point of view (to the extend that this point of view is in practice subordinated to a process of appropriation)” (OC, 2: 65; VE, 99).<br />
Rottenness is an end in itself: it does not “go anywhere,” but instead wanders in the labyrinth, throwing off energy, disorder. Heterological science studies it, but not as a means to something else. Bataille’s science attains not a higher knowledge but a failure point of knowledge (just as to eat is always to vomit): “a burst of laughter is the only imaginable, definitively terminal, outlet- and not the means- of philosophical speculation” (OC, 2: 62; VE, 99.).<br />
A matter that is an end in itself, leading nowhere; but this matter is always prior, an unformed, or definitively formless, “stuff,” mana which circulates through entities and communities, which opens their possibility, but which is never reducible to them. It is the charged, energy-laden material that draws together, and sets apart. Verneuil and his victims; andin another context, it is the junk that ties together people in primitive religions at the moment they expel it- when “it,” for example, is the mutilated corpse of a sacrificial victim. It is the energy of their violent communication. “What [formless] designates has no rights in any sense and gets itself squashed everywhere, like a spider or an earthworm” (OC, 1:217; VE, 31).<br />
Thus for Bataille this sacred, charged, formless matter entails a religious experience, if one could use that word, but it is an “experience” that is not to be associated with established, Christian religions. (Bataille writes, “ WE ARE FEROCIOUSLY RELIGIOUS, and, to the extent that our existence is the condemnation of everything that is recognized today, an inner exigency demands that we be equally imperious” [OC, 1: 443; VE, 179].) Christianity proposes a homogeneous sacred, one that attempts to assimilate all evil, all rottenness, to its own system: evil is only the absence of God, it is not a positive entity, and one can work one’s way out of it on the way to a sacred belonging (Dante). The Christian sacred is ineffable, pure, holy, elevated above the rotten matter it must distance itelf from in order to continue itself. But Bataille notes the existence of early, now banned and cursed religions that maintained a cult of “bad matter”: Gnosticism.<br />
In practice it is possible to give as a leitmotiv of Gnosticism the conception of matter as an active principle having an external, autonomous existence, which is that of darkness (which would not be the absence of light but the monstrous archons revealed by that absence), that of evil (which would not be the absence of good, but a creative action). (OC, 1: 233; VE, 47; emphasis Bataille’s)<br />
Religion returns as a cult of materialism; not useful matter, to be sure, but “formless” matter that communicates its energy (“creative action”) between members of a cult. An elevated, pure God is doubled by a dead God or a multiple cursed divinity (such as the archons of Gnosticism). And along with this matter there is an energy, given the Sadean context of Bataille’s writing of this period, that is inseperable from a death drive. In some ways this “religion” is more rigorously atheist than was Sade’s; Sade, as is clear enough in La Philosophie dans le boudoi, needed God: The Sadean orgasm could only reach its peak intensity when the libertine was enraged in blasphemy. Sade was in effect already developing a model of sacrifice avant la letter: God’s sacrifice was integral to the transgressive act. The sacrifice of God and the production of “sacred matter” (the expelled, murdered, formless mess left over after the orgy) were inseperable. Sade’s dead God and his fiction are coterminious.<br />
Bataille’s religion, then, must take up from where Sade’s necessarily blasphemous nonreligion ends. In a sense Bataille must be conscious of the religious double bind in which Sade find himself, the necessity of positing God only to blaspheme and murder him. But where Sade, locked in his fiction, hits a dead end, with Dolmance regretting that he cannot believe in the God he blasphemes, Bataille affirms the virulence of the dead God erupting in and against society. This is the practice, if one can call it that, of Bataille’s heterological science, a science that ends not in self-satisfied knowledge but in the horror of a revolting sacrifice God exists only in his death, his expulsion, his violation. It seems that Bruno’s immanent, material God has come back in Bataill, but with his status as uncontrolled eruption of energy now made explicit: endlessly opening the violent duality of matter, God does not “exist,” but he incessantly dies, since the matter he inaugurates is the very destruction of any coherent principle- and God is the ultimate principle. If laughter is the terminal point of scientific activity, then God is the terminal point of laughter: “When God realized he was an atheist he died laughing.” Bataille’s dead God is not mere fiction, but myth and tragedy (tragedy being the highest myth, that of the death of the king, the leader, the most high).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to communicate this fall of God we come to the public square- a place racked with the same kind of authority present in the status quo's relationship to nature, the very authority we have come here to topple- and in our madness declare out loud &quot;THE DEATH OF GOD.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bataille 1985 (Georges. Edited and translated by Allan Stoekl. “Visions of Excess.” Written from 1927-1939. P. 213-214)<br />
<br />
A “mystery” cannot be posited in the empty region of spirit, where only words foreign to life subsist. It cannot result from a confusiong between obscurity and the abstract void. The obscurity of a “mystery” comes from images that a kind of lucid dream borrows from the realm of the crowd, sometimes bringing to light what the guilty conscience has pushed back into the shadows, sometimes high-lighting figures that are routinely ignored. From Louis XVI’s guillotine to the obelisk, a spatial arrangement is formed on the PUBLIC SQUARE, in other words, on all the public squares of the “civilized world” whose historical charm and monumental appearance prevail over everything else. For it is nowhere but THERE that a man, in some ways bewitched, in some ways overtaken by frenzy, expressly presents himself as “Nietzsche’s madman” and illuminates with his dream-lantern the mystery of the DEATH OF GOD.<br />
“Have you not heard,” cried Nietzsche, “of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the market place, and cried incessantly: &quot;I seek God! I seek God!&quot;---As many of those who did not believe in God were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter. Has he got lost? asked one. Did he lose his way like a child? asked another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated?---Thus they yelled and laughed.<br />
The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. &quot;Whither is God?&quot; he cried; &quot;I will tell you. We have killed him---you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.<br />
‘How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us---for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto.’”<br />

If you see the messenger on the side of the road kill him…The affirmative begins its discussion about the production of knowledge reminiscent of Hermes, the great messenger from Greek antiquity that would lead us on a journey through the dangers of enlightenment philosophy to a balanced deconstruction of knowledge…unfortunately in this case, as with many others, the way they proposes to lead us on the path to profound realizations is merely the highway to hell. We have no doubt that enlightenment dialectics are bad and should be deconstructed, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In place of the reasoned discourse present in the dominant western approach to knowledge we will invest in the process of creating an oral tradition designed to distance the quest to know from the linear progression of western knowledge:<br />
We live in the age of forgotten gods. Some lost, others betrayed, and still more with names only spoken in whispers or at secret rituals. However, while they are forgotten they are not gone. The magic they exercise now is far less miraculous than in our ancient past but has taken on an automatic quality that makes it no less powerful. Consider Hermes, the messenger God high atop mount Olympus. In his glorious youth Hermes was beautiful, athletic, and most importantly mischievous. Hermes, like the land he lived in, seemed covered in gold shining resplendent in the sun right down to his famed winged shoes. But the world has changed. Age and the slow process of forgetting have taken their toll on Hermes. He is no longer the archetype for inhuman speed…lean muscles fatten and atrophy, the glint of the sun once blinding is dimmed under tarnish and dust, and his once immediate wit decayed into a sorrowful sense of duty. This sense of loss can only be understood in the context of his past. Hermes, whose speed defied even the reach of death, was charged with ushering souls into the underworld, he sat at the right hand of Zeus, and played cruel games on the gods. Unfortunately, it seems time has played the cruelest trick on him. Hermes after the scattering of the gods on mount Olympus stood at a unique intersection…he was charged with the glacial task of the messenger in the new age, not to outrun death and outsmart the gods, but rather to be the keeper and disseminator of the lasting Classical tradition. A frail Hermes no longer dawns the winged shoes but rather pours over countless books. He has grown sedentary appearing to merge into his reading chair like some primitive cyborg growing increasingly unable to control its fits and starts. Despite his broken state the world never resists Hermes…it has become beholden to his call. Things were not always this way… in the past there were large parts of the world, even this country that resisted. Hermes is not kind in his old age. Simply ask the Native Americans…<br />
Someone went to ask the Native Americans…but they were nearly all gone.<br />
While the Native American people were all but exterminated at places like Wounded Knee creek or assimilated at places like the Carlisle Indian School their gods waited with their immortality. Hermes’s transition away from the classical era precipitated a fall from grace no doubt, but he has managed through subterfuge to leverage himself back into the central quest for the production of knowledge. This stands in stark contrast to the Coyote whose fall mirrors the suffering of his people. Imagine the awesome sadness as a god watches his people driven from their land into death and silence. Consider the feelings of alienation and rage as white lies replaced sacred teachings. Dwell for just a moment in the vast loneliness of a god whose followers are either gone or have forgotten. Coyote once a potent symbol of freedom, playfulness, and intelligence retreated into madness. In his darkest hours the Coyote was unrecognizable…he was both forgotten and forgettable. With his spirit broken Coyote turned to the bottle and worse. He became a matted, shrunken mess whose skeletal remains were so offensive that eyes were averted as an automatic response. He was nothing more than a shadow…and he was not alone.<br />
Hermes on the other hand was back on the rise and far from the shadow. He began a romantic dalliance with Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, who has spent her time winning the biggest race in town…capitalism. With the support and backing of Nike Hermes became reborn. With a flash of his old speed Hermes ascended the ranks of divine power leaving countless gods tumbling in his wake. Hermes was a new kind of god…not the god of Capitalism but something far more powerful. The task he used to rue became his sole charge. With the consent of his lover’s money Hermes corporatized knowledge and with speed that would have made him jealous in his youth and turned the machinery of the information-industrial-complex to his will. Somewhere the Coyote almost faded away…<br />
In his free time, Hermes watches over the high school debate circuit and takes certain students on tours of his complex of knowledge. From time to time, he even shows them the next step, but he accepts no other visitors on these tours…. There is no outside to his notion of knowledge.<br />
The Coyote almost faded away, but immortality is a tricky thing. It was in this moment, at the point of his greatest despair that Coyote felt a change. He knew for the first time that he had reached the bottom. There was nowhere else for the fallen to fall. The common sense response to reaching bottom would be a final sense of despair before finally giving in, but Coyote is far from common. In all of his frailty and through the shock of disease and madness Coyote felt some kernel of strength rejoin itself to his spirit. There was something of his old spirit gleaming in his eyes. He knew for the first time that the meek must confront the mighty, but it is not revenge that Coyote seeks…but a reckoning.<br />
Coyote had yet to devise a plan but he did know the target. He had been sleeping with his clothes stuffed with newspapers for insulation and had read of Hermes and his powerful union with the Nike corporation. He laughed smugly at the hollow echo of Hermes’s winged shoes, hand stitched in some nightmare factory populated by other poor folks, on the side of some hundred dollar shoes labeled with his greedy wife’s moniker and a swoosh in place of the once miraculous wings. He chuckled looking at his hollow rib cage and lamented both of their sorry condition…Coyote a fallen drug addict and Hermes suffering from the opposite problem…his height and duty have made him a corruption of his former self. All but gone is the trickster, all but gone is the rush of wind he once found so intoxicating, all that is left of him now is his final message in the cold/mechanical process of delivery and hollow capitalist idols sapped of their once dynamic force. It seems that one must not always fall in order to become a shadow. Coyote shook his head to clear it of his sense of pity. There was no place for pity now. Coyote knew that in order for his people, or people like them to have a chance at survival he must storm the preverbal gates of heaven. He had become an excluded element, the remainder, an excess, the spillage from some awful public restroom backed up with every bit of sloughed off human waste in the universe. They couldn’t know him in any real way. Hermes had already broken all of the information in his library. He had already cut-up the books and re-arranged them. He put books about queers in the children’s section and books about aliens in the reference stacks. He had leveled all knowledge almost out of boredom…now he gives these absurd tours, but what Coyote knew that Hermes did not was that he didn’t destroy the last and most potent aspect of his controlling function over the world…he left his library intact. It is only through Hermes and by proxy the Classical world that we come to confront knowledge. It is always a history of knowledge perpetuated and controlled by Hermes…there are no books about Coyote.<br />
Coyote resolved himself…the library must come down. Despite his wretched condition the plan began to form. Coyote would use what is left of his magic to change shapes for a time. He would sneak through the gates of heaven disguised as Nike. He would go to Hermes and seduce him and then at his most vulnerable moment he would change to his true form. Coyote figured that one of two things will happen either Hermes will die of shock at the thought of non-human coupling or Coyote will have set up a camera to document the awful scandal. He would then take the pictures to the always schrewd Nike who would have no choice but to succumb to the will of the fallen trickster. He would ask for the library and Hermes would be powerless in the face of the fearsome Nike. The plan worked to perfection. Coyote changed shape barely filling out the frame of the beautiful Nike, climbed into Hermes’s bed and came away with a picture fit for the lowly trickster god…Nike could not resist his request…the library was his. The walk to the library felt like walking the trail of tears backwards. Coyote looked upon it in all of its glory. The storehouse of the history of western knowledge lay before him. The light was back in Coyote’s eyes and despite his attempt at restraint a grin carved its way across his face. He descended on the library with maniac fury tearing it down brick by brick. The walls were gone…the library spilled into the world and the rest of the world into the library. Coyote rested…<br />

<strong>We begin in a world of few solutions. The work of capitalism fits human beings into a degrading cycle of production and consumption where humans work themselves to death only to buy the ability to consume. This principle of consumption is the vortex that reduces ideology to a simple lie. Unfortunately, the revolution against material capitalism in the form of Marxist thought only plays the same game in reverse asking its people to buy hollow ideology only to get the product to be consumed instead.</strong><br />

<br />
Purchasing power is a license to purchase power. The old proletariat sold its labour power in order to subsist; what little leisure time it had was passed pleasantly enough in conversations, arguments, drinking, making love, wandering, celebrating and rioting. The new proletarian sells his labour power in order to consume. When he's not flogging himself to death to get promoted in the labour hierarchy, he's being persuaded to buy himself objects to distinguish himself in the social hierarchy. The ideology of consumption becomes the consumption of ideology. The cultural détente between east and west is not accidental! On the one hand, homo consomator buys a bottle of whisky and gets as a free gift the lie that accompanies it. On the other, Communist man buys ideology and gets as a free gift a bottle of vodka. Paradoxically, Soviet and capitalist regimes are taking a common path, the first thanks to their economy of production, the second thanks to their economy of consumption. *<br />

<strong>This places human beings in the unfortunate position of only being able to choose one master over another. However, nearly all governments now trend toward a form of totalitarianism where the only goal is to automate the will to domination. Governments do not produce freedom it is rather only when individuals break from officially permitted acts and touch true creativity that we can sense the sword of Damocles hanging over a population of slaves promised freedom.</strong><br />

<br />
In this fractured world, whose common denominator throughout history has been hierarchical social power, only one freedom has ever been tolerated: the freedom to change the numerator, the freedom to prefer one master to another. Freedom of choice so understood has increasingly lost its attraction -- especially since it became the official doctrine of the worst totalitarianisms of the modern world, East and West. The generalization of the refusal to make such a Hobson's choice -- to do no more than change employers -- has in turn occasioned a restructuring of State power. All the governments of the industrialized or semi-industrialized world now tend to model themselves -- after a single prototype: the common aim is to rationalize, to 'automate', the old forms of domination. And herein lies freedom's first chance. The bourgeois democracies have clearly shown that individual freedoms can be tolerated only insofar as they entrench upon and destroy one another; now that this is clear, it has become impossible for any government, no matter how sophisticated, to wave the muleta of freedom without everyone discerning the sword concealed behind it. In fact the constant evocation of freedom merely incites freedom to rediscover its roots in individual creativity, to break out of its official definition as the permitted the licit, the tolerable -- to shatter the benevolence of despotism.<br />

<strong>The affirmative has the ability to take a stance against the slavery of capitalism but they choose to employ their creative will by advocating an imagined action by the state. This is a vision of power and control. They will claim that it is the source of some kind of salvation but it is merely another justification to trap creativity inside a prison cell. The real path to freedom isn’t just the writing of graffiti on our prison walls but rather to liberate creative resistance from the boundaries of the state and to affirm the transformational power of the individual creative will. It is this moment that dissolves the slave mentality and changes the world.</strong><br />

<br />
With touching candour, Dewitt Peters remarks that, &quot;If paints, brushes and canvas were handed out to everyone who wanted them, the results might be quite interesting&quot;. It is true that if this policy were applied in a variety of well-defined and well-policed spheres, such as the theatre, the plastic arts, music, writing, etc., and in a general way to any such sphere susceptible of total isolation from all the others, then the system might have a hope of endowing people with the consciousness of the artist, ie., the consciousness of someone who makes a profession of displaying their creativity in the museums and shopwindows of culture. The popularity of such a culture would be a perfect index of Power's success. Fortunately the chances of people being successfully 'culturized' in this way are now slight. Do they really imagine that people can be persuaded to engage in free experiment within bounds laid down by authoritarian decree? OR that prisoners who have become aware of their creative capacity will be content to decorate their cells with original graffiti? They are more likely to apply their newfound penchant for experiment in other spheres: firearms, desires, dreams, self- realization techniques. Especially since the crowd is already full of agitators. No: the last possible way of coopting creativity, which is the organization of artistic passivity, is happily doomed to failure. &quot;What I am trying to reach&quot;, wrote Paul Klee, &quot;is a far-off point, at the sources of creation, where I suspect a single explanatory principle applies for people, animals, plants, fire, water, air and all the forces that surround us&quot;. As a matter of fact, this point is only far off in Power's lying perspective: the source of all creation lies in individual creativity; it is from this starting point that everything, being or thing, is ordered in accordance with poetry's grand freedom. This is the take-off point of the new perspective: that perspective for which everyone is struggling willy-nilly with all their strength and at every moment of their existence. &quot;Subjectivity is the only truth&quot; (Kierkegaard).Power cannot enlist true creativity. In 1869 the Brussels police thought they had found the famous gold of the International, about which the capitalists were losing so much sleep. They seized a huge strongbox hidden in some dark corner. When they opened it, however, they found only coal. Little did the police know that the pure gold of the International would always turn into coal if touched by enemy hands. The laboratory of individual creativity transmutes the basest metals of daily life into gold through a revolutionary alchemy. The prime objective is to dissolve slave consciousness, consciousness of impotence, by releasing creativity's magnetic power; impotence is magically dispelled as creative energy surges forth, genius serene in its self-assurance. So sterile on the plane of the race for prestige in the Spectacle, megalomania is an important phase in the struggle of the self against the combined forces of conditioning. The creative spark, which is the spark of true life, shines all the more brightly in the night of nihilism which at present envelopes us. As the project of a better organization of survival aborts, the sparks will become more and more numerous and gradually coalesce into a single light, the promise of a new organization based this time on the harmonizing of individual wills. History is leading us to the crossroads where radical subjectivity is destined to encounter the possibility of changing the world. The crossroads of the reversal of perspective. *<br />

<strong>Finally, language serves power but is also the space of the reversal of perspective. We are constantly bombarded by language that communicates nothing beyond the lie of power. Fortunately, words are double agents. Language once used in service of the king will now realize its secret desire to kill that which it serves. This is the work of poetry and the beginning of the revolution of everyday life.</strong><br />
<br />
Vaneigm in 1972 (Raoul, The Revolution of Everyday Life. Translated into English by John Fullerton and Paul Sieveking.)<br />
<br />
The fight is unfair. Words serve power better than they do men; they serve it more faithfully than most men do, and more scrupulously than the other mediations (space, time, technology...) Hypostatised transcendence always depends on language and is developed in a system of signs and symbols, such as words, dance, ritual, music, sculpture and building. When a half-completed action, suddenly obstructed, tries to continue in a form which it hopes will eventually allow it to finish and realise itself -- like a generator transforming mechanical energy into electrical energy which will be reconverted into mechanical energy by a motor miles away -- at this moment language swoops down on living experience, ties it hand and foot, robs it of its substance, abstracts it. it always has categories ready to condemn to incomprehensibility and nonsense anything which they can't contain, or summon into existence-for-power that which slumbers in nothingness because it has no place as yet in the system of Order. The repetition of familiar signs is the basis of ideology.<br />
And yet men still try to use words and signs to perfect their interrupted gestures. This is why a poetic language exists: a language of lived experience which, for me, merges with radical theory, the theory which penetrates the masses and becomes a material force. Even when it is recuperated and turned against its original purpose, poetry always gets what it wants in the end. The &quot;Proletarians of all lands, unite&quot; which produced the Stalinist State will one day realise the classless society. No poetic sign is ever completely tamed by ideology. The language that diverts radical actions, creative actions, human actions par excellence, from their realisation, becomes anti-poetry. it defines the linguistics of power: its science of information. This information is the model of false communication, the communication of the inauthentic, the non-living. There is a principle that I find holds good: as soon as a language no longer obeys the desire for realisation, it falsifies communication; it no longer communicates anything except that false promise of truth which is called a lie. But this lie is the truth of what destroys me, infects me with its virus of submission. Signs are thus the vanishing points from which diverge the antagonistic perspectives which make up the world and divide it between them: the perspective of power and the perspective of the will to live. Each word, idea or symbol is a double agent. Some, like the word 'fatherland' or the policeman's uniform, usually work for authority; but make no mistake, when ideologies clash or begin to wear out the most mercenary sign can become a good anarchist (I am thinking of the splendid title that Bellegarigue chose for his paper: L'Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre). Dominant semiological systems -- which are those of the dominant castes -- have only mercenary signs, and, as Humpty-Dumpty says, the king pays double time to words he uses a lot. But deep down inside, every mercenary has dreams of killing the king. If we are condemned to a diet of lies we must learn to spike them with a drop of the acid truth. This is the way the agitator works: he charges his words and signs so powerfully with living reality that all the others are pulled out of place. He diverts them. In a general way, the fight for language is the fight for the freedom to live, for the reversal of perspective. The battle is between metaphysical facts and the reality of facts: I mean between facts conceived statistically as part of a system of interpretation of the world and facts understood in their development by the praxis which transforms them. Power can't be overthrown like a government. The united front against authority covers the whole extent of everyday life and engages the vast majority of men. To know how to live is to know how to fight against renunciation without ever giving an inch. Let nobody underestimate power's skill in stuffing its slaves with words to the point of making them the slaves of its words. What weapons do we have to secure our freedom? We can mention three: 1. Information should be corrected in the direction of poetry, news deciphered, official terms translated (so that &quot;society&quot;, in the perspective opposed to power, becomes &quot;racket&quot; or &quot;area of hierarchical power&quot;) -- leading eventually to a glossary or encyclopaedia (Diderot was well aware of their importance and so<br />
are the Situationists).2. Open dialogue, the language of dialectic; conversation, and all forms of non-spectacular discussion 3. What Jakob Boehme called &quot;sensual speech&quot; (sensualische Sprache) &quot;because it is a clear mirror of the senses&quot;. And the author of the Way to God elaborates: &quot;in sensual speech all spirits converse directly, and have no need of any language, because theirs is the language of nature.&quot; if you remember what I have called the recreation of nature, the language Boehme talks about clearly becomes the language of spontaneity, of &quot;doing&quot;, of individual and collective poetry; language centred on realisation, leading lived experience out of the cave of history. This is also connected with what Paul Brousse and Ravachol understood by &quot;propoganda of the deed&quot;*<br />

We begin in “The Factory.” This factory like any other is the site of production. There is no creativity here only production…one after another…always the same. The strangeness of the Factory as a location in debate is made stranger by the fact that we are attempting to make art in this debate space. This is not the kind of art that seeks to critique the world, find depth in it, or incite some kind of radical political transformation, we rather seek to become shallow and replicate the debate aesthetic in all of its trite superficial exactness. Andy Warhol said “I want to be a machine” (Quoted by Jean Baudrillard in The Transparency of Evil. New York: Verso, 1993:171.) when he painted the Brillo Soap boxes. We also want to become machines. It is this mode of becoming that frees the object from the reign of the aesthetic and relieves us of our alienation.<br />
<br />

Available online: <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:662:http://teaching.arts.usyd.edu.au/ArtHistory/ARHT1002/readings/JBWarhol.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://teaching.arts.usyd.edu.au/ArtHistory/ARHT1002/readings/JBWarhol.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://teaching.arts.usyd.edu.au/ArtHistory/ARHT1002/readings/JBWarhol.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:662 -->)<br />

Modern art had already gone a very long way in the deconstruction of its object, but it was Warhol who went furthest in the destruction of the subject of art, in the destruction of the artist. It was he who went furthest in the disinvestment of the creative act. And one could say that this is his snobbery, but a snobbery that relieves us of all the affectation of art. Precisely because he is machinic. Picabia and Duchamp, for example, introduced the machine into the picture or into the mechanism of painting, but in them it was still present as surrealist mechanicity, that is, basically as a critical function (even the readymade still responds to this) — and not as machinicity. Whereas Warhol simply identified himself with the machinic, just as he identified himself with the no place of utopia, so as to propagate it and himself as the automatic reality of the modern world. This is true snobbery, total machinism. That gives his images their contagious power, whereas the others, even when they retrace the mechanism of banality, remain singular objects. They hadn’t become veritable machines, thus veritable snobs: they were still simply artists. Their works are half way between artifice and the unconditional artefact. Having lost the secret of representation, they don’t draw out the consequences — which would effectively imply, in machinic snobbery, a sort of suicide. With Warhol, there’s a minimal pretension to being, a minimal strategy of means and ends. “Nothing is perfect because it is opposed to nothing” [“Nothing is perfect—after all...it’s the opposite of nothing”] One must read the Diaries, Warhol’s whole Diary, as the most beautiful narrative of this transparency, this meticulous inexpression, this lightness, this will to insignificance which is without doubt our contemporary version of the will to power. As an example, I will quote Warhol himself: Nothing is missing. It’s all there. The affectless gaze. The diffracted grace...The bored languor, the wasted pallor...The chic freakishness, the basically passive astonishment, the enthralling secret knowledge. The childlike, gum-chewing naïveté, the glamour rooted in despair, the self admiring carelessness, the perfected otherness, the wispiness, the shadowy, voyeuristic, vaguely sinister aura, the pale, soft-spoken magical presence, the skin and bones... (From A to B and Back Again — The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, London: Picador, 1976, p.17-18) Because of this transparency Warhol’s images can be multiplied infinitely, but not explored in depth. Unlike all other painters, there are no blown-up details of any works by Warhol, not even in the catalogues. It’s as if each of them already functions as a hologram, where there is no difference between the detail and the whole, and where the gaze spreads out in an object without substance, to the point of confounding it with its virtual presence. Warhol himself, like his images, is nothing more than a sort of hologram. Famous people come to the Factory to hang around him, but without being able to draw anything from him. They are absorbed into his virtual presence, passing through him as through a filter or photographic lens, which he was effectively: an objective. Valerie Solanas even tried to break this objective when she took a shot at him, when she tried to pass through the hologram in a desperate attempt to verify that blood could still flow out of him. Here we can just say with Warhol: more superficial than me, you die. And Warhol was near to dying, since this time he considered himself as a dead man, as a survivor. Everything about Warhol is factitious: the object is factitious because it is no longer relative to a subject, but to the object’s desire alone (desire of the object) The image is factitious because it is no longer relative to an aesthetic demand but to the image’s desire alone (and Warhol’s images desire and generate one another, since there is no other destiny for the image but the image). They no longer have a signification of their own, thus they are no longer alienated. In this way the fetishistic stage, the stage of the unconditional simulacrum, is an ulterior and superior stage to that of alienation, it relieves us of alienation. So Warhol is the first disalienated artist, having reached the stage of radical fetishism — it is, as he says, alterity brought to a point of perfection (that is to say, beyond alienation). More alienated than alienated is: free from alienation, according to the exponential principle of the extreme phenomenon.<br />

Round after round in late out rounds the debate community has spoken. Difference is dead. Critique is dead. We must become other or die. The duplication of the “artificial automation” opens the space for political affectation where we can literally externalize our subjectivity and become other. It is in this becoming machine that we are capable of outmaneuvering the machinations of the system and reach its magical core…this allows us to discover its secret aim.<br />
<br />
Baudrillard in ‘93 (Jean, The Transparency of Evil. New York: Verso, 1993:170-171.)<br />
<br />
Simulating a man, not being oneself, calls for a great deal of affectation. A subtle way of regulating one’s fate on the basis of external, ‘inauthentic’ signs, affectation is condemned by our entire culture, which is a culture of truth and sincerity. Affectation is that affective state in which one becomes aware, as Gombrowicz puts it, of the artificiality of one’s condition; in this state we create a kind of artificial double for ourselves, an artificial shadow into which we enter, an artificial automaton produced from our own essence—the means, in short, to externalize ourselves, thanks to signs, as other. Does not great affectation in fact characterize all our automata, all our artificial machines, all our techniques? Andy Warhol has found the formula of maximum snobbery here: ‘I want to be a machine’. By assigning himself, as a unique machine, to the realm of machines and machine-made objects, by employing just a touch more simulation and artificiality, Warhol out-maneuvers the very machinations of this system. Whereas an ordinary machine produces objects, Warhol produces the object’s secret aim – which is to be reproduced. He reproduces the object complete with its ultra-purpose, cloaked in the secret non-sense that emanates from the very process of object-generation. Where others seek to add a little soul, Warhol adds a little more machinery. Where others seek a little more meaning, he seeks a little more artifice. Less and less himself, more and more affected, he reaches the machine’s magical core by reproducing the world in all its trite exactness. Less and less the subject of desire – closer and closer to the nothingness of the object.<br />

<strong>Space programs ultimately serve capitalists, who use the new “outside” space creates as a fresh market and source of resources</strong><br />
<br />
Dickens 9<br />
(Peter Dickens, Visiting professor of Sociology at the University of Essex, “The Cosmos as Capitalism’s Outside,” The Sociological Review, 57: 66–82)<br />
<br />
The imminent conquest of outer space raises the question of ‘outside’ and ‘inside’ yet again. Capitalism now has the cosmos in its sights, an outside which can be privately or publicly owned, made into a commodity, an entity for which nations and private companies can compete. As such the cosmos is a possible site of armed hostilities. This means, contra Hardt and Negri, that there is an outside after all, one into which the competitive market can now expand indefinitely. A new kind of imperialism is therefore underway, albeit not one attempting to conquer and exploit people ‘outside’ since there are no consumers or labour power to exploit in other parts of the solar system. Ferrying wealthy tourists into the cosmos is a first and perhaps most spectacular part of this process of capital's cosmic expansion. Especially important in the longer term is making outer space into a source of resources and materials. These will in due course be incorporated into production-processes, most of which will be still firmly lodged on earth. Access to outer space is, potentially at least, access to an infinite outside array of resources. These apparently have the distinct advantage of not being owned or used by any pre-existing society and not requiring military force by an imperializing power gaining access to these resources. Bringing this outside zone into capitalism may at first seem beneficial to everyone. But this scenario is almost certainly not so trouble-free as may at first seem. On the one hand, the investment of capital into outer space would be a huge diversion from the investments needed to address many urgent inequalities and crises on Earth. On the other hand, this same access is in practice likely to be conducted by a range of competing imperial powers. Hardt and Negri (2000) tell us that the history of imperializing wars is over. This may or may not be the case as regards imperialism on earth. But old-style imperialist, more particularly inter-imperialist, wars seem more likely than ever, as growing and competing power-blocs (the USA and China are currently amongst the most likely protagonists) compete for resources on earth and outer space. Such, in rather general terms, is the prospect for a future, galactic, imperialism between competing powers. But what are the relations, processes and mechanisms underlying this new phenomenon? How should we understand the regional rivalries and ideologies involved and the likely implications of competing empires attempting to incorporate not only their share of resources on earth but on global society's ‘outside’? Social crises, outer spatial fixes and galactic imperialism Explanatory primacy is given here to economic mechanisms driving this humanization of the universe. In the same way that they have driven imperializing societies in the past to expand their economic bases into their ‘outsides’, the social relations of capitalism and the processes of capital-accumulation are driving the new kind of outer space imperialisms. Such is the starting-point of this paper (See alsoDickens and Ormrod, 2007). It is a position based on the work of the contemporary Marxist geographer David Harvey (2003) and his notion of ‘spatial fixes’. Capitalism continually constructs what he calls ‘outer transformations.’ In the context of the over-accumulation of capital in the primary circuit of industrial capital, fresh geographic zones are constantly sought out which have not yet been fully invested in or, in the case of outer space, not yet been invested in at all. ‘Outer spatial fixes’ are investments in outer space intended to solve capitalism's many crises. At one level they may be simply described as crises of economic profitability. But ‘economic’ can cover a wide array of issues such as crises of resource-availability and potential social and political upheavals resulting from resource-shortages. Furthermore, there is certainly no guarantee that these investments will actually ‘fix’ these underlying economic, political and social crises. The ‘fix’ may well be of a temporary, sticking-plaster, variety.<br />

<br />
The capitalist class owns the factories, the banks, and transportation-the means of production and distribution. Workers sell their ability to work in order to acquire the necessities of life. Capitalists buy the workers' labor, but only pay them back a portion of the wealth they create. Because the capitalists own the means of production, they are able to keep the surplus wealth created by workers above and beyond the cost of paying worker's wages and other costs of production. This surplus is called &quot;profit&quot; and consists of unpaid labor that the capitalists appropriate and use to achieve ever-greater profits. These profits are turned into capital which capitalists use to further exploit the producers of all wealth-the working class. Capitalists are compelled by competition to seek to maximize profits. The capitalist class as a whole can do that only by extracting a greater surplus from the unpaid labor of workers by increasing exploitation. Under capitalism, economic development happens only if it is profitable to the individual capitalists, not for any social need or good. The profit drive is inherent in capitalism, and underlies or exacerbates all major social ills of our times. With the rapid advance of technology and productivity, new forms of capitalist ownership have developed to maximize profit. The working people of our country confront serious, chronic problems because of capitalism. These chronic problems become part of the objective conditions that confront each new generation of working people. The threat of nuclear war, which can destroy all humanity, grows with the spread of nuclear weapons, space-based weaponry, and a military doctrine that justifies their use in preemptive wars and wars without end. Ever since the end of World War II, the U.S. has been constantly involved in aggressive military actions big and small. These wars have cost millions of lives and casualties, huge material losses, as well as trillions of U.S. taxpayer dollars. Threats to the environment continue to spiral, threatening all life on our planet. Millions of workers are unemployed or insecure in their jobs, even during economic upswings and periods of &quot;recovery&quot; from recessions. Most workers experience long years of stagnant real wages, while health and education costs soar. Many workers are forced to work second and third jobs to make ends meet. Most workers now average four different occupations during their lifetime, being involuntarily moved from job to job and career to career. Often, retirement-age workers are forced to continue working just to provide health care for themselves. With capitalist globalization, jobs move as capitalists export factories and even entire industries to other countries. Millions of people continuously live below the poverty level; many suffer homelessness and hunger. Public and private programs to alleviate poverty and hunger do not reach everyone, and are inadequate even for those they do reach. Racism remains the most potent weapon to divide working people. Institutionalized racism provides billions in extra profits for the capitalists every year due to the unequal pay racially oppressed workers receive for work of comparable value. All workers receive lower wages when racism succeeds in dividing and disorganizing them. In every aspect of economic and social life, African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders, Arabs and Middle Eastern peoples, and other nationally and racially oppressed people experience conditions inferior to that of whites. Racist violence and the poison of racist ideas victimize all people of color no matter which economic class they belong to. The attempts to suppress and undercount the vote of the African American and other racially oppressed people are part of racism in the electoral process. Racism permeates the police, judicial and prison systems, perpetuating unequal sentencing, racial profiling, discriminatory enforcement, and police brutality. The democratic, civil and human rights of all working people are continually under attack. These attacks range from increasingly difficult procedures for union recognition and attempts to prevent full union participation in elections, to the absence of the right to strike for many public workers. They range from undercounting minority communities in the census to making it difficult for working people to run for office because of the domination of corporate campaign funding and the high cost of advertising. These attacks also include growing censorship and domination of the media by the ultra-right; growing restrictions and surveillance of activist social movements and the Left; open denial of basic rights to immigrants; and, violations of the Geneva Conventions up to and including torture for prisoners. These abuses all serve to maintain the grip of the capitalists on government power. They use this power to ensure the economic and political dominance of their class. Women still face a considerable differential in wages for work of equal or comparable value. They also confront barriers to promotion, physical and sexual abuse, continuing unequal workload in home and family life, and male supremacist ideology perpetuating unequal and often unsafe conditions. The constant attacks on social welfare programs severely impact single women, single mothers, nationally and racially oppressed women, and all working class women. The reproductive rights of all women are continually under attack ideologically and politically. Violence against women in the home and in society at large remains a shameful fact of life in the U.S.<br />

<br />
It is time to try to describe, at first abstractly and later concretely, a strategy for destroying capitalism. This strategy, at its most basic, calls for pulling time, energy, and resources out of capitalist civilization and putting them into building a new civilization. The image then is one of emptying out capitalist structures, hollowing them out, by draining wealth, power, and meaning out of them until there is nothing left but shells. This is definitely an aggressive strategy. It requires great militancy, and constitutes an attack on the existing order. The strategy clearly recognizes that capitalism is the enemy and must be destroyed, but it is not a frontal attack aimed at overthrowing the system, but an inside attack aimed at gutting it, while simultaneously replacing it with something better, something we want. Thus capitalist structures (corporations, governments, banks, schools, etc.) are not seized so much as simply abandoned. Capitalist relations are not fought so much as they are simply rejected. We stop participating in activities that support (finance, condone) the capitalist world and start participating in activities that build a new world while simultaneously undermining the old. We create a new pattern of social relations alongside capitalist relations and then we continually build and strengthen our new pattern while doing every thing we can to weaken capitalist relations. In this way our new democratic, non-hierarchical, non-commodified relations can eventually overwhelm the capitalist relations and force them out of existence. This is how it has to be done. This is a plausible, realistic strategy. To think that we could create a whole new world of decent social arrangements overnight, in the midst of a crisis, during a so-called revolution, or during the collapse of capitalism, is foolhardy. Our new social world must grow within the old, and in opposition to it, until it is strong enough to dismantle and abolish capitalist relations. Such a revolution will never happen automatically, blindly, determinably, because of the inexorable, materialist laws of history. It will happen, and only happen, because we want it to, and because we know what we’re doing and know how we want to live, and know what obstacles have to be overcome before we can live that way, and know how to distinguish between our social patterns and theirs. But we must not think that the capitalist world can simply be ignored, in a live and let live attitude, while we try to build new lives elsewhere. (There is no elsewhere.) There is at least one thing, wage-slavery, that we can’t simply stop participating in (but even here there are ways we can chip away at it). Capitalism must be explicitly refused and replaced by something else. This constitutes War, but it is not a war in the traditional sense of armies and tanks, but a war fought on a daily basis, on the level of everyday life, by millions of people. It is a war nevertheless because the accumulators of capital will use coercion, brutality, and murder, as they have always done in the past, to try to block any rejection of the system. They have always had to force compliance; they will not hesitate to continue doing so. Nevertheless, there are many concrete ways that individuals, groups, and neighborhoods can gut capitalism, which I will enumerate shortly. We must always keep in mind how we became slaves; then we can see more clearly how we can cease being slaves. We were forced into wage-slavery because the ruling class slowly, systematically, and brutally destroyed our ability to live autonomously. By driving us off the land, changing the property laws, destroying community rights, destroying our tools, imposing taxes, destroying our local markets, and so forth, we were forced onto the labor market in order to survive, our only remaining option being to sell, for a wage, our ability to work. It’s quite clear then how we can overthrow slavery. We must reverse this process. We must begin to reacquire the ability to live without working for a wage or buying the products made by wage-slaves (that is, we must get free from the labor market and the way of living based on it), and embed ourselves instead in cooperative labor and cooperatively produced goods. Another clarification is needed. This strategy does not call for reforming capitalism, for changing capitalism into something else. It calls for replacing capitalism, totally, with a new civilization. This is an important distinction, because capitalism has proved impervious to reforms, as a system. We can sometimes in some places win certain concessions from it (usually only temporary ones) and win some (usually short-lived) improvements in our lives as its victims, but we cannot reform it piecemeal, as a system. Thus our strategy of gutting and eventually destroying capitalism requires at a minimum a totalizing image, an awareness that we are attacking an entire way of life and replacing it with another, and not merely reforming one way of life into something else. Many people may not be accustomed to thinking about entire systems and social orders, but everyone knows what a lifestyle is, or a way of life, and that is the way we should approach it. The thing is this: in order for capitalism to be destroyed millions and millions of people must be dissatisfied with their way of life. They must want something else and see certain existing things as obstacles to getting what they want. It is not useful to think of this as a new ideology. It is not merely a belief-system that is needed, like a religion, or like Marxism, or Anarchism. Rather it is a new prevailing vision, a dominant desire, an overriding need. What must exist is a pressing desire to live a certain way, and not to live another way. If this pressing desire were a desire to live free, to be autonomous, to live in democratically controlled communities, to participate in the self-regulating activities of a mature people, then capitalism could be destroyed. Otherwise we are doomed to perpetual slavery and possibly even to extinction. The content of this vision is actually not new at all, but quite old. The long term goal of communists, anarchists, and socialists has always been to restore community. Even the great peasant revolts of early capitalism sought to get free from external authorities and restore autonomy to villages. Marx defined communism once as a free association of producers, and at another time as a situation in which the free development of each is a condition for the free development of all. Anarchists have always called for worker and peasant self-managed cooperatives. The long term goals have always been clear: to abolish wage-slavery, to eradicate a social order organized solely around the accumulation of capital for its own sake, and to establish in its place a society of free people who democratically and cooperatively self-determine the shape of their social world.<br />

<strong>First a little set up. The budget control act created a bipartisan 12 person deficit reduction committee or “super committee” required to reduce spending by 1.2 trillion over 10 years. They agree to a proposal by majority and must submit this proposal by November 23rd, at which point it bypasses authorizing and appropriations committees and goes to the house and senate for and majority vote which is not subject to filibuster. Failure to do so triggers sequestration, an automatic across the board cut split between defense and entitlements.

<br />
But the committee has a few things in its favor, aspects that could lead to compromise. Among them: • The membership may be stacked with partisan appointments representing Democratic and Republican leaders in both the House and Senate, but several have been willing to cross aisles before: Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus of Montana and Foreign Relations Chairman John Kerry of Massachusetts are Democrats who have forged relationships with Republicans. At Thursday night's speech, Michigan Republicans Camp and Upton sat with Baucus. &quot;We've been working closely with Sen. Baucus, and he suggested we sit together,&quot; Camp said. &quot;I thought it was a good idea.&quot; Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, have been viewed as moderates -- at least in the past -- who bring valuable experience from the executive branch. Both worked in the federal Office of Management and Budget. Portman ran it. • Neither party wants to see the committee fail because it could trigger $1.2 trillion in across-the-board cuts, split evenly between defense and other programs. Even some Democrats -- Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin of Michigan among them -- fear those cuts could be too deep. An agreement also would forestall potential cuts to housing programs, education and more -- areas almost as important to Democrats as social entitlement programs, which would be largely protected. • There is a relative abundance of ideas to work with: In the Senate, the bipartisan panel known as the Gang of Six -- three Democrats and three Republicans -- drew up an outline of a plan that could have reduced the deficit by about $4 trillion over 10 years through a series of spending caps and tax reforms. And last year's report from the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform made a detailed proposal for nearly $4 trillion in deficit reduction that included spending caps, a hike in the gas tax to fund transportation projects, reforming the tax code (including capping the mortgage-interest deduction) and controlling Medicare spending. Neither the Gang of Six plan nor the Fiscal Responsibility and Reform Commission (also known as Simpson-Bowles, after its chairmen) got the support it needed to move forward, but in each case, there were members of both parties in support, suggesting there is room for bipartisan agreement. In the case of the latter, four of the super committee's members served on the commission and, although they voted against it, each saw merit in its proposals. Camp, for example, said he couldn't support the commission's plan because it resulted in higher government spending. But he pointedly noted -- in what could be a signal that compromise could come -- that the report's authors &quot;detail the tough choices ahead: choices I am willing to make.&quot; Making a deal No one expects a far-reaching government overhaul to be worked out in the 74 days left before the committee is required to vote on its recommendations. But there are some key areas in which compromise might be found. Take Medicare, for instance. In past talks, Baucus has discussed making selective cuts to the program, as long as Republicans agreed to additional tax revenues to pay for other government spending. There is a chance -- with Obama lending his bully pulpit to the notion of Medicare reform -- that a solution could be found if both parties are flexible. Another area where compromise is possible is tax reform. Camp, the head of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, has held hearings on the topic. Baucus, whose committee oversees tax policy in the Senate, has talked about the need for a fairer tax system in the U.S. Mark Prater, selected as the committee's staff director, is a tax expert. &quot;I think that is an area in which we've seen a good amount of political traction gained in the last few months, especially with corporate tax reform,&quot; said David Logan, an economist with the Tax Foundation in Washington, D.C. The negotiating points are these: The U.S. has, at 35%, one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, a fact many see as counter-competitive. But the government also provides billions of dollars in tax breaks for corporations -- including the accelerated write-off of equipment as it depreciates; the deferral of taxes on income earned abroad, and tax-free interest on municipal and government bonds. Get rid of some of the tax breaks -- the Congressional Research Service said the 10 largest breaks to corporations account for about $100 billion in lost tax collections each year -- and the federal government could reduce the corporate tax rate and still increase tax revenues. The Simpson-Bowles committee recommended a corporate tax rate of 23%-29% but didn't estimate how much in revenues it might raise, if any. And that's the issue -- because Republicans well could balk if a new corporate tax rate brought in more tax revenue. If it doesn't, it does nothing to solve the committee's problem -- finding $1.2 trillion through spending cuts and/or increased taxes. A similar problem exists on the individual income side. Both Simpson-Bowles and the Gang of Six looked at raising tax revenues by simplifying the tax brackets and lowering them, but, at the same time, considering changing tax breaks that many Americans take for granted, such as the exemption for health care coverage paid by an employer and the exclusion for interest paid on home mortgages. &quot;It has potential,&quot; Camp said. &quot;It's a very broad area, but it has potential.&quot; Politically, changes to the tax code may prove too difficult. Many Republicans have signed pledges never to raise taxes -- and they may have to decide on a case-by-case basis whether that promise applies to the government collecting more money by getting rid of select tax breaks. Democrats, on the other hand, have said they won't accept any deal based solely on cuts. Again, it's a tough formula to find. &quot;Everybody's got to have skin in the game,&quot; said former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson, the Republican co-chairman of the Fiscal Responsibility and Reform Commission. &quot;If they're going to roll over and play dead for the AARP and Grover Norquist (head of the anti-tax Americans for Tax Reform), we don't have a prayer.&quot; Simpson sees another advantage that the committee has: With world markets in turmoil, the members of both parties may be itching to act. The odds of reaching agreement &quot;are damn better than 50-50 if the markets and the world are rocking along in a wobbly fashion,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they're going to follow the signals of what the hell is going on in the world.&quot;<br />

Digging in for a bruising struggle, Republicans on Congress' powerful deficit-fighting &quot;supercommittee&quot; targeted Social Security and government health-care spending Tuesday, while Democrats pressed for higher tax revenue as part of any deal to reduce red ink by at least $1.2 trillion over the next decade. There were no ultimatums from either side, and there was even a fleeting suggestion that tax reform might eventually clear the way for the bipartisan agreement that both sides say they want. Yet with partisan struggles flaring elsewhere in Congress, the events underscored the challenge the 12-member panel faces as it gropes for a deal that can clear Congress and win President Barack Obama's signature by year's end. With the nation's debt high and surging and the population aging, &quot;Citizens will either have to pay more for their government, accept less in government services and benefits, or both,&quot; Doug Elmendorf, the head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, told the supercommittee. Though the choices are difficult, Elmendorf said, the problem &quot;need not be viewed as unsolvable.&quot; Yet the challenge is complicated, he said, if lawmakers hope to revive the economy in the short term and cut federal deficits in later years. In that case, &quot;a combination of policies would be required: changes in taxes and spending that would widen the deficit now but reduce it later in the decade.&quot; The committee has until Nov. 23 to recommend legislation, but Elmendorf said the essential decisions must be made as much as three weeks earlier than that. The panel was created last month as part of a compromise that avoided a threatened government default and cut nearly $1 trillion from some federal programs. In addition to the original goal of cutting long-term deficits, Democrats want much or all of Obama's week-old $447 billion jobs proposal put on the agenda, significantly increasing the amount of savings that must be found. &quot;My question to Congress is: What on earth are we waiting for?&quot; the president asked rhetorically as he visited Columbus, Ohio, to campaign for the enactment of his program of Social Security payroll tax cuts and spending increases for highway projects and other domestic programs. Speaking in the home state of Republican House Speaker John Boehner, the Democratic president said his call for $25 billion for school construction nationwide would put thousands of construction workers in Ohio back to work. Boehner responded from the Capitol, where he said the president was seeking &quot;permanent tax increases put into effect in order to pay for temporary spending. I just don't think that's going to help our economy the way it could.&quot; Republicans are likely to accept some or all of the tax cuts Obama wants, but the spending increases shape up as a tougher sell.<br />

<br />
The so-called super committee set up by Congress to address the nation's fiscal imbalance hasn't met yet, and its final three members were just named Thursday. But that hasn't stopped the unhelpful, inside-the-Beltway speculation that it's doomed for gridlock. The 12 members of the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction need to set aside partisan polemics to do the work Americans should be able to expect of their elected officials. Bipartisan agreement on attacking America's fiscal woes is not unprecedented - even in these times.<br />
Just eight months ago, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, co-chaired by former Republican Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles,<br />
the chief of staff for President Bill Clinton, showed that it could be done. The plan was not perfect and ultimately fell short of the 14 votes needed to send it directly to Congress. But it still garnered 11 votes, a solid majority that confirmed that fiscal security for America must include both spending cuts and raising tax revenue. The congressional committee, which will require just a simple majority to forward proposals to Congress, needs to embrace the same broad philosophy to achieve success.<br />
The Simpson-Bowles plan delayed deep spending cuts until 2012 to avoid jeopardizing the fragile economic recovery. But it also suffered no illusions about the serious work required to cut the deficit in half by 2015. The plan would have whacked every kind of government program, from the military to entitlements like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. It also proposed dramatic tax reform, including doing away with exemptions such as those allowed on second homes.<br />
The planhad shortcomings as well. It was pinched on tax reform, not willing to contemplate, for example, that an industry that has done so well in the past 10 years - financial services - might rightly need to pay a share of taxes through financial transaction fees.<br />
Tea party adherents appear unwilling to tolerate even the mildest suggestion of tax reform, much less revenue enhancement. And they're counting on their influence in the Republican Party to keep the six Republicans on the super committee beholden to the no-new-taxes pledge disseminated by uberlobbyist Grover Norquist. But no member of Congress worthy of support from his or her constituents should be beholden to a pledge that was signed, in some cases, before an escalating deficit caused in part by a pair of foreign wars.<br />
Rhetoric and platitudes have not solved this problem. Only tough, bipartisan compromise will. The dozen super committee members need to put country before partisanship.<br />

(Reuters) - Budget cuts over and above the $350 billion approved by Congress in August would have a &quot;devastating&quot; impact and erode U.S. ability to achieve its national security objectives, the nominee for deputy defense secretary told his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.<br />
Additional defense cuts of up to $600 billion &quot;would lead us to have to consider truly draconian things,&quot; including abandoning major weapons systems and furloughing employees, said Ashton Carter, the current undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics.<br />
Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee he believed the Pentagon could build a balanced defense program with $350 billion less to spend over 10 years as required by the legislation passed in August.<br />
But the legislation set up a panel to look at further cuts, and if this panel fails to reach agreement the government would face additional across-the-board cuts of about $600 billion in national security spending.<br />
He noted in written testimony that the effort would &quot;require difficult choices&quot; by the Defense Department and Congress.<br />
&quot;Any further reductions that may result from a failure of the joint committee to reach agreement will undermine our ability to meet our national security objectives,&quot; Carter wrote.<br />
He said greater cuts would significantly weaken the ability of the U.S. military to respond to threats around the globe.<br />
Carter said a second round of forced cuts if the committee fails to reach a compromise would be particularly troubling because it would cut a percentage of everything.<br />
&quot;It's arbitrary,&quot; he said. &quot;It deprives us of the opportunity of strategic choice. ... It put a haircut across everything.&quot;<br />

Moral realism is the theoretical expression of the Stone Age moral psychology with which we are saddled. It is an illusion that exacerbates conflict and promotes misunderstanding. If I want things to be one way and you want things to be some other way, we might be able to reach some sort of compromise. But, if I want things to be one way, and if I believe that the way I want things is not merely the way I want things but also the way things ought to be, and if I believe further that it’s just plain to see that my way is the way things ought to be and that anyone who says otherwise must be outright lying or willfully refusing to see the truth, and if you want things to be some other way and you’re just as convinced of the rightness of your position as I am of mine, then what chance do we have of reaching a reasonable compromise? I see you as an errant child, someone who has lost the way, someone who wasn’t paying attention on the day right and wrong were explained, or, perhaps, as someone who was paying attention but who, for whatever inexplicable reason, has chosen to cast aside what is right and good in favor of that which is base and evil. And you, of course, see me in a similar light. I attempt to argue with you and am amazed at your obtuseness. The words I speak so clearly reveal the truth, and yet you persist in your wrongheaded ways. And you are similarly perplexed by me and my stubbornness. Haidt (2001, pg. 823) summarizes the social-intuitionist take on ordinary moral discourse: The bitterness, futility, and self-righteousness of most moral arguments can now be explicated. In a debate on abortion, politics, consensual incest, or on what my friend did to your friend, both sides believe that their positions are based on reasoning about the facts and issues involved (the wag-the-dog illusion). Both sides present what they take to be excellent arguments in support of their positions. Both sides expect the other side to be responsive to such reasons (the wag-the-other-dog’s-tail illusion). When the other side fails to be affected by such good reasons, each side concludes that the other side must be insincere, closed-minded, or even devious…. In this way the culture wars over issues such as homosexuality and abortion can generate morally motivated players on both sides who believe that their opponents are not morally motivated (Haidt &amp; Hersh, 2001, Robinson, Keltner, Ward, &amp; Ross, 1995). A mess, indeed. But how to clean it up? Must we resign ourselves to a world of endless conflict and misunderstanding? Haidt (Pg. 823) suggests a shift in tactics: Moral reasoning may have little persuasive power in conflict situations, but the social intuitionist model says that moral reasoning can be effective in influencing people before a conflict arises… If one can get the other person to see the issue in a new way, perhaps by reframing a problem to trigger new intuitions, then one can influence others with one’s words. This, however, does not get to the heart of the problem. It is a gesture toward more subtle, less explosive forms of moral warfare, not peace. Moreover, it is a lesson that most professional moral communicators have already learned from experience. No surprise that novels, plays, metaphors, and anecdotes are more effective means of propaganda than philosophical arguments and statistics. (I’ve never stayed in a hotel room that came furnished with a copy of Kant’s Grundlegung.) As Haidt suggests, a better understanding of moral psychology may be used to further one’s own moral agenda—a good or bad thing depending on the agenda in question. But I propose instead that we use our understanding of moral psychology to transcend our ordinary modes of moral discourse rather than to operate more effectively within them.15 Once again, the enemy, the wolf in sheep’s clothing, is moral realism. Conflicts of interest may be inevitable, but they need not be exacerbated by people’s unflagging confidence that they’re right and that their opponents are wrong. The solution, then, is to get rid of realist thinking and to start by getting rid of realist language. Speak only in terms that make the subjective nature of value plain. Instead of saying that capital punishment is wrong say that you are opposed to it. Say that it is an ineffective deterrent, difficult to implement in a colorblind fashion, and likely to lead to irreversible mistakes. And then say no more. Instead of saying that eating animals is wrong and a form of murder, say that you are opposed to eating animals because you wish to alleviate suffering and you believe that this practice causes much unnecessary suffering. Instead of saying that gay marriage undermines “family values,” say that it undermines your family’s values, that it is against the teachings of your religion, etc. (Obviously some people will have an easier time with this transition than others. This is an important point to be explored later in Chapter 5.) Speaking in this way is honest, requires no false metaphysical commitments, and should make discussions of moral matters much more fruitful and, at the very least, shorter. When someone makes a claim about how he feels; what he wants, values, or cares about; or what he is or is not willing to accept in a negotiation, there is, in the absence of realist interlocutors, nothing to dispute. When someone makes a putative statement of fact, there is often much to dispute, but in a purely factual discussion there is a decent chance that genuine evidence can be brought to bear on the issue, resolving it in favor of one party or another or, failing that, demonstrating to both parties that the evidence is inconclusive.16 Even where differences of value and/or factual disagreements persist, such a mode of discourse is likely to lead to increased mutual understanding and less exasperating huffing and puffing. The language of moral realism is sufficiently rich to provide a reasonable sounding justification for just about anything a society would actually want to do. Even terrorists (or “freedom fighters,” depending on your point of view) can justify their actions in terms that sound eerily similar to those used by their victims in other contexts. Because there is no fact of the matter about what’s right or wrong, no true moral theory, there is no neutral ground from which to sort out the putatively true moral claims from the ones that simply ring true to some people. Thus, the language of moral realism makes an excellent smoke screen for aggressive or otherwise anti-social behavior, a smoke screen that is so effective it can, and usually does, fool those who employ it. A nation with economic incentives to take over a neighbor’s territory can claim that the neighboring territory really belongs to their nation and that they have a right to it. One might go so far as to say that nations require the language of moral realism to marshal popular support for aggressive actions. Has a military aggressor ever not claimed a moral right to carry out its plans? Has a nation ever been moved to war by leaders who said, “It would be good for us economically, and we can get away with it, so why not?” As Roger Fisher says in Basic Negotiating Strategy (1971, Pg. 110), “Governments are not like bank robbers. People ask ‘What ought I do?’ not ‘What can I get away with?’” Arthur Schlesinger (1971) concurs: “National interest has a self-limiting factor. It cannot, unless transformed by an injection of moral righteousness, produce ideological crusades for unlimited objectives.” As does Kenneth Thompson (1985, pg. 5): “Foreign policy tends to be articulated in moral terms, even in most authoritarian regimes.” As noted above, moral realists naturally interpret the actions and opinions of their (realist) opponents as products of a surreptitious disregard for morality. They see things this way because, to them, the moral truth that has been disregarded by their opponents is so self-evident that only one who willfully disregards morality’s requirements could think and act as their opponents do. People who are evil, people who believe that their actions are wrong and carry on just the same, are native to Hollywood movies and children’s books, but in real life (and good books and films) such characters are few and their influence is negligible. (See Section 5.2.3.) In the real world, the vast majority of avoidable suffering is caused by people who think they have the moral truth on their side.<br />

What about “ought” and “should?” These words are more or less equally comfortable in the mouths of deontologists and consequentialists, and, as we would expect, not so bad as “rights” and “duties,” but a bit more dangerous than “good” and “bad.” In asserted contexts one can avoid them by saying “I favor…,” “I’m for,” “I recommend…,” “I support…,” “I’m opposed to…,” or “I’m against…” instead of “We ought to…,” or “He should….,” or “They must….” It’s a bit hard to let go of these words in non-asserted contexts. For example how would a revisionist ask, “Should abortion be legal?” One could ask, “Are we for or against abortion?” but this sounds like a question about our current position, as if our votes have been cast and it’s simply a matter of tallying them. “Shall we allow abortion?” and “Are we to allow abortion?” both sound a bit too realist, not to mention stilted. “Will we allow abortion?” makes it sound like the issue is one of predicting the future. As far as I can see, there is no standard English way of asking the anti-realist question, “Should2 abortion be legal?” or of translating the phrase, “the dispute over whether abortion should2 be legal.” For this reason, revisionists may have to settle for “ought” and “should” for use in non-asserted contexts.<br />

The trouble is that, like other technologies biased toward control, the more successful legislation becomes, the more it renders itself necessary. Because it aims at rigorous definition at establishing hard boundaries or limits crossing the threshold of legislative utility means creating conditions under which the definition of freedom becomes so complex as to be self defeating. Taken to its logical end, legally biased social activism is thus liable to effect an infinite density of protocols for maintaining autonomy, generating a matrix of limits on discrimination that would finally be conducive to what might be called &quot;axiological entropy&quot; 6 a state in which movement in any direction is equally unobstructed and empty of dramatic potential. Contrary to expectations, complete &quot;freedom of choice&quot; would not mean the elimination of all impediments to meaningful improvisation, but rather an erasure of the latter's conditions of possibility. The effectiveness and efficiency of &quot;hard,&quot; control biased technologies depend on our using natural laws 6 horizons of possibility 6 as fulcrums for leveraging or dictating changes in the structure of our circumstances. Unlike improvised contributions to changes taking place in our situation, dictating the terms of change effectively silences our situational partners. Technological authority thus renders our circumstances mute and justifies ignoring the contributions that might be made by the seasons or the spiritual force of the mountains to the meaning the direction of movement of our ongoing patterns of interdependence. With the &quot;perfection&quot; of technically mediated control, our wills would know no limit. We would be as gods, existing with no imperatives, no external compulsions, and no priorities. We would have no reason to do one thing first or hold one thing, and not another, as most sacred or dear. Such &quot;perfection&quot; is, perhaps, as fabulous and unattainable as it is finally depressing. Yet the vast energies of global capital are committed to moving in this direction, for the most part quite uncritically. The consequences as revealed III the desecration and impoverishing of both 'external' and 'internal' wilderness (for instance, the rainforests and our imaginations) are every day more evident. The critical question we must answer is whether the &quot;soft&quot; technologies of legally biased and controlled social change commit us to an equivalent impoverishment and desecration. The analogy between the dependence of technological progress on natural laws and that of social activism on societal laws is by no means perfect. Except among a scattering of philosophers and historians of science for example, the laws of nature are not viewed as changeable artifacts of human culture. But for present purposes, the analogy need only focus our attention on the way legal institutions like natural laws do not prescriptively determine the shape of all things to come, but rather establish generic limits for what relationships or states of affairs are factually admissible. Laws that guarantee certain &quot;freedoms&quot; necessarily also prohibit others. Without the fulcrums of unallowable acts, the work of changing a society would remain as purely idealistic as using wishful thinking to move mountains. Changing legal institutions at once forces and enforces societal reform.<br />

“Another problem still remains, however: the question of the possibility of (performing) an ethical act. Is it at all possible for a human subject to accomplish an (ethical) act - or, more precisely, is it possible that something like an Act actually occurs in (empirical) reality? Or does it exists only in a series of failures which only some supreme Being can see as a whole, as an Act? If we are to break. out of the `logic of fantasy', framed by the postulates of immortality and God (the point of view of the Supreme Being), we have to assert that Acts do in fact occur in reality. In other words, we have to `attack' Kant on his exclusion of the `highest good' and the `highest (or diabolical) evil' as impossible for human agents. But does this not mean that we thereby give in to another fantasy, and simply substitute one fantasy for another? Would this kind of claim not imply that we have to `phenomenalize' the Law, abolish the internal division or alienation of human will, and assert the existence of devilish and/or angelic beings? This point was in fact made by Joan Copjec,16 who defends Kant against critics who reproach him for - as she puts it - `lack of intellectual nerve,' for not having enough courage to admit the possibility of diabolical evil. The attempt to think diabolical evil (as a real possibility) turns out, according to this argument, to be another attempt to deny the will's self-alienation, and to make of the will a pure, positive force. This amounts to a voluntarist reading of Kant's philosophy, combined with the romantic notion of the possibility of a refusal of the Law. We do not contest the validity of this argument per se. But the problem is that it leaves us with an image of Kantian ethics which is not very far from what we might call an `ethics of tragic resignation': a man is only a man; he is finite, divided in himself - and therein lies his uniqueness, his tragic glory. A man is not God, and he should not try to act like God, because if he does, he will inevitably cause evil. The problem with this stance is that it fails to recognize the real source of evil (in the common sense of the word). Let us take the example which is most frequently used, the Holocaust: what made it possible for the Nazis to torture and kill millions of Jews was not simply that they thought they were gods, and could therefore decide who would live and who would die, but the fact that they saw themselves as instruments of God (or some other Idea), who had already decided who could live and who must die. Indeed, what is most dangerous is not an insignificant bureaucrat who thinks he is God but, rather, the God who pretends to be an insignificant bureaucrat. One could even say that, for the subject, the most difficult thing is to accept that, in a certain sense, she is `God', that she has a choice. Hence the right answer to the religious promise of immortality is not the pathos of the finite; the basis of ethics cannot be an imperative which commands us to endorse our finitude and renounce our `higher', `impossible' aspirations but, rather, an imperative which invites us to recognize as our own the `infinite' which can occur as something that is `essentially a by-product' of our actions.<br />

If we retain this original sense of “radical evil” as it appears in Kant’s ethical thinking, the thinking that is the source of contemporary ethics of human rights according to Badiou (p. 8), then it turns out that Badiou’s own proposals look very Kantian indeed. Notice, first of all, that for Badiou as for Kant the ethical imperative does not derive from the experience of being or of a multitude of empirical facts about human beings, but from something immortal and transcending. The truth event, although prepared somehow in the order of being, comes to the subject, or rather, somehow transforms the human animal into a subject, from a horizon that is outside of space, time, and causality. Badiou could easily affirm Kant’s contention that it is “a contradiction to look for the temporal origin of the moral constitution of a human being.”9 Kant stresses pure reason as an immortal source of the moral law, while Badiou is content to leave nature of the revelatory power of eternal truth open and undefined. But for both this immortal calls for an allegiance to itself on the part of a subject who is disinterested in anything but the requirements of universal truth. For Badiou, a truth event generates a single, formal imperative: “the sole maxim of consistency (and thus of ethics): ‘Keep going!’ Keep going even when you have lost the thread, when you no longer feel ‘caught up’ in the process, when the event itself has become obscure, when its name is lost…” (p. 79). (Does this not look like another version of the categorical imperative that obligates the will independently of any material content)? Precisely in the way that Kant describes radical evil, Badiou too speaks of the human being falling from grace by betraying the formal imperative of consistency, by putting self-interest and self-love ahead of the immortal truth. Evil emerges for Badiou, not because of the effects of human action on others, but because of a disorder in the way the subject responds to a revelation of truth. Evil is measured in other words, not by what is done to others, that is, by the horrible suffering even well-intentioned men cause (that would smack too much of the ideology of rights for Badiou), but by failures in what Kant would call the subjective will. Badiou does not speak of freedom the way Kant does, but one would have to surmise that for him, this fall or swerve from the truth is freely undertaken: one willfully relaxes back in to the status quo, one gives up on one’s principles, and one chooses totalizing power and contingencies, rather than the concrete universality of truth. Evil represents a contamination of the purity of one’s insight, whether it is political, artistic, religious, or amatory. So, my claim here is that Badiou shares with Kant 1) a formalistic ethics grounded in a subjectivity transcending the ordinary universe of cause and effect and 2) a conception of evil that stems from false choices or from a will that deranges the primacy of truth. To this we can add another resemblance: 3) a non-gradualist approach to moral reform. For Kant, radical evil stems from the will’s original distorted ordering of incentives that puts self love ahead of a disinterested allegiance to the moral law. The only way to change that root orientation or propensity to sin in the human species is by an act of will. The gradual acquisition of virtue, for example, will not change the will since that acquisition itself could have “evil” motives. True virtue, for Kant, represents an efect and not a cause of a change of heart; it is the result of a pure resolution to stay true to the demands of reason and the moral law, come what may. Citing John 3:5, Kant says, “And so a ‘new man’ can come about only through a kind of rebirth, as it were a new creation and a change of heart.”10 From an empirical, phenomenal standpoint such a change is as utterly unpredictable, as inexplicable as evil itself. Badiou shares Kant’s belief that a commitment to truth requires a total transformation of the human subject and not a gradual reform. In an interview with Peter Hallward, the translator of his Ethics, Badiou uses words like “seizure,” “irruption,” and the “incalculable,” (109, 125), expressing his appreciation for the French Revolution and the Maoist Cultural Revolutions for their faithfulness to their truth events. Badiou has no patience for the detail work of legal and political institutions of liberal democracies that strive to bring about gradual reforms in the human condition. Rather, as Kant or indeed Kierkegaard does, Badiou seeks a conversion in being that makes man new in an instant, or at least in an instant places him on a righteous path. Elsewhere, Hallward notes that Badiou embraces what we could call the puritanical virtues of a dedicated revolutionary: &quot;Criteria of rectitude and 'purity' certainly play an important, perhaps fundamental, role in many aspects of Badiou's work.&quot; 11 For both Badiou and Kant, then, the emphasis is on the subject as an agent of moral good and evil. The sufering that is brought to the world as a consequence of the subject’s behavior is for both thinkers secondary. Thus, the absolute good or evil for Kant “could be only the maxim of the will and consequently the acting person himself as a good or evil person.”12 This is a crucial passage. We are still under its spell in modern ethics, as signaled by Maeve Cooke’s claim: “To be congruent with the normative self-understanding of late modernity, therefore, any account of moral evil must conceive moral disposition as something for which the individual subject ultimately has to bear responsibility.”13 This, however, sidesteps any account of moral evil as that which those who are in subjection have to bear, as though victims were merely contingent conditions, while vicious hearts were necessary conditions for the existence of evil. For the philosophy of the subject, evil lies somewhere in the intention or at least the in character of the evildoer and not in the abyss of suffering.<br />
