V-morality

Definition of ought

All morality has to recognize the construction of human identity. All choices act as a construction of human identity.
Christine Korsgaard (Harvard University). The Activity of Reason. Presidential Address – Eastern Division.
“In response, I… governed by rational standards”

The standard is respect of human worth for five reasons.

First, it is the only way to respect human identity. Korsgaard 2
“It is the conceptions… from reflective rejection”

Second, all ends based calculations are flawed, since ends are only conditional aspects relating back to the unconditional human rationality.
Immanuel Kant. Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals” translated by Thomas Abbott.
“The ends which… practically carried out”

Third, only deontology respects the basis of morals as being humanity. Korsgaard 3
“ask yourself what… of normative claims”

Fourth, desire-based theories fail because they are inherently circular.
Parfit. “Reasons and Motivations” Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes, Vol. 71, (1997), pp. 99-146   Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/4106956
“According to desire-based… happiness as an end”

Fifth, moral rules only exist if they apply to all actors.
Michael E. Bratman (Stanford University). The Sources of Normativity. International Phenomenological Society. Sep., 1998. JSTOR.
“In her fourth lecture… so Korsgaard claims”

I contend that the possession of nuclear weapons does not respect humans as ends. They are weapons of imperial control.

Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. Empire. Harvard University Press. 2000.
“Imperial control operates… the power of life”

The imperial insecurity causes rogue states.
Stephen Walt (professor of international affairs at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government), The Coming Crisis: Nuclear Proliferation, U.S. interests, and world order- ed. Victor A. Utgoff 2000, Pg 196

“by promising to… else can complain”

International law is based on decentralization and the ability for states to be bound in agreements and checks
[1] Hans J. Morgenthau, Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace (Boston: McGraw, 1993).
“the decentralized nature… objective social forces”

maintaining international legislation and rule of law promotes decentralization and state sovereingty.
Morgenthau 2.
“international law contains… it has consenting”

state sovereignty requires respect of international agreements in order to interact with other states
[1] Malcolm Nathan Shaw [Professor of International Law at the University of Leicester]. International Law. Cambridge University Press, 2003. Pg. 43.
“but the raison d’etre… of course, obligations”

the idea of national jurisdiction is increasingly problematic; the legal inadequacy of territoriality threatens to leave many problems unaddressed

The value is morality as ought is a moral obligation. The state is a moral agent due to its ability to act intentionally.
Thomas Donaldson. International Deontlogy defended: A response ot Russell Hardin. Published in Ethics and International Affairs 1995. Vol. 9. 
"similaryl, while we... satisfy this condition"

Any standard must be consistent with the higher framework of contractiarianism. Mutual agreements are the basis of morality. 
Gauthier, David P. Morals by Agreement. Oxford: Clarendon, 1986. Print.
"moral principles are... in their affairs"

Second, only contractarianism’s foundation is in the empirical fact that individuals have desires that they rationally pursue provides a non-circular origin for morality. Gauthier 2.
"a contractarian theory... morally neutral base"

Third, when promises exist, they change the moral relationship due to the voluntary acceptance of obligations 
H.L.A. Hart. Are there any natural rights? (in the anthology, contemporary political philosophy). PG 284-285. 2006.
"by promising to... else can complain"

The standard for the round is adherence to international legal obligations due to their basis in consensual agreements.
First, international law derives from nations’ consent.
Hans J. Morgenthau, Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace (Boston: McGraw, 1993).
"international law contains... it has consented"

Second, rules are required to define the way states interact. 
Malcolm Nathan Shaw [Professor of International Law at the University of Leicester]. International Law. Cambridge University Press, 2003. Pg. 43.
"bu the raison... of course obligations"

<span style="color: black;">I contend that disarmament is required by international legal agreements. The UN general assembly, which includes all recognized states, calls for disarmament.</span>

Link: The affirmative removes US nukes. The critique of nuclear weapons is directly designed to reduce US power.

Sovereignty NC

V - morality

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;">I value morality as ought prescribes a moral obligation. All rights claims are based in the community because all human rights claims are grounded in social interaction. Humans are not capable of moral rationality outside of the community.</span>

<span style="color: black;">The libertarian perspective… enhanced or diminished (for details, see Etzioni 1968a, 1988).</span>

Thus, the community of individuals is the only source of moral authority.

The moral process that the community allows reveals itself in the declarations of the state.

Brad R. Roth [Associate Professor of Political Science and Law, Wayne State University. J.D., Harvard Law School, 1987; LL.M., Columbia Law School, 1992; Ph.D., University of California, Berkeley, 1996.] COMMENTARY: THE ENDURING SIGNIFICANCE OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY. Florida Law Review December, 2004. 56 Fla. L. Rev. 1017 Lexis

<span style="color: black;"> Sovereignty takes on… be democratic about.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Thus, the affirmative burden is to prove that the non-possession of nuclear weapons is a requirement of state sovereignty. The community decision making of the state is the statement of morality through the citizens’ deliberation in the community.</span>

I contend that the possession of nuclear weapons is a statement of sovereignty.
