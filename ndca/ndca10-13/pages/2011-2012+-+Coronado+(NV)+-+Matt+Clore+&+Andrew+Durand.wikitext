cascade of meltdowns.Solar storms in 2013 –
Current storms are merely preludes to the “Big One”

Billings 1/23 (Lee, science journalist for Popular Mechanics citing John Kappenman, an engineer and expert in geomagnetic storm effects and Bogdan, “The Looming Threat of a Solar Superstorm”, [[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/deep/the-looming-threat-of-a-solar-superstorm-6643435|__http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/deep/the-looming-threat-of-a-solar-superstorm-6643435__]] EG)



Flares and CMEs from the Sun continued……. of $1 to $2 trillion in the first year alone.



But current space weather monitoring relies on aging warning systems – only DSCOVR solves


Billings 1/23 (Lee, Science journalist. His articles on the science and policy behind breakthrough work in astronomy, planetary science, astrophysics, and cosmology have appeared in publications such as Nature, New Scientist, Popular Mechanics, and Seed magazine. In February 2011, to coincide with the announcement of major discoveries from NASA’s planet-hunting Kepler mission, Lee was invited to contribute to BoingBoing.net. His blog posts over a two-week period accumulated around 350 on-site comments, delivered hundreds of thousands of page views, and spawned spin-off coverage in a host of other venues, including the Daily Mail, Wired Science, MSNBC.com, New Hampshire Public Radio, and NASA’s official Kepler homepage. From January 2006 to March 2011, Lee was a writer and editor for Seed magazine, where he produced content noted by outlets such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and Slate.com., The Looming Threat of a Solar Superstorm, [[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/deep/the-looming-threat-of-a-solar-superstorm-6643435|__http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/deep/the-looming-threat-of-a-solar-superstorm-6643435__]])


Until new layers of protection ….. and the Sun continues to seethe.


There is a bias against rationality – their epistemology is flawed

==**Kappler K - 1NC**== 
**The affirmative cedes the political sphere by asking: "what should the government do?" This focus on mega-spheres of action eclipses questions of what we would do if we were simply ourselves. This kills political activism, inculcating a spectator mentality and preventing change.**
**Kappeler 95** (Susanne, Associate Professor at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The politics of personal behavior, Pg. 10- 11)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yet </span>__our insight that indeed we are not__
__AND__
__structures and the values of war and violence.__

**Blaming cultural or structural causes for violence absolves people of individual responsibility and makes the problem worse.**
**Kappeler 95**(Susanne, Associate Professor at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The politics of personal behavior, Pg.2-4)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Violence is perceived as a phenomenon for science </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">that racist violence does indeed 'pay off.' </span>


**Surrendering ourselves to the state and abdicating personal responsibility makes extinction inevitable.**
**Beres, 94** (Louis Rene, Professor of International Law in the Department of Political Science at Purdue University, Spring,, Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law, Lexis)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">By surrendering ourselves to States and to traditional </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the most indelible badge of modern humankind. </span>


**Hence, our alternative: Vote Negative to reject the affirmative’s representations and re-conceive of violence as an issue of personal choice made by individuals.**

**This alternative is the best means of resolving violent conflict.**
**Kappeler 95**(Susanne, Associate Professor at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The politics of personal behavior, Pg.5-6)

__A politics aim in at a change in__
__AND__
__violence__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">and for a non-violent society. </span>

**Finally, we don't defend collective irresponsibility. We think EVERY individual has part in the violence- but the point is that we need to take responsibility for the one factor we actually control ourselves.**
**Kappeler 95**(Susanne, Associate Professor at Al-Akhawayn University, The Will to Violence: The politics of personal behavior, Pg. 10)

__We are the war does not mean__
__AND__
__decisions for such events are always made elsewhere.__
