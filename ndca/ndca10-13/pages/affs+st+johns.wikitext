The United States federal government should invest in the planning and completion of a national High-Speed Rail system.

===Contention One is Inherency=== 

Current forms of High Speed Rail have no consideration for the environment and ignores the interconnectedness of all parts of Nature
Eun-su 10 (Cho, Professor Seoul National University, Sociology and Feminism/Buddhism, The Lonely Eco-fight of Jiyul Sunim: The Green Resonance of a Humans and Salamanders, 2010.01.18, http://budd hism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/BDLM/toModule.do?prefix=/search&page=/search_detail.jsp?seq=219734)
This paper introduces and explores Jiyul Sunim~’s effort to protect nature and environment in Korea
AND
in the Nakdong River area are related to Buddhist conception of the body.


Transportation infrastructure has been the justification to consume nature this type of consumption is parralled to how we consume the women and the body 16^^th^^ century ship building perpetuated patriarchal ontology of consumption where by the environment is viewed as expendable this metaphor has been carried into modern globalization
Tickner 93 (J. Ann, , prof of IR @ USC, States and Markets: An Ecofeminist Perspective on International Political Economy, International Political Science Review / Revue internationale de science politique, Vol.14, No. 1, International Political Economy and the Global Environment, <62-63>, Jstor)
A nascent market economy and its need for an ever-expanding resource base,
AND
ecological traditions which were not able to withstand assimilation by the global economy.




===Contention Two=== 

Transportation accessibility and special displacement serves as a metaphor for understanding gendered dichotomies.
Perkin 07 Faculty of Environmental Studies, York University<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Patricia E., , "Feminist Ecological Economics and Sustainability" JOURNAL OF BIOECONOMICS Volume 9, Number 3 (2007))</span>
The journey-to-work strand of research made a major contribution to urban
AND
criticized by feminist theorists in other contexts. Pickup~’s framework also downplays constraints on
mobility which are located in gender relations outside the home, such as women~’s lower rates of pay and lower access to company cars.

This epistemology reinvigorates a public/private dichotomy where masculinity is placed in the public and femininity is suppressed in the private- this re-inscribes misogynist power relations
Peterson in 2000 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(V Spike, Associate Professor of Political Science @ Arizona, SAIS Review, 20.2, rereading public and private: the dichotomy that is not one, project muse)</span>
In the first variant, I read the public-private dichotomy as emphasizing the
AND
public-private even as they challenge the dichotomy~’s conventional boundaries in IR


This social organization of masculine over feminine justifies perpetual physical-psychological war and annihilation of difference- this is the root cause to their impacts
Irigaray 94<span class="cite">(Luce, Thinking the difference: for a peaceful revolution, pg 4-7)</span>
What does it mean for our entire culture to be threatened with destruction? There
AND
religious ones, destroying life seems to be as compulsory as giving life.




Scenario One is the Women - Nature Dyad

Women are excluded from Policy discourse and formation around issues of the environment –this results in ineffective and failed policy toward environmental catastrophe
Denton 02 (Fatima, senior energy planner with the United Nations Environment Program, author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and was also a member of UNEP~’s Scientific Technical Advisory Panel, PhD in political science and development studies from Birmingham University , Climate Change Vulnerability, Impacts, and Adaptation: Why Does Gender Matter?, 2002 <11-12>, Jstor)
Ignoring women~’s contribution to environmental resource management Women~’s absence from decision-making processes Women
AND
Leaders in Agriculture and Environment (AWLAE) came together partly to ensure that

The domination of women and control of nature are fundamentally connected. Patriarchy is based on the assumption that there is a split between ~’man~’ and nature, justifying nature as a commodity that must be controlled and subordinated. This ideology is what also devalues women.
McGuire in 2k3 (Cathleen and Colleen, eve online ecofeminist visions emerging, Ecofeminist Visions, http://eve.enviroweb.org/what_is/index.html)
Although there is no one "correct" ecofeminism, most ecofeminists would agree with
AND
rain cloud: sometimes miles away, other times hovering right over us.


Patriarchal control of women and nature has put us on the brink of extinction-only an openness to nature can reshape our relationship to the environment
McGuire in 2k3 <span class="cite">(Cathleen and Colleen, eve online ecofeminist visions emerging, Ecofeminist Visions, http://eve.enviroweb.org/what_is/index.html)</span>
The Western linear calendar declares the approach of the second millennium, obscuring the fact
AND
as sensitive, mature human beings in harmony with other animals and nature.


Environmental exploitation, pollution, nuclear proliferation and war are predicatable and logical under a masculine ontology.
Warren & Cady 1996<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> (Karen & Duane, "Feminism and Peace: Seeing Connections", Hypatia Volume: 9. Issue: 2, pp 4, DJ)</span>
Operationalized, the evidence of patriarchy as a dysfunctional system is found in the behaviors
AND
women-nature-peace connections in regional, national and global contexts.


===Contention 3 is Ecofeminism and political considerations=== 


Our ethic goes beyond the positive notions of the public sphere- an ethic of the private is key to the functionality and legitimacy of the state. Only through a permutation of the public and the private can we understand the deficits within the State and modernity
Peterson in 2000 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(V Spike, Associate Professor of Political Science @ Arizona, SAIS Review, 20.2, rereading public and private: the dichotomy that is not one, project muse)</span>
Gender-sensitive accounts go beyond this by bringing everyday practices, reproductive processes,
AND
is to impoverish our understanding of violence and the security questions it raises.
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Neglect of the private sphere</span>


AND, Our Standpoint epistemology of ecofeminism ensures solvency-it means that knowledge is reformulated not from the standpoint of the oppressor, but the oppressed. This is the only way to rupture violent relations of power— none of their offence will assumes our combination of standpoint and ecofeminist epistemology
Pandey in 2k6 <span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Anupam, thesis submitted to faculty of graduate studies and research in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctorate of philosophy department of political science Carleton university, forgin bonds with women, nature and the third world: an ecofeminist critique of international relations, proquest) <58-61></span>
Though ecofeminism shares the Marxist feminist commitment to an analysis of patriarchy and capitalism,
AND
between women and nature — it is not just ~’interaction~’ with nature.

AND, here~’s more evidence on our epistemic framework:

We rectify the epistemological deficits between the subject and object which is the key internal link to solving all forms of ecological and human crisis within modernity- all of their impacts should be held suspect—- they are a superficial way of dealing with crisis— the root of the problem resides within the relationship between humans and nature ====

This chapter has attempted to show the need to transcend a positivist epistemological base and
AND
meaningful and real stability and flourishing of humans and non-human others.

The adoption of certain epistemologies is not an innocent choice; it is the fundamental justification for allowing a white, male-centered view of public politics that justifies the oppression of marginalized groups- EcoFeminism solves this

Both traditional IR theory and its positivist basis have been soundly criticized for their shortcomings
AND
the key to understanding hierarchization, inegalitarianism and exploitation in relationships between humans.

Economic expansion and activity has its roots in the masculine exploitation of women, only through an Ecofeminist gendered analysis can we deconstruct western attitudes toward nature and women
Tickner 93 (J. Ann, , prof of IR @ USC, States and Markets: An Ecofeminist Perspective on International Political Economy, International Political Science Review / Revue internationale de science politique, Vol.14, No. 1, International Political Economy and the Global Environment, <61-62>, Jstor)
The State, the Market and Nature in Early Modern Europe The view that natural
AND
the practices of a capitalist world economy and an expansive Eurocentric state system.


===Contention 4 is Solvency=== 


We must symbolically and materially reject gender constructs which are based on masculine modalities which seek to fuse gender and genitals/ sociology and biology. These gendered social constructs are not natural and static but rather fluid, changeable and are a reflection of power-the 1AC is a metaphorical call to our castration
Mirkin 99 (Harris Ph.D., Princeton, retired Chair of Political Science at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, Associate Professor of Political Science Specialization: Political Philosophy, American Political Thought, and the Politics of Sex and Genders "The Pattern of Sexual Politics: Feminism, Homosexuality and Pedophilia" J.Homosex - appeared in Vol. 37, No. 2 (1999); http://www.ipce.info/ipceweb/Library/mirkin_text.htm)
As in all politics, in the sexual arena some groups are more privileged than
AND
constructions, while ``abuser~’~’ and ``molester~’~’ are used as natural categories.

Jesus and I propose that the United States federal government should invest in the planning and completion of a national High-Speed Rail system.

The United States federal government should invest in the planning and completion of a national transportation infrastructure review board modeled after the EuroFem Agency.

The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment in the planning and completion of a national High-Speed Rail system.
