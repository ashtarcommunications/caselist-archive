Instruction No. 10 was not given in…that the contract required.


**2. Our interpretation is best ---**

**A. Predictability --- ignoring the resolution opens up an infinite number of frameworks --- this undermines our ability to have in-depth research on their arguments destroying the value of debate.**

**B. Ground --- the resolution exists to create fair division of aff and neg ground --- any alternative framework allows the aff to pick a moral high ground that destroys neg offense.**

**C. Education --- academics must learn to engage the public’s line of thinking --- abstract moralism without addressing how to get our policies passed is useless.**
Jeffrey **Isaac**, Spring **2002**. Professor of Political Science at Indiana University. “Ends, Means, and Politics,” Dissent, http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=601.
What is striking about much of the… it undermines political effectiveness.


**3. Voting issue --- resolving the framework is a pre-condition for debate to occur.**

The requirements given thus…basic agreement or harmony.

When presented in this…investment in the railroad’s bonds.

**Prefer our interpretation –**
**1. Limits – they open the floodgates to dozens of small affs that have one private company work on the aff**
**2. Ground – they spike out of core neg arguments like spending, politics, and privatization**
**3. Extra-topicality is a voting issue – we can’t predict the different combinations of funding mechanisms that the aff could use to skew the debate in its favor**

The term “transport…vehicles and rolling stock.

**Violation – the plan increases ships which are vehicles**

**Prefer our interpretation –**
**1. Predictable Limits – they explode the topic – there are thousands of individual vehicle models and designs that we can’t prepare for**
**2. Grammatical Precision – forgetting about the word “infrastructure” when writing your aff means we prepare for drastically different interpretations of the topic**

**Satellites are communication infrastructure, not transportation infrastructure**
**IEDC 12** (International Economic Development Council, “Economic Development Reference Guide”, http://www.iedconline.org/?p=Guide_Infrastructure)

(A) IN GENERAL.--The term 'infrastructure'…waste disposal facility.

**Violation: the aff spends money on the military**

**Prefer our interpretation –**
**1. Ground – Military Affs require radically different DAs and CPs than public infrastructure – they create multiple topics worth of education.**
**2. Limits – They justify infinite number of small military projects.**


===**T - Maintenance**===

What has been neglected in…often squeezed, forcing neglect.

**B. Violation – the aff is a maintenance project – that’s distinct from maintenance**

**C. Voting Issue**
**1. Limits – there are dozens of small maintenance programs with an aff-biased lit base**
**2. Ground – Maintenance programs are much smaller, minimizing politics and spending links – they also come from different accounts killing tradeoff links**



===**T - Substantial**===

**Violation – the aff costs less than 556 billion dollars**

**Prefer our interpretation –**
**1. Ground – they can avoid of our spending, politics disads and tradeoff disads by saying the plan is too small to be perceived**
**2. Limits – allowing insubstantial affs unlimits the topic and justifies affs that create one road – the topic is already huge and we can’t be prepared to debate every minute aff**

**Violation – AFRICOM does not occur in the United States**

**Prefer our interpretation –**
**1. Grammatical Precision – forgetting about the word area of the infrastructure means we prepare for drastically different interpretations of the topic**

Generating energy from the ocean’s temperature variations, he added, is “a natural for Hawaii.” The Navy is also interested in the technology and in the next few months plans to award a contract to explore it, according to Whit DeLoach, a spokesman for the Naval Facilities Engineering Command. As of last year, he said, the Navy had spent slightly more than $1 million to research the technology for Diego Garcia. In the approach that Lockheed is pursuing (with another company, Makai Ocean Engineering), </span>__the water on the ocean’s surface is used to heat a pressurized liquid,__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> usually ammonia, </span>__which boils at a temperature slightly below that of warm seawater.

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**OTEC generates energy – solves warming by reducing emissions**</span>
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">**Barry 08**</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Christopher D., a naval architect and co-chair of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers ad hoc panel on ocean renewable energy. He has worked in design agencies, shipyards and manufacturers in the marine industry and in offshore oil exploration and currently works for the Coast Guard, “Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion and CO2 Sequestration,” July 1, 2008, Renewable Energy World, http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2008/07/ocean-thermal-energy-conversion-and-co2-sequestration-52762)</span>

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In economic terms, optimistic guesses at OTEC plant costs are in the range of a million dollars per MW. Since a kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated by coal produces about a kilogram of carbon dioxide, </span>a carbon tax of one to two cents per kWh might cover the capital costs of an OTEC plant in carbon credits alone. The equivalent in gasoline tax would be ten to twenty cents per gallon. With gasoline above three dollars per gallon and electricity above ten cents per kilowatt, these are not entirely unreasonable charges.
