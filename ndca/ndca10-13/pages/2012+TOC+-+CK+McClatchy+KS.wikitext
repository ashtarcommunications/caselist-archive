NEW AFFIRMATIVE

Plan: The United States federal government should guarantee to purchase and launch a substantial number of reusable launch vehicles beyond the Earth's mesophere.

Contention 1 is The Status Quo

The Space Launch System is NASA’s current plan for space – triggers politics and spending links, but doesn’t solve our aff

Contention 2 is Sounding Rockets

RLVs are key to sounding rocket missions in all scientific areas

Contention 3 is Launch Costs

Low launch costs are key to prevent extinction
