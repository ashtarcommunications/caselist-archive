I wake, I fall asleep
I bus to and from school
I walk in and out of my room
But sometimes I don’t even know where I am
Am I asleep, or am I awake, or are they really the same things?
Am I between school and home, or am I even awake?
My life is in constant transit – from one event to the next
From dream to bed to newspaper to school
But sometimes I never change location, just mind
Sometimes I sit down for ten minutes and change place hundreds of time
There is never a destination to my life – for when I get to a destination I am only at another stage in my journey
I go through a series of events
I wake up, fall back asleep
I begin to dream that I am in love with an Austrian girl
We sail the beautiful Mediterranean sea, touching upon France, Italy and Northern Africa
We make love and whisper to one another like we have nothing better to do, nowhere else to be
I wake up
I am in a car ride going to Gig Harbor to debate
I tell myself that the great journey of life brought me from here to Austria
And that while I am confined to this car, I can go anywhere through the transport of my mind
I know that my journey in Austria never ended
That it just continued in this red van
That im sitting here in the hot tomale
That my journey is never ending
That, when I arrive at Gig Harbor High School,
I am just continuing on my journey,
Just continuing my travel.
I am in love, I am out of love, I am within love.
I am speaking, thinking, in a room.
I see a face, a girl
Hair like spun gold
I feel her hand, even though It never touches mine
And I squeeze her small, pink fingers
As her cold, wet lips kiss my cheeks.
I blink. She’s gone.
But she was in my transit,
Just as you were in my heart.
Was I dreaming?
No. I was in transit.
My life is just a poem.
A journey of thought along lines.
I am sitting in a classroom at north seattle community college
Listening as we talk about what killed the dinosaurs
Turn to page 172, she says,
We each follow her, as we journey away from this brick prison
I go home, and go to Bangladesh
I am a prince
I walk to school
I am a prince
I see a woman. Large eyes, small ears.
I have not yet reached my destination.
My hair curls, It wavers, as a hand goes through
I am sense.
I am love, lots of love.
I am hope.
I am duckwall.
I am an octopus
I float freely, speaking, stinging, singing, staining
I lose two tentacles.
I am a sextapus.
If I lose one more tentacle, I will be NATO
Bodily fluids flow from NATO
To the large eyes I see in front of me
I am the Cold War
A body of proxy wars within
But I travel from proxy wars to NATO
I am a shot. I am love.
I am a thing of the past
The present
The future.
I travel from front to back, from line to line
Like a ghost on a journeey.
I am debate.
I travel from here to there.
I am down, depressed, angry.
Everything is the same, confined from travel.
I am a fluid organism, roaming.
I am part of one body, then the next, as I travel.
I am each season, as I run around the calendar over and over.
And as a poem comes to an end,
Another one is just beginning,
For a poem is never to end
Just to begin on another page from the same tree from the same mother,
Mother Nature.
(Poem written by Liam Donnelly)




**Dr. Seusss once said “Earth: you don’t have to be crazy to live here, but it helps.” It is thus that we affirm the resolution, that the United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States, through many lines of flight.**





**We are the clog in the machine.**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Deleuze and Guattary 72</span>** (Felix and Guilles, “[[http://i.imgur.com/BD3eK.png|Anti Oedipus]],” p 363-363, dw: 1972, lido)
**__What makes the schizophrenic__** **__ill,__** **__since the cause of the illness is not schizophrenia as a process? What transforms the breakthrough into a breakdown?__** It is the constrained arrest of the process, or its continuation in the void, or the way in which it is forced to take itself as a goal. **__We have seen in this sense how social production produced the sick schizo: constructed on decoded flows that constitute its profound tendency or its absolute limit, capitalism is constantly counteracting this tendency, exorcizing this limit by substituting internal relative limits for it that it can reproduce on an ever expanding scale, or an axiomatic of flows that subjects this tendency to the harshest forms of despotism and repression.__** It is in this sense that contradiction installs itself not only at the level of the flows that traverse the social field, but at the level of their libidinal investments, which form the flows' constituent parts-between the paranoiac reconstruction of the Urstaat and the positive schizophrenic lines of escape. Thereafter **__three possibilities emerge. First, the process is arrested, the limit of desiring-production is displaced, travestied, and now passes over into the Oedipal subaggregate. So the schizo is effectively neuroticized, and it is this neuroticization that constitutes his illness,__** for in any case neuroticization precedes neurosis, the latter being the result of the former. **__Or, second, the schizo resists neuroticization and oedipalization. Even the use of modern resources__**, the pure analytic scene, the symbolic phallus, structural foreclosure, and the name of the father **__do not succeed in "taking" on him__**. (Here again, in these modern resources, what a strange use is made of Lacari's discoveries-Lacan, who was the first on the contrary to schizophrenize the analytic field!) In this second case **__the process__**, confronted with a neuroticization that it resists, but that suffices to block it on all sides**__, is led to take itself as an end: a psychotic is produced who escapes the delegated repression properly speaking only to take refuge in primal repression, closing the body without organs around itself and silencing his desiring-machines. Catatonia rather than neurosis__**, catatonia rather than Oedipus and castration-but it is stilI an effect of neuroticization, a countereffect of one and the same illness. **__Or-the third case-the process sets to turning round in the void. Since it is now a process of deterritorialization, it can no longer search for and create its new land. Confronted with Oedipal reterritorialization__**-an archaic, residual, ludicrously restricted sphere-**__it will form still more artificial lands that__**, barring an accident, **__accommodate themselves in one way or another to the established order: the pervert__**. After all, Oedipus was already an artificial sphere, 0 family! And the resistance to Oedipus, the return to the body without organs was still an artificial sphere, 0 asylum! **__So that everything is perversion. But everything is psychosis and paranoia as well, since everything is set in motion by the counterinvestment of the social field that produces the psychotic. Again, everything is neurosis, since it is an outcome of the neuroticization that runs counter to the process. Finally, everything is process, schizophrenia as process, since it is against schizophrenia that everything is measured; its peculiar trajectory, its neurotic arrests, its perverse continuations in the void, its psychotic finalizations.__**


**We will now read the following passage from “Talking Abstinence**”: <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(By [[http://i.imgur.com/BD3eK.png|Tara Leonard]]. Dw: 1995. Ask for pamphlet during round.)</span>

**__<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Congragulations on your decision to wait to have sex. You’re not along – it’s a choice that many teens are making. And remember, even if you’ve had sex before, it’s never too late to choose abstinence. Sometimes talking about waiting can be tough. It’s ok to feel scared or shy. (Your partner may too!) These tips will help you get started.</span>__**
**<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">__Plan Fun Alternatives: Find new, romantic ways to show you care! Have a picnic, go to concerts, trade class rings, get creative! Plan group activities with family and friends. Relax and enjoy each other without the pressure of sex.__ </span>**

**<span style="font-size: 10pt;">That little snippet is key – we must destroy sexuality everywhere </span>**
**<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Deleuze and Guattary 72</span>** (Felix and Guilles, “[[http://i.imgur.com/BD3eK.png|Anti Oedipus]],” p 293-294, dw: 1972, lido)
**__The truth is that sexuality is everywhere: the way a bureaucrat fondles his records<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, a judge administers justice, a businessman causes money to circulate; the way the bourgeoisie fucks the proletariat; and so on. And there is no need to resort to metaphors, any more than for the libido to go by way of metamorphoses. Hitler </span>__****__got the fascists sexually aroused. Flags, nations, armies, banks get a lot of people aroused. A revolutionary machine is nothing if it does not acquire at least as much force as these coercive machines have for producing breaks and mobilizing flows.__** It is not through a desexualizing extension that the libido invests the large aggregates. On the contrary, **__it is through a restriction, a blockage, and a reduction that the libido is made to repress its flows in order to contain them in the narrow cells of the type__** "couple," "family," "**__person__**," "**__objects__**." And doubtless such a blockage is necessarily justified: the libido does not come to consciousness except in relation to a given body, a given person that it takes as object. **__But our "object choice" itself refers to a conjunction of flows of life and of society that this body and this person intercept, receive, and transmit, always within a__** biological, **__social, and historical field where we are equally immersed or with which we communicate.__** The persons to whom our loves are dedicated, including the parental persons, intervene only as points of connection, of disjunction, of conjunction of flows whose libidinal tenor of a properly unconscious investment they translate. **__Thus no matter how well grounded the love blockage is, it curiously changes its function, depending on whether it engages desire in the Oedipal impasses of the couple and the family in the service of the repressive machines, or whether on the contrary it condenses a free energy capable of fueling a revolutionary machine.__** (Here again, everything has already been said by Fourier, when he shows the two contrary directions of the "captivation" or the "mechanization" of the passions.) **__But we always make love with worlds. And our love addresses itself to this libidinal property of our lover, to either close himself off or open up to more spacious worlds, to masses and large aggregates.__** There is always something statistical in our loves, and something belonging to the laws of large numbers. And isn't it in this way that we must understand the famous formula of Marx?-the relationship between man and woman is "the direct, natural, and necessary relation of person to person." That is, the relationship between the two sexes (man and woman) is only the measure of the relationship of sexuality in general, insofar as it invests large aggregates (man and man)? Whence what came to be called the species determination of the sexuality of the two sexes. And must it not also be said that the phallus is not one sex, but sexuality in its entirety, which is to say the sign of the large aggregate invested by the libido, whence the two sexes necessarily derive, both in their separation (the two homosexual series of man and man, woman and woman) and in their statistical relations within this aggregate?

=NEGATIVE= 
===Just right spec 1NC=== 
A. Interpretation: The affirmative must specify just the right amount - they can't over specify, but they also can't under specify
B. Violation – One of two things MUST be true:
The Affirmative fails to specify an agent of action. Rather they just say “USFG”
OR
The Affirmative over specified their actor, resolution calls for USFG - this is a voter because they can get out of links to Disads and CP's based on our agent.

C. Impacts
1. Failure to specify is illegitimate and a voting issue.
Ground – Specifying an agent is critical to Disads relating to the specific agent of action and Counterplans to use a different agent. The agent must be named in the plan to ensure that Counterplans compete and to maximize the value of pre-round preparation, which is essential at the beginning of the year when strategies are not fully developed.
Moving Target – Failure to specify an agent in the plan text allows the affirmative to shift out of 1NC arguments by allowing new 2AC clarification about the agent of action. This makes it impossible for the negative to debate because the AFF could always change their plan after they heard the 1NC arguments.
2. Overspecifying is ALSO a voting issue: they can get out of links to Disads and CP's based on our agent.
