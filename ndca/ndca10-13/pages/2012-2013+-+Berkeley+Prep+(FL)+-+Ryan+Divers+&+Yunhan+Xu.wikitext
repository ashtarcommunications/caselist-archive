===1ac plan=== 

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The United States federal government should substantially increase transportation infrastructure __[[#|loans]]__ in the United States commensurate with establishment of an independent government-owned National Infrastructure Bank.</span>

===1ac growth=== 

Advantage One is Growth:
Slow growth will persist – it’s the cause – not the consequence – of the economic crisis – reforming policy process is key
Coyne 9-13 (Andrew Coyne, Canadian political columnist, former editor of Maclean’s, former editor of __[[#|Globe and Mail]]__, __[[#|winner]]__ of 2 National Newspaper Awards, M.A. Economics, London __[[#|School of Economics]]__, B.A. Economics and History, __[[#|University of]]__ Trinity __[[#|College]]__, __[[#|University]]__ of Toronto, “What if slow growth wasn’t a result, but the cause of the crisis?” The __[[#|Vancouver Sun]]__, 9-13-2012, [[http://www.vancouversun.com/business/What+slow+growth+wasn+result+cause+crisis/7236500/story.html]])
It has become a cliché: the __[[#|new]]__ normal. Indeed, so accustomed have
AND
on.¶ It’s not quite the light bulb. But it’s a __[[#|start]]__.

Only the plan makes federal spending effective enough to raise growth rates
Cooper 9-12 (Donna Cooper, Senior Fellow with the Economic Policy team at the Center for American Progress, former deputy mayor for policy for the city of Philadelphia, former secretary of policy and planning for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; Kristina Costa, Research Assistant in Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress; Keith Miller, intern with the Economic Policy team at the Center for American Progress, __[[#|student]]__ at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute; “Creating a National Infrastructure Bank and __[[#|Infrastructure Planning]]__ Council: How Better Planning and __[[#|Financing]]__ Options Can Fix Our Infrastructure and Improve Economic Competitiveness,” Center for American Progress, September 2012, [[http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/InfrastructureBankReport.pdf]])
Infrastructure forms the foundation of the U.S. economy. Without highways,
AND
past time for us to stop neglecting the very foundation of our economy.

Otherwise, slow growth will collapse the structural determinants of cooperative international relations
Khalilzad 11 (Zalmay Khalilzad, counselor at the Center for Strategic and International __[[#|Studies]]__, former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United Nations, former director of policy planning at the Defense Department, Ph.D. __[[#|University]]__ of Chicago, M.A., B.A. __[[#|American University]]__ of Beirut, “The Economy and National Security,” National Review Online, 2-8-2011, http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/259024/economy-and-national-security-zalmay-khalilzad?)
Today, economic and fiscal trends pose the most severe long-term threat to
AND
leading the world toward a __[[#|new]]__, dangerous era of multi-polarity.

This provides a structural filter to the probability AND magnitude of all transnational threats and scenarios for nuclear conflict – determines the limits of institutional manageability
Harris & Burrows 9 (Mathew Harris, counselor of the U.S. National Intelligence Council (NIC), Ph.D. European History, __[[#|Cambridge University]]__; and Jennifer Burrows, member of the NIC’s Long Range Analysis Unit; “Revisiting the Future: Geopolitical Effects of the __[[#|Financial Crisis]]__,” The Washington Quarterly, April 2009, [[https://csis.org/files/publication/twq09aprilburrowsharris.pdf]])
Wider Ramifications of an Enduring Global Financial Crisis The report’s 30,000 ft.
AND
frustrated and the current benefits they derive from a globalizing world turn negative.

Slow growth also ensures any transition is violent
Goldstein 7 (Avery Goldstein, Professor of Global Politics and International Relations, __[[#|University]]__ of Pennsylvania, “Power transitions, institutions, and China's rise in East Asia: Theoretical expectations and evidence,” [[@http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=t713636064|Journal of Strategic Studies]], Volume[[@http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=t713636064~tab=issueslist~branches=30#v30|30]], Issue [[@http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g780703608|4 & 5, ]]August 2007, p.639-682)
Two closely related, though distinct, theoretical arguments focus explicitly on the consequences for
AND
the period prior to the __[[#|possible]]__ crossover.19 pg. 647-650


===1ac elections=== 

Advantage Two is Elections:
__[[#|Obama]]__ will __[[#|win]]__ – consensus of statistical models, polls, and Romney campaign implosion – but continuing economic concerns ensure a slim margin of victory
Klein 9-17 (Ezra Klein, “The Romney campaign is in trouble,” Washington Post, 9-17-2012, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/17/romney-is-behind-and-the-debates-arent-likely-to-save-him/)
There are two sure signs a campaign is in trouble. The first is that
AND
crack under the pressure, then that comeback becomes that much less likely.

__[[#|Slim]]__ victory means small Congressional gains – more models and polls – but a majority is still possible – races will be down to the wire
Kondik 9-20 (Kyle Kondik, House Editor, Sabato’s Crystal Ball, “House Battle at Relative Standstill, but Watch Generic Ballot,” 9-20-2012, http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/house-battle-at-relative-standstill/)
After shuffling many of our House ratings, it’s pretty obvious that the race for
AND
Democrats en masse, the trend will probably pop up in that number.

Passing an infrastructure bank gives him a mandate – perceived as prioritizing job creation over austerity
Jones 12 (Forrest Jones, citing Robert Reich, economist, former U.S. Secretary of Labor, and professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, “Reich: Obama’s Campaign Message Falling Short,” Money News, 4-23-2012, http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/Reich-Obama-Campaign-Message/2012/04/23/id/436699)
President Barack __[[#|Obama]]__ can lose to likely challenger Mitt Romney if he sticks with his
AND
Buffett who championed the idea, failed to push through in the Senate.

Two internal links to Congressional control:

First is coat-tails – a win on a popular jobs plan is the only way the Democrats can retake the majority
Silver 12 (Nate Silver, statistician and political analyst, editor of FiveThirtyEight.com, accurately predicted 49 of 50 states in the 2008 presidential election, named one of the World’s 100 Most Influential People in 2009 by Time Magazine, studied at the London School of Economics, A.B. economics, University of Chicago, former high school debater, “Do Democrats Have a Shot at the House?” FiveThirtyEight blog, New York Times, 6-23-2012, http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/do-democrats-have-a-shot-at-the-house/)
Taken as a whole, the set of special elections might suggest that races for
AND
just on __[[#|the general]]__ principle of long uncertainty early in a political cycle.

__[[#|The bank]]__ has broad public support – best data proves
Likosky 11 (Michael Likosky, Senior Fellow at New York University’s Institute for Public Knowledge, formerly a tenured law professor at the University of London and former Markle Foundation Fellow at Oxford University, an expert to the United Nations and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, he actively advises intergovernmental organizations, governments, investors, major broadcasters, public interest groups, and labor unions, “Bipartisanship Post-Labor-Day: P3s and a National Infrastructure Bank,” Huffington Post, 8-29-2011, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-likosky/bipartisanship-postlabor-_b_939966.html)
We can expect proposals in the coming weeks aiming for a domestic economic surge,
AND
support, even if we differ -- often sharply -- on specific projects.

Second is economic stewardship – passing an infrastructure bank is key to reverse perceptions of Democratic irresponsibility
Meyerson 11 (Harold Meyerson, political columnist for the Washington Post, “Obama Flips the 2012 deck,” The Washington Post, 5-4-2011, http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/for_2012_a_reversal_of_obamas_selling_points/2011/05/03/AFhZRQiF_story.html?nav=emailpage)
Take Obama's success in killing bin Laden, add to it Bush's decision to wage
AND
on the economy. Obama (or is that McCain?) for president.

This will be the key issue in Congressional elections – and Republicans are already playing it to their advantage
__[[#|Jackson]]__ 12 (Henry C. Jackson, Associated Press, “Veteran House Dems gear up for competitive races,” CNS News, 7-10-2012, http://cnsnews.com/news/article/veteran-house-dems-gear-competitive-races)
For Rep. Lois Capps of California and other vulnerable House Democrats, a string
AND
: Retire and avoid a grueling campaign, or buckle down and fight.

Our internal link is backed by quantitative research and accounts for demographics – a new strategy for growth is key
Teixeira & Halpin 11 (Ruy Teixeira, Senior Fellow at both the Century Foundation and the Center for American Progress, guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, where he has directed projects on the political demography of battleground states, Ph.D., sociology, University of Wisconsin-Madison; and John Halpin, Senior Fellow and co-director and creator of the Progressive Studies Program at the Center American Progress, former senior associate at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, providing strategic guidance and public opinion research for political parties and candidates, M.A. political science, University of Colorado, Boulder, B.A. Georgetown University; “The Path to 270: Demographics Versus Economics in the 2012 Presidential Election,” 11-22-2011, http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/11/path_to_270.html)
With a little under one __[[#|year]]__ to go before the 2012 presidential election, next
AND
-class voters in 2010, then they are likely to emerge victorious.

Specifically, this is the only scenario for a Democratic majority
Kraushaar 12 (Josh Kraushaar, executive editor of National Journal Hotline, former editor of House Race Hotline, former political reporter for Politico, “Working-Class Whites a Barrier to a Democratic House,” National Journal, 6-20-2012, http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/against-the-grain/working-class-whites-a-barrier-to-a-democratic-house-20120620)
Former House Speaker Tip O’Neill famously remarked that all politics is local. But this
AND
. Because what’s good for the goose isn’t necessarily good for the gander.

Single-party control is the only way to break gridlock
Spaeth 12 (Michael Spaeth, citing congressional scholars Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein, “Michael Spaeth: Continued gridlock,” The Michigan Daily, 7-22-2012, http://www.michigandaily.com/opinion/michael-spaeth-continued-gridlock?page=0,0)
Even though the Democratic and Republican National Conventions are over a month away, there’s
AND
White House, the Senate or the House, the gridlock will continue.

That’s key to sustain foreign policy effectiveness – prevents multiple scenarios for escalating global instability and conflict
Flournoy 9-4 (Michèle A. Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense for policy, “Sustaining American Leadership Abroad,” in A Symposium: Democratic Advice for Obama's Second Term, The Wall Street Journal, 9-4-2012, [[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444914904577619742199611900.html]])
In a second term, President Obama should double down on the big national security
AND
to forge a postelection consensus on a pragmatic way forward here at home.

__[[#|Effective leadership]]__ provides a vital political filter to the probability AND magnitude of all transnational threats and scenarios for conflict
Hirsh 11 (Michael Hirsh, former foreign editor and chief correspondent for Newsweek, “The End of the American Interlude,” http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-end-of-the-american-interlude-20111215)
Welcome to the future. What we are witnessing, at G-20 meetings
AND
__[[#|new]]__ destabilizers such as cyberwarfare are rising—conflict is much more likely.

Our impact is reverse causal – effective leadership controls all conflict escalation
Kagan 12 (Robert Kagan, M.A. Harvard University, Ph.D. American University, The World America Made, p.65-68, 2-7-2012, googlebook)
The unusual combination of vast power and remarkable global acceptance of that power is the
AND
might pursue more ambitious policies because war would be a more viable option.

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Anyone who travels abroad can see that </span>the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>no longer has a world-class infrastructure<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. And </span>there’s hard evidence to back up that<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> impression</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The World Economic Forum</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> compiles a massive annual “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Global Competitiveness Report</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.” The 2012-2013 edition </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">finds</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has fallen well behind</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> many members of </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the E</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">uropean </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nion, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Canada, and Asian countries</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> such as Singapore, Japan, and South Korea in the overall quality of its infrastructure. We rank 18th in railroads, 19th in ports, 20th in roads, 30th in airports, and 33rd in the quality of our electrical system. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> An outstanding new report from the Building America’s Future Educational Fund explains why this has happened. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Relative to our economic competitors, </span>we have no national<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> infrastructure </span>planning<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, we </span>systematically underfund<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> infrastructure </span>investments, and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> we </span>fail to use rigorous measures of evaluation<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and accountability for the projects we do manage to fund. This makes for a drag on our economy</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. One example: in 2010, Americans spent a total of 4.8 billion hours stuck in traffic, wasting 1.9 billion gallons of fuel, at a total cost of $101 billion. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span>And it will only get worse<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. According to the Building America’s Future report, by 2020, every American port will be struggling to cope with at least twice the tonnage it was designed to handle. While a projected 94 percent of the nation’s economic growth will occur in metropolitan areas, these jurisdictions are already home to “the most congested highways, the oldest roads and bridges, and the most overburdened transit systems,” with no relief in sight. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The report warns that “if we don’t create a transportation system that functions reliably and cost-effectively</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in the 21st century, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">companies operating in this globalized world can simply choose to do their business elsewhere</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.” </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But before it comes to that, the American economy will pay a steep price</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Another report, from the American Society of Civil Engineers, lays out the projected costs, sector by sector. Here’s the bottom line: by 2020, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if the mounting investment gap in infrastructure is not addressed, “the economy is expected to lose almost $1 trillion in business sales, resulting in a loss of 3.5 million jobs . . . the cumulative cost to the U.S. economy will be more than $3.1 trillion in GDP and $1.1 trillion in total trade</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.” </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> These numbers would appear large enough to arrest the attention of even the most jaded policy makers. This has not happened. Instead, current fiscal trends and policies portend a long-term squeeze on domestic discretionary spending—the pool of funds from which federal infrastructure investment is drawn. Innovative plans for federal government partnerships with the private sector to leverage scarce public resources have not gone forward in some instances and have fallen well short of adequate scope in others. While things have gone better at the state and metropolitan levels, </span>aggregate investment continues to fall far short of needs—by a<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">n estimated </span>$<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">1.1 </span>trillion<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> between now and 2020, according to ASCE projections. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As the Building America’s Future report observes, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">most of </span>our global competitors have access to infrastructure banks<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that attract private capital to fund major projects</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A recent</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Brookings </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">report</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> has </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">proposed</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> one model for </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">such a bank in the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates. (There are several others.) Sound </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">proposals to break through the current impasse in infrastructure funding are not hard to find. It has proved much more difficult to mobilize elected officials and average citizens around plans</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> that will require higher taxes and fees upfront in return for a stronger economy and better quality of life down the road. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> One of the key tests of democratic self-government is each generation’s ability to overcome chronological myopia and provide for the future that its children and grandchildren will enjoy. Throughout history, Americans have found a way to do that—from the canals and roadways of the early 19th century to the Civil War-era Transcontinental Railroad to Theodore Roosevelt’s Inland Waterways Commission to FDR’s bridges, tunnels, and airports that put millions back to work during the Great Depression, to Dwight Eisenhower’s visionary Interstate Highway System, begun in the 1950s and still benefitting the nation two generations later. It remains to be seen whether today’s Americans will muster the will and resources to do as well for their posterity. </span>

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The lifeblood of America’s economy passes through</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> our ports – everyday, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">trains, trucks,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">barges and ships</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> move goods into, around, and through our ports </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to meet the commercial</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and military needs of the Nation</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Ports receive shipments from farms and factories</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> destined for markets throughout the world. Goods flow from factories in Europe, South</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> America, and the Far East through our ports on the way to factories and stores throughout</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the country. Petroleum, chemicals, and raw materials move across the oceans through</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> our ports to reach U.S. industries.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The seas and rivers, ports and terminals and their nearby transportation links, and interstate</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> rail, road, and marine highway systems are the critical and intertwined transportation</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> network that “delivers the goods.” Containers, bulk, breakbulk, neo-bulk, project</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> cargo, automobiles and trucks, and petroleum and other bulk liquids all flow through</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> our transportation system that begins at our Nation’s ports. Such a system requires an</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> advanced and sophisticated network of not only ports and terminals, but fleets of trucks,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> rail cars, and barges to carry this cargo to the customer and to fuel our economy. It also</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> requires highly trained personnel both ashore and afloat. And it needs support services</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and industries to keep the network up and running. A failure of any one of these parts</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> prevents the efficient functioning of the rest of the system.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As our economy has become interdependent on the global economy</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">GDP</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">) </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has grown exponentially</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This global interdependence among trading nations has brought prosperity, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">but has also placed additional demands on</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> our ports and </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the end-to-end delivery system of imports and exports that are so vital to America’s economic growth and our role as the world’s leading economic power</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Although foreign trade accounted for only 13 percent of U.S. GDP in 1990, it grew to nearly 22 percent by 2006. Recent projections indicate that foreign trade will be equivalent to 35 percent of GDP by 2020 and may grow to 60 percent in 2030. As foreign trade continues to grow, marine transportation will become even more important to our economy. Approximately 90 percent of America’s overseas foreign trade tonnage is moved by ship. And, America’s network of waterways moves more than 2.3 billion tons of domestic and foreign cargo each year.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The transportation network that serves our economy also benefits our national defense. The </span>movement of military<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and related </span>traffic essential to national security relies heavily on our commercial transportation system<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Ports moving commercial and consumer goods also move </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">military equipment </span>and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> supplies that </span>enable the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>to project its power anywhere in the world<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. </span>Robust intermodal connections are necessary to support<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the flow of </span>global commerce and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the </span>deployment of military forces<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Only focused, sustained attention to both business and military needs will allow for a truly seamless, integrated intermodal freight transportation system</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Until recently, additional capacity demands could be met because there was always a way to build another terminal or add another highway lane. That is no longer the case. Today, our Nation’s ports and </span>intermodal systems face a growing capacity crunch<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> We are </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">confronted with capacity stretched to its limits, aging and </span>decaying infrastructure<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, multiple demands for land </span>and high<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> construction </span>costs<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. And </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">when </span>a problem<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> occurs in one part of the system, it </span>can have a ripple effect throughout the entire<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> waterborne and surface transportation </span>network<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Today, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is an urgent need to address congestion’s systemic challenges. Although ports and their intermodal connections are continually making improvements, </span>any benefits can be quickly offset by<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the </span>rapid<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> pace of </span>growth in shipments and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the relatively </span>slow<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and often daunting process of </span>financing<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and constructing </span>new infrastructure<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Clearly, there is a need to better manage the transportation process “end to end.” We must improve efficiency, reliability and cost savings and provide environmentally sustainable world class service to customers. But the decisions of today and tomorrow are much more complex than they were 20 or 30 years ago.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Now, transportation decision makers in metropolitan planning organizations, cities, individual states and the Federal government must consider not only the “why” and “how” of infrastructure needs, but also their impact on the environment, local communities and quality of life of future generations.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Given the enormity and breadth of these challenges, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is imperative that the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">adopt a truly national freight transportation policy</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. We must </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ensure the efficient movement of goods in the domestic and global supply chains while promoting a productive and competitive U.S. economy and addressing national defense needs</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In order to accomplish these goals, individual stakeholders, as well as individual segments of the transportation system, must no longer stand alone but attain full integration into the overall solution. The Nation’s ports should serve as the focal point for present and future efforts.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> America’s Ports and Intermodal Transportation System</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In the past, transportation management, planning, and funding were often viewed from an individual modal perspective, such as rail, road, and marine transportation. But today’s transportation decisions are far more complex and require a system-wide perspective. The benefits are clear. With a nationwide understanding of common problems and agreement on broad goals for the way forward, ports, governments and the private sector will be better able to collaborate to achieve solutions to improve our Marine Transportation System and freight movement. The Maritime Administration is committed to this effort and to working with our stakeholders to ensure the Nation’s ability to move goods and people, meet military needs and support and grow our economy.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> To move forward and facilitate consensus among the various interests serving the Nation’s transportation system, the Maritime Administration prepared this report, “America’s Ports and Intermodal Transportation System.” The Report identifies key system-wide findings and challenges in the vital strategic areas of end-to-end freight shipments, water access, ports, terminals and landside access and interstate rail and highways. The Report also discusses significant institutional challenges including governance, the role of private industry, financing the transportation system and infrastructure development.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Report’s primary goal is to ensure that the entire Marine Transportation System develops capacity in concert with other transportation modes. For example, a port that increases its capacity “inside the gate,” with no corresponding improvements in the approach channels, intermodal connectors and rail, road and marine highway corridors that serve it, will realize little overall system gains. The Report’s findings and recommendations will help ensure that the U.S. port system can effectively and efficiently respond to the challenges of future growth in freight shipments in the coming years and support our Nation’s needs.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Report is also fully aligned with the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Strategy to Reduce Congestion on America’s Transportation Network. The Department of Transportation recognizes that congestion across all transportation modes continues to limit the predictable, reliable, and efficient movement of people and goods, and poses a serious threat to continued economic growth. Since 2006, there have been several Department-wide efforts to address congestion at our Nation’s gateways and on our highway corridors, bridges, and roads. Four of these initiatives support the Report’s recommendations and are discussed throughout this analysis:</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Reduce bottlenecks at major freight gateways, including Southern California;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Develop new interstate highway and rail capacity through a</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> “Corridors of the Future” concept;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Encourage states to consider enacting public-private partnership laws; and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Implement technological and operational improvements.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As summarized here and explained further throughout this Report, a focus on three areas – Deep Water Access, Ports and Terminals, and Interstate Corridors – as well as on institutional challenges, will help to achieve national objectives to reduce congestion and improve transportation infrastructure.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> III. The Marine Transportation System</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Transportation is a system of systems, an integrated network, not just within the United States, but also around the world. Our domestic network must operate seamlessly in order to keep America competitive in the global transportation and logistics network. Ports have become the nexus of that system.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Nation’s port system is made up of thousands of large, medium, and small terminals and intermodal facilities in approximately 360 commercial sea and river ports. More than just facilities for loading and off-loading cargo, they are a great engine of economic growth. A recent study reported by the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) found that in 2006, U.S. deep-draft seaports and seaport-related businesses generated approximately 8.4 million American jobs and added nearly $2 trillion to the economy. But their success story does not end there.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Ports are not limited to working with just the maritime sector. According to the AAPA, port authorities may also have jurisdiction over airports, bridges, tunnels, commuter rail systems, inland river or shallow draft barge terminals, industrial parks, Foreign Trade Zones, world trade centers, terminal or short-line railroads, ship repair, shipyards, dredging, marinas and other public recreational facilities. Ports may also undertake community or regional economic development projects beyond those directly benefiting the port itself.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> However, ocean port operations are decentralized and governed by local port authorities that may or may not own and/or operate significant portions of the port. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There is</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> also </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">little coordination of port operation at the Federal level and, thus, ports compete for both business and government funding to maintain and improve infrastructure</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.1</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Distribution centers receive international containers (typically 20, 40, or 45 foot lengths) from ports, re-allocate the contents, and then re-pack the freight in 53 foot domestic truckloads to be moved to their ultimate destinations. Thousands of distribution centers have emerged in near-port areas and at key transportation nodes, further constraining capacity and prompting the call for new and innovative models to speed the movement of freight to and from our major container ports.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> With over 85 percent of our Nation’s containerized freight flowing through 10 ports, and projections for continued increases in containerized foreign trade, there is great pressure on our port and intermodal system to use capacity more efficiently. The following pages briefly describe these 10 ports. Appendix 1 also provides a listing of major U.S. port and terminal facilities.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Top 10 Ports in the U.S.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Los Angeles</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Los Angeles is located in San Pedro Bay, just 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, California. According to 2007 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, the Los Angeles metropolitan statistical area, with a population of 12.9 million people, ranked second in the country behind only New York. The port encompasses 7,500 acres, 43 miles of waterfront and features 27 cargo terminals, including dry and liquid bulk, container, breakbulk, automobile and Omni facilities.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2007, the port ranked first in terms of container volume moving nearly 5.7 million TEUs (loaded). This accounted for over 39 percent of the container traffic on the West Coast and 18.6 percent nationally. From 2002-2007, container traffic increased by 22 percent at the port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overall, more than 77 million metric tons of international waterborne cargo flowed through the port in 2007. While imports accounted for 79 percent of the total foreign trade by volume, they also accounted for 87 percent of the value. On average, over 212,000 tons of cargo moved through the port daily in 2007, with the top five commodities consisting of petroleum, iron and steel, heavy machinery, furniture and plastics.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Long Beach</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Long Beach is also located in San Pedro Bay, California and also serves a population of 12.9 million people. The port encompasses 3,200 acres and features 10 piers, 80 berths and 71 Post-Panamax cranes. Facilities include dry and liquid bulk, container, breakbulk, and Roll-on/Roll-Off (RO/RO).</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2007, the port ranked second in terms of container volume moving over five million TEUs (loaded). This accounted for over 34 percent of the container traffic on the West Coast and 17 percent nationally. Volumes actually increased slightly at Long Beach in 2007 (four percent). Over the last five years, container traffic has increased by nearly 61percent at the port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overall, more than 38 million metric tons of international waterborne cargo flowed through the port in 2007. While imports accounted for 45 percent of the total foreign trade by volume, they also accounted for 70 percent of the value. On average, over 105,000 tons of cargo moved through the port daily in 2007, with the top five commodities consisting of petroleum, wood pulp, iron and steel, plastics, and heavy machinery.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of New York/New Jersey</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of New York/New Jersey is a bi-state port located on the East Coast of the U.S. With a population of 18.8 million people, the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area ranked as the most populated in the country. The port features seven cargo terminals, 54 container cranes and three cruise ship terminals. Facilities include dry and liquid bulk, container, breakbulk, and RO/RO.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2007, the port ranked third in terms of container volume moving nearly 3.9 million TEUs (loaded). This accounted for 33 percent of the container traffic on the East Coast and 13 percent nationally. Since 2003, container traffic has increased by over 30 percent at the port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overall, more than 80 million metric tons of international waterborne cargo flowed through the port in 2007. While imports accounted for 78 percent of the total foreign trade by volume, they also accounted for 75 percent of the value. On average, almost 220,000 tons of cargo moved through the port daily in 2007, with the top five commodities consisting of petroleum, salt and stone, wood pulp, iron and steel and beverages.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Savannah</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Savannah is located in Georgia. The City of Savannah has a population of 329,000. The port encompasses 1,400 acres and includes container, breakbulk, and RO/RO facilities.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2007, the port ranked fourth in terms of container volume moving nearly two million TEUs (loaded). This accounted for 17 percent of the container traffic on the East Coast and seven percent nationally. Since 2003, container traffic has increased by more than 79 percent at the port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overall, more than 33 million metric tons of international waterborne cargo flowed through the port in 2007. Imports accounted for 60 percent of the total foreign trade by volume and 63 percent of the value. On average, almost 92,000 tons of cargo moved through the port daily in 2007, with the top five commodities consisting of petroleum, salt and stone, wood pulp, paper products, and plastics.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Hampton Roads</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Virginia Port Authority oversees four general cargo terminals: Norfolk International Terminals, Portsmouth Marine Terminal, Newport News Marine Terminal and the Virginia Inland Port in Front Royal. All of the terminals are operated by the Virginia Port Authority’s</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> affiliate, Virginia International Terminals, Inc. The Norfolk area, with a population of approximately 1.7 million people, was ranked 34th in the country in 2007.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2007, Hampton Roads was ranked fifth in terms of container volume moving nearly1.6 million TEUs (loaded), accounting for 13 percent of the container traffic on the East Coast and five percent nationally. Since 2003, container traffic has increased by more than 43 percent at this port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overall, more than 42 million metric tons of international waterborne cargo flowed through the port in 2007. While imports accounted for 32 percent of the total foreign trade by volume, they also accounted for 60 percent of the value. On average, almost 116,000 tons of cargo moved through the port daily in 2007, with the top five commodities consisting of petroleum, grains, wood, heavy machinery and paper products.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Oakland</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Oakland – ranked sixth in the country – is located on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay in Northern California – an area that is home to 4.2 million people. The port encompasses 1,210 acres and includes 20 deepwater berths and 35 container cranes (29 of which are Post-Panamax). Additionally, the port boasts 10 container terminals and 2 intermodal rail facilities.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2007, the port ranked fifth in terms of container volume moving nearly 1.4 million TEUs (loaded). This accounted for 10 percent of the container traffic on the West Coast and five percent nationally. Since 2003, container traffic has increased by more than 34 percent at the port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overall, almost 17 million metric tons of international waterborne cargo flowed through the port in 2007. Imports accounted for 53 percent of the total foreign trade by volume but 68 percent of the value. On average, almost 46,000 tons of cargo moved through the port daily in 2007, with the top five commodities consisting of petroleum, wood pulp, iron and steel, beverages and fruit and nuts.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Charleston</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Charleston is home to 630,000 people and located in South Carolina along the U.S. East Coast. Three of the port’s five terminals support container traffic and boast 21 cranes (16 of which are at least Post-Panamax in size). The other two terminals support breakbulk cargoes with the capability of handling RO/RO cargo as well.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2007, the port ranked seventh in terms of container volume, moving almost 1.4 million TEUs (loaded). This accounted for 12 percent of the container traffic on the East Coast and five percent nationally. Since 2003, container traffic has increased by over 12 percent at the port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overall, more than 19 million metric tons of international waterborne cargo flowed through the port in 2007. Imports accounted for 64 percent of the total foreign trade by volume but 67 percent of the value. On average, over 53,000 tons of cargo moved through the port daily in 2007, with the top five commodities consisting of petroleum, iron and steel, salt and stone, vehicles and paper products.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Houston</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Houston is centrally located on the U.S. Gulf Coast and is home to a population of 5.6 million people. The port has the benefit of being located along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, providing a navigable inland waterway route along the Gulf Coast. Port facilities include general cargo, containers, dry bulk, and breakbulk.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2007, the port ranked eighth in terms of container volume, moving almost 1.4 million TEUs (loaded). This accounted for 68 percent of the container traffic on the Gulf Coast and five percent nationally. Since 2003, container traffic has increased more than 49 percent at the port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> However, a majority of the cargo moving through the Port of Houston moves on vessels other than containerships. The port ranked first by tonnage in international cargo moved in 2007 (133 million), but only 12 percent of that cargo was carried on container vessels. Exports accounted for 65 percent of the total foreign trade by volume, but only 47 percent of the value. On average, nearly 365,000 tons of cargo moved through the port daily in 2007, with the top five commodities consisting of petroleum, organic chemicals, salt and stone, grains, and byproducts of iron and steel.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Seattle</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Seattle is located in the Puget Sound area of the Pacific Northwest and is home to 3.3 million people. The port features four container terminals with 10 container berths and 25 cranes (7 Super Post-Panamax and 14 Post-Panamax). The port also includes two major rail hubs and two major Interstate Highways within five minutes of the terminals.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2007, the port ranked ninth in terms of container volume, moving nearly 1.3 million TEUs (loaded). This accounted for nine percent of the container traffic on the West Coast and four percent nationally. Since 2003, container traffic has increased by nearly 57 percent at the port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overall, nearly 21 million metric tons of international waterborne cargo flowed through the port in 2007. While imports accounted for 46 percent of the total foreign trade by volume, they also accounted for 76 percent of the value. On average, almost 56,000 tons of cargo moved through the port daily in 2007, with the top five commodities consisting of salt and stone, grains, seeds, wood and petroleum.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port of Tacoma</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Like the Port of Seattle, the Port of Tacoma is located in the Puget Sound area of the Pacific Northwest and is home to the same 3.3 million people. The port encompasses 2,400 acres, includes two transcontinental railroads and several Interstate Highways within minutes of the terminals. In addition to container traffic, the port also supports bulk, breakbulk, and RO/RO facilities.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2007, the port ranked tenth in terms of container volume, moving over 1.1 million TEUs (loaded). This accounted for eight percent of the container traffic on the West Coast and four percent nationally. Since 2003, container traffic has increased by nearly 22 percent at the port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overall, more than 18 million metric tons of international waterborne cargo flowed through the port in 2007. While imports accounted for 35 percent of the total foreign trade by volume, they also accounted for 81 percent of the value. On average, almost 50 thousand tons of cargo moved through the port daily in 2007, with the top five commodities consisting of seeds, grains, wood, iron and steel, and salt and stone.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Small and Medium Size Ports</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Not to be overlooked, our small and medium size ports play a vital role in the Nation’s port system. These ports serve specific market niches and have developed special handling techniques for specific commodities, such as fresh produce, frozen meats, and building materials that are containerized and/or palletized. They can also be the sole source of commodities for isolated communities. Also, these ports provide redundancy and resiliency for emergency preparedness.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Indeed, the efficient and smaller ports that dot the U.S. coasts, Great Lakes, and inland waterways offer a range of options in the event of primary port slowdowns or stoppage due to natural or man-made events, thereby minimizing the impact on the entire transportation system. Still other ports can serve to relieve pressure and congestion when other nearby large ports approach capacity limits.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Small and medium ports also play a vital role in the local communities they serve. For example, the port of Anchorage, while not considered a major port in the global system, handles more than 90 percent of the commodities consumed and produced in the entire state of Alaska.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As noted, small and medium size ports may specialize in niche commodities upon which entire industry sectors rely. For example, the port of Southern Louisiana handles approximately 50 percent of bulk grains produced in the entire U.S. Midwest for export. Its importance to the Nation was never more apparent than when the port was closed in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina just prior to the harvest season. Fortunately, it reopened in time for the surge of operations and the season was a success.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The variety and versatility of America’s ports demonstrates that the Marine Transportation System must efficiently handle all types of cargo. In recent years, attention has revolved around the growth in merchandise shipped in containers and the increasing size and number of vessels calling at ports, straining distribution centers, railroads, and highways. However, bulk, breakbulk, neo-bulk, project cargo, automobiles and trucks, petroleum and other bulk liquids arriving at our Nation’s ports also all flow through our transportation system – whether on the water, highways, rail or through pipelines. These cargoes account for 83 percent of our waterborne freight by tonnage, and are vital to the Marine Transportation System and our economy.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> National Defense</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The same network that serves the U.S. economy also supports our national defense. Our Armed Forces can project power anywhere in the world through the same commercial transportation system that provides us with goods and commodities</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Every day, the United States military moves assets across the Nation to the fighting front, using the seaports for deployment of equipment. When troops are deployed, the ports wear two hats as they work with both the military and commercial sector to efficiently move the goods for the economy and national defense.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Employment Opportunities</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Maritime Administration further expects that continued growth in foreign trade and domestic freight movements – along with changing technology – will create new employment opportunities in the trucking, rail, and maritime industries. In many cases, these new workers must be highly skilled and well qualified. This all translates into more high-paying jobs in our marine terminals, transportation company offices, trucking firms, railroads, shipyards and on board our ships.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> IV. Institutional Challenges</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> America’s top ten U.S. container ports experienced a</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> staggering 54 percent increase in container movements</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> between 2001 and 2006. Many of our ports are already</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> nearing the limits of existing capacity, and the system</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> faces a projected doubling in cargo over the next 10 to</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> 15 years. Port capacity, however, is not our only challenge.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Since 9/11, there has also been a significant increase</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of port security measures, including capital improvements,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> training and operating expenses. Some examples</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of security expenditures include the implementation of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC),</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> enhanced cargo screening and the Port Security Grant</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Program. No one denies the importance of these measures</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> for the ports. However, every dollar spent on security</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> is one less spent on capacity improvements.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Port Security Grant Program has helped offset some</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of the security improvement costs by funding security</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> planning, perimeter and surveillance equipment, patrol craft and other necessary items.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> However, the grants are not available to fund the follow-on maintenance and staff required</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> to keep the equipment operational and in service. In the long term, this may make some</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of the new activities difficult to sustain without a long-term commitment.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Port development has also become a costly and time consuming process. Just obtaining</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the necessary permits can take years; project completion can run into decades. We face</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> similar challenges with dredging, both to maintain existing channel depths and deepening</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and widening channels to accommodate the newer, larger vessels.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In addition, shipping raw materials needed for U.S. manufacturing brings additional challenges</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> as they compete with containerized freight for transportation infrastructure. Export</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> raw materials and bulk commodities such as grain and soda must also vie for their share</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of the goods movement system. And where demand outpaces capacity, the system underperforms</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and costs increase.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Other factors also affect capacity. These include significant environmental challenges, a</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> limited supply of land to expand, congested road and rail linkages and a shortage of labor</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> to handle new cargo demands. The whole system is overtaxed.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As container congestion increases, the pressure on bulk and breakbulk terminals will also increase. Often these niche terminals are crowded out by containerization. That is the bad news. The good news is that bulk and breakbulk vessels are the most adaptable to congestion challenges and can shift towards less congested routes. However, the same challenges of land and water access will limit their options in the future.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Adding rail capacity is costly and will take time. A recent study estimates that excluding the cost of land acquisition, an investment of $148 billion of infrastructure expansion over the next 28 years is required to keep pace with the projected 88 percent increase in freight rail demand.2</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Our ability to build more roads is also severely limited. Most urban areas do not have the space to widen existing roads or build new ones. Plus, the cost of construction is prohibitive and prospective projects bring, in many cases, local opposition that can significantly delay or stop projects. In fact, the Highway Trust Fund – a key public highway funding source – is expected to be depleted by 2009.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Changing trends in transportation also bring new challenges. For example, the expansion of the Panama Canal will open new opportunities for larger container ships to call at U.S. East and Gulf Coast ports. Coupled with the expansion of marine terminal and intermodal assets at facilities, such as the Ports of Virginia and Houston, this will lead to a significant increase in container traffic calling at Gulf Coast and Eastern ports. However, with the continued growth in foreign trade this shift will do little to relieve congestion at our West Coast ports.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Taken together, declining public funding, scarcity of land, regulatory barriers, environmental concerns and other external factors clearly demonstrate that the United States must find new and innovative approaches to care for and make the best use of our current transportation infrastructure.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Changing and Emerging Trends</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The advent of the shipping container had a dramatic and profound effect on transportation and our society. It enabled the manufacturing of goods to take place thousands of miles from where they would be eventually purchased or consumed. It triggered major shifts in international trade routes, altered the gateways that handled the goods, and shifted domestic freight corridors.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> However, the container revolution is but the latest in a series of tectonic shifts in transportation and their effect on how we live and work. Long before containers, the development of the railroads in the 19th century triggered a shift from waterborne transportation to land, which in turn allowed communities to develop in States and territories where it had been impractical to do so before. The Interstate Highway System had a similar influence on transportation and American society. We became a nation on the move and that mobility is now woven into our national character.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> There is no doubt that transportation will continue to change at a remarkable pace. Future developments and rapidly emerging factors will not only determine how and where goods move, but will influence how we live. For example, environmental concerns – both at the global and community level – could affect the methods and cost of freight movement.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In the first half of 2008, soaring energy costs – especially petroleum</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> – boosted the price of transportation, increasing pressure to manufacture</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> products closer to the consumer. Increased exports from the U.S. are</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> also affecting trade flows. Even climate change presents new opportunities</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> as new water routes open in the Arctic, which had heretofore been</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> inaccessible. All of these factors are likely to affect the supply chain and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the economy.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Developments like these can also cause shifts in the Marine Transportation</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> System that often outpace our ability to develop the policies, infrastructure,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and technologies to accommodate them. Careful planning is essential</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> to forecast and manage change before it overwhelms the Marine</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Transportation System.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Environmental</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Air quality compliance issues, particularly emissions on the U.S. West Coast, are of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> concern. Options for reducing emissions include using alternative fuels and emission</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> reduction technologies for large vessels approaching populated areas; employing shoreside</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> electricity (also known as “cold ironing”) for ships in port; and replacing or upgrading</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> cargo-handling equipment in ports and the dray trucks that move freight into and out of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> them.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span>Policy implemented by state<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> or local authorities, </span>instead of<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> at the </span>Federal<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> or international</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">level, </span>can negatively impact international trade<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and our ability to uniformly improve air</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> quality. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">For instance, some jurisdictions are considering stricter air quality standards and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">legislating specific practices to reduce emissions</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. States, municipalities, and ports are</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> also contemplating various fees to finance the cost of implementing these requirements.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> However, if not properly enacted, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">these </span>policies could require one<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> costly ship </span>configuration for one port, and another<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> costly configuration </span>for a different one<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. On the international level, global adoption of a carbon cap-and-trade policy could lead to wholesale changes in trade routes and volumes.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Environmental issues are not limited to just air quality. There are also efforts to limit</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the spread of invasive non-native aquatic species by regulating shipboard discharges</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> of water, including ballast water, and new standards could significantly affect marine transportation.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Health Issues</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The side effects of freight transportation in and near ports situated in urban, high population areas have been linked to health problems, particularly those associated with air emissions. Ships, trucks, trains, and cargo-handling equipment emit nitrogen oxide (NOx), diesel particulate matter (PM) and other pollutants. NOx is a key contributor to smog and ozone formation, while diesel PM contains unhealthy air contaminants. As cargo volumes continue to increase, ports, industry and local, state, and Federal government agencies must determine how to best minimize these pollutants and reduce their harmful effect on the community.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Some jurisdictions are already taking action. One example is the Port of Long Beach, which, combined with the Port of Los Angeles, forms the largest container port complex in the U.S. Port-related activities in Long Beach emit about 48 tons of NOx and 2.5 tons of diesel PM each day, or about ten percent of the region’s pollutants. These are from a combination of sources, including ocean-going vessels, cargo handling equipment, trucks in the port, harbor craft, and locomotives.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Recognizing the health hazards these emissions can represent, authorities have developed a Clean Air Action Plan aimed at reducing emissions for each of these sources.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The plan eliminates older, less clean diesel trucks by helping to finance a new generation of clean or retrofitted vehicles and equipping all major container cargo and cruise ship terminals with shore-side electricity so that vessels at berth can shut down their diesel-powered auxiliary engines. The plan also calls for reducing ship speeds when entering</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> or leaving the harbor, using low-sulfur fuels, and other emission-reduction measures and technologies. Some estimates project that implementation of this plan would cut PM</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> pollution by 47 percent, NOx emissions by more than 45 percent, and sulfur oxides by</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> 52 percent.3</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Several other communities and ports around the country, such as Seattle and Oakland, are considering variations of this plan. In addition, some states, municipalities, and ports are contemplating various fees to finance the cost of this environmental remediation.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Energy</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In spite of the recent decline in price, the cost of fuel will have a profound impact on the entire Marine Transportation System, both in the short and long term. In 2000, when oil prices were $20 per barrel, it cost only $3,000 to ship a standard 40-foot container from Shanghai to the U.S. East Coast (including inland costs). By the spring of 2008, however, shipping the same container cost $8,000, and approaching $200 per barrel of oil, it cost $15,000.4 In addition to increasing overall costs, the imbalance between the efficiencies of various methods of transportation is likely to trigger a shift of freight between modes. For example, a truck can move one ton of cargo 155 miles using a gallon of fuel. However, railroads can move the same cargo 413 miles, and inland marine towing vessels can transport it 576 miles. As the price of fuel increases, the resulting modal shift could play a significant role in shaping our future international trade routes, selecting gateway ports and determining which interstate corridors are sustainable into the future.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Exports</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Several factors have combined in recent years to trigger a rapid increase in U.S. exports. A few years ago, most export containers were empty and going overseas only to be refilled with imports destined for the U.S. Today, they are being filled with grain and other produce, paper and metals for recycling, and goods manufactured in the U.S. for consumption, or use in other countries.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> A factor driving this trend is the decline of the U.S. dollar which makes U.S. goods sold overseas cheaper and imports to the U.S. more expensive. There are other reasons too. For example, the rapid increase in the cost of steel and other raw materials, combined with upward construction trends in developing countries, such as China and India, have also triggered a surge in recycling. Containers are perfect to export these materials from the U.S. for re-use in a myriad of construction and manufacturing markets abroad.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Port Governance and the Role of Private Industry</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Overview</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> According to AAPA, there are 183 U.S. commercial deep draft ports dispersed along the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf and Great Lakes coasts. This includes seaports of Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Saipan, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> However, port governance in the United States varies widely and consists of both public and private entities. These organizations are found throughout all levels of government, i.e., Federal, state and local. Port authorities are usually instrumentalities of state or local governments that are established by enactments or grants of authority by the state legislature.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In contrast to other countries, the U.S. Federal Government does not control ports or port authorities during peacetime. However, port activities are subject to U.S. law and jurisdiction regarding security, safety, environmental protection, customs and immigration.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Neither the U.S. Congress nor any Federal agency has the power or right to appoint or dismiss port commissioners or staff members. However, the U.S. Constitution specifically grants Federal jurisdiction over navigable waters of the United States, including deep draft channels and harbors. Generally, this authority is delegated to the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Federal Governance</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The issues facing the transportation system are not going unnoticed. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Across the spectrum of government and the private sector, </span>there is growing<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> sense of </span>urgency that<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that the </span>transportation<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> system </span>must be able to meet present and future economic and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> national </span>security demands<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Because commercial waterborne transportation impacts every citizen’s livelihood and way of life, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is essential that the Federal Government ensure the continuance of a safe, economically efficient, equitable, and environmentally-sound intermodal transportation system</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Transportation Research Board (TRB) – one of the six major divisions of the independent National Research Council – has acknowledged that the Marine Transportation</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> System is a joint public-private enterprise, the same as other parts of the Nation’s transportation system. Private stakeholders own and operate vessels and terminals, while the public sector provides some infrastructure and is responsible for maintaining the operation of the system in a safe, secure, and environmentally-responsible manner.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The TRB identified the Federal Government’s current role in the Marine Transportation System as:</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Constructing, operating and maintaining the navigable channels;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Managing the traffic on the waterways;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Providing mariners with aids to navigation, charts and information on water and weather conditions;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Regulating the safety and environmental compatibility of vessels;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Responding to marine accidents that threaten public safety and the environment;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Helping to finance the highways that connect marine ports and terminals to the larger transportation system; and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Ensuring the security of the Marine Transportation System and its many</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> components.5</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> However, the Marine Transportation System cannot be viewed in isolation. The United States has built a vast and highly productive network of transportation assets based on the strengths of the individual modes – air, marine, highway, transit, and rail. Each is important and each plays a critical role. But due to our increasing dependence on waterborne trade, the marine mode is increasingly important to meet our national economic and security objectives.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Americans require and deserve the safest and the most efficient transportation system we can provide. The Federal Government’s challenge is to blend these separate transportation modes into a single, fully coordinated system – one that connects and integrates the individual modes in a manner that is at once safe, economically efficient, equitable, and environmentally sound.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Today, 18 Federal departments and agencies play a role in the Marine Transportation System, with no single entity designated as the lead agency. This presents challenges in both policy formulation and the coordination and delivery of the broad range of Federal Government services.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As the Marine Transportation System approaches capacity, </span>stakeholders are increasingly calling for<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the </span>Federal<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Government to play more of a </span>leadership role<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in dealing with the many challenges and to improve the efficiency and quantity of the services it delivers. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The Federal Government should </span>identify projects that have national significance and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> serve as the broker in </span>develop<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ing </span>funding partnerships<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> for them</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The different Federal agencies involved in marine transportation separately manage their individual pieces or sections of the system. Essentially, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Federal management ends at each agency’s organizational boundary – whether this is most effective or not, or if it makes good reason or not</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Listed below are some of the non-security Federal functions related to the marine component of the U.S. transportation system and the agencies with current oversight and control.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Inland waterway lock maintenance, replacement, and development –</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Design</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Approval</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Construction Contracting</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Maintenance</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Permits for channel/harbor maintenance and deepening – USACE</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Aids to Navigation and Vessel Traffic Services – U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Ship owner’s nationality verification – USCG</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Marine safety and regulations – USCG</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Vessel documentation and inspection – USCG</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • For new vessel construction/reconstruction</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • For vessel surveys and repairs</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Development of construction and safety regulations for vessels</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Mariner Training and Education – Maritime Administration</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Mariner certification and documentation – USCG</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Mariner testing and certification</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Mariner documentation data systems</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Great Lakes pilotage – USCG and Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Licensing of deep water ports – Maritime Administration and USCG</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Environmental protection (e.g., pollution prevention, ballast water management, spill cleanup) –</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • National Pollution Funds Center (USCG)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Marine safety and environmental science functions (USCG)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Marine pollution education (USCG)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Marine pollution prevention programs (USCG and Maritime Administration)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Charting services and weather and tide data – National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Domestic and international regulations and rulemaking related to fair competition laws – Federal Maritime Commission (FMC)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Infrastructure and info-structure development and maintenance –</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Construction approval and inspection of waterside port facilities (USACE, Maritime Administration, USCG and NOAA)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Bridge administration (USCG)</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> International marine mode representation in overseas venues – Department of State, USCG, and Maritime Administration</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">􀂬 • Development of International Standards in Maritime Safety</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">􀂬 • Development of International Standards for Marine Environmental</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Protection</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In December 2004, the President formed the Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) to provide a coordinating body among Federal agencies. It is comprised of the 18 entities that have a role in the Marine Transportation System and brings together the authorities, resources, or capabilities of multiple Federal agencies to resolve large or complex issues.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> State and Local Governance</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> State and local governments play an equally important role in the transportation system. All strive to provide the safest, most efficient and reliable transportation system possible within their jurisdiction, while maximizing the economic benefits for their citizens. They also collaborate to provide combined resources to address regionally significant projects and issues. State and local governments also work with the Federal Government to identify and fund projects of national significance within their jurisdiction.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> This multi-jurisdictional cooperation is already showing solid results. For example, the Department of Transportation spearheaded the development of the Southern California National Freight Gateway Collaboration as a major component of the Department’s initiative to reduce congestion.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Comprised of leaders representing Federal Government, State of California, local governments, ports, metropolitan planning organizations and other stakeholders, the Collaboration will address the challenge presented by the record growth in freight moving through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. In fact, more than 44 percent of the Nation’s imported containerized goods move through these ports to destinations throughout the country.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Collaboration will assist the affected agencies and interests (e.g., environmental, community and business interests) to expeditiously address various concerns, issues and opportunities facing the Southern California National Freight Gateway. However, the Collaboration will not act as “super-decision-makers”; that power will be left to existing authorities.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Through this innovative approach, the Collaboration identifies and focuses on concerns, issues, or opportunities in these initiatives and assists the constituency to address them – often through public participation and stakeholder involvement with the appropriate agencies.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In some cases, the Collaboration may simply work to see that the various initiatives are better coordinated, delivered on time and functioning in an appropriate manner. In other situations, the Collaboration has begun to explore priority topics, such as the movement of freight, public health, safety, environmental and community issues and economic development and opportunities.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> State, regional, and local governments play many roles in today’s Marine Transportation System. States’ departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations identify, prioritize, and allocate funding for transportation projects. While these are local decisions, they significantly affect ports, industries, or consumers in the transportation system. However, these local decisions should not be made in isolation; they should take into consideration the national system.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Many ports function as a component of city or municipal governments. Port terminals are often leased by the port authority to individual private sector tenants. As such, investment and policy decisions that have an impact on individual port capacity and efficiency are often jointly determined by local governments and their private sector tenants.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Many of the large and medium sized ports have state and local port authorities which own public terminals and related facilities. Public sector involvement has traditionally been due to the state and local economic benefits that accrue from port operations and the large capital investments necessary to build and maintain infrastructure. As noted above, while some port authorities operate terminals, many others lease terminals to private corporations. There are also many terminals in operation on the coasts and along inland water-</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> ways that are privately owned and operated. All of these ports and terminals make up a network that is vital to the health of the transportation system.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> State and local governments also share a problem with their Federal counterparts. The cost to replace or expand needed infrastructure continues to rise. In many cases, the cost is beyond the capability of a single entity, such as a state department of transportation, to bear. In addition, the complexity and interrelated goals and responsibilities of public and private sector freight stakeholders underscore the importance of developing new funding mechanisms for the transportation system.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Funding the Transportation System</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Federal Government relies heavily on general revenues to fund the Marine Transportation System, while funding for aviation and highways relies almost exclusively on collections from users of the systems that are placed in a trust fund.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In 2002, the Government Accountability Office noted that traditionally, Federal participation in the maritime industry has been directed mainly at projects related to “waterside” issues, such as keeping navigation channels open by dredging, icebreaking, or improving the system of locks and dams; maintaining navigational aids such as lighthouses or radio systems; and monitoring the movement of ships in and out of the Nation’s coastal waters.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Federal participation has generally not extended to “landside” projects related to port capabilities, such as building terminals or piers and purchasing cranes or other equipment to unload cargo. Some maritime stakeholders, particularly port owners and operators, have now proposed using a portion of customs duties for infrastructure improvements to the Marine Transportation System. They point out that the Marine Transportation System generates billions of dollars in revenue, and some of these funds should be returned to maintain and enhance the system. However, unlike transportation excise taxes, customs duties are taxes on the value of imported goods paid by importers and ultimately their consumers – not on the users of the system – and have traditionally been viewed as revenues to support the Federal Government’s general activities.6</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Public-Private Partnerships</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Today, public-private partnerships are increasingly viewed as a major component of funding and developing a seamless, reliable, and cost-efficient 21st century national transportation system. In a 2004 report to Congress, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) found that capital-intensive highway and transit projects benefit from them. And some of these partnerships are also involved in the actual management of assets, such as ports and terminals.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Banks and private investment firms are now investing heavily in private infrastructure, including highways, bridges, and ports. States such as Texas, Virginia, Florida, and Georgia are relying more heavily on private capital to expand their highway systems. Billions of dollars are flowing into these projects.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Private investors are looking for opportunities to invest in infrastructure and know how to measure economic costs and benefits to ensure that the public interests in transportation projects are being met. Partnerships in marine terminals are seen as a wise investment that can pay off by creating more efficient terminals that compete for business while keeping local jobs and paying into the local and state tax base.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> An excellent example of a public-private partnership delivering real world benefits is the new APM Terminal in Portsmouth, Virginia. APM Terminals North America opened a new 55-foot deep-water container terminal, which is now the largest privately-owned container terminal in the United States. It is also the third-largest container terminal in the United States and is capable of handling one million TEUs annually and has the potential to expand to more than two million TEUs.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The project is the largest private investment in the history of the Hampton Roads region. APM invested $500 million to convert 600 acres into a highly automated marine terminal of 291 acres and surrounding buffer zone. The State of Virginia invested in highway improvements to access the terminal which will provide several hundred local jobs.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> This new model also recently led to the development of the Heartland Corridor project connecting the Port of Virginia to intermodal distribution centers in Chicago. This project will link the existing rail network; build new lines where needed; and raise tunnel and bridge heights to accommodate double-stack trains. In total, the project will cost over $300 million, which will be paid for by multiple private users, the Federal government, and the states of Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Deparment of Transportation has moved both administratively and recommended to Congress to expand the use of public-private partnerships. As a result, there is now greater flexibility in financing transportation infrastructure, which includes using innovative contracting methods. In addition, recently enacted transportation legislation encourages states to explore innovative financial and contracting methods that make greater use of private sector resources.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Administration has also recommended a number of legal changes to help promote public-private partnerships. For example, risk aversion and lack of experience with the private sector often drive public agencies to spend considerable time and resources developing systems for soliciting projects, ensuring adequate competition, and allocating the risks associated with designing, constructing and operating a large transportation facility.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> These administrative procedures limit private sector flexibility and have deterred many states from exploring such partnerships. And the additional costs associated with developing a public-private partnership can also diminish the potential value these partnerships may offer. This is especially true because some of the benefits are difficult to quantify.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> However, there can also be significant cost and time savings associated with public-private partnerships. The FHWA report showed that public-private partnerships can save from six to 40 percent of construction costs and significantly limit the potential for cost overruns. The reason for these savings is that the private sector often has more appropriate incentives to limit costs than the public sector. In addition, having one entity responsible for design, construction, and operation can result in efficiencies that are not possible with traditional design-bid-build methods.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Public-private partnerships can help reduce the time it takes to build a project in two ways – innovative financing and project management. Innovate financing generates the most significant time-savings and can cut many years off project delivery. Although frequently less dramatic, innovative project management also reduces the time it takes to finish a project, often saving months if not years.7</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Clearly, the Marine Transportation System would greatly benefit from and needs greater access to these resources. But </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">bringing </span>an infusion of private capital<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to the transportation system </span>cannot merely be a good monetary investment<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> with a high rate of return </span>for a<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span>few people<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Rather, </span>investments<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in roads, rail, ports, and waterways </span>must<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> yield dividends for the Nation, including </span>eas<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ing </span>congestion, minimiz<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ing </span>environmental impacts<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span>spur<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ring economic </span>growth and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> helping to </span>sustain America’s leadership<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in the global marketplace</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Types of Financing Mechanisms</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Revenue Bonds</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Revenue bonds are issued by governments, authorities, or public benefit corporations and are secured by a pledge of the future revenues to repay the bonds over time. In a port’s case, revenue bonds can be issued on a consolidated basis; that is, they would be backed by both aviation and seaport revenues, regardless of the projects being financed. This results in a stronger credit and a lower interest rate on the bonds. Although port revenue bonds are typically issued on a fixed-rate basis for a term of up to 25 years, variable rate bonds, and shorter-term notes also can be issued to diversify the port’s capital structure and to reduce interest costs by appealing to a wider group of investors.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> If a port is designated as a government entity, it can issue bonds for most projects on a tax-exempt basis, meaning that investors who hold the bonds pay no Federal income taxes on the interest they receive. As a result, the port would be able to pay lower interest rates than are paid on taxable bonds, which in turn, provides for significantly lower financing costs.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> General Obligation Bonds</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> General obligation bonds are debt instruments issued by states and local governments that can be used to raise funds for ports and public works. What makes general obligation bonds, or GO bonds, unique is that they are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing municipality. This means that the municipality commits its full resources to paying bondholders, including general taxation and the ability to raise more funds through credit. The ability to back up bond payments with tax funds is what makes GO bonds distinct from revenue bonds, which are repaid using the revenue generated by the specific project the bonds are issued to fund.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> GO bonds give municipalities a tool to raise funds for projects that will not provide direct sources of revenue, such as roads, bridges, parks and equipment, and, of course, port projects. As a result, GO bonds are typically used to fund projects that will serve the entire community; revenue bonds, on the other hand, are used to fund projects that will serve specific populations, who provide revenue to repay the debt through user fees and taxes.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Taxing Authority</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Ports and port authorities rely on issuing bonds – usually general obligation or revenue bonds – for operation as well as infrastructure development. Besides bonding authority, some port districts have been granted taxing authority, such as the Port of Seattle and the Port of Tacoma.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Each port authority can levy property taxes under state law for general taxing purposes. This taxing authority is subject to two limitations: (1) the total levy rate may not exceed $0.45 per thousand dollars of assessed value; and (2) annual increases for levy are restricted to the lesser of inflation or one percent.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The annual increase in the allowable levy is based on the amount of taxes that could have been levied in the previous year, even if the port did not levy the full amount. The Tax Levy is available for general port purposes, but may not be used to pay debt service</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> on revenue bonds. It is these ports’ policy to use the levy solely for capital expenditures, environmental expenses, and community investments.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Container Fees</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> There is growing interest in container fees to pay for a number of environmental or congestion relief initiatives that will increase the flow of cargo through large metropolitan areas and major corridors in the United States.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Although there could be repercussions, such as the loss of business, the States of California and Washington have explored the idea of user fees to address growing transportation and environmental costs. In California, State Senator Alan Lowenthal authored SB974, which would impose a $60 per TEU fee on containers moving through the ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Oakland.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The fees’ proceeds – which were expected to be $400 million to $500 million annually – would have been split evenly between air quality projects related to freight movement throughout the state and to improve the goods-movement infrastructure located outside the ports.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The California Senate passed the Lowenthal bill (SB 974) in August 2008 by a vote of 22-9. This vote follows California Assembly approval of the bill in July by a vote of 45-31. But the bill was vetoed by the Governor on September 30, 2008.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Net Income</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Net income for funding purposes represents the cash that could be generated from the port’s business activities after payment of all expenses. It differs from the standard accounting concept of income in that it excludes non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization. It also includes non-operating items such as interest earnings. Net income can be used directly to fund capital projects (pay-as-you-go) or leveraged (borrowed against).</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Alternative Financing</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Alternative financing refers to off-balance-sheet funding mechanisms that do not rely on port capital or credit capacity. This includes private or third party development, conduit financing (debt secured by a private company) or project financing (debt secured solely by project revenues).</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Future Workforce</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Given growing throughput and rapidly changing technology, a fully staffed and well-trained workforce is critical to the safe and efficient operation of the Marine Transportation System. Deep draft, coastal and inland vessel crews are under increasing pressure to accomplish more with fewer personnel. They must operate more efficiently and comply with more and more rules, regulations, and requirements. Merchant Marine Academies, state schools, union, and non-union sponsored schools and training centers must address these new challenges and opportunities to meet the increased demand for well trained and qualified mariners.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Port personnel who load and unload vessels, move, track and account for cargos and ensure the safety and security of people and property must meet the increased demand for moving greater volumes of freight at greater speeds and adapting to new technologies and environmental protocols. Truck drivers who move the cargo to and from the ports are</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> increasingly in short supply at a time when demand is increasing and supply chains are changing. They must also be well trained and equipped with the safest and most environmentally sound equipment.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The entire workforce, port, and employer leadership must collaborate to ensure the future workforce is positioned to meet all of these demands. They must work in concert so that the entire Marine Transportation System can function safely and effectively.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Infrastructure Development</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> From 1946 through 2005, U.S. public port development capital expenditures totaled $30 billion which funded the construction and improvements to port facilities and related infrastructure.8 The need for infrastructure development is only increasing. Projected cargo demands suggest that we may need the capacity of a new container terminal the size of the Ports of Seattle/Tacoma each year for the next five to ten years. Several trends are also emerging as we look at future requirements for the Nation’s maritime infrastructure, including:</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • Specific geographic needs will drive solutions, e.g., international gateways and trade corridors;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • The private sector is increasing its investment in port and terminal infrastructure; and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> • The public sector is limited in its ability to fund future connector infrastructure needs.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> There is evidence that the private sector is concerned too about the lack of investment in the Nation’s logistics infrastructure. The National Chamber Foundation released a study in April 2008 entitled “The Transportation Challenge: Moving the U.S. Economy.” The study concludes that there is a need for more investment in the transportation system in order to support increasing trade and population growth in the United States. According to the report, underinvestment is contributing to congestion which is costing U.S. businesses and consumers both time and money.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Historically, the acquisition and use of available land for necessary development met few objections because expansion was in the name of economic prosperity. But many port communities are now encountering competing demands for waterside land for purposes other than those related to waterborne commerce: namely, commercial, residential, and recreational uses. This issue is discussed in greater detail in Section V under “Community and Land Use Issues.”</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Deeper channels to accommodate larger ships also make dredging a major component of infrastructure development in the transportation system. However, many other issues also affect infrastructure development.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Infrastructure development is also not just about bricks and mortar. To achieve an enhanced integrated transportation system for the movement of international and domestic freight, new technology must be exploited. And it must be planned and built into the infrastructure and transportation network, and designed into communication and information flows right from the start.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> National Defense, Security and Emergency Preparedness</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In partnership with the Maritime Administration and the National Port Readiness Network (NPRN), the Department of Defense (DOD) has designated 15 commercial ports as Strategic Seaports. These Strategic Ports are geographically dispersed along the Nation’s coasts. Each has individual capabilities that provide DOD with the facilities and services the military requires to perform its mission. Recent history has shown that these same capabilities can also be applied to domestic emergency relief activities after a natural disaster.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Military deployments require the large-scale use of RO/RO ships, which are capable of carrying a combination of aircraft, wheeled and tracked vehicles, oversize equipment, and containers. As demonstrated during Operation Iraqi Freedom, loading of combat units requires substantial staging areas for vehicles and aircraft, adequate port rail infrastructure and port labor that is skilled in handling non-containerized military equipment.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The effectiveness of military cargo port operations is tied to the mobility planning process and the availability of staging areas and rail infrastructure for sequencing arriving equipment. As noted, U.S. ports will continue to expand their operations to meet the forecasted growth in commercial containerized freight. However, if these ports reduce the area available for non-containerized cargo, there will be fewer facilities to support military cargo handling. This, in turn, may reduce the ability of U.S. ports to facilitate military unit deployments.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Indeed, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the deployment of U.S. forces and materiel from “fort to foxhole” depends on the commercial intermodal freight transportation system. This vital military cargo shares a transportation system that is already stressed by carrying commercial freight with demanding delivery schedules</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> With the exception of ammunition and other specialized or dangerous cargoes, </span>virtually all<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> CONUS-based </span>military contingency cargoes are deployed<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> through U.S. commercial seaports</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Commercial cargo and peacetime military cargo are primarily containerized, whereas military surge cargo is based on moving an entire military unit’s needs (force package), which contains wheeled vehicles, tanks and other equipment. Military surge and sustainment freight also differ in volume and needed configuration in comparison with normal commercial port operations. This surge deployment of cargo puts unique pressure on staging areas and requires the use of other labor skills to load the cargo.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Military freight mobilization also moves </span>under compressed timeframes<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, with a requirement to maintain real-time communications between public and private transportation entities and DOD command and control. If not properly planned, coordinated, and executed, military operations can disrupt commercial transportation operations both immediately and over the longer-term</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For example, U.S.-based forts may load and dispatch six trains per day to ports, while the receiving port may only have the capability of handling and unloading one to two trains per day.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Military deployments, which must preserve unit integrity, may also require that a port receive materials and supplies from more than a dozen different U.S. military installations in a short timeframe</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Trains and trucks may be dispatched from bases and arrive at the terminal gates with little advance warning. DOD logistics planners have adopted successful commercial methods of handling freight and will re-direct cargo at the last moment to accomplish a just-in-time delivery. But again, these changes occur with little or no warning to the receiving port.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span>The ability to meet<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> these many </span>requirements is raising alarms<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> at the highest levels</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The “Department of Defense Report to Congress on Projected Requirements for Military Throughput at Strategic Seaports,” states that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">“commercial cargo volume growth has generated </span>increasing concern about the<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> future </span>adequacy of<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Strategic Seaport </span>infrastructure<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to meet national security requirements and readiness</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.”9</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Clearly, </span>as<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the volume of </span>trade continues to increase, we must ensure that<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the U.S. </span>transportation<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> system </span>maintains the ability to fully accommodate defense mobilization requirements<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is important to note, however, that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in today’s modern world, sealift and </span>emergency planning<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> cannot be successfully accomplished in isolation. They </span>must be integrated into<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the much larger planning process for </span>the entire U.S. transportation system so as to serve<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> both economic and national defense needs</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Maritime Administration and other parts of the Department of Transportation are also working with other Federal agencies in outreach and coordination activities designed to assist the maritime industry in </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">emergency preparedness, </span>response and recovery efforts related to<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> maritime transportation </span>security incidents and natural disasters<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This includes interaction with key industry associations and Marine Transportation System stakeholders in planning and training forums, conferences, workshops, exercises, real world response and recovery efforts and establishing a communications link between the broader business community and Federal leadership regarding private sector concerns that may arise during emergencies.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Homeland Security</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The President approved the National Strategy for Maritime Security in October 2005, which is an overarching document of eight supporting plans that cover the spectrum of preparedness, protection, response, and recovery for all hazards, both man-made and natural.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Maritime Administration coordinates with other government entities, as well as state and local security providers, in order to facilitate the movement of commerce in a secure environment. Transparency, accountability, and interoperability are essential elements of a secure and efficient transportation system, which is why security and safety are inextricably linked to the movement of commerce. For example, knowing where vessels are located, their next and last port of call and the cargo being carried, is used to both coordinate movement through the supply chain and analyze the security risk. The latter is based on threat, vulnerability, and consequence.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol have the responsibility and authority to ensure the security of vessels and cargoes entering ports. Security measures to identify risks at the earliest opportunity are part of an in-depth, layered security program. The Maritime Administration acts as a catalyst between Federal, state, and local entities that provide security, and the Marine Transportation System private sector.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) is the foundation for preparing, protecting, and responding to a transportation incident. The Maritime Administration is the MDA Executive Agent for the Department of Transportation, as is the U.S. Coast Guard for the Department of Homeland Security and the Navy for the Department of Defense. In a collaborative effort, the knowledge that each Executive Agent possesses is shared in order to provide clarity and actionable information to identify threats. The Federal Government also administers port security grants to harden the security of our Nation’s portS. The Maritime Administration, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Transportation Security Administration are included in the review of grant applications and make policy recommendations about the grant program to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Port security is a “must have” from both a homeland security perspective and a business perspective. As with safety, security is based on customer demands and expectations. In order to facilitate commerce and enhance security simultaneously, the private sector, state, and local entities must be considered to effect solutions commensurate with the security threat. The physical security at the port and the economic security of our homeland are inextricably linked.</span>

Effective logistics is key to conventional deterrence – uniquely prevents conflict initiation and escalation
--local conventional balance of power trumps global or threat of nuclear use (i.e. troops key)
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Gerson 9</span> (Michael S. Gerson, research analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses, “Conventional Deterrence in the Second Nuclear Age,” Parameters, Autumn 2009, http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/parameters/Articles/09autumn/gerson.pdf)
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Deterrence is once again a topic of discussion and debate among US defense and policy communities. Although the concept has received comparatively little attention since the end of the Cold War, it seems poised to take center stage in America’s national security policy during the coming decades. </span>With<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> two </span>ongoing wars already straining the military<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span>concerns about<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> a recalcitrant and militarized </span>Russia<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span>Iran<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">’s continued uranium enrichment activities, </span>North Korea<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">’s nascent nuclear arsenal, </span>and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> top-to-bottom military modernization in </span>China<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span>adversary-specific deterrence strategies will<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> likely </span>become<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> a </span>prominent<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> component of national and international security </span>in an increasingly multipolar world<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As part of this renewed interest in deterrence, conventional weapons are playing an important role. The “New Triad,” consisting of both nuclear and advanced conventional weapons; proposals for conventionally armed intercontinental ballistic missiles; and, more generally, the concept of Prompt Global Strike all represent a growing belief that advanced conventional capabilities can substitute for some missions previously relegated solely to nuclear weapons. Although there has been considerable debate over these specific initiatives—for example, the effect that putting conventional warheads on ballistic missiles would have on strategic stability—most specialists agree that conventional forces can help reduce the role of nuclear weapons in US security strategy. In fact, in recent years the US military has expanded the concept of “strategic deterrence,” a term that once encompassed only intercontinental nuclear weapons, to incorporate both nuclear and conventional forces, as well as diplomatic, economic, and informational tools.1</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The recent emphasis on substituting conventional for nuclear weapons in selected missions is an important step in developing a credible and robust twenty-first century deterrent, but it does not fully consider</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the unique logic and strategy of conventional deterrence</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The current debate focuses primarily on the use of conventional weapons for “deterrence by punishment,” the threat to impose unacceptable costs, such as the destruction of an adversary’s strategic and high-value targets, in response to unwanted actions. Yet, one of the most important contributions of conventional forces is “deterrence by denial,” the threat to deny an adversary the ability to achieve its military and political objectives through aggression</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.2 If some early strategists were accused of “conventionalization” by treating nuclear weapons merely as more powerful and effective tools of war, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the current debate regarding conventional contributions to deterrence may be accused of “nuclearization” in that it treats conventional capabilities merely as a substitute for nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> This article seeks to expand the current debate about the role and utility of conventional forces in US deterrence strategies by reexamining the traditional logic of conventional deterrence, which focuses on deterrence by denial, in the context of the modern international security environment. It is primarily concerned with the role of US conventional forces in extended deterrence, defined as the threat of force to protect allies and friends, rather than “central” or “homeland” deterrence.3 This focus on extended deterrence—and especially on the role of deterrence by denial in extended deterrence—highlights the central importance of protecting territory from attack and invasion. </span>Historically, the desire for control over specific territory has been a frequent motivator of<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> interstate crises and conflict</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.4 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While interstate conventional </span>wars<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> have significantly declined since the end of the Second World War, </span>the potential for conflict over Taiwan or<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> on the </span>Korea<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">n Peninsula, the prospect of future clashes over control of </span>scarce natural resources, and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the 2008 war between </span>Georgia and Russia attest to the continued possibility of conflict<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> over specific territory that has important strategic, economic, political, religious, historical, or socio-cultural significance</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Consequently, this article examines how </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">US conventional military power can be used to deter conventional aggression against friends and allies by threatening to deny an adversary its best chance of success on the battlefield—a surprise or short-notice attack with little or no engagement with American military forces. The ability to prevent an opponent from presenting</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the United States with </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a fait accompli—that is, from strik</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ing quickly and achieving victory before substantial US</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (and perhaps coalition) </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">forces can be deployed to the theater—is a central component of modern conventional deterrence</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Conventional Deterrence in US Strategy</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Broadly defined, deterrence is the threat of force intended to convince a potential aggressor not to undertake a particular action because the costs will be unacceptable or the probability of success extremely low. This threat has always been one of the central strategic principles by which nations attempted to prevent conflict.5 Even so, the development and rigorous analysis of deterrence as a discrete strategic concept did not occur until the advent of nuclear weapons.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Deterrence theory was developed against the backdrop of the Cold War nuclear arms race and focused on the prevention of nuclear conflict. Yet, while the majority of academic research and public debate was concerned with the prevention of nuclear war—the net result was that deterrence became synonymous with nuclear weapons—conventional deterrence, appropriately, assumed an increasingly important role in the development of military strategy during this period.6 As the Soviet Union began to amass a large and survivable nuclear arsenal that was capable of global reach in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the credibility of the Eisenhower Administration’s policy of “Massive Retaliation,” which threatened an overwhelming nuclear response to virtually any Soviet aggression, was brought into question. Once the Soviet Union developed survivable nuclear capabilities that could reach the US homeland, many defense officials and analysts argued that the threat of Massive Retaliation lacked credibility against anything other than an all-out Soviet nuclear attack.7</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As a result, western military strategy eventually shifted from total reliance on nuclear weapons as a means of deterring both Soviet conventional and nuclear aggression to a strategy of “Flexible Response,” which included conventional and nuclear elements. From the mid-1960s onward, NATO relied on conventional power, backed by the threat of nuclear escalation, to deter any conventional assault on Europe by the numerically superior Warsaw Pact, and relied on nuclear weapons to deter nuclear attacks.8 By incorporating “direct defense”—the ability to respond to Warsaw Pact aggression, especially conventional aggression, with proportionate (i.e., conventional) force—into NATO strategy, the concept of Flexible Response sought to create a more credible means of deterrence across the entire spectrum of conflict.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Following the Cold War, conventional deterrence earned an even greater role in US national security strategy. With the demise of the Soviet Union and significant advancements in conventional precision-guided munitions, many defense analysts concluded that “smart” weapons could provide a powerful deterrent against a wide variety of threats. While some commentators argued that nuclear weapons were still necessary to prevent nuclear attacks, and others contended that conventional weapons were “the only credible deterrent” even against nuclear threats, almost all agreed that technologically advanced conventional weapons could now take the place of nuclear weapons in many missions.9 Following the remarkable success of sophisticated conventional firepower in Operation Desert Storm, William Perry declared, “This new conventional military capability adds a powerful dimension to the ability of the United States to deter war.”10</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In the current international security environment, </span>conventional deterrence can be useful against nonnuclear and nuclear<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">-armed </span>adversaries<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. For regimes that do not possess nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, US conventional capabilities will likely be the most credible and potent deterrent</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">History suggests that, in general, nations without</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> weapons of mass destruction (</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">WMD</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">) </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are not intimidated by an opponent’s nuclear capabilities</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For example, nuclear weapons did not give the United States significant advantages before or during the Korean and Vietnam wars; nor did they dissuade Egypt from attacking Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War11 or Argentina from attacking the British-controlled Falkland Islands in 1982.12 This circumstance is due in part to the perceived impact of the “nuclear taboo,” a moral and political aversion to using nuclear weapons that has emerged due to the long absence of nuclear use in time of war. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The nuclear taboo reduces the credibility—and therefore the utility—of nuclear weapons, especially against regimes not possessing</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> nuclear weapons or other </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">WMD</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.13</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Although implicit or explicit nuclear threats may lack credibility against non-WMD regimes, many potential adversaries believe that the United States will use conventional firepower, especially because America has conventional superiority and a demonstrated willingness to use it. Consequently, when dealing with non-WMD-related threats, conventional deterrence will be the most likely mechanism for deterring hostile actions.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> According to Admiral Michael Mullen, the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A big part of credibility</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, of course, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">lies in our conventional capability. The </span>capability to project power globally and conduct effective theater-level operations . . . remains essential to deterrence effectiveness<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.”14</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Conventional deterrence also plays an important role in preventing nonnuclear aggression by nuclear-armed regimes. </span>Regional nuclear proliferation may not only increase the chances for<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the </span>use of nuclear weapons, but<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, equally important, the possibility of </span>conventional aggression<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The potential for conventional conflict under the shadow of mutual nuclear deterrence was a perennial concern throughout the Cold War, and that scenario is still relevant. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A nuclear-armed adversary may be emboldened to use conventional force against US friends and allies, or to sponsor terrorism, in the belief that its nuclear capabilities give it an effective deterrent against US retaliation or intervention</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.15 For example, a regime might calculate that it could undertake conventional aggression against a neighbor and, after achieving a relatively quick victory, issue implicit or explicit nuclear threats in the expectation that the United States (and perhaps coalition partners) would choose not to get involved.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In this context, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">conventional deterrence can be an important mechanism to limit options for regional aggression below the nuclear threshold. By deploying robust conventional forces in and around the theater of potential conflict, the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">can credibly signal that it can respond to conventional aggression at the outset, and therefore the opponent cannot hope to simultaneously achieve a quick conventional victory and use nuclear threats to deter US involvement</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Moreover, if the United States can convince an opponent that US forces will be engaged at the beginning of hostilities—and will therefore incur the human and financial costs of war from the start—it can help persuade opponents that the United States would be highly resolved to fight even in the face of nuclear threats because American blood and treasure would have already been expended.16 Similar to the Cold War, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the deployment of conventional power in the region, combined with significant nuclear capabilities and escalation dominance, can help prevent regimes from believing that nuclear possession provides opportunities for conventional aggression and coercion</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Logic of Conventional Deterrence</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> There is comparatively little theoretical literature on conventional, as opposed to nuclear, deterrence, but what scholarship does exist provides a useful baseline for analyzing the utility of conventional deterrence in the emerging international security environment. The few scholars who have</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> studied conventional deterrence generally agree on its basic logic, offering refinements, additional insights, and supporting evidence rather than competing theories. Consequently, the existing literature can be readily synthesized into a broader, more complete, and more robust theory of conventional deterrence, effectively incorporating arguments from important works on the subject.17</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The logic of conventional deterrence is based on three interrelated arguments. First, states contemplating conventional aggression typically seek relatively quick, inexpensive victories.18 The history of conventional warfare demonstrates that most nations desire and develop military strategies designed for rapid, blitzkrieg-style wars rather than protracted wars of attrition.19 Long and costly wars can ruin economies and create political instabilities undermining the effectiveness, reputation, and survival of the government or state.20 War is inherently unpredictable, and most leaders do not want to get trapped in a costly and bloody conflict with no end in sight and an uncertain final outcome.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Second, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">conventional deterrence is primarily based on deterrence by denial, the ability to prevent an adversary from achieving its objectives through conflict</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.21 If states typically seek short and low-cost conflicts, then conventional deterrence largely depends on convincing an adversary that it cannot achieve its objectives rapidly or efficiently. In this context, </span>the deterrent<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> effect </span>is achieved<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in large part </span>by the possibility of getting bogged down in a long and costly war<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> of attrition</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. According to John Mearsheimer, one of the principal architects of conventional deterrence theory, “. . . deterrence is best served when the attacker believes that his only alternative is a protracted war: The threat of a war of attrition is the bedrock of conventional deterrence.”22 Thus, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if a state believes it can achieve rapid victory, deterrence is more apt to fail; conversely, deterrence is more likely to succeed when an aggressor state believes it cannot achieve its goals in relatively short order</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.23</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Although the strategy of conventional deterrence primarily depends on deterrence by denial, the usefulness and applicability of deterrence by punishment should not be overlooked, especially in light of significant advancements in conventional precision-strike capabilities. In practice, a robust and flexible conventional deterrence strategy should combine both mechanisms, as some adversaries are more likely to be deterred by the threat of punishment and others by the threat of denial. For example, some leaders may believe that they can simply withstand or “ride out” whatever punishment the opponent’s conventional forces can inflict. For these regimes, threats to deny success may be a more potent deterrent than threats of punishment. On the other hand, some aggressors may convince them</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> selves that US conventional forces will not be able to successfully deny their objectives. These leaders may believe that they can achieve their aims in spite of the opposing conventional power because they have greater resolve and are willing to fight longer and harder, and accept greater casualties. Often, they base this resolve on the belief that they can achieve their goals before substantial US conventional power arrives, a fait accompli. These opponents may perceive that they have a better conventional war-fighting strategy or a “home field advantage” since the conflict is on their territory. Their resolve is often based on strategy that incorporates the employment of asymmetric tactics to offset US conventional advantages, such as supporting terrorism or acquiring WMD. In all these cases, the threat of punishment may be the most effective deterrent.24</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In general, however, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">denial has an important advantage over punishment: </span>If conventional deterrence fails, a force designed for deterrence by denial is more able to engage<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in conventional conflict, </span>control escalation, and<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> exercise a </span>win<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ning strategy</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Given that a credible deterrence by denial strategy requires that an adversary believe that U.S. forces are actually capable of denying victory on the battlefield, this force posture is inherently designed to fight and win a conflict in the event of a deterrence failure</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.25 According to Lawrence Freedman, “In principle, denial is a more reliable strategy than punishment because, if the threats have to be implemented, it offers control rather than continuing coercion. With punishment, the [adversary] is left to decide how much more to take. With denial, the choice is removed.”26</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Third, and finally, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the “local” balance of military power—the balance between the conventional forces of the attacker and those of a defender in the area of conflict—often plays a critical role in conventional deterrence, since </span>it is local forces that will impact an aggressor’s calculations regarding a quick victory<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.27 If US adversaries seek relatively short and inexpensive wars, and if the key to deterring conventional aggression is convincing those adversaries that they will not be able to achieve such an objective, then </span>credible and effective deterrence requires that US forces be<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in or near the region, or </span>readily able to deploy, for an immediate response<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. When the local balance favors the adversary, deterrence is more likely to fail because the regime will calculate that it can achieve a rapid success</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. When the local balance favors the defender, deterrence is more likely to succeed.28</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The importance of the local power balance in deterrence calculations suggests that US conventional superiority in and of itself is not as relevant as some analysts have suggested.29 In fact, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the available </span>evidence suggests that overall superiority may be insufficient to establish deterrence<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Despite</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the apparent advantage of conventional superiority in the macro sense, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">deterrence may still fail if the opponent believes it has a local advantage</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Challenges for Conventional Deterrence</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The existing scholarship, previously outlined, provides a framework for how conventional deterrence works. The majority of this literature, however, is now decades old. While the core elements of deterrence theory, both conventional and nuclear, remain relevant, it is necessary to reexamine some of the theory’s assumptions and arguments in the context of today’s security environment.30</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Quick Victory, Deterrence, and the “Fait Accompli”</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In the future, the desire for relatively quick, low-cost victories may lead states that are considering conventional aggression against the United States to employ a “fait accompli” strategy.31 The purpose of this strategy is to rapidly achieve limited objectives, such as seizing a piece of territory, with little or no military engagement. A fait accompli strategy hinges on strategic surprise; the goal is to attack swiftly and achieve victory before the United States has time to mobilize and deploy forces.32 Following the accomplishment of limited objectives, the adversary may switch to a defensive posture designed to repel any counterattack. By striking quickly and then exercising a defensive posture, the adversary hopes to deter or complicate US attempts to reverse any gains or restore the status quo.33</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The fait accompli strategy—and, more generally, military planning for rapid victory—is an important component of strategic thinking in several nations. China’s concept of “Local Wars under Modern High-Technology Conditions” envisions localized, short-duration, and high-intensity conflicts using technologically advanced weapons for both symmetric and asymmetric combat, including cyber, space, and information warfare.34 According to some analysts, China’s military strategy for its Taiwan contingency approximates a fait accompli-type strategy. China would attempt to rapidly defeat, or at least incapacitate, Taiwan, perhaps through a massive conventional missile strike, thereby forcing Taiwan to capitulate before US forces could arrive.35 Similarly, according to a high-ranking North Korean defector in 1997, Kim Jong-il apparently believed that he could achieve a quick victory against South Korea by launching a massive missile strike against Seoul, while at the same time forestalling US intervention by threatening missile attacks on Japan.36</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> As a result, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">conventional deterrence puts a premium on forward-deployed combat power, as well as forcible entry, force sustainment and reinforcement capabilities, and regional base access. Compared to deterrence by punishment, which relies primarily on precision-strike capabilities, deterrence by denial involves a number of </span>complicated logistical issues<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that </span>impact an adversary’s calculations<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> regarding success</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. With deterrence by denial, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">not only might an adversary question America’s political willpower but, equally important, it could question whether the U</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is capable of responding, and, if so, how quickly. These types of calculations will be especially important for states hoping to achieve a fait accompli, since this strategy is predicated on the ability to accomplish objectives before substantial US forces can arrive</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span>Rapid-response and force sustainment may present increasingly complex challenges<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in the coming decades, </span>as<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> current and potential </span>adversaries develop<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> both </span>symmetric and asymmetric means to counter US power projection<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. China, for example, is developing a range of anti-access and area-denial capabilities intended to diminish the capacity of extra-regional nations to deploy, operate, and sustain forces in its geographical region.37 The ability, whether real or perceived, to prevent or weaken US power projection capability and operational effectiveness can undermine deterrence efforts. Consequently, </span>the credibility of conventional deterrence—and execution<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> of the threat </span>if deterrence fails<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">—</span>requires convincing potential aggressors that the U<span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span>S<span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates </span>can and will rapidly respond<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to aggression against its global interests, and that there is nothing the regime can do to prevent or hinder the response</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Deterrence by Denial and Deterrence by Defeat</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In the emerging international security environment, the concept of denying victory has to be carefully evaluated. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There is an important difference between the threat to merely deny a rapid victory and the threat to completely defeat the opponent</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The traditional logic of </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">conventional deterrence hinges almost exclusively on the former</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is important to note that this threat does not necessarily require defeating the opponent. Rather, the deterrent effect is derived by convincing the aggressor that it cannot accomplish its objectives within an acceptable timeframe and cost. Even if an adversary believes it could achieve success through a protracted war, Mearsheimer argues, “deterrence is nevertheless likely to obtain, largely because the protracted nature of the conflict will result in high costs.”38</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In some future scenarios, however, this threat might be insufficient to obtain effective deterrence. One central challenge for both conventional and nuclear deterrence in the twenty-first century is that the United States faces challenges from a variety of states with varying mo</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> tives, objectives, cultures, and propensity for risk-taking. Most important, while some future adversaries may be motivated to aggression by opportunity and the prospect of profit and gain, others might be motivated by some perceived necessity. According to Richard Ned Lebow, international crises and conflicts can result from a leader’s perception of an impending and detrimental change in the external security environment, such as a shift in the regional or international balance of power that jeopardizes the nation’s long-term security, or from a leader’s attempt to divert domestic attention away from internal political instabilities and turmoil to generate a “rally around the flag” effect.39 In these situations, the regime believes that it must act to prevent an even more dire outcome that might occur if they did nothing.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The distinction between states motivated by opportunity and those motivated by necessity has important and far-reaching implications for the design and implementation of effective conventional (and nuclear) deterrence strategies.40 In particular, states motivated by opportunity or necessity are likely to have different risk calculations and tolerances to costs. According to Prospect Theory, an influential model of decision-making under risk, decision-makers tend to be willing to accept significant risks and costs to prevent losing something of great value, and are more risk-averse and sensitive to costs when attempting to gain something new.41 Based partly on insights from Prospect Theory, it is now well known that decision-makers consider not only the potential costs and risks of action, but, equally important, the potential costs of inaction.42 Consequently, a state that is motivated by some perceived necessity may be willing to take substantial risks, especially if inaction is believed to result in a certain and intolerable loss. In these circumstances a leader may calculate that the costs of doing nothing outweighs the potential costs and risks of action.43</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Prospect Theory suggests that the concept of denying victory will apply differently depending on the adversary’s motivations for aggression. Since nations motivated by opportunity and the prospect of profit and gain are likely to be relatively risk-averse and sensitive to costs, the threat to prevent rapid and low-cost success will be sufficient for deterrence. Even if victory is attainable in the long-run, the prospect of a long and expensive conflict often is enough to induce caution and restraint.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Leaders motivated by the necessity to prevent losing something of value, however, may be willing to engage in a long and expensive conflict, especially if the stakes are deemed critical to national security or domestic political survival. In such cases, the ability to deny a swift and inexpensive victory may be insufficient for the purpose of achieving deterrence, since the leadership might calculate that the objectives are sufficient to run the risk of a protracted conflict. While they might still prefer a short and inexpensive conflict, and may attempt a fait accompli-type victory, they would probably be willing to engage in a longer and harder conflict if the final objectives are worthwhile. Consequently, in these cases the United States must credibly threaten to defeat the adversary, rather than simply deny the prospect of a quick and cheap victory, in the early stages of conflict so that the opponent cannot hope to eventually achieve its objectives in a protracted war. For regimes motivated by necessity, credible deterrence will not hinge on the ability to deny only a quick victory, but rather on the ability to completely defeat the opponent quickly.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The Credibility of Conventional Deterrence</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Credibility</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">, according to Sir Lawrence Freedman, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is the “magic ingredient” of deterrence</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.44 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Deterrence credibility is a function of an adversary’s assessment of a nation’s military capability and political resolve</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For deterrence to be credible, an adversary has to believe that the United States has both the military capability and the political willpower to carry out its announced objectives.45 Of all the concepts and theories associated with deterrence, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the issue of how to demonstrate or signal credibility has been the dominant theme in academic and policy literature</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Whereas in the nuclear context discussions about deterrence credibility have centered on political willpower and resolve, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in conventional deterrence the issue of credibility has focused on the military capabilities component of the credibility equation</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The almost exclusive emphasis on resolve for credible nuclear deterrence and on capabilities for credible conventional deterrence is the result of the inherent differences between nuclear and conventional weapons. There is little doubt that nuclear weapons are extremely destructive. The pertinent question for credible nuclear deterrence is not whether one can inflict significant costs for unwanted actions (assuming, of course, that the nuclear forces are survivable and there are appropriate command, control, and communications), but rather whether one will use nuclear weapons, since the execution of the threat might risk retaliation in kind. As Herman Kahn argued, in the nuclear are</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> na “credibility depends on being willing to accept the other side’s retaliatory blow. It depends on the harm he can do, not the harm we can do.”46</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> In the conventional setting, it has been advocated that the situation is essentially reversed. Given the comparatively limited power of conventional weapons, an adversary may doubt whether conventional forces are capable of denying a rapid victory or inflicting the associated costs that outweigh the benefits of aggression. As Richard Harknett explains:</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The nature of conventional forces invites skepticism at a level that few deterrence theorists have emphasized—that of capability. Due to the contestable nature of conventional forces, it is a state’s capability to inflict costs that is most likely to be questioned by a challenger. In a conventional environment, the issue of credibility is dominated by suspicions about the capability to inflict costs rather than on the decision to inflict costs . . . . In the end, a state evaluating a conventional deterrent can assume that the deterrer will retaliate. The pertinent question is how costly that response will be.47</span>

The most</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> notable environmental threats to U.S. security are:</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> • Global: competition for or threatened denial of strategic</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> resources; ozone depletion; global warming; loss of biodiversity;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; effects of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> demilitarization of nuclear, chemical, biological and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> conventional weapons; space</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> access to land, air, and water.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> • State: environmental degradation of the resource base on</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> which governmental legitimacy depends; risks to public health and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the environment from DOD activities; increasing restrictions on</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> military operations and access to air, land, and water;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> inefficient use of military resources; reduced weapons systems</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> performance; demilitarization of nuclear, chemical, and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> conventional weapons systems; and erosion of public trust.16</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Each of these categories may have global, regional or national</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> dimensions.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> East Europe and the Former Soviet Union.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is in the U.S. national interest that stable societies</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and governments emerge in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Union (FSU). Unfortunately, both regions are politically and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> economically unstable and threatened by environmental problems.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> To survive as stable entities, these governments must address the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> basic needs of their people, which requires that their societies</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are capable of producing (or acquiring) and distributing food,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> vital materials and services. The FSU's GDP growth in 1992 was</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> estimated at -18.5 percent,17 while consumer prices escalated at</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> least 70 percent during 1990-91 in FSU nations; some saw consumer</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> prices rise by approximately 125 percent.18 The nations of the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> FSU and East Europe cannot establish viable economic and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> political systems without solving some of their fundamental</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> environmental problems.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Soviet regime released untreated industrial and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> hazardous wastes into the environment at military and civilian</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> facilities in both the FSU and Eastern Europe, and pursued</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> policies leading to irreversible contamination of natural</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> resources. East Europe has some of the dirtiest coal-fired power</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> plants in the world; pollutants pose health risks and threaten</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> buildings. One well-publicized example is the Lake Baikal region,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> where agricultural irrigation practices led to catastrophic</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> damage and the destruction of agricultural lands. Mismanagement</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of nuclear production, testing, and wastes irradiated many sites.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The facility at Mayak, which produces plutonium for military</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> purposes and for handling and burying radioactive wastes, remains</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> one of the most problematic operations, due to several serious</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> accidental nuclear releases. Significant quantities of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> radioactive waste were dumped into the Techa River; large areas</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of land and approximately a half-million people were</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> irradiated.19 Moscow itself is dangerously polluted;</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> approximately 350 sources of radioactive contamination were</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> discovered in the city between 1982-1987. Since then, over 300</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> new sources of radioactive contamination have been found.20 The</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> weapons testing sites at Semipalatinsk</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> be the most contaminated site on earth by the late 1960s. The</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> contamination in waters offshore is estimated at about 1.5</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> million curies.22 Also, nuclear accidents continue to occur,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> such as the April 1993 nuclear waste explosion at Tomsk-7, a</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> military facility.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Nationally or regionally-based environmental problems in</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> these lands have direct and serious implications for economic and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> political stability. If not adequately addressed, transboundary</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> environmental problems could trigger significant economic, social</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and political disruptions within a nation or region. As more is</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> learned about the movement of pollutants and delicate ecological</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> balances, it is increasingly clear that each nation is vulnerable</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to the environmental actions of other states.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Instabilities leading to armed conflict are only one aspect</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the environmental equation. Aside from interest in the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> stability of regimes in Eastern Europe and the FSU, the United</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> States has a particular interest in the management of weapons of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> mass destruction in the former Soviet empire. Without stable</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> governments, the likelihood of mismanagement, of terrorism, or of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> black-market sales of both nuclear and conventional weapons</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> increases dramatically. There are stockpiles of extremely</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> hazardous chemical and nuclear materials in the FSU. It is not</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> clear how these materials are being safeguarded. For example,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> there may be as much as 150,000 tons of heptyl--a supertoxic, a</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> carcinogenic liquid rocket fuel used for Russian missiles--</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> stockpiled in closed production facilities and missiles. No</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> technology is known for handling it.23</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The United States has clear and immediate interests in</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> negotiating and carrying out arms reduction and safe disposal of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> weapons. These issues entail daunting technical challenges in</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> addition to the political challenge of reaching agreement. No</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> single FSU nation has the authority to determine the fate of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> these weapons. Even with effective agreements and planning, the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> danger from these weapons and the need for continuous control and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> oversight by governments will continue; some of these weapon</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> components cannot be degraded into "safe" materials in the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> foreseeable future. The complex set of tasks involved in nuclear</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> weapons destruction would be impossible if the FSU lacks</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> authoritative government actors to negotiate and execute</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> demilitarization and cannot be safely accomplished without</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Western technical assistance.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In addition to concern about the direct impacts upon</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> stability arising from environmental conditions in the FSU and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Eastern Europe, the United States must be concerned about</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> indirect transboundary effects on the rest of Europe. Some of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> those effects are obvious. Ecosystems are connected, and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> pollution does not respect national</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> waters. Groundwater contamination spreads across national</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> borders; air pollution blows across borders. Moreover, the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> political and economic consequences of environmental crises spill</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> over national and regional borders as well. For example, soil is</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> depleted by pollution and by lack of clean water; as soil is</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> degraded, agricultural productivity declines and migrations occur</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as people seek more productive farm lands. Large migrations from</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the East would create very significant economic and security</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> problems for the receiving lands, and would threaten their</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> stability. Environmental systems and processes do not remain</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> static. If effective steps are not taken to address these</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> problems, deterioration will spread.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There are economic motives for pursuing environmental</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> security. As the peoples of the FSU and Eastern Europe seek to</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> rebuild infrastructure and open new relationships, existing and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> potential economic ties are important. The region is potentially</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> very important for new markets, which the United States wants to</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> encourage for economic as well as political reasons. If these</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nations fail to meet environmental challenges or to set and meet</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> environmental goals, they will maintain severely polluting</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> industries---and attract more polluting industries. Failure to</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> meet Western environmental standards will limit trading</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> opportunities and increase local, regional and global threats to</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the environment.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Given the strong interest in the stability of this region,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> there are reasons for alarm. The catalogue of severe</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> environmental problems in the FSU keeps growing, as more is</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> learned about the conditions, and health effects data are</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> released. There is massive contamination of both air and water</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> sheds; large areas of land and surface waters have been polluted</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with hazardous and radioactive materials. One-sixth of the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> world's land mass is moving toward disaster. One of three</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> inhabitants of this territory lives in an ecological crisis zone,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> covering an area of over 4 million square kilometers,24 resulting</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in severe health effects. The former German Democratic Republic,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for example, had the largest uranium mine operations in Europe,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> which supported the USSR nuclear weapons industry. Three mines</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have over 150 million tons of uranium mill tailings, plus many</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> tons of contaminated liquids. One site, now closed, generated</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> thousands of cases of lung cancer, with more reported each</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> year.25 Neither Eastern Europe nor the FSU has the strong</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> efficient governmental infrastructure or economic resources</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> necessary to successfully assess, or more importantly, mitigate</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> these environmental threats.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Contaminated lands and livestock can destroy a state's</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ability to produce foodstuffs for many years, perhaps</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> permanently. Diminished crop and fish production, and consequent</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> food shortfalls, are consequences</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> neuro-toxic effects that impair brain function. Decrements in the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> mental as well as physical capabilities of many people would</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> affect the region's ability to build and maintain reliable armies</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and manage sophisticated socio-economic systems. The success of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> economic restructuring and political stability are</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> interconnected.

Population growth is also among the most rapid</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the world. An estimated 217.4 million people lived in the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> northeast Africa and the Middle East area in 1983. By the year</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 2000 the World Bank estimates that the population will have grown</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to 337 million or an increase of 55 percent.29 The combination</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of resource scarcity, rapid population growth, and social and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> cultural differences can be volatile.

Turkey has embarked on an ambitious</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> program to develop the water resources of these river systems.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Grand Anatolia Project, consisting of 21 dams, will provide</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> water supply, hydroelectric capacity and irrigation to Turkey.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> However, downstream water supplies to Syria and Iraq could be</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reduced by up to 40 percent and 80 percent respectively by these</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> projects.31 Syria and Iraq have protested these projects as being</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> inimical to their strategic interests, since a majority of their</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> water comes from outside their borders. In the 1970s, Iraq almost</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> went to war with Syria over the reduced flows in the Euphrates</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> produced by the filling of Turkish and Syrian dams coincident</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with a dry period.32</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Kurdish separatists fighting Turkey have also been aided by</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Syria and Iraq as a means of showing these states' displeasure</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with the Turkish water projects. As of 1992, this insurgency had</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> taken 3,500 lives.33</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Jordan River. Demand for the limited water available in this</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> basin is already substantial, and is expected to grow as</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> population increases. These waters are shared by Jordan, Syria,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Israel and Lebanon. Jordan and Israel already use more than 100</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> percent of their renewable water resources. In the past 10 years</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the Palestinian population on the West Bank has more than</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> doubled, further exacerbating differences in access to water</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> between Israel and Palestine, currently estimated at 354 cubic</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> meters/person/day (cmd) for Israelis versus 119 cmd for</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Palestinians.34</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The control over headwaters of the Jordan River has been a</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> critical strategic interest of Israel. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> War, Israel occupied these headwaters to ensure control over</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> water. These resources provide approximately 33 percent of the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> total sustainable water yield to Israel.35</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Nile River. The Nile is literally the lifeblood of Egypt.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Ninety-seven percent of Egypt's water comes from the Nile, yet</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Egypt is particularly vulnerable to impacts of upstream</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> development or diversion of water, since 95 percent of the Nile's</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> flow originates outside Egypt's boundaries, and comes from the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> other eight basin states. Additional upstream water development</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> could pose a basic strategic threat. Egypt has indicated its</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> willingness to fight to maintain its access to Nile River</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> flows.36</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Water resource issues could pose significant sources of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> conflict in the Middle East. In two of the three cases, actual</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> armed conflict has already taken place.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> further complicate the situation. Hostilities which arise over</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> water could quickly escalate to more general conflict which would</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in turn affect U.S. strategic interests related to petroleum</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> access and honoring treaty or friendship relations.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Haiti.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The manner in which environmental issues can endanger U.S.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> security interests and involve U.S. forces in life-threatening</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> conflict is demonstrated by recent events in Haiti. The United</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> States has a long economic relationship with Haiti, that, like</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its neighbor the Dominican Republic, resulted in U.S. forces</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> being sent to its shores during this century to support a</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> struggling government.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Today, Haiti is a threat to U.S. national security. The</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> flood of illegal Haitian immigrants to the United States is a</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> burden that incurs significant domestic political and diplomatic</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> costs, promotes divisive political and legal debate that has</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> diverted foreign policy resources from other more vital</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> international issues, and overwhelms the economic, health and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> human services infrastructure of the areas to which the refugees</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> arrive. Large numbers of Haitian immigrants carry the HIV virus</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and have the potential to place disproportionately high demands</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the already burdened U.S. health care system. In Haiti, the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> decline in infant mortality and the cultural norms of its</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> uneducated, rural population have caused the population rate to</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> increase from 2 to 3 percent annually since the 1970s, with</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> average fertility increasing to 6.3 children per female.37 As a</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> result, Haiti's 6 million population is expected to rise to</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> famine levels of between 9.5 and 15.5 million by 2025.38</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Moreover, diplomatic efforts to resolve the Haitian conundrum</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have divided State and Defense Departments and very nearly</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> established the precedent of introducing unprotected U.S.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> military forces into violent, life-threatening situations with no</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> clear objective or possibility of success. Haiti's political</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> difficulties stem from severe environmental degradation that</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> eroded the resource base upon which any government could be</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> successfully established.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Haiti is an example of how ignored environmental problems</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> promote instability. A country's environmental security is</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> threatened when it undergoes change in its quality of life over a</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> short period of time with limits placed on its alternative</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> responses. This can occur when overpopulation consumes elements</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the state's resource base at rates that exceed the land's</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> carrying capacity. When migration is constrained, the imbalance</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> becomes chronic. In a desperate search for</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have eroded vast quantities of topsoil, creating a loss of arable</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> land of 1 percent annually.39 Some of the effects of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> environmental degradation that have particularly important</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> national security ramifications lag behind the direct cause. The</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> requirement for energy resources in the developing world has this</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> effect.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In Haiti it was known for some time that deforestation was</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> causing social instability. In 1978, the President's Council on</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Environmental Quality (CEQ) annual report indicated that</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> deforestation was virtually complete and warned that such</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> resource degradation would result in social disruption and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> instability.40 By the mid-1980s, the Haitian peasants' continued</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> unchecked harvesting of bush and seedling trees for firewood and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> cultivation of marginal soil had denuded the landscape of soil</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> retaining flora and allowed devastating erosion and loss of soil</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> productivity. The result has been an exodus of environmental and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> political refugees to the United States with significant impacts</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on Florida's economy and social infrastructure, which continues</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to cause turbulence.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The environmental-energy linkage has profound global</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> implications. For example, the 1978 CEQ report states that for</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Ouagadougou (then Upper Volta), the forest was completely</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> stripped within a 70 kilometer circle around the urban center.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The trees had been harvested for firewood. The average laborer in</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Ouagadougou spent 20 percent of his income for fuelwood each</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> year.41 Such actions can directly affect national security</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> because deforestation can lead to desertification.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Desertification is the gradual, long-term reduction of soil's</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> productivity and resulting spread of desert-like conditions. It</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is a major cause of destabilizing migration. Most of the world's</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> drylands are at risk to the desertification processes with at</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> least one sixth of the world's population threatened.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The search for energy resources to support the economies of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the industrial states has been a national security issue for some</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> years. What has not been clear to security policymakers, however,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is the connection between political instability, environmental</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> degradation, and the energy issue. The search for family energy</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> sources in developing countries such as Haiti has led to resource</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> depletion, large scale migration and instability. DOD has the</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> institutions and technical infrastructure to help these countries</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> develop alternative energy sources that are not high-tech,</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> complicated, and</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> U.S. security interests, the Department of Defense is a logical</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> choice to execute U.S. environmental security missions. Formally</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> recognizing DOD's environmental security roles, the Secretary of</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Defense created the Office of Deputy Under Secretary of Defense</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for Environmental Security during the Clinton administration DOD</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reorganization and committed DOD to addressing important</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> international environmental issues. To determine how best to use</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> DOD in this effort, it is important to review some of its</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> environmental capabilities.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Considering its broad spectrum of operations, </span>DOD has many<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span>assets with which to mitigate environmental threats<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to national</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">security.

**Vote NEG on presumption – the 1AC is just a set of empty claims with few coherent warrants and little to no data – raising the bar for what constitutes an argument is the only way to check the escalation of lazy scholarship, overconfidence, and dogmatism**
**Powell** – management scientist and business strategy professor @ Oxford – **1** (T.C. Powell, Tutorial Fellow in Management Studies at St Hugh’s College and Professor of Strategy at Oxford’s Said Business School, “Fallibilism and Organizational Research: The Third Epistemology,” 2001, http://thomaspowell.co.uk/article_pdfs/Fallibilism_web_version.pdf)//RD
If organizational knowledge is truly achievable, then knowledge-claiming is defensible, and a contest of knowledge claims is a reasonable process for advancing organizational research. However, the role of epistemology in social science is not merely to justify our knowledge claims, but to probe the justifiability of knowledge-claiming itself. If we cannot show that organizational knowledge is possible - or in what sense such knowledge is possible, or the limitations of knowledge-claiming as an activity - then our claims to know organizational propositions are premature. Moreover, if the possibility of organizational knowledge is poorly established, or cannot be established, then the prevalence of knowledge-claiming on both sides of the organizational debate is itself a behavioral pattern worthy of investigation. The primary theme of this paper is that the possibility of organizational knowledge has neither been established nor significantly discussed in organizational research. By epistemological neglect and persistent overclaiming, the objectivist-subjectivist debate has devolved into something less than productive and progressive scholarship, resembling instead a sectarian struggle between competing and entrenched dogmatisms, or faiths. With neither party having established the grounds for knowledge-claiming, the debates consist all too often of empty persuasion and rhetorical flourish, devoid of epistemological foundation. To see how it might have been otherwise, we need only compare the dualistic debates in organizational epistemology with epistemological debates in philosophy itself. Objectivism and subjectivism did not spring forth as original insights in organizational research but emerged from long-standing Western and Eastern philosophical traditions. But in every major philosophical tradition we find a third branch of epistemology altogether absent in the two organizational perspectives – a fallibilist epistemology concerned with establishing criteria and justifications for knowledge-claiming. In philosophy, fallibilism acts as a kind of thermostat, deterring and constraining excessive knowledge claims among positivists, realists, empiricists, idealists, rationalists, 5 existentialists, etc., and thereby protecting the discipline’s epistemological integrity. Without such a constraint, epistemological debates might easily descend into semantics, extravagant overclaiming, and entrenched, increasingly-dogmatic churches of belief, as in fact we observe in organizational research.

**And, their focus on outcome-based project planning generates biased and overconfident truth-claiming**
**Buehler** – social psychology professor @ Wilfrid Laurier – **3** (Roger Buehler, professor of social psychology, Wilfrid Laurier University, and Dale Griffin, professor of marketing and advisory council chair in consumer behavior, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration, University of British Columbia, Ph.D., M.A. Stanford University, B.A. University of British Columbia, “Planning, personality, and prediction: The role of future focus in optimistic time predictions,” Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 92(1-2), Sep-Nov 2003, p.80-90, http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074959780300089X)
The results of the future focus manipulation constitute the major contribution of the present studies. These findings provide the first direct, experimental support for cognitive accounts of the planning fallacy proposed previously (Buehler et al., 1994; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). We have hypothesized that people generate overly optimistic predictions, in part, because they overweight their specific plans for a given future project and underweight more general distributional information. Because planning processes are more directly tied to stated predictions than to actual behavior (which occurs much later and is prone to unforeseeable complications) they will often exert a greater impact on predicted than actual completion times, and thus produce an optimistic prediction bias. Previous research (Buehler et al., 1994 and Buehler et al., 1997) provided correlational evidence that a future focus at the time of prediction is linked to the optimistic bias in prediction. By providing experimental evidence, we can be more confident about the causal role of these cognitive processes in producing overly optimistic forecasts. These findings also provide the first evidence we know of that inducing people to focus on specific future plans—a focus that often facilitates goal attainment—may have costs in terms of judgmental accuracy. We are currently seeking more direct evidence for our “overweighting” hypothesis by examining the effects of varying the evidence available to an observer predictor.¶ In addition to their theoretical contribution, the present findings also have clear practical implications. As noted previously, planners in organizational contexts are often expected to justify their forecasts with a concrete, step-by-step plan for implementation. The present findings suggest that requiring a detailed plan-based justification may actually accentuate the tendency to make overly optimistic forecasts and projections. Individuals and organizations seeking more realistic forecasts may be advised to adopt an alternative approach to prediction that gives less weight to plans and more weight to other potentially useful sources of information, such as distributions of completion times for related projects or the views of neutral, outside observers.¶ Is planning bad? Although we have demonstrated that plans can sometimes exert a greater impact on predicted than actual completion times, this does not mean, of course, that planning processes are usually unrelated to behavior—in the limit, the complete absence of plans would make project completion impossible. Plans are useful, even necessary, in guiding behavior but under some circumstances, at least, they seem to be overweighted relative to other sources of information that could be used to generate more realistic task completion predictions.¶ The problem of identifying conditions under which optimistic expectations to complete a project determine completion times is reminiscent of the classic social psychological problem of identifying when attitudes and associated behavioral intentions guide behavior (Ajzen, 1991; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). Two points of contact between research on attitudes and our analysis of the planning fallacy are especially noteworthy. First, an active but still controversial question in attitude research is when and how past behavior predicts future behavior independent of attitudes and intentions (Ouellette & Wood, 1998; Sheeran, Orbell, & Trafimow, 1999). Second, both the actual and perceived controllability of the task have been identified as determinants of intention-behavior consistency (Ajzen, 1991; Ajzen & Madden, 1986; Schifter & Ajzen, 1985). Thus, for some kinds of personal projects, lessons from attitude research may help to distinguish those situations in which optimistic biases are “self-correcting”—that is, when strong intentions to finish early actually lead to early completions—from situations in which past experiences are the best predictors of completion times. However, for large-scale organizational projects, such as the mega-projects we began with, a forecaster cannot control the outcome, unless she can fully dictate the resources available to the project. Similarly, many personal projects are subject to factors that are beyond the control of a person’s best intentions and efforts. For such projects, bias reduction techniques (“de-biasing”) must target the optimistic predictions themselves. These techniques have the potential to yield substantial benefits to individuals and organizations whose fate relies on the accuracy of their predictions.

1. Introduction America is in serious trouble. The problem is not “secular progressives,” as some have suggested, nor is the problem the rise of the Tea Party. I will argue that virtually all the problems facing Americans today stem from a single phenomenon: anti-intellectualism. Anti-intellectualism is not the same as ignorance. As I've written before, the fact is that everyone today knows almost nothing about most things.1 This is a direct consequence of the exponential growth of collective human knowledge: what humanity as a whole knows is expanding rapidly while the mental capacities of the individual are staying roughly the same.2 We are all unavoidably ignorant about nearly everything – politics, science, philosophy, literature, and so on. The question is how we deal with this ignorance. The anti-intellectual posture is one in which individuals are resistant, either passively or actively, to knowledge, especially when it challenges dearly held beliefs.3 It follows from this definition that an intellectualist is someone who strives for knowledge – or at least looks to the relevant experts when knowledge is lacking. Notice that an intellectualist need not be an intellectual: there is no cognitive requirement for espousing intellectualism. What makes one an intellectualist is merely a respect for evidence, facts and genuine expertise, as well as a commitment to intellectual honesty. This means putting the why of belief before the what, i.e., it means accepting a belief when and only when there are good reasons for doing so, even if one finds the belief undesirable.4 After all, true statements are true whether we want them to be or not. Already I've mentioned a lot of terms that, upon reflection, do not have obvious definitions: “facts,” “evidence,” “reasons,” “belief,” “true.” These terms are in need of philosophical clarification, and this is precisely what I want to do below. Although there is not a single claim I make here that's immune to scrutiny, the answers I give to questions like “What constitutes a good reason for believing something?” and “What is truth?” are fairly standard and well-established. Understanding them – even if one goes on to modify certain aspects of these views – will provide a robust point of reference, a grounding in philosophical positions that are widely accepted (and for good reason!). I hope readers will come away with a much better sense of what it means to be rational, of why it's deeply misguided to believe that global warming isn't real, that evolution didn't happened, that Jesus ministered in North America after his resurrection, that Muhammad was the last great prophet of Allah, that homosexuals shouldn't be allowed to marry, that Jesus healed a blind man with mud made from spittle, that the world will end in December 2012 because of the Mayan calendar, and so on. 2. Truth Let's begin with two questions: first, What sort of things can be true or false? And second, What must be the case for things of this sort (whatever they are) to count as true rather than false? These are crucial questions that a deep understanding of truth requires one to think about. There are many possible candidates for what can have the properties of being true or being false. One thing that cannot is, for example, a chair. (Bear with me for a moment!) A chair can be neither true nor false by its very nature, just as justice can be neither short nor tall and the number three can have no mass or weight. What about a desire for something? Can that be true or false? This is a less obvious case than the chair, but it turns out that desires are in the exact same category. That is to say, desires and chairs are not “truth-evaluable” types of things. My desire for coffee isn't either true or false, it just is. One could, of course, talk about whether or not it's true that I desire coffee, but now we're talking about something else, not the desire itself. What are we talking about, then? The best answer – and the one most widely accepted by contemporary philosophers (who spend their days thinking about such issues) – is that propositions are what exhibit the properties of being true and being false. Not chairs, desires, cars, love, hopes, justice, apples, and so on, but propositions. These are the only kinds of things in the entire universe that are truth-evaluable: if it's not a proposition, then it's not true, yet it's not false either. It's in a different category altogether. But what exactly are propositions? A proposition is simply a description of reality, of some possible configuration of the world or state of affairs. Examples of propositions include: “Lazarus rose from the dead,” “The US has the best health care system in the world,” “I ate the last piece of bread this morning,” “Vishnu created the universe,” “God is three completely distinct persons who are also completely identical in substance.” Propositions are what constitute the contents of beliefs – i.e., they are what beliefs are about. Beliefs, then, are a kind of (what contemporary philosophers call) “propositional attitude.” This means that the word “belief” picks out a specific sort of relation that holds between two things: individuals and propositions.5 Note there are many different relations, or “attitudes,” that one can have toward a proposition. One could, for instance, hope that Lazarus rose from the dead, hate that I ate the last piece of bread this morning, maintain that God is three-in-one, and so on. The relation of believing specifically involves an individual asserting that a given proposition is a true description of reality – of what the world is like or how it works. This is what it means to believe something. (In contrast, the relation of desiring has to do with the way one thinks reality ought to be, independent of how it actually is. All propositional attitudes can be more or less reduced to either beliefs – “informational” in nature – or desires – “directional” in nature, in that they involve one wanting the world to be a certain way.6) This leads us to the second question posed above: What are the conditions under which a proposition can count as true rather than false? One way to answer this question is to think of propositions as little maps inside our heads – that is, maps of reality. An actual map is an idealized description of the world (or some spatiotemporal region therein). Whereas an actual map typically provides this description graphically, pictorially or imagistically, the mental maps inside our brains can be expressed in linguistic form.7 This being said, an actual map is “true” when it accurately corresponds to the region of the world it aims to represent. In exactly the same way, the maps inside our heads – i.e., the contents of our beliefs – are true when and only when they can be mapped onto reality without error. A proposition is true when what is says the world is like lines up with what reality is actually like.8 The goal of rational agents like ourselves is to get the vast network of mental maps that form our worldviews to align as completely as possible with the external world in which we live. When we achieve such an alignment, our worldviews are true; when there's a mismatch between our beliefs and reality, then the mental maps we hold are false and should be abandoned. The question now becomes: How do we get our beliefs to line up with the external world? When is one justified in holding a given proposition? Under what conditions can one be confident that what a given proposition says about reality lines up with reality itself? 3. Evidence The questions posed above are variations of this: What makes it reasonable for one to accept a given belief about the world as true? In over two-thousand years of Western thought, the best answer that philosophers have come up with is that evidence, and only evidence, is what makes accepting a belief reasonable.9 In the absence of evidence, a belief will be unreasonable to believe. As the “evidentialist” maxim goes, one should always proportion one's beliefs to the evidence: if there's only a little evidence for a belief A, then A should be held with only a little confidence; if there's a lot of evidence for A, then A should be held with a lot of confidence. At the extreme, when there's overwhelming evidence for A, we may start talking about A as a fact. The claim that biological organisms have evolved for 3.5 billion years on Earth is so thoroughly corroborated by heaps of evidence from a variety of different domains that evolution as an historical event is virtually certain. Biologists consider it to be a fact. Same goes for the link between smoking and cancer, the claim that the earth revolves around the sun (and not vise versa), and the assertion that Obama was born in the United States. In sum, evidence makes beliefs more probable, and what “being reasonable” means is nothing more than holding less probable beliefs less strongly and more probable beliefs more strongly.10 While evidence increases the chances that a given belief is an accurate map of reality, it cannot guarantee truth. An exception comes from logic: one can use logical reasoning to prove, with the greatest certainty possible, that propositions like “There are no circles with corners” and “If Socrates is a man and all men are mortal, then Socrates is mortal” are true, and that propositions like “Jesus could doubt the existence of God” are false. (Jesus couldn't doubt the existence of God because, on the assumption that trinitarianism is true, Jesus was God, and an omniscient deity can't be unsure of its own existence.) This suggests a difference between proof and probability: logic can sometimes be used to prove certain beliefs; in most cases, though, the best one can do is establish that a belief is more or less likely to be true. Absolute certainty is unattainable. But why? The answer is that it's always possible in principle for a future piece of evidence to refute some previously-justified-by-the-evidence belief. You can never know for sure what you're going to discover tomorrow. Although there is overwhelming evidence for the proposition that species have evolved over time, it still remains possible for paleontologists to discover an animal fossil that dates from before the Cambrian explosion, when animals first appeared on Earth. Given the current evidence, such a discovery is highly improbable. But improbability does not equal impossibility.11 Relying on the evidence to shape and mold one's belief system thus leads to fallibilism, the view that one could be wrong about virtually anything. It also explains why “flip-flopping” – typically considered a sin among politicians – can sometimes be a good thing. The important question is “Why?.” If the reason for flip-flopping is that some new piece of evidence is uncovered that makes a previously unreasonable belief reasonable to accept (or vice versa), then changing views is highly rational. But if one changes views for non-evidential reasons – for example, because one thinks it will get one more votes, or because of pressure from a special-interest group – then flip-flopping is wrong and should be denounced. For the fallibilist, what ultimately matters is the why behind the belief rather than the what – in other words, reasons over content.12 The network of mental maps that one holds thus changes freely in response to the evidence (as it comes in), even when the most reasonable belief is not a belief that one wants to accept. While evidence cannot guarantee truth, as defined above, philosophers recognize that it's nonetheless our very best guide to the truth. (I'm reminded of Winston Churchill's famous claim that democracy may or may not be a very good form of government, but it's certainly the best we've ever tried!13) Consider the historical case of geocentrism and heliocentrism. The first hypothesis asserts that the sun revolves around the earth, whereas the second asserts that the earth goes around the sun.14 At some point in our past, the best evidence humans had to arbitrate between these two hypotheses was unaided observations of the sun apparently rising and setting each day, and the sensation of standing on an ostensibly stationary body. Relative to this extremely limited pool of evidence, geocentrism is the most reasonable position. Thus, the available evidence actually led us to a false belief. But over time, as more observations were made, as the pool of evidence grew larger and its quality got better, the evidence came to support heliocentrism over geocentrism. Intellectually honest people began to doubt geocentrism and accept the heliocentric model of the Solar System, even though the Catholic Church taught the exact opposite. Today, a vast pool of evidence corroborates the theory that the earth isn't stationary but moves around the sun once every ~365 days. We're so sure about this now, given the available evidence, that we call heliocentrism a fact. In this way, then, the evidence fallibilistically guided us to the truth, although the journey first took a detour through a falsehood. Beliefs not only need to be based on some evidence to be justified, warranted and reasonable to accept, but they must be based on one's total evidence. For example, a belief A might be supported by pieces of evidence 1, 2 and 3. But another belief B – a belief that is mutually incompatible with A – might be supported by pieces of evidence 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. If all the evidence here is of roughly the same value / quality, then the reasonable belief would be B rather than A, even though A has some positive evidential support. Furthermore, if the evidence for two competing beliefs is of equal strength, then the reasonable position is agnosticism. Finally, we should note that the word “evidence” is often used in different ways by different people. Some of these uses are problematic. For example, religious individuals around the world often take their inner feelings of the God or gods in which they believe – i.e., religious experiences – as evidence for their various religious beliefs. While a Muslim might claim to feel the presence of Allah around him during prayer, a Christian might talk about how God “called” him to pursue a career as a pastor. A Buddhist might similarly talk about obtaining nirvana, and a fortune-teller about seeing the future. I knew someone who spent two months in a coma and, upon waking, claimed to have met Jesus, Muhammad and the Buddha, all of whom apprised him that the organized religions of the world are all wrong. This was a life-changing experience for him – and he's not the only one who's gone through such an ordeal.15 The problem here is that this “evidence” is not intersubjectively verifiable. It is subjective rather than objective in nature and, as such, it cannot be checked by third parties. As a result, one can do nothing more than merely take someone else's word for it – the Christian's, the Muslim's, the Hindu's, the Buddhist's, and so on. Thus, checkability is important is because it ensures that the “evidence” uncovered through some experience is not the result of three possible things: delusion (a schizophrenic person believing that God is talking to him or her16), self-deception (a sincere individual who's gullible and gets carried away with some belief), or trickery by another person (a demagogue who fools people into believing nonsense). When third parties can check a given claim, that claim becomes more secure – and the more independent observers, the better, for obvious reasons. A similar point can be made about essentially singular events in history. Many religions are theologically founded on supernatural occurrences that have, and maybe can only have, happened once. (Very often these events occurred among peoples who lacked scientific understanding and insight. Seizures are, for us today, fully explicable in terms of uncontrolled neural activity in the brain, but for individuals in Jesus' time, seizures would have been attributed to supernatural phenomena like demon possession or prophetic visions.17) The Mormon religion, for example, claims that Joseph Smith was visited by the angel Moroni. This is a crucial event in the narrative of Mormonism's birth. Similarly, the New Testament states that Mary was visited by the angel Gabriel who informed her that “thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son.” And Muhammad also claimed to have communicated with Gabriel, who revealed to him the Koran over a span of 23 years. A nearly endless list of revelations had by individuals in mutually incompatible religious traditions across cultural space and time could be mentioned here. The problem is that non-repeatable events are much easier to lie about, to be self-deceived about, and to be faked by people hoping to fool others. What if I were to tell you that last night God visited me in my room and told me that the world will end next Tuesday? Since this event can't happen again – it's non-repeatable – and since you can't travel back in time to sneak into my room and double check that I'm not lying to you, that I wasn't hallucinating after taking an Ambien, or that my partner wasn't playing a well-orchestrated joke on me, your only option (aside from rejecting it as highly improbable) is to simply take my word for it. In contrast, the reason historians accept singular historical events like the assassination of Franz Ferdinand is because there are heaps of independent evidence that make belief in Ferdinand's assassination rational. What independent evidence is there that the Apostle Paul had a “direct revelation from Jesus Christ” (Galatians 1:11) or that Joseph Smith spoke with Moroni? Virtually none. So, if you're skeptical about my supernatural encounter last night, then you should also be skeptical about the veridicality of Paul's claims and Joseph Smith's claims and Muhammad's claims and Brian David Mitchell's claims (etc.) – that is, given the best evidence available to us in the twenty-first century. In sum, total evidence is what justifies beliefs about reality. This evidence should be public in nature and (preferably, in some way) repeatable. A bone from Homo habilis, for instance, can be observed by multiple people at different points in time, and a collision of lead ions at a particle accelerator like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN can later be repeated by others in different places. A feeling that the divine is present and a revelation of some supernatural being characteristically cannot be checked by (dis)interested third parties. 4. Science and Religion This points at a fundamental difference between science and religion. Whereas religious doctrines are typically accepted in the absence of objective, third-person checkable evidence (this is what religious faith is all about18), there isn't a single widely accepted scientific theory that isn't supported by loads of intersubjective / repeatable evidence. When it comes to science, no one is required to simply take someone else's word for it – you can always go and see for yourself if you have even the slightest bit of doubt. (The only restrictions here are practical rather than principled. That is to say, some claims made by scientists might be difficult for non-experts to verify, but only because non-experts lack the requisite knowledge, skills and instrumentation to see for themselves. Thus, with the right education and technology, anyone can examine a Homo habilis bone or “read” an image of lead ions colliding in a particle accelerator.) This is no trivial point. The central reason that science has been so phenomenally successful at telling us what our universe is like and how it works is that it adopts the strict – but nonetheless commonsensical – requirement that beliefs must always be based on evidence. Whereas science begins with the evidence, which is uncovered through empirical investigation (in the field) and experimentation (in the lab), and then moves to beliefs, religion begins with beliefs and then tries to get the available evidence to fit a pre-established worldview. Religion is founded on immutable truths and infallible doctrines; science is open to virtually any claim about the world just as long as the evidence supports it. In fact, much of what science tells us about the world (especially the macroscopic and microscopic levels of reality, which we didn't have to understand in order to survive in our past evolutionary environment) is highly unintuitive.19 That is to say, a thoroughly intuitive strategy for acquiring knowledge – simply “looking and seeing,” as occurs with scientific investigation and experimentation – has led to a vast number of propositions that stretch the imaginative capacities of human beings to the limits.20 Contemporary science tells us that mass and energy are equivalent; species are not fixed through time; the universe began with a “big bang” some 13.5 billion years ago; our ancestors were ape-like creatures that evolved in East Africa; matter is literally 99.9% empty space; and so on. At first glance, these are all (admittedly so!) outrageous claims. But every one is secure beyond a reasonable doubt, since all are based on a great deal of objective evidence. Science doesn't care what the belief is, it cares about why one should accept it.21 Some people criticize science for not providing the sort of “certainty” that religions like Christianity and Islam claim to offer. Science often changes its mind – it flip-flops on issues. But this is exactly what one should expect from an evidence-based, truth-seeking enterprise. Imagine that you have a jigsaw puzzle consisting of 1,000 pieces on the table before you, and that you have no idea what the puzzle's picture is. Randomly scattered about, the pieces are no help. After putting 50 pieces together you see a bluish cloud; another 50 reveals a face. A guess (or hypothesis) at this point will probably be incorrect, but you're nonetheless starting to get some idea of what the picture might be. As you fit more and more pieces together, your guesses will tend to improve in accuracy. With 900 pieces locked in place, you might be able to recognize the picture as (let's say) Paul Gauguin's famous Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In this way, your hypotheses got better over time as the “evidence” available to you increased.22 Science is exactly like this: it provides increasingly accurate approximations of truth as the pool of available evidence grows deeper and wider. This is why science sometimes flip-flops – but not the way politicians often do, the bad way mentioned above. When it comes to deciding which beliefs to accept, all that matters to science are the reasons one can adduce, and the belief system (interconnected theories and hypotheses) accepted by the scientific community is always responsive to newly discovered checkable evidence. The tentative nature of scientific beliefs is not a vice, but one of science's greatest virtues. To paraphrase Stephen Hawking, the problem with the world today is not ignorance but the appearance of knowledge when there is none.23 5. Faith While many Americans cringe at the word “atheism” – in fact, atheists are the least trusted demographic in the US, even behind Muslims, feminists, homosexuals and rapists24 – referring to oneself as a “person of faith” tends to earn respect and admiration. In 2012, it's virtually inconceivable that an open atheist could become the President of the United States, and six states still explicitly ban atheists from holding public office (Arkansas, Texas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi and Maryland). From a philosophical point of view, though, the sort of faith exemplified by religious belief is highly problematic. Indeed, accepting propositions about how reality is and ought to be merely on faith is profoundly foolish and, in our increasingly technologized world, immensely dangerous. Allow me to explain. There are many different senses of “faith.” The most general definition is trust in someone or something. Defined as such, faith involves a relation between two individuals, such as a Muslim and Allah or a Christian and God. But when people talk about having faith that God is real and he loves them very much, for example, they're not using this sense of “faith.” The reason is that “God is real and he loves me very much” isn't an individual, but a proposition. Thus, in addition to the trust sense of the word (sometimes called the fiducial meaning), there is also a propositional sense. It's this sense that figures centrally in discussions of whether or not religious belief is reasonable, since faith in so-and-so isn't truth-evaluable – it's neither true nor false, like the chair I'm sitting on or my desire for coffee – but faith that such-and-such can indeed be evaluated for truth. Thus, philosophers characterize propositional faith as a species (or type) of belief. It's worth noting here that knowledge too is a species of belief. According to the most widely held theory (first put forth by Plato), knowledge can be analyzed into three components: belief, truth and justification. In other words, you can't know a proposition P if P fails to be justified; if P turns out to be false; and if you don't believe P in the first place. All three must be satisfied, and as soon as all three are, you've got knowledge.25 Thus, while some science writers like to exclaim that biologists don't believe in evolution, they know it, this is very misleading. All knowing involves believing, but not all believing involves knowing.26 This is what makes knowledge a species of belief.27 We discussed above that, according to the most widely held and commonsensical view (evidentialism), “being justified” amounts to a belief being favored by one's total evidence. Whereas knowledge requires evidential support, the word “faith” picks out a kind of belief that fails to be based on the best evidence available. In some cases, faith involves accepting a belief not merely in the absence of supporting evidence, but in the presence of contradictory evidence. The existence of an immortal soul provides an example: everything we know about how the brain works and its relation to our thoughts, feelings, moral judgments, consciousness, personality, memories, and so on, suggests strongly that the “soul,” as traditionally understood, cannot exist apart from the brain. This is why a large majority of researchers in neuroscience, cognitive science, neurobiology, evolutionary biology, and the philosophy of mind reject the view that our souls / minds can float free of our brains. (Even many God-believing theologians in the twentieth century abandoned the traditional position in favor of a more evidentially-informed materialistic worldview!28) Yet a majority of the religious flock around the world, in the US, still accepts a body-soul metaphysics, called “substance dualism,”29 according to which the mind is not dependent upon the brain for its existence. Given the intersubjectively verifiable evidence to the contrary, the only way to continue believing in immortal souls is through either faith or ignorance. 6. Politics Although the domain of religion provides the clearest examples of faith – dogmatic belief without the support of checkable evidence – one can find faith in many other domains. One can, indeed, adopt atheism out of faith. The crucial question that everyone should always ask in every situation is: Why does one believe whatever it is that one believes? If one accepts atheism simply because “Richard Dawkins was such a dashing young man!,” then one is no better than (say) the Mormon who thinks that Joseph Smith really did translate golden plates with hieroglyphics written on them using seer stones inside his hat.30 It follows that what the world needs now more than ever before is not more atheists per se, but more people who care most of all about the evidence, who strive to put the why before the what, who champion the humble attitude of fallibilism – who are, in a word, intellectualists. As far as I can tell, the evidence does favor atheism more than any alternative. It follows that insofar as this is true, intellectualism will naturally lead to atheism. But beliefs like atheism should always be the destination, not the point-of-departure.31 As alluded to above, politics is a domain in which faith shows up quite often. Is “Obamacare” a “government takeover of health care”? This has been repeated ad nauseum by conservative pundits and politicians. But the evidence suggests that it's absolutely false. The non-partisan fact-checking organization PolitiFact even labeled it the 2010 “Lie of the Year.” Similarly, Sarah Palin has famously stated over and over again that Obamacare would result in the formation of “death panels” that would decide the fate of elderly people. This too is absolutely false. Accepting these beliefs thus requires a good dose of faith – it requires that one disregard and ignore the best evidence available. As a result, rather than having a genuine, honest and sophisticated discussion about the pros and cons of healthcare reform, anti-intellectualism muddled the entire debate. And when 50 million Americans don't have health insurance and some 45,000 die each year from their lack of access to medical care,32 this is no trivial thing.33 Although anti-intellectualism can be found on both sides of the political spectrum, it's far more prevalent on the conservative right. Consider Fox News, whose motto could hardly be more Orwellian: “Fair and balanced.” Numerous studies have shown that Fox News viewers are significantly more misinformed than any other demographic – including those who don't watch any news at all. These studies have focused on a variety of issues, from the overthrow of the Egyptian government to the Iraq War to health care to the 2010 election to the reality of global warming.34 As a professor of political science who published a paper on how knowledgeable people were about the Egyptian and Syrian uprisings put it, “Because of the controls for partisanship, we know these results are not just driven by Republicans or other groups being more likely to watch Fox News. Rather, the results show us that there is something about watching Fox News that leads people to do worse on these questions than those who don't watch any news at all.”35 A similar study conducted by the University of Maryland found that there exists an actual correlation between watching Fox News and holding beliefs that are factually untrue. On the flip side, the most educated group of people in the country – academics, professors – are overwhelmingly liberal. One study found that 72% of US professors consider themselves liberal, while only 15% self-identify as conservative. (The results were skewed even more at the most prestigious schools, where 87% are liberal and 13% conservative.)36 There's no big mystery here. As one philosopher writes, “[I]f you actually take the time to look at history and culture, certain conclusions about human nature, society, and economics tend to force themselves on you. … [M]ost of those in the liberal arts have concluded that there really isn't any other intellectually respectable way to interpret the broad contours of history and culture. They are liberal, in other words, by deliberate and reasoned choice, based upon the best available evidence.”37 Or, to quote the comedian Stephen Colbert, “[R]eality has a well-known liberal bias.” The whole job of the academic is to get closer to reality, to construct increasingly accurate maps of what the world is like and how it works. While liberals dominate in academia, conservatives often express ambivalence about or outright opposition to education and the mode of analytic / critical thinking it promotes. For example, the Texas GOP said the following in it's official 2012 platform: “We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs ...” And why not oppose critical thinking if you're a religious conservative?38 We now have controlled studies that establish a causal link between analytic thinking and religious disbelief, such as one published this year (2012) in Science.39 With respect to IQ, multiple studies have reported that liberals are, on average, more intelligent than conservatives. One study published in Psychological Science found that adults with low intelligence tend to adopt socially conservative views,40 while another in Social Psychology Quarterly found that adolescents with the highest IQs were the most likely to identify as “very liberal” and those with the lowest IQs most often identified as “very conservative.” Individuals of average intelligence, according to this same study, tended to identify as “middle of the road” centrists.41 The resulting situation is very worrisome. Consider the phenomenon of global warming. While 20% of Democrats thought that global warming is “exaggerated” by the news in a 2011 Gallup Poll, 67% of Republicans held this position.42 As mentioned above, Fox News viewers are disproportionately misinformed about the reality of anthropogenic climatic changes. (I'll never forget the Fox News website putting up a “You Decide” survey on the question “Has the sea level risen?”) This is no trivial thing either. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which maintains a “Doomsday Clock” that symbolizes the likelihood of a global catastrophe, recently added global warming to its list of doomsday concerns. As the Bulletin states, the “dangers posed by climate change are nearly as dire as those posed by nuclear weapons.” The fact is that global warming is human-caused and potentially catastrophic – beyond a reasonable doubt. Yet a large number of Americans, especially conservatives, refuse to even accept that climate change is happening.43 One consequence of global warming is the loss of biodiversity. Humans depend on other living creatures – on the biosphere – for our continued existence. But few people realize that we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction event in the entire 3.5 billion year history of life on Earth.44 (The last mass extinction event happened about 65 million years ago and resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs.45) Species are dying out at up to 10,000 times the normal “background” rate of extinction.46 According to the 3rd Global Biodiversity Outlook report, the population of vertebrates – birds, mammals, reptiles, sharks, fish, rays, and so on – living in the tropics declined by a whopping 59% in only 36 years (between 1970 and 2006). Furthermore, 48% of all primates alive in 2012 were threatened by extinction;47 50% of turtles and tortoises are near extinction;48 33% of amphibians (considered to be “ecological indicators”) are facing extinction;49 33% of birds in the US are endangered;50 up to 18% of all animals, fungi and plants in the US are in danger of going extinct;51 and so on. There are, in addition, over 400 “dead zones” in the ocean as a result of human-made pollution.52 Conditions in these dead zones are such that all marine life except algae will suffocate due to a lack of oxygen. And a shocking paper published in 2012 by over 20 scientists and published in Nature warns that, based on the best available evidence, humanity faces an imminent and irreversible collapse of the global ecosystem.53 Some conservatives accuse environmentalists of being alarmists about global warming, biodiversity loss, and related phenomena. But being alarmed is not the same as being an alarmist; conservative critics confuse two distinct phenomena. Simply put, alarmism involves being more alarmed than the evidence warrants. One should, following the evidentialist maxim above, always proportion one's alarm to the evidence. No one would accuse an individual who's being chased by a lion in the African savanna of alarmism, no matter how alarmed he or she may be. Thus, given the facts mentioned just above, people positively ought to be alarmed – very alarmed – about our current predicament, about the dwindling probability that human civilization will survive the coming centuries. There is, in fact, a burgeoning new discipline in which “existential risks” – i.e., catastrophes of global scope and terminal intensity that can, by definition, only happen once in a species' history54 – are being studied by scientists and philosophers. According to these “secular eschatologists,” the chance of humanity bringing about its own demise is frighteningly high. Estimates of self-annihilation typically range from 25% to 50% in the present century.55 We truly are living in unprecedented times.56 7. Conclusion A democracy can only function if the voting population is informed about the relevant issues. The anti-intellectualism that lies deep within American culture is a profound and dangerous obstruction to a healthy democracy – to solving the very serious problems facing human beings today, from global warming to a broken US health care system. There has never been a time in human history when it's been more important for people to pay attention to the evidence, to put the why over the what (i.e., think critically), to make their belief systems responsive to the facts as they come in, to be intellectually honest even if it means abandoning dearly held beliefs, and to recognize that faith is never a good reason for accepting a proposition about reality. What's frustrating is that solutions to problems like climate change are out there – they are! – but experts can't even begin a productive public discussion about them because a large portion of the public thinks global warming isn't even real. There are sophisticated debates to be had about the merits of different kinds of health care systems, but we can't even begin to have these until political leaders stop confounding public discourse with talk of “death panels” and warnings of a “government takeover.” Until this unfortunate and deeply irresponsible situation changes, the present and future of humanity will remain precarious. I hope this paper can help clear the waters a little bit by providing easily digestible definitions of basic philosophical concepts like truth, justification and evidence – concepts upon which intellectual activities and endeavors of every sort are fundamentally based. In sum, adopting the stance of intellectualism is, I believe, a necessary first step that we all must take to save the world from disaster. A technologically advanced society with the capacity for self-annihilation cannot be run by people of faith, by people whose worldviews are shaped more by ideology and revealed “truths” than empirical facts and logical reasoning. To borrow a phrase from Bertrand Russell, humanity must strive to have a “robust sense of reality” if we want to prosper on our increasingly crowded spaceship Earth.57

The theoretical basis for communicative rationality is then presented. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This</span> definition <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is used to </span>sketch the general <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">outline</span>s of<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> a new form of transportation planning based on</span> the concept of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">communicative rationality</span>. Discussions of transportation planning processes in general and a case study of a particular transportation planning issue (parking policy for fixed rail transit) are used to illustrate the general features of a communicative approach and how they differ from conventional practices. The paper concludes with an assessment of the promise of communicative rationality for transportation planning, arguing that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">communicative rationality can form a new transportation planning paradigm that addresses the problems of </span>the<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> coming decades in an innovative way. </span>The orthodoxy of transportation planning process: Instrumental rationality and objectivity //The predominant method of transportation planning is instrumental rationality//, //a process ofoptimizing// means (//plans// and programs) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">according to identified</span> ends (<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">goals). Instrumental rationality requires that the desired ends of a unitary decision-maker can be known.</span> It assumes that efficient means can be identified using algorithm-like methods. Instrumental rationality bases reason on logic and scientific empiricism. It maintains that what we know is based on what we can observe in a neutral and dispassionate manner. Furthermore, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it assumes that </span>urban and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">transportation systems operate in </span>mechanistic, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">predictable ways </span>– that immutable laws about travel behavior can be discovered and used for prediction. Finally, instrumental rationality assumes that the actors in a planning process are autonomous individuals who refine their knowledge against universal principles, and that planning roles can be divided into various analysis, evaluation and decision-making tasks. In this model, planning activities focus on analytic issues such as modeling and forecasting, impact analysis and economic evaluation.

For planning, however, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">gridlock is not gridlock until we have defined it as a problem and decided to do something to address it. Transportation plans depend on what gridlock means</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and establishing meaning is an inherently social </span>and linguistically <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">based process. The way that transportation planners use language</span> – <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">understanding certain</span> ideas and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">values and excluding others</span>, hearing some things and not hearing others, and defining roles for themselves, their organizations, decision makers and the public – <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">shapes knowledge</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">public participation</span>, problem definition, process design and negotiation, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the outcome of planning.</span> The perspective offered in this paper is that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">language profoundly shapes our view of the world. The paper critically examines the formal </span>//scientific rationality// //that dominates the field// <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and uses</span> insights from planning practice, social theory and philosophy to explore the promise of //communicative rationality//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> as a new paradigm for transportation planning</span> – <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">one in which language and communicative processes form the basis for </span>rational <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">planning.

The </span>global <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">aim of communicative rationality is</span> to create a rational basis for constructing ends and means in a democratic society, by <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">enriching public </span>and political <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">discourse. Communicative rationality focuses on interactive processes rather than the deliberative process of a single actor</span>, emphasizing the design of planning processes, participation and learning, and a reconciliation of different ways of understanding planning opportunities. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It reorients planning from </span>a form of//scientific, instrumental rationality//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to</span> a form of reason based on //consensual discussion//.1





Extinction is inevitable without direct democracy – only the alt spills over

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Gare ‘3 </span>

Arran, Swinburne University social sciences professor, Swinburne University, Melbourne, Australia, Ph.D. from Murdoch University, "Beyond Social Democracy? Beyond Social Democracy?" Democracy and Nature, 9(3), Nov 2003, via EBSCO database

In the new order, the state’s role, along with a range of new institutional structures ranging from the local to the international level, is exclusively to create the stable framework for the efficient functioning of the market. Although this phase extends the market into the Third World, power is concentrated as never before with the elites of the core zones. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Civil society has dissolved almost completely</span>, people have been brutalized, and politics and democracy rendered superfluous. Only a small minority of the world population, mostly in a few affluent regions in North America, Western Europe and East Asia are benefiting from these developments. And <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the consequence </span>of the internationalization of the market economy and the concentration of economic power it engenders, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is ‘an ecological crisis that threatens to develop into </span>an //eco-catastrophe//, the destruction of the countryside, the creation of monstrous mega-cities and the uprooting of local communities and cultures’ (p. 116). Fotopoulos argues that with liberalized commodity and capital markets, the internationalization of the market economy with an over-riding commitment to economic growth, it is impossible to regulate the market to control its destructive imperatives. Any country that attempts to do so (for instance Sweden), will lose its international competitiveness (p. 86ff). Market efficiency in an internationalized economy and social control of the market are irreconcilable. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This </span>argument <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">provides the background for</span> the defence of //inclusive democracy//. Going beyond efforts to democratize industrial production and focusing on the community rather than merely the economy, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the project of inclusive democracy encompasses</span> the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">political, economic, social and ecological realms</span>; that is, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">any area of</span> human activity <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">where decisions can be taken collectively and democratically.</span> Democracy is defined as the ‘institutional framework that aims at the equal distribution of political, economic and social power. . . in other words, as the system which aims at the effective elimination of the domination of human beings over human being’ (p. 206f). Ecological democracy is defined as the institutional framework that aims to reintegrate humans and nature. The original example of genuine democracy (although it was confined to a small proportion of the total population) is taken to be ancient Athens of Pericles. The liberal ‘democracies’ of the modern world, social democratic models and Marxist socialism that reduce politics to the scientific management of production, are dismissed as various forms of oligarchy. Fotopoulos traces the history of these social forms, claiming them to be perversions of the democratic ideal. Fotopoulos offers an historical, social and economic analysis of ancient Greek democracy to show what true democracy is and the conditions for its success. The basis of democracy must be the choice of people for individual and collective autonomy. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Political decisions should be made by citizens collectively in community assemblies, </span>//not through representatives.// Positions to which authority is delegated should be filled by lot on a rotation basis. All residents in a particular geographical area should be directly involved in decision-taking processes and should be educated to enable them to do so. Political rights should be accompanied by social and economic rights and, to ensure this, productive resources should be owned by the demos (the people). In one of the most important sections of the book, Fotopoulos provides a detailed model of a production and distribution system simulating and gaining the benefits of a market economy while avoiding the destructive effects of real markets. This involves a combination of democratic planning and a voucher system, securing the satisfaction of basic needs for everyone while enabling individuals to maintain their sovereignty as consumers. Satisfaction of basic needs involving more than one community should be coordinated through a confederal plan formulated in regional and confederal assemblies made up of delegates. Fotopoulos shows how such a system could be made workable economically and politically. The point of offering such a model is not to prescribe how people should organize themselves but to demonstrate that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">direct democracy is feasible</span>. Fotopoulos argues <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we do not have to wait for the conditions for inclusive democracies to evolve</span>//. They can be created at almost any time,// although it is easier at some times rather than others. Fotopoulos argues that to escape the destructive imperatives and brutalizing effects of the present order, ‘The immediate objective should. . . be the creation, frombelow, of “popular bases of political and economic power”, that is, the establishment of local and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">public realms of direct</span> and economic <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">democracy</span> which, at some stage, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will confederate in order to create </span>the<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> conditions for </span>the establishment of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a new society’ </span>(p. 284). This struggle must be undertaken simultaneously at the political, economic, social and cultural levels. The final part of the book is devoted to the philosophical justification of inclusive democracy. Essentially, Fotopoulos develops Castoriadis’ arguments that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the core</span> of democracy <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is</span> autonomy—the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">freedom </span>of people<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to be self-instituting</span>, that is, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to </span>be able to put into question and//transform// their //existing institutions//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and the</span>ir //dominant social paradigm// (beliefs, ideas and values).1 Any philosophy that denies the possibility of such autonomy is criticised.In particular, Fotopoulos attacks those who see democracy as the outcome of something other than the free choice of people, whether this be the truths of religion, the laws of nature, the cunning of reason or the evolution of society. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The question</span> then <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is whether people are prepared to struggle for democracy now</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">given that</span> their <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">failure to do so not only </span>means accepting their <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">subjugatio</span>n and brutalization, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">but </span>also <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the destruction of the ecological conditions </span>//of their existence.//

Framing issue – rail supporters suffer from massive optimism bias – you should be highly skeptical of the aff’s evidence

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">O’Toole 10</span>(Randal, Senior Fellow at Cato Institute, “High Speed Rail,” June, http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/transportation/high-speed-rail)

1. Costs and Ridership. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Proponents of high-speed rail projects tend to overstate their benefits and understate their costs.</span> Danish planning professor Bent Flyvbjerg has studied hundreds of government megaprojects, and he argues that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">project supporters suffer from "optimism bias" </span>regarding the merits of projects, and that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">they often "strategically misrepresent" project details</span> in order to gain support.30 No high-speed rail line has been built from scratch in the United States. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">historically, urban passenger rail projects have, on average, gone 40 percent over their projected costs</span>. At the same time, U.S. passenger rail <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">planners typically overestimate ridership by an average of about 100 percent</span>.31 California's high-speed rail authority is projecting that the San Francisco to Los Angeles line will be carrying two to three times more passengers by 2020 than Amtrak's entire Boston to Washington corridor currently carries.32 A Reason Foundation review of the state rail authority's plan called the ridership projections "the most unrealistic projections produced for a major transport project anywhere in the world."33 A report on the California project from the state's Senate Transportation Committee pointed to many major risks of the project, including inaccurate forecasting, uncertainly regarding rights-of-way, and substantial safety issues.34 Unlike running a bus system or even an airline, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">building a rail line requires accurate long-range forecasting. Planning and construction can take many years, and the service life of rail lines is measured in decades. A seemingly minor forecasting error—or a deliberately optimistic estimate—can turn what appears to be a sound investment into an expensive white elephant.</span>



No impact to economic collapse – empirics prove

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Miller 2K</span> (Morris Miller, economist, adjunct professor in the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of Administration, consultant on international development issues, former Executive Director and Senior Economist at the World Bank, “Poverty as a cause of wars?” Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, 2000, p.273)

The question may be reformulated. Do wars spring from a popular reaction to a sudden economic crisis that exacerbates poverty and growing disparities in wealth and incomes? Perhaps one could argue, as some scholars do, that it is some dramatic event or sequence of such events leading to the exacerbation of poverty that, in turn, leads to this deplorable denouement. This exogenous factor might act as a catalyst for a violent reaction on the part of the people or on the part of the political leadership who would then possibly be tempted to seek a diversion by finding or, if need be, fabricating an enemy and setting in train the process leading to war. According to a study undertaken by Minxin Pei and Ariel Adesnik of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, there would not appear to be any merit in this hypothesis. After studying ninety-three episodes of economic crisis in twenty-two countries in Latin America and Asia in the years since the Second World War they concluded that:19 Much of the conventional wisdom about the political impact of economic crises may be wrong ... The severity of economic crisis – as measured in terms of inflation and negative growth - bore no relationship to the collapse of regimes ... (or, in democratic states, rarely) to an outbreak of violence ... In the cases of dictatorships and semidemocracies, the ruling elites responded to crises by increasing repression (thereby using one form of violence to abort another).



Doesn’t solve productivity

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Staley 9</span>(Sam, director of urban growth and land use policy for Reason Foundation, “Why High-Speed Rail Fails as a Jobs Program,” August 18 ,http://reason.com/archives/2009/08/18/why-high-speed-rail-fails-as-a)

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Of course, rail proponents argue that spending money now on high-speed rail is a long-term investment</span> that will __[[#|pay off]]__ in higher economic productivity over the long-haul. But these <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">job creation and income estimates they use are based on spending for freight rail, not passenger rail</span>. Freight rail in America is a crucial part of our transportation infrastructure, accounting for 43 percent of the shipment of goods and services from one city to the other. Thus, investments in freight rail have a direct impact on the bottom line for American businesses, increasing the speed and reliability of goods shipment and improving productivity. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Passenger rail in the U.S. is a different story. Passenger rail currently carries a very small portion of city-to-city travel</span>—the market targeted by high-speed rail—and it's likely to remain modest well into the future. In 2008, Amtrak carried 28.7 million passengers. By comparison, there were 687 million airline passengers in 2008, in part because air service provides frequent high-speed travel to geographically distant cities. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Then there's our well-developed highway network that makes automobiles very competitive with rail for distances under 200 miles</span>. In most cases, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">once travel and wait times to train stations are factored in, travelers will spend as much time in route on the train as they will in a car</span>. Consider a trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco, or Chicago to St. Louis, for a typical high-speed train traveler. You'll likely have to drive to the train station and pay to park. Once arriving in downtown St. Louis or San Francisco, you will likely have to take a taxi or rent a car to get to your hotel or meeting place (which is likely to be outside the central business district). The reliable, diverse, and nimble transit system that many advocates envision surrounding high-speed rail stations simply doesn't exist in most cities today, limiting the appeal of trains. To compensate for these disadvantages, taxpayers <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will have to steeply subsidize train ticket prices for the business travelers and tourists that are most likely to use them. Ultimately, high-speed rail's impacts on American travel patterns and employment productivity are going to be negligible, and the actual job creation potential for high speed rail is much more modest than proponents admit</span>. Take, for example, the Ohio Hub corridor linking Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Toledo to regional destinations such as Chicago and Toronto. Ohio is one of the nation's largest state economies, employing 5.3 million people. As an old-line manufacturing state, Ohio has lost 300,000 jobs just in the past year. Needless to say, Ohioans will be attracted to the optimistic rhetoric of rail's job creation potential. Moreover, preliminary estimates by independent consultants suggest the Ohio Hub may actually cover its annual operating costs (although supporters are counting on the federal government covering 80 percent of capital costs of the $3.7 billion project). Yet, even with these federal subsidies the consultant reports suggest that a $2.3 billion investment in building the rail corridor would generate only 54,540 jobs over the projected nine-year construction phase. That works out to 2,635 jobs per year at a cost of $42,170 per job. Further analysis found 16,700 permanent jobs would be created by the system once the system was up and running, assuming optimistically that ridership reaches forecasted levels and fares are set to cover its operating costs. While that might seem like a lot of jobs, the effort will do little to stem the economic tide turning against Ohio and other states facing the headwinds of global competition and a rising services-based economy. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">For transportation investments to have a meaningful economic impact, they will need to cost-effectively improve America's ability to move goods, services, and people from one place to another. High-speed rail doesn't do that. It is an extremely costly way to achieve limited portions of these goals, and it inevitably fails as a broad-based solution to the country's transportation challenges.</span>



Any disad outweighs on timeframe

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">High-speed</span> rail is a wonderful concept because it uses electricity and c<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ould reduce our dependence on fossil fuels sometime in the distant future. But it's also far more expensive than commercial airlines and will require a new source of electricity</span> from solar, wind or nuclear power. The president assures us there will be no pork in the $3.8 trillion federal budget for 2011. That may be true if we ignore the proposed $2.3 billion high-speed-rail grant for California. An undetermined amount of that money would be spent as a down payment on a $42.6 billion proposal to connect Anaheim with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco and Los Angeles with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's Las Vegas. That's an "oink-oink" if I ever heard one. I can understand the Las Vegas high-speed link to accommodate the thousands of Californians who want to flee to Nevada to escape California's high taxes. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">High-speed rail as part of a short-term economic stimulus package is nonsense if it takes a decade or two to build. The environmental impact statement itself will take years</span>. Acquiring 680 miles of right-of-way will be <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">contested in thousands of eminent domain lawsuits and will take at least a decade to complete.</span> If high-speed rail serves intermediate cities then it will increase travel time, create noise and interrupt traffic flow at thousands of intersections. If it bypasses smaller cities to gain the advantage of speed, then it serves only the end terminals and disadvantages everyone in-between.



Doesn’t solve megaregions

But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">while I agree with the megaregion pundits about transportation and environmental planning, we’re not there yet on economic development, and</span>, as Lang correctly notes, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we’re nowhere close on related and equally important issues like (</span>secondary) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">education. And I’d add workforce development to that list. </span>Costs for major transportation projects must be shared across cities and counties because they can’t afford to go it alone. And fight it though we may, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we resist regional cooperation on environmental concerns</span> such as aquifer protection <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">at our own peril</span>. [Characterizing water availability as primarily an environmental issue is foolish in its own right, but that's an entry on communication for another time.] No individual city or county can afford to adequately protect a long-term water supply of regional significance. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Cities and counties will maintain separate budgets for local transportation and environmental projects for as long as we have local government</span>, but we’ve crossed the threshold where regional cooperation is no longer questioned in most places. City and county officials can work together on metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to lobby for projects that benefit their collective area within the region. Everybody in the region–or at least all users–benefit from the investment, but their residents likely benefit more than people in other municipalities because of proximity and perception. Voters, to the extent they are paying attention, give credit to the local politicians for successfully navigating the regional decision-making process and everybody wins. What’s the counterpart for economic development? Most local economic developers participate in at least one regional effort of some type, such as “regional partner” programs at larger chambers of commerce funded by membership dues or economic development districts funded by the U.S. Economic Development Administration. However, while most local economic developers, especially in smaller communities, understand that acting regionally is the only way to compete effectively in the global economy, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">how many local politicians or voters give credit to their local economic developers for the project that lands in the community next door</span>? Some of your residents may get new jobs in that facility next door, and perhaps, if the project is large enough, a portion of the spinoff activity will add to your tax base, making the local politicians happy. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">rarely do you see local economic developers standing together to explain, convincingly, how a regional win translates to tangible benefits for each individual community. Competition among local economic developers breeds a lot of innovation that pushes the entire field forward. This is not one of those cases. We need to do better</span>. Pundits are right to point to the regional nature of how economies grow–based on shared assets like DFW Airport and networks which form the basis of cluster approaches–but, as much as it pains me to say it, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">convincing data alone rarely changes behavior. Carrots and sticks change behavior, not academic arguments.</span> Thankfully, we’ve seen more carrots than sticks lately with bottom-up approaches like the Jobs Accelerator at the federal level and the MPO-like process for economic development that’s emerging in states such as New York and Ohio. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But it will take some time to see if these new models are politically viable and capable of generating results that are significant enough to accelerate regional cooperation</span> in places around the country where old habits die hard when it comes to economic development. Until I see evidence of that changing, I’ll be skeptical of the megaregion argument.



Stimulus fails – fraud, waste and abuse

Four years into the deepest recession since World War II, the U.S. economy expanded at a rate of only 0.7 percent in the first half of 2011. This means that the economy is growing at a slower pace than the population and that capita output continues to fall.2

In response, the president has announced a plan for yet more deficit-financed stimulus spending.3 Like the two previous stimulus bills, this one focuses on infrastructure spending. The president‘s plan is rooted in the belief that stimulus spending and deeper deficits will give the economy the lift it needs to create more jobs. The hope is that, eventually, the economy will grow fast enough to allow the government to begin to pay down the national debt.

There are three problems with this approach. First, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">despite the claims of stimulus proponents, the evidence is </span>//not at all clear//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that more stimulus would be helpful right now</span>. Second, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">even if one adheres to the idea that more government spending can jolt the economy, spending—particularly infrastructure spending—</span>//cannot be implemented in the way Keynesians say it ought to be//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. This </span>//greatly undermines//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> its stimulative effect</span>. Third, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">while no one disputes the value of good infrastructure, this type of spending typically suffers from </span>//massive cost overruns, waste, fraud, and abuse//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. This makes it a </span>//particularly bad vehicle//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> for stimulus</span>. In sum, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">further stimulus would be </span>//a risky short-term gamble//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> with </span>//near-certain negative consequences in the long term//



High deficits wreck the economy.

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The</span> U.S. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">federal budget is on an unsustainable path</span>. In the absence of significant policy changes, federal government <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">deficits are expected to total</span> around <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">$5 trillion over the next decade. Such deficits will cause</span> U.S. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">government debt, relative to GDP, to rise significantly</span>. Thereafter, as the baby boomers increasingly reach retirement age and claim Social Security and Medicare benefits, government deficits and debt are likely to grow even more sharply. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The scale</span> of the nation's projected budgetary imbalances <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is now so large that the risk of severe adverse consequences must be taken very seriously</span>, although it is impossible to predict when such consequences may occur.

Conventional analyses of sustained budget deficits demonstrate the negative effects of deficits on long-term economic growth. Under the conventional view, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ongoing budget deficits decrease national saving, which reduces domestic investment and increases borrowing from abroad</span>.1 Interest rates play a key role in how the economy adjusts. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The reduction in national saving raises domestic interest rates, which dampens investment and attracts capital from abroad</span>.2 The external borrowing that helps to finance the budget deficit is reflected in a larger current account deficit, creating a linkage between the budget deficit and the current account deficit. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The reduction in domestic investment</span> (<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">which lowers productivity growth</span>) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the increase in the current account deficit</span> (<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">which requires that more of the returns from the domestic capital stock accrue to foreigners</span>) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">both reduce future national income</span>, with the loss in income steadily growing over time. Under the conventional view, the costs imposed by sustained deficits tend to build gradually over time, rather than occurring suddenly.

The adverse consequences of sustained large budget deficits may well be far larger and occur more suddenly than traditional analysis suggests, however. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Substantial deficits projected far into the future can cause a fundamental shift in market expectations and a related loss of confidence both at home and abroad</span>. The unfavorable dynamic effects that could ensue are largely if not entirely excluded from the conventional analysis of budget deficits. This omission is understandable and appropriate in the context of deficits that are small and temporary; it is increasingly untenable, however, in an environment with deficits that are large and permanent. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Substantial ongoing deficits may severely and adversely affect expectations and confidence, which in turn can generate a self-reinforcing negative cycle among the underlying fiscal deficit, financial markets, and the real economy</span>:

* <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As traders, investors, and creditors become increasingly concerned that the government would resort to high inflation</span> to reduce the real value of government debt or that a fiscal deadlock with unpredictable consequences would arise, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">investor confidence may be severely undermined</span>;

* The fiscal and current account <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">imbalances may</span> also <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">cause a loss of confidence among participants in foreign exchange markets and in international credit markets</span>, as participants in those markets become alarmed not only by the ongoing budget deficits but also by related large current account deficits;

* <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The loss of investor and creditor confidence, both at home and abroad, may cause investors and creditors to reallocate funds away from dollar-based investments, causing a depreciation of the exchange rate, and to demand sharply higher interest rates on U.S. government debt</span>;

* <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The increase of interest rates, depreciation of the exchange rate, and decline in confidence can reduce stock prices and household wealth, raise the costs of financing to business, and reduce private-sector domestic spending</span>;

* The <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">disruptions to financial markets may impede the intermediation between lenders and borrowers that is vital to modern economies</span>, as long-maturity credit markets witness potentially substantial increases in interest rates and become relatively illiquid, and the reduction in asset prices adversely affects the balance sheets of banks and other financial intermediaries;

* <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The inability of the federal government to restore fiscal balance may directly reduce business and consumer confidence</span>, as the view of the ongoing deficits as a symbol of the nation's inability to address its economic problems permeates society, and the reduction in confidence can discourage investment and real economic activity;

* <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">These various effects can feed on each other to create a mutually reinforcing cycle</span>; for example, increased interest rates and diminished economic activity may further worsen the fiscal imbalance, which can then cause a further loss of confidence and potentially spark another round of negative feedback effects.

Although it is impossible to know at what point market expectations about the nation's large projected fiscal imbalance could trigger these types of dynamics, the harmful impacts on the economy, once these effects were in motion, would substantially magnify the costs associated with any given underlying budget deficit and depress economic activity much more than the conventional analysis would suggest. Indeed, the potential costs and fallout from such fiscal and financial disarray provide perhaps the strongest motivation for avoiding substantial, ongoing budget deficits. 3

Conventional analyses of budget deficits also do not put enough emphasis on three other related factors: uncertainty; the asymmetries in the political difficulty of revenue increases and spending reductions relative to tax cuts and spending increases; and the loss of flexibility in the future from enacting tax cuts or spending increases today. Budget projections are inherently uncertain, but such uncertainty does not provide a rationale for fiscal profligacy. The uncertainty surrounding budget projections means that the outcome in the future can be either better or worse than expected today. Such uncertainty can actually increase the incentive for more saving ahead of time—in other words, for more fiscal discipline. In addition, it is much harder for the political system to reduce deficits than to expand them. As a result of this asymmetry, enacting a large tax cut or spending increase today is costly because it reduces the flexibility to adjust fiscal policy to future events. Therefore, large tax cuts or spending increases today carry a cost typically excluded from traditional analysis: They constrain policy-makers' flexibility to respond to unforeseen events in the future.

Thus, in our view, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to ensure healthy long-run U.S. economic performance, substantial changes</span> in fiscal policy <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are needed to deal preemptively with</span> the risks stemming from sustained <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">large budget deficits</span> and the economic imbalances they entail. The political system, however, seems unwilling to address the threat posed by future deficits and to make the necessary choices to put the nation on a sustainable fiscal course.4 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Failing to act sooner rather than later</span>, though, only <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">makes the problem more difficult to address without considerable instability, raises the probability of</span> fiscal and financial <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">disarray</span> at some point in the future, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and</span> runs the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">risks</span> of further <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">constraining policy flexibility</span> in the future.

Instead, the economy remained in recession and 3.5 million more net jobs were lost. By every reasonable standard, the stimulus failed.

H. L. Mencken once wrote that "complex problems have simple, easy to understand, wrong answers."

Inflation is low but investor perception is on the brink

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Time Business 12</span> — Time Business, 2012 (“Fed Inflation Hawks Warn More Stimulus Could Fuel Prices,” Byline Sam Gustin, April 11th, Available Online at http://business.time.com/2012/04/11/fed-inflation-hawks-warn-more-stimulus-could-fuel-prices/, Accessed 06-30-2012)

Are inflation hawks preparing to take flight? That’s the sense one gets reading comments made by two U.S. central bank officials Tuesday, including Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who said that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">corporate chiefs have been sounding the alarm about an increase in prices thanks to the Fed’s easy money policy</span>. Fisher’s latest remarks are sure to fuel a growing debate about whether the Fed should embark on another round of monetary stimulus, especially in light of last month’s lackluster jobs report. Speaking at the University of Oklahoma’s Price College of Business, Fisher said that he’s heard from <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">business leaders</span> who <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are concerned that the Fed’s easy money policy could raise inflation, which would increase prices for companies just as they’re trying gain a solid footing</span>. “I’m just reporting what I hear on the street, which is a real concern that with our expanded balance sheet, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we are just a little bit in an ember of what could become </span>//an inflationary fire//,” Fisher said in comments cited by Bloomberg. He said business leaders are telling him, “Please, no more liquidity.” Separately, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Narayana Kocherlakota said that the threat of inflation means that the central bank will likely have to begin to reverse its easy money policy as early as the end of the year. “Conditions will warrant raising rates some time in 2013 or, possibly, late 2012,” Kocherlakota said in comments cited by Reuters. That puts Kocherlakota at odds with the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which has said since January that it plans to keep interest rates low through 2014. Fisher and Kocherlakota are well-known inflation hawks, which means they tend to worry more than other policy-makers about the risk that inflation poses to the economy. So it’s not surprising that Fisher, in particular, would voice business leaders’ concerns that inflation could make buying the materials — or inputs — they need to run their companies more expensive. Although both officials are considered to be more hawkish than Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, their comments could put pressure on their colleagues to resist calls for a third round of quantitative easing, or QE3, something the Fed policy makers have left on the table if the economy loses momentum. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">For now, inflation remains under control</span>: as of February, prices had risen 2.3% over the previous year, according to the personal consumption spending index, just slightly above the Fed’s target rate of 2%. Neither Fisher nor Kocherlakota are among the five Fed presidents voting on the FOMC this year, which may explain their outspokenness. Fisher is the more hawkish of the pair. He’s called the idea of more monetary stimulus a “fantasy of Wall Street,” while Kocherlakota has allowed that “if the outlook for inflation fell sufficiently and/or the outlook for unemployment rose sufficiently, then I would recommend adding accommodation.” The Fed has already cut its benchmark interest rates to near zero to make it easier for companies to borrow money to invest. The central bank has also purchased over $2 trillion worth of bonds in an effort to increase liquidity. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But injecting money into the system </span>//runs the risk of inflation//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, which could hurt businesses</span>. On the other hand, some have argued that a little inflation might actually benefit the economy. For the moment, inflation is under control, not least of all because U.S. economic growth remains modest, which is why policy-makers are focused on conditions six months to two years from now. Last month’s weaker-than-expected job report raised the prospect of a third round of Fed bond-purchases. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy added 120,000 jobs in March, compared to the 205,000 that analysts, on average, had been expecting, a sign that the employment gains of recent months could be losing steam. But Fisher downplayed the report, saying that policy can’t be based on one data point. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The Federal Reserve is in a delicate position right now. The economy is growing and unemployment is falling — but neither by enough for the Fed to rule out another round of action. On the other hand, after two rounds of massive stimulus that has fueled a bloated balance sheet, and a lengthy period of very low interest rates, it’s clear that the inflation hawks are getting a little nervous</span>. For now, they’ve been unable to sway the conventional wisdom. Hopefully, they won’t end up being canaries in the coal mine.



Stimulus increases inflation—erodes the dollar and floods the economy.

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Zupan 11</span> — Mark Zupan, Dean of the Simon Graduate School of Business at the University of Rochester, 2011 (“Stimulus Is a Recipe for Inflation,” //Kiplinger//, March 30th, Available Online at http://www.kiplinger.com/printstory.php?pid=21057, Accessed 06-30-2012)

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Our nation is flirting with resurrecting inflation to levels that are reminiscent of the grim 1970s. A high rate of inflation will</span>, among other things, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">penalize savers, pensioners and working people, whose raises and cost-of-living adjustments</span> – if they get them – //cannot keep up with rising prices//. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The root cause of the coming inflation is the Federal Reserve’s easy-money policy in support of the federal government’s </span>//stimulus efforts//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Rising government spending has been rapidly swelling our debt</span> (now more than $14 trillion). Moreover, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the Fed’s actions work to erode the</span> U.S. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">dollar’s purchasing power</span>. Over the past three years, the dollar has been devalued against many leading currencies, with the notable exception of the troubled euro. A weak dollar means imports become more expensive. In addition, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">with more dollars now chasing fewer goods and services, the prices of those goods and services have begun to rise</span>. Based on producer-price increases registered so far this year, we could see consumer prices increasing at a 6%-plus clip later this year. All of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this is occurring as banks sit on $1 trillion of reserves</span> that they have not loaned out. //Once they feel more confident//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> about lending and this money hits the economy, it will </span>//add to inflationary pressures//.



Inflation tanks growth

Volcker, served as Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987, worked for the federal government for over 30 years serving under John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M.

So now <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we are beginning to hear murmurings about the possible invigorating effects of “just a little inflation.”</span> Perhaps 4 or 5 percent a year would be just the thing to deal with the overhang of debt and encourage the “animal spirits” of business, or so the argument goes.¶ It’s not yet a full-throated chorus. But remarkably, at least one member of the Fed’s policy making committee recently departed from the price-stability script.¶ The siren song is both alluring and predictable. Economic circumstances and the limitations on orthodox policies are indeed frustrating. After all, if 1 or 2 percent inflation is O.K. and has not raised inflationary expectations — as the Fed and most central banks believe — why not 3 or 4 or even more? Let’s try to get business to jump the gun and invest now in the expectation of higher prices later, and raise housing prices (presumably commodities and gold, too) and maybe wages will follow. If the dollar is weakened, that’s a good thing; it might even help close the trade deficit. And of course, as soon as the economy expands sufficiently, we will promptly return to price stability.¶ Well, good luck.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Some mathematical models spawned in academic seminars might support this scenario. But </span>//all of our economic history says it won’t work that way//. I thought <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we learned that lesson in the 1970s. That’s when the word stagflation was invented to describe a truly ugly combination of rising inflation and stunted growth</span>.¶ My point is not that we are on the edge today of serious inflation, which is unlikely if the Fed remains vigilant. Rather, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the danger is that if, in desperation, we turn to deliberately seeking inflation to solve real problems</span> — our economic imbalances, sluggish productivity, and excessive leverage — <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we would soon find that a little inflation doesn’t work. Then the instinct will be to do a little more</span> — a seemingly temporary and “reasonable” 4 percent becomes 5, and then 6 and so on.¶ What we know, or should know, from the past is that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">once inflation becomes anticipated and ingrained — as it eventually would — then </span>//the stimulating effects are lost//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Once an independent central bank</span> does not simply tolerate a low level of inflation as consistent with “stability,” but <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">invokes inflation as a policy, it becomes </span>//very difficult to eliminate//.¶ It is precisely the common experience with this inflation dynamic that has led central banks around the world to place prime importance on price stability. They do so not at the expense of a strong productive economy. They do it because <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">experience confirms that price stability — and the expectation of that stability — is </span>//a key element//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> in keeping interest rates low and sustaining a </span>//strong, expanding, fully employed economy//.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">At a time when foreign countries own trillions of our dollars, when we are dependent on borrowing still more abroad, and when the whole world counts on the dollar’s maintaining its purchasing power, taking on the risks of deliberately promoting inflation would be </span>//simply irresponsible//.

No one will actually ride the HSR – that undercuts every internal link

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Utt 10</span>(Ronald, Research Fellow in the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, “America’s Coming High-Speed Rail Financial Disaster,” March 19, http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2010/03/america-s-coming-high-speed-rail-financial-disaster)

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">To put the European commitment to passenger rail in perspective, rail ridership</span> (high speed, conventional intercity, and metropolitan commuter rail) in these six countries a<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ccounted for just 7.9 percent of all surface transportation modes </span>on a per passenger, per billion kilometer basis. This suggests that these <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">countries received a poor return on their money given that more than 90 percent of passengers in these countries chose other travel modes</span>-- mostly auto--<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">despite the subsidies</span>. In Europe as a whole (EU-27), rail accounted for only 6.1 percent of passenger travel in 2007, including travel by air and sea. Buses accounted for 8.3 percent of the market, and air travel accounted for 8.8 percent. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Despite Europe's huge investment in passenger rail, its market share declined</span> from 6.6 percent in 1995 to 6.1 percent in 2007. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Over that same period, commercial air increased its share</span> from 6.3 percent to 8.8 percent. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">By providing faster service and competitive prices, it took passengers away from rail, buses, and autos.</span> This last point is of some importance because one goal of the HSR scheme is to shift travel from largely unsubsidized commercial aviation to heavily subsidized trains. Yet <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the same scheme in Europe seems to have failed over the past dozen years, despite massive government subsidies</span>. Nonetheless, as problematic as the general European experience with passenger rail has been, some individual countries have experienced even worse results.



No warming and it’s not anthropogenic – their evidence is based on flawed studies and hype

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Watson 9</span> (Steve, citing a report conducted by the Japan Society of Energy and Resources, the academic society representing scientists from the energy and resource fields, “Top Japanese Scientists: Warming Is Not Caused By Human Activity,” February 27th, [[http://www.infowars.com/top-japanese-scientists-warming-is-not-caused-by-human-activity/]])

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A major scientific report</span> by leading Japanese academics <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">concludes that global warming is not man-made and </span>that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the </span>overall <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">warming trend</span> from the mid-part of the 20th Century onwards <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has now stopped. </span>Unsurprisingly the report, which was released last month, has been completely ignored by the Western corporate media. The report was undertaken by Japan Society of Energy and Resources (JSER), the academic society representing scientists from the energy and resource fields. The JSER acts as a government advisory panel, much like the International Panel on Climate Change did for the UN. The JSER’s findings provide a stark contrast to the IPCC’s, however, with only one out of five top researchers agreeing with the claim that recent warming has been accelerated by man-made carbon emissions. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The </span>government commissioned<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> report criticizes computer climate modeling</span> and also says that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the US ground temperature data set, used to back up the man-made warming claims, is too myopic. </span>In the last month, no major Western media outlet has covered the report, which prompted British based sci-tech website The Register to commission a translation of the document. Section one highlights the fact that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Global Warming has ceased</span>, noting that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">since 2001, the increase in global temperatures has halted, despite a continuing increase in CO2 emissions. </span>The report then states that the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">recent warming</span> the planet has experienced <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is</span> primarily <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a recovery from the</span> so called "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Little Ice Age</span>" that occurred from around 1400 through to 1800, and is part of<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> a natural cycle</span>. The researchers also conclude that global warming and the halting of the temperature rise are related to solar activity, a notion previously dismissed by the IPCC. "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The hypothesis that</span> the majority of global <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">warming can be ascribed to the Greenhouse Effect is mistaken.</span>" the report’s introduction states. Kanya Kusano, Program Director and Group Leader for the Earth Simulator at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC) reiterates this point: "[<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The IPCC's] conclusion</span> that from now on atmospheric temperatures are likely to show a continuous, monotonic increase, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">should be perceived as an unprovable hypothesis</span>," Shunichi Akasofu, head of the International Arctic Research Center in Alaska, cites historical data to challenge the claim that very recent temperatures represent an anomaly: "We should be cautious, IPCC’s theory that atmospheric temperature has risen since 2000 in correspondence with CO2 is nothing but a hypothesis. " "Before anyone noticed, this hypothesis has been substituted for truth… <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The opinion that great disaster will really happen must be broken.</span>" Akasofu concludes. The key passages of the translated report can be found here. The conclusions within the report dovetail with those of hundreds of Western scientists, who have been derided and even compared with holocaust deniers for challenging the so called "consensus" on global warming. The total <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">lack of exposure that this major report</span> has received <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is an</span>other <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">example of how skewed coverage of climate change is toward one set</span> of hypotheses. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This serves the agenda to deliberately whip up mass hysteria on behalf of governments</span> who are all too eager to introduce draconian taxation and control measures that won’t do anything to combat any form of warming, whether you believe it to be natural or man-made.

And in further describing this phenomenon, they say that U<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.S. temperatures in 2008 "not only declined from near-record warmth of prior years, but were in fact colder than the official 30-year reference climatology</span> (-0.2°C versus the 1971-2000 mean) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and further were the coldest since at least 1996</span>." With respect to the geographical origin of this "natural cooling," as they describe it, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the five researchers point to "a widespread coolness of the tropical-wide oceans and the northeastern Pacific</span>," focusing on the Niño 4 region, where they report that "anomalies of about -1.1°C <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">suggest a condition colder than any in the instrumental record since 1871.</span>" So, pushing the cause of the global and U.S. coolings that sparked their original interest back another link in the chain which -- in their estimation -- connects them with other more primary phenomena, they ask themselves what caused these //latter// anomalous and significant oceanic coolings? <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Perlwitz </span>//et al//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. first discount </span>//volcanic eruptions//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, because they say "there were no significant volcanic events in the last few years." </span>Secondly, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">they write that </span>//solar forcing//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> "is also unlikely</span>," <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">because its radiative magnitude is considered to be too weak to elicit such a response. And these two castaway causes thus leave them with "coupled ocean-atmosphere-land variability" as what they consider to be the "most likely" cause of the anomalous coolings</span>. In regard to these three points, we agree with the first. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">With respect to Perlwitz </span>//et al//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.'s dismissal of solar forcing, however, we note that the jury is still out with respect to the interaction of the solar wind with the influx of cosmic rays to earth's atmosphere and their subsequent impact on cloud formation, which may yet prove to be substantia</span>l. And with respect to their final point, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we note that the suite of real-world ocean-atmosphere-land interactions is highly complex and also not fully understood.</span> Indeed<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, there may even be important phenomena operating within this realm of which the entire scientific community is </span>//ignorant//. And <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">some of those phenomena may well be strong enough to </span>//totally compensate//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> for anthropogenic-induced increases in greenhouse gas emissions</span>, so that other natural phenomena end up dictating the ever-changing state of earth's climate, as could well be what has been happening over the last decade or more.<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> In light of these considerations, therefore, as well as the substantial </span>//strength//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and </span>//longevity//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> of the planet's current cooling phase, the path of wisdom would seem to us to be to wait and see what happens next, in the unfolding biogeophysical drama of earth's ever-changing climatic path to the future,</span> before we undertake to attempt to //change// what we clearly do not fully //comprehend//.



No extinction

In a paper published in //Systematics and Biodiversity//, Willis //et al//. (2010) consider the IPCC (2007) "predicted climatic changes for the next century" -- i.e., their contentions that "global temperatures will increase by 2-4°C and possibly beyond, sea levels will rise (~1 m ± 0.5 m), and atmospheric CO2will increase by up to 1000 ppm" -- noting that it is "widely suggested that the magnitude and rate of these changes will result in many plants and animals going extinct," citing studies that suggest that "within the next century, over 35% of some biota will have gone extinct (Thomas //et al//., 2004; Solomon //et al//., 2007) and there will be extensive die-back of the tropical rainforest due to climate change (e.g. Huntingford //et al//., 2008)." On the other hand, they indicate that some <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">biologists and climatologists have pointed out that "many of the predicted increases in climate have happened before, in terms of both magnitude and rate of change</span> (e.g. Royer, 2008; Zachos //et al//., 2008), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and yet biotic communities have remained remarkably resilient</span> (Mayle and Power, 2008) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and in some cases thrived </span>(Svenning and Condit, 2008)." But they report that those who mention these things are often "placed in the 'climate-change denier' category," although the purpose for pointing out these facts is simply to present "a sound scientific basis for understanding biotic responses to the magnitudes and rates of climate change predicted for the future through using the vast data resource that we can exploit in fossil records." Going on to do just that, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Willis </span>//et al//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. focus on "intervals in time in the fossil record when atmospheric CO</span>2<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> concentrations increased up to 1200 ppm, temperatures in mid- to high-latitudes increased by greater than 4°C within 60 years, and sea levels rose by up to 3 m higher than present," describing studies of past biotic responses that indicate "the scale and impact of the magnitude and rate of such climate changes on biodiversity</span>." And <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">what emerges</span> from those studies, as they describe it, "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is evidence for rapid community turnover, migrations, development of novel ecosystems and thresholds from one stable ecosystem state to anoth</span>er." And, most importantly in this regard, they report "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is very little evidence for broad-scale extinctions due to a warming world.</span>" In concluding, the Norwegian, Swedish and UK researchers say that "based on such evidence <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we urge some caution in assuming broad-scale extinctions of species will occur due solely to climate changes of the magnitude and rate predicted for the next centur</span>y," reiterating that "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the fossil record indicates remarkable biotic resilience to wide amplitude fluctuations in climate."</span>

No effect to Panama Canal—overhyped for federal money



Szakonyi 6/11— associate editor of the Journal of Commerce (Mark, “Eastern US Rails Poised for Growth on Either Coast”, Journal of Commerce, , ProQuest, http://proxy.lib.umich.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/docview/1019810103?accountid=14667)//



//That's good news for railroads, considering that expectations for cargo gained through the Panama Canal expansion are weakening as the deadline approaches. The heads of the major East Coast ports told attendees of The Journal of Commerce's TPM conference in Long Beach, Calif., they expected at best mid-single-digit growth from the expansion. Others such as rail analyst Tony Hatch, who told NARSA attendees in Chicago that the expected shift was overhyped and simply a vehicle for East Coast ports to attract federal infrastructure dollars, expect even less. NS's Heartland and Crescent corridor projects and CSX's National Gateway are dependent on government funding, too. But the rail projects are delivering results already, while harbor deepening appears to be more of an effort just to keep participating ports in the Asia trade game. Intermodal traffic on the Heartland Corridor, a route that reduced the leg from the Port of Virginia to Columbus, Ohio, jumped 92 percent year-over-year in 2011, NS spokesman Robin Chapman said. The $321 million public-private partnership project, completed in September 2010, has taken on freight from other routes and delivers double-stack service to a new intermodal facility in Columbus. The Heartland Connector, a double-stack line between Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio, opened in mid-January, shortening the route for auto part shipments from the Port of Virginia to Detroit by 212 miles, or roughly two transit days. Similarly, CSX's more than $900 million National Gateway, a double-stack corridor between mid-Atlantic ports and the Midwest, has helped the railroad handle Maersk Line inbound discretionary cargo gained through a recent contract. The initiative, expected to be finished in 2015, allows freight to avoid congested Chicago by being routed through a recently built intermodal terminal in North Baltimore, Ohio. Both projects can benefit domestic intermodal business, but the Crescent Corridor, the ongoing NS project, is particularly focused on tapping one of the fastest-growing freight businesses. The project is aimed at eventually snatching more than 1 million annual loads from trucks on the route between the South and Northeast. As part of the project, NS in May broke ground on a $92 million intermodal terminal in Charlotte, N.C., and the railroad began construction on the Memphis Regional Intermodal Facility in Rossville, Tenn., last year. While analysts debate the impact of the Panama Canal expansion, domestic intermodal is providing returns. Domestic intermodal volume in the first quarter jumped 14.9 percent year-over-year, compared with a 2.9 percent rise in international intermodal traffic, according to the Intermodal Association of North America. With truck capacity tightening and fuel prices volatile, domestic intermodal is on solid ground. However, international intermodal volume on the East Coast is subject to the tides of consumer demand, federal funding for dredging, a more aggressive longshoremen union and cautious global container lines.//





//Heg is inevitable: structural foundations buffer heg decline//

//Norrlof 10 - an Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Toronto (Carla, “ America’s Global Advantage US Hegemony and International Cooperation” p. 1-2)//

//The United States has been the most powerful country in the world for more than sixty years. Throughout this period, it has had the world’s largest economy and the world’s most important currency. For most of this time, it had the world’s most powerful military as well – and its military supremacy today is beyond question. We are truly in an era of US hegemony, a unipolar moment, a Pax Americana, which has enabled Americans to enjoy the highest standard of living in human history. Is this privileged position being undercut by serial trade deficits? The pessimists are growing more numerous by the day. They see the country’s spendthrift ways as a disaster waiting to happen. They warn that the cavernous gap in merchandise trade, well above 6 percent in 2006, is an ominous sign of competitive slippage. In 2008, the liabilities acquired to finance the shortfall in exports reached an amazing 29 percent of GDP. A falling dollar, military overstretch, the rise of the euro, the rise of China, and progressively deeper integration in East Asia are among the factors that many believe herald the imminent decline of American hegemony. In my view, the doomsayers are mistaken. I argue that American hegemony is stable and sustainable. While the United States certainly does face a number of challenges, an analysis of the linkages between trade, money, and security shows that American power is robust. This book is a story about why and how American hegemony works, and what other states would have to do to emulate or, on other grounds, thwart, America’s power base. As I will show, the United States benefits from running persistent trade deficits as a result of its special position in the international system. I will argue that any comparably situated country would choose to pursue the same cyclical deficit policy as the one encouraged by the US government. A series of size advantages cut across trade, money, and security: the size of the American market, the role of the dollar, and American military power interact to make a trade deficit policy rewarding and buffer the United States from the extreme consequences that a sustained deficit policy would otherwise have.//





//Even if the US declines, liberal international norms will survive – solves the impact//

//Ikenberry 11 – (May/June issue of Foreign Affairs, G. John, PhD, Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University in the Department of Politics and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, “The Future of the Liberal World Order,” http://www.foreignaffairs.com///

//articles/67730/g-john-ikenberry/the-future-of-the-liberal-world-order?page=show)//

//For all these reasons, many observers have concluded that world politics is experiencing not just a changing of the guard but also a transition in the ideas and principles that underlie the global order. The journalist Gideon Rachman, for example, says that a cluster of liberal internationalist ideas -- such as faith in democratization, confidence in free markets, and the acceptability of U.S. military power -- are all being called into question. According to this worldview, the future of international order will be shaped above all by China, which will use its growing power and wealth to push world politics in an illiberal direction. Pointing out that China and other non-Western states have weathered the recent financial crisis better than their Western counterparts, pessimists argue that an authoritarian capitalist alternative to Western neoliberal ideas has already emerged. According to the scholar Stefan Halper, emerging-market states "are learning to combine market economics with traditional autocratic or semiautocratic politics in a process that signals an intellectual rejection of the Western economic model." Today's international order is not really American or Western--even if it initially appeared that way. But this panicked narrative misses a deeper reality: although the United States' position in the global system is changing, the liberal international order is alive and well. The struggle over international order today is not about fundamental principles. China and other emerging great powers do not want to contest the basic rules and principles of the liberal international order; they wish to gain more authority and leadership within it. Indeed, today's power transition represents not the defeat of the liberal order but its ultimate ascendance. Brazil, China, and India have all become more prosperous and capable by operating inside the existing international order -- benefiting from its rules, practices, and institutions, including the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the newly organized G-20. Their economic success and growing influence are tied to the liberal internationalist organization of world politics, and they have deep interests in preserving that system. In the meantime, alternatives to an open and rule-based order have yet to crystallize. Even though the last decade has brought remarkable upheavals in the global system -- the emergence of new powers, bitter disputes among Western allies over the United States' unipolar ambitions, and a global financial crisis and recession -- the liberal international order has no competitors. On the contrary, the rise of non-Western powers and the growth of economic and security interdependence are creating new constituencies for it. To be sure, as wealth and power become less concentrated in the United States' hands, the country will be less able to shape world politics. But the underlying foundations of the liberal international order will survive and thrive. Indeed, now may be the best time for the United States and its democratic partners to update the liberal order for a new era, ensuring that it continues to provide the benefits of security and prosperity that it has provided since the middle of the twentieth century.//



//Competitiveness theory is flawed//

//It has become popular by American politicians to blame China for the decline in America's production base. This is totally unfair, and shows both their ignorance and a failure to accept responsibility by the American leadership. Actually, it is through China being able to supply America with cheap consumer goods, and lend the capital to purchase these goods which has allowed the US to contain inflation, benefiting the American consumer. Germany, which is now the world's number one export nation and which has a wage structure higher than the US, has had to cope with a rising currency, but has still been able to expand its exports between 10-20% per annum, and continues to have an expanding large trade and current account surpluses. German manufactures also have to compete with their Asian competitors just as those from America, yet have a 160.5 billion trade surplus. So it would appear in the short-term, the loose monetary policies of America and Japan appear to have benefited everyone. Expanding the money supply has provided the capital to support the growth of the expanding Asian economies, especially those of India and China. Inflation (if you exclude property) has been contained (normally a consequences of a loose money policy) because of China and India being able to produce consumer goods and services cheaply for the global markets, preventing manufactures in the Anglo-Saxon economies from raising their prices.//

//Over the past few years, I and several other US <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">trade-watchers have lamented the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates' <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">dwindling leadership on global trade</span> and economic issues <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and warned of that trend's troubling potential ramifications</span>. It appears that at least one of our breathless predictions may finally be coming true. Starting <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in mid-2009 -</span> when <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it became</span> depressingly <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">clear that </span>the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama</span> administration <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">viewed trade in mostly political terms and thus would not be advancing a robust, proactive free trade agenda</span> - we free traders expressed grave concern that US recalcitrance could harm not only US companies and workers, but also the entire global free trade system. As I explained in a 2009 oped urging the President to adopt a robust pro-trade agenda (as outlined in this contemporary Cato Institute paper): Since the 1940s, the US has led the charge to remove international barriers to goods, services and investment. The result: a global trade explosion that has enriched American families, spurred innovation, enhanced our security and helped millions escape poverty. Every US president since Herbert Hoover has championed free trade because of its proven benefits.... Because of today's rules-based multilateral trading system and the interdependence of global markets, US fecklessness on trade shouldn't lead to devastating <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">protectionism</span> akin to the Smoot-Hawley-induced tariff wars of the 1930s. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it's still a problem</span>. In 2008, global trade contracted for the first time since 1982, and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">protectionist pressures abound</span>. The WTO's Doha Round is comatose, even though an ambitious deal could inject US$2 trillion into the reeling global economy. Considering <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the US has steered every major trade initiative in modern history</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">any chance for significant progress on trade will disappear without strong American leadership</span> - in word and deed. Since that time, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the President</span> has clearly <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">not taken free traders' advice</span>. The WTO's Doha Round is dead, despite a pretty good opportunity to force the issue back in late 2010. The <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama</span> administration <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">took three years to implement</span> already-<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">dusty FTAs</span> with Korea, Panama and Colombia and actually insisted on watering the deals down with new protectionist provisions in order to finally agree to move them. And while countries around the world are signing new trade agreements left and right, we've signed exactly zero and have eschewed important new participants and demanded absurd domestic protectionism in the one agreement that we are negotiating (the TPP). Meanwhile, on the home front// the President has publicly championed mercantilism//, as <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">his minions quietly pursued myriad efforts to restrict import competition and consumer freedom</span>, embraced competitive devaluation and maintained WTO-illegal policies (while publicly denouncing protectionism, of course). Pretty stark when you lay it all out like that, huh? Despite this depressing state of affairs, it did not appear that the United States' diversion from its long free trade legacy had resulted in a tangible increase in global <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">protectionism</span> (although the death of Doha certainly isn't a good thing). Unfortunately, a new blog post from the FT's Alan Beattie indicates that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">those chickens may finally be coming home to roost</span>: One of the very few bright spots in governments’ generally grim recent performance of managing the world economy has been that trade <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">protectionism</span>, rampant during the Great Depression, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has been relatively absent. That may no longer be the case</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The WTO</span>, fairly sanguine about the use of trade barriers over the past few years, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">warns today that things are getting worrying</span>. The EU made a similar point yesterday. And this monitoring service has been pointing out for a long time that a lot of the new forms of protectionism aren’t counted under the traditional categories, thanks to gaping holes in international trade law. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">After glancing at the bi-partisan protectionism on display in the</span> 2012 US <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">presidential campaign</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Beattie concludes that</span>, on the global trade stage, "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">things are looking scarier than they have for a while</span>." I'm certainly inclined to agree, and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">one need only look </span>South <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to Brazil's frighteningly rapid transition from once-burgeoning free trade star to economically-stagnant, unabashed protectionist</span> to see a scary example of why. And while I agree with Beattie that the world still isn't likely to descend into a 1930s-style trade war - we can thank the WTO and the proliferation of free market economics for that - <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the rising specter of global protectionism is undoubtedly distressing. </span>And, of course<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, it has risen just as America's free trade leadership has faded away</span>. Now, as we all know, correlation does not necessarily mean causation, and it's frankly impossible to know just how much <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the dearth of US trade leadership</span> has actually affected global trade policies. But I think it's pretty safe to say that it <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">certainly hasn't helped matters</span>. Just ask yourself this: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">how can the US admonish</span> Brazil or <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">any</span> other <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">country about its distressing mercantilism when the President is himself routinely preaching</span> - and his administration is busy implementing - similar policies? How can we decry the global "currency wars" when we're discretely advocating a similar strategy? How can we push back against nations' increasing use of market-distorting subsidies or regulatory protectionism when we're....



Trade is resilient.

Chicago Tribune, ‘8 [“After Doha,” 8-9, http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0809edit2aug09,0,7859688.story]

Even people involved daily in ongoing international trade aren't reacting much differently. They're buying and selling goods across borders and oceans, dealing with the logistical complications of high oil prices, currency fluctuations, the price of labor, unit cost, quality control and the like. This doesn't mean that a successful completion of the Doha talks wouldn't have mattered. It's a big deal that for the first time in half a century, global trade talks have failed. The Doha talks—seven years in negotiation—would have slashed farm subsidies and further opened markets for manufactured goods and services. But with or without Doha, countries will continue to trade aggressively. The benefits and opportunities are just too great. International trade expanded from 40 percent of the world economy in 1990 to more than 55 percent by 2004, according to the World Bank. The fastest growing countries—among them China, Vietnam, Ireland—were those that expanded their trade. Countries left behind, including much of sub-Saharan Africa, traded the least. Even with the current slowdown in the international economy, the WTO predicts that trade will still grow 4.5 percent this year. (That will be down from 8.5 percent in 2006 and 5.5 percent last year.)



Trade doesn’t solve war.

Gelpi & Greico, ‘5 [Christopher, Associate Professor of Political Science -- Duke, Joseph, Professor of Political Science -- Duke, “Democracy, Interdependence, and the Sources of the Liberal Peace,” Journal of Peace Research]

As we have already emphasized, increasing levels of trade between an autocratic and democratic country are unlikely to constrain the former from initiating militarized disputes against the latter. As depicted in Figure 1, our analysis indicates that an increase in trade dependence by an autocratic challenger on a democratic target from zero to 5% of the former's GDP would increase the probability of the challenger’s dispute initiation from about 0.31% to 0.29%. Thus, the overall probability of dispute initiation by an autocratic country against a democracy is fairly high (given the rarity of disputes) at 23 nearly .3% per country per year. Moreover, increased trade does little or nothing to alter that risk. Increases in trade dependence also have little effect on the likelihood that one autocracy will initiate a conflict with another. In this instance, the probability of dispute initiation remains constant at 0.33% regardless of the challenger’s level of trade dependence.

Weather patterns outweigh – experts agree

Deutsche Bank 1-12-11 [“Food prices on the rise: weather events exacerbate a tight supply-demand balance,” http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?addmenu=false&document=PROD0000000000268155&rdShowArchivedDocus=true&rwobj=ReDisplay.Start.class&rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD]



Weather-driven crop failures have been a major driver of recent upswings in food prices. Drought and wildfires in Russia last summer affected wheat supply globally (exacerbated by a ban on exports). Recent record-setting rainfalls in parts of Australia also heavily affected the wheat harvest. Dry weather in South America and the Western US plains may compound the problem. These weather disruptions all appear to be symptoms of the La Nina phenomenon referring to low sea surface temperatures across the equatorial Eastern Pacific Ocean (counterpart of El Nino). There is a vast consensus among climate change experts that extreme weather events are likely to happen with increasing frequency, thus further affecting agricultural (and oil) prices, especially since they occur in the context of a tight supply-demand balance.



US can’t solve food security- global efforts are ineffective

Podesta ’10 [John, staff writer at Foreign Policy, “The Coming Food Crisis,” August 26, [[@http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/26/the_coming_food_crisis?print=yes&hidecomments=yes&page=full]]]



Looking beyond the immediate crisis, the United States and other developed countriesmust renew long-neglected investments in agriculture assistance across the developing world, targeting small farmers as the fundamental drivers of economic growth. In Africa, for example, agriculture employs more than 60 percent of the labor force and accounts for 25 percent of the continent’s economic output. And yet, Africa continues to struggle: Nearly 10 million people in the northern Sahel region are suffering from extreme hunger, and most countries still lack adequate investment in agricultural and road infrastructure to facilitate the development of value-added products and new markets. While the United States provides more than half of the world’s food aid, agriculture assistance today stands at only 3.5 percent of overall U.S. development aid, down from 18 percent in 1979. Not surprisingly,agricultural productivity growth in developing countries is now less than 1 percent annually. We must also improve how this assistance is targeted. We can reap lasting results by focusing on soil and water conservation and improved crop varieties rather than carbon-intensive fertilizers. Scientific research and appropriate biotechnology can deliver significant crop yield gains and water savings if conducted in a safe and transparent manner. We also must invest in women, who represent up to 80 percent of the food producers in many developing countries, but frequently lack the support and services that will allow them to reinvest hard-earned agricultural gains into health and education for their families…. The Group of Twenty leading developed and developing nations must uphold their pledges of $22 billion to enhance global food security by sending real money out the door. The multilateral Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, a new global partnership funded by commitments from the United States, Canada, South Korea, Spain, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is to be commended for issuing $224 million in initial grants to help increase food security and reduce poverty in five developing countries. But lasting gains in agricultural productivity will require something more — action to confront climate change.Food shortages resulting from severe crop losses will occur more frequently and take longer to recover from as more people become vulnerable to extreme weather events like the droughts and flooding we see today in Russia and Pakistan. The World Bank predicts that developing countries will require $75 billion to $100 billion a year for the next 40 years to adapt to the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity, infrastructure, and disease.

//Growth in the US manufacturing sector remained "modest" during September, according to a closely-watched survey. The Markit Flash US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was unchanged from August's figure of 51.5. A reading above 50// implies growth//. While manufacturing output continued to rise, "growth was only marginal and the weakest for three years", Markit said. Input price inflation reached a four-month high, the survey found, but there was a slight increase in employment. New domestic orders continued to rise, but the number of export orders experienced its steepest fall since October 2011. The index score for new export orders was 47.9, down from 48.8 in August, reflecting poor economic data from China and the eurozone. Earlier on Thursday, separate PMI surveys indicated that China's manufacturing sector declined for the 11th month in a row in September, although the rate of decline slowed. Meanwhile activity among eurozone firms suffered its steepest contraction since June 2009, the PMI survey for the region found.//

But only about half of the $1.6 billion collected by the fund each year is appropriated for harbor maintenance, allowing a huge backlog of needed work to develop.

//ADVANCES IN BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH likely will permit development of a new class of advanced biological warfare (ABW) agents engineered to elicit novel effects. In addition, biotechnology will have applications supporting ABW// weaponization, dissemination, and delivery//. Such new agents and delivery systems would provide a variety of new use options, expanding the BW paradigm. Although ABW agents will not replace threats posed by traditional biological agents such as Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) and Variola (smallpox), they will necessitate novel approaches to counterproliferation, detection, medical countermeasures, and attribution. INTRODUCTION The concept of employing disease as a weapon has existed for centuries. The low cost, minimal barriers to acquisition, and potential impact of biological agents as weapons have influenced a number of countries to pursue biological warfare (BW) throughout the 20th century. 1 International agreements, such as the Biological Weapons and Toxins Convention (BWC), have arguably done little to deter foreign BW programs; ironically, information regarding the former Soviet Union suggests that such programs reached new heights of sophistication following ratification of the agreement.2 This is in part because of the ease with which BW programs can be concealed within legitimate research. Thus, it is logical to expect that states that seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction will continue to pursue biological warfare. The threat that BW proliferation poses to civilian and military populations is compounded by the possibility that terrorist organizations may either acquire these weapons, indirectly or serendipitously, from national programs or develop their own intrinsic BW capability. This bioterror threat represents a significant challenge to organizations and agencies responsible for directing biodefense efforts. To date, most discussions regarding the creation of a national biodefense strategy have focused largely on addressing existing threats posed by a select group of naturally occurring pathogens and toxins. Although agents traditionally associated with biological warfare likely will remain the predominant threat over the next 10 years, implications of current and emerging biotechnologies on development of novel BW agents should also be considered and factored into any longterm biodefense strategy. This article is intended to highlight the impending potential for biotechnology to revolutionize concepts underlying development, weaponization, and limitations of biological agents for BW. It is now possible to build on previous reports devoted to communicating biological threats posed by molecular biology3–6 by identifying key technologies that could support efforts to engineer novel biological warfare agents. However, the problem of outlining specific technologies of high “dual-use” application in a public forum without assisting individuals with malicious intent precludes extensive technical discussions here. Rather, we will focus on how// biotechnology, when applied to biological warfare, holds promise to challenge biodefense efforts// targeted to counter threats presented by traditional agents, including counterproliferation, detection, and development of medical countermeasures. Ultimately, in order to be well situated to meet future challenges, some resources in all areas of biodefense need to be diverted toward development of next-generation approaches sufficient to counter emerging threats.



No one will use bioweapons – structural barriers

Zalman 2008

(Amy, Ph.D. from New York University's Department of Middle Eastern Studies, July 23, “Bioterrorism Threat Disputed”, http://terrorism.about.com/b/2008/07/23/bioterror-threat-is-hotly-debated.htm)



William R. Clark, the chair emeritus of immunology at the University of California, doesn't think that bioterrorism is a serious threat, right now. He just wrote a book on the politics of bioterrorism called Bracing for Armegeddon? In an interview with [[http://www.miller-mccune.com/article/355|Matt Palmquist ]]in May, Professor Clark explained how he really feels about reports of a bioterrorism threat:

The more I looked into it, I thought, "Jeez, what are these guys talking about?" What are the odds that a terrorist group, no matter how well financed, would be able to create a bioterror weapon? I began looking into what it takes to really make a successful bioterrorism agent, and I just became very skeptical of this whole thing. The (United States ) military gave up bioweapons 30 years ago. They're too undependable; they're too hard to use; they're too hard to make. Then I started checking around, and I found there's a whole literature out there of people who've been screaming for years that this whole bioterrorism thing is really overblown; it's not practical; it's never going to work. Aum Shinrikyo couldn't get it to work; those guys put millions and millions of dollars into it. So you think of a bunch of guys sitting in a cave in Afghanistan — they're sure as hell not going to do it. Is any government going to do it? No. So that made me very skeptical, and I went back to Oxford and said, "This whole thing's a crock.



No extinction from bioweapons

Could diseases in animals be converted in a laboratory into ones transmissible among people? The answer is yes, but it is very unlikely that one could accomplish this easily and if one did have an organism that would transmit from animal to people, and then people to people, it would only be significant if that animal was widely distributed in the target area. So birds would be ideal and rats might be significant. There are few other animals around to transmit to people unless we consider pets and insects. We have pretty good protection against insects and, in a crisis, we would be ready to use somewhat more dangerous materials like DDT to fight a contaminated invasion until we developed other remedies. The serious limitation on self-propagating diseases generated for terrorists’ purposes is that it could be self-defeating because if it is effectively self-propagating, it will eventually bounce back to the attacking country and, presumably, have similar effects there as it has in the target country.



Early detection of disease spread is fairly straightforward in terms of modern epidemiology in most parts of the world. The most dramatic effects, aside from deaths, would be in the preventive measure to reduce the propagation of the disease from spreading by extremely severe reduction in travel for both people and cargoes, domestically and internationally. This may extend for quite a time until a preventive measure or vaccine is developed, tested and proven. Even assuming that an enemy initiated an attack, there would be the problem of where and what would happen as we learned about the attack. Would it become self-limiting? Suppose they managed a release in ten cities. Those ten largest cities, perhaps, represent 10% of the population and we could take internal measures, as suggested above, to contain it in those cities. Pandemics are a credible catastrophic situation slowing and disrupting the economy and society but not threatening nationhood in the advanced nations. A high death-rate pandemic is likely to create a greater setback in Worlds 2 and 3. The Black Death in Europe 1347–1352 killed an estimated third of the population, 25 million people. The Spanish Flu in 1918 killed 20–50 million people and infected a billion. The latter had no lasting effects comprising a threat to stability.

The ports of Norfolk, Va., and Baltimore have completed projects that put them in position to be the first to receive the big ships, some of them 1,110 feet long with the capacity to haul up to 13,000 boxcar-size freight containers, Ellis said. Elsewhere, the work is in varying stages: •The [[http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Army+Corps+of+Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] is expected to finish dredging a 50-foot deep channel to three terminals in [[http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/New+York+Harbor|New York Harbor]] by the end of the year and to the main New terminal by 2014, according to New York/New Jersey Port Authority spokesman Hunter Pendarvis.

//Today, as part of its We Can’t Wait initiative, the Administration announced that 7 nationally and regionally significant infrastructure projects will be// expedited //to help modernize and expand 5 major ports in the United States, including the Port of Jacksonville, the Port of Miami, the Port of Savannah, the Port of New York and New Jersey, and the Port of Charleston. As part of a Presidential Executive Order issued in March of this year, the Office of Management and Budget is charged with overseeing a government-wide effort to make the permitting and review process for infrastructure projects more efficient and effective, saving time while driving better outcomes for local communities. These are the first 7 of the initial// 43 projects //that will be expedited by the Executive Order –// additional //expedited infrastructure// projects will be announced in the coming weeks//. “One way to help American businesses grow and hire is to modernize our infrastructure,” said President Obama. “That’s why in March I asked my Administration to identify important projects across the country where Federal review could be expedited. Today’s commitment to move these port projects forward faster will help drive// job growth //and// strengthen the economy//.” The Obama Administration is also announcing the establishment of a White House-led Task Force that will consist of senior officials from various White House offices, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Departments of Transportation, Commerce, Homeland Security, and the Treasury. The Task Force will develop a Federal strategy and coordinated decision making principles that focus on the economic return of investments into coastal ports and related infrastructure to support the movement of commerce throughout the Nation. For more information on the Task Force, please click HERE. Port of Jacksonville One of the critical steps in modernizing and expanding the Port of Jacksonville is to finalize the federal feasibility study examining the costs and benefits of deepening the harbor. Nationally, feasibility studies take an average of 10 years and the expedited process announced today will shave 7 years off of that timeline, committing the federal government to finalize the study by April of 2013, years ahead of previous projections. Today, the Administration also announced that it will commit to completing all permits for the Jacksonville Port Intermodal Container Facility by July of 2013. Jacksonville Harbor Coordinating Agency: US Army Corps of Engineers Target date for completing all Federal permit and review decisions: April 2013 The Army Corps is completing a feasibility study to examine the benefits and costs of deepening the Federal navigation channel at the port from its existing authorized project depth of 40 feet up to maximum project depth of 50 feet to accommodate larger cargo vessels and other ships. The Army Corps is applying its modernized planning process for potential long-term infrastructure investments to this ongoing study, and expects to complete its recommendations for improvements several years earlier than originally anticipated. The Port of Jacksonville plans to construct a new Intermodal Container Facility concurrently with the navigation improvements that will vastly improve the efficient movement of goods. Jacksonville Intermodal Container Facility Coordinating Agency: US Department of Transportation Target date for completing all Federal permit and review decisions: July 2013 A new Intermodal Container Facility (ICTF) at the Port of Jacksonville will increase the capacity of the port to handle containers that arrive or depart by rail, and thereby will reduce truck traffic on local and regional roads. The ICTF will include a five-track rail yard, two wide-span electric cranes, and a paved area for stacking containers and several support uses, including a road a gate for truck movement of cargo, a parking area, and storm water retention facilities. The facility will also use zero-emission, wide-span electric cranes for all lift operations. This $45 million project is being financed through a public-private partnership, including US Department of Transportation TIGER grant funding of $10 million serving as an example of the expanded outreach and coordination by DOT to help non-traditional grantees navigate the environmental review process, from start to finish, in an efficient manner to meet the aggressive timelines associated with an innovative funding program. This port-side investment compliments the ongoing work by the Corps of Engineers helping maintain and increase the economic competitiveness of the port as expansion of the Panama Canal commences in the coming years. Port of Miami The Administration today committed to completing all federal reviews for the Port of Miami by August of 2012, and expects to complete the deepening of the channel this year. Miami Harbor Coordinating Agency: US Army Corps of Engineers Target date for completion of all Federal permit and review decisions: August 2012 The Army Corps is working with the Port of Miami to construct an authorized project that involves deepening the Federal navigation at the port from its current depth of 42 feet to a depth of 50 feet. The project would enable the port to accommodate larger cargo vessels and other ships, ultimately facilitating a more efficient movement of goods. Through a progressive partnership with the State of Florida, which has provided all of the funds needed to construct this project, the time frame for its construction has been advanced by years. The Corps expects to complete the deepening of the Federal navigation channel by late 2012. Related infrastructure improvements include landside investments funded in part by the Department of Transportation. Port of Savannah The Administration today committed to completing all federal reviews for the Port of Savannah by November of 2012. Savannah Harbor Coordinating Agency: US Army Corps of Engineers Target date for completing all Federal permit and review decisions: November 2012 The Army Corps has completed a feasibility report that examined the benefits and costs of deepening the existing channel at Savannah Harbor from its current depth of 42 feet to a depth of 47 feet. The proposed project would enable the Port of Savannah to accommodate larger cargo vessels and other ships, ultimately facilitating more efficient movement of goods. The study involved a multiyear collaborative effort with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Interior and the Department of Commerce, all of whom must also approve the final report. As a result of this collaboration, the project includes an extensive mitigation plan, which is an integral part of the recommended improvements and are intended to restore, preserve, and adaptively manage the surrounding ecosystem, which includes the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge. Port of New York and New Jersey The Administration today committed to completing all federal permit and review decisions for the Bayonne Bridge by April of 2013, shaving months from the schedule. In addition, the Administration will complete all remaining federal reviews for the New York and New Jersey Harbor by May of 2013. New York and New Jersey Harbor Coordinating Agency: US Army Corps of Engineers Target date for completing all Federal permit and review decisions: May 2013 The Port of New York and New Jersey is the largest port on the East Coast. Through the port’s major container terminals, waterborne cargo moves to all parts of the United States and throughout the world. The Army Corps is in the final stages of constructing an authorized project that will deepen existing Federal channels that provide access to four container terminals to a depth of 50 feet, enabling the navigation channel to accommodate larger cargo vessels and other ships, ultimately facilitating a// more efficient// movement of goods. The Corps expects to complete this $1.6 billion project in 2014. In order to fully realize the potential economic returns from this improvement to the navigation channel, the Port also plans to raise the Bayonne Bridge. Bayonne Bridge Raising Coordinating Agency: US Coast Guard Target date for completing all Federal permit and review decisions: April 2013 The Port of New York and New Jersey plans to raise the height of the Bayonne Bridge by 2016 in order to provide enough vertical clearance to allow access to the Port's main container terminals by larger container vessels able to transit to the Port of New York/New Jersey due to deepening of the New York Harbor's navigation channels by the Army Corps of Engineers. This project, which is estimated to cost $1 billion paid with the Port Authority funding, involves raising the roadway from 151 feet to 215 feet above mean high water, while preserving the bridge's historic arch. Effective coordination between the Port Authority and the Coast Guard (the federal coordinating agency) and with other Federal agencies, is anticipated to reduce the overall permit decision-making and review timelines by several months. Port of Charleston The Administration today committed to completing all federal reviews for the Port of Charleston by September of 2015. Charleston Harbor Coordinating Agency: US Army Corps of Engineers Target date for completing all Federal permit and review decisions: September 2015 Under its planning modernization process, the Army Corps is implementing an aggressive planning schedule for the Charleston Harbor Feasibility Study that will examine the benefits and costs of deepening the Federal navigation channel for Charleston Harbor from its existing depth of 45 feet to a maximum of 50 feet to accommodate larger cargo vessels and other ships, ultimately facilitating a more efficient movement of goods. The study is expected to be complete within 3 years – much earlier than the over 10 year average.



Status quo solves – new funding bills prove

Aiken 3/15— Herald Palladium Staff Writer (Scott, “Senate moves to keep dredge money for dredging”, McClatchy - Tribune Business News, ProQuest, [[http://proxy.lib.umich.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/docview/928101583?accountid=14667]]) EL

March 15--A surface transportation bill approved by the U.S. Senate on Wednesday includes a resolution urging Congress to use tax money already being collected for harbor maintenance to clear up a backlog of dredging projects. The "sense of the Senate" resolution calls for an appropriation of all the money available in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for its intended purpose, said Sen. Carl Levin, R-Mich. The resolution puts the Senate on record supporting use of the trust fund to maintain federal navigation projects, including 69 harbors and channels in Michigan, Levin said, though it is non-binding. The resolution mirrors the Harbor Maintenance Act, legislation introduced in 2011 by Levin and a bipartisan group of lawmakers. U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, Mich., is a cosponsor of a similar measure in the House, the Realize America's Maritime Promise Act. The transportation bill, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21, now goes to the House for consideration. The two-year bill would provide $109 billion for the nation's surface transportation programs. Levin said inclusion of his resolution on harbor maintenance funding "is an important first step toward addressing the issue legislatively in support of our maritime infrastructure." Around the Great Lakes and other parts of the country, in sufficient maintenance is restricting shipping and in some cases threatening to shut down harbors. The St. Joseph River harbor closed late in 2011 after storms caused severe shoaling near the mouth of the river, preventing ships from entering. The Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for maintaining commercial harbors, allocated $100,000 for limited emergency dredging to allow the year's final shipments of cement, salt and other commodities to reach port. In February, the Army Corps was allocated funding for spring dredging at St. Joseph, Holland and Manistee, funding that was previously not available.

Independently, intent and context prove it could become expedited – Obama’s executive order was for the purpose of dredging for Post-Panamax ships

Slade, 7/19/12 (David Slade, staff writer for The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C., The Post and Courier, ""Dredging could happen even sooner", ProQuest)

South Carolina officials have been calling on Washington to make the proposed deepening of the Charleston Harbor a priority, and on Wednesday the White House responded with good news. Charleston is among five ports whose infrastructure projects will be expedited, the Obama administration said, and that means the Port of Charleston could be deepened nearly a year earlier than the Army Corps of Engineers estimated just last week. "The overarching message is that this is a priority project and it needs to move fast," said Jim Newsome, president and CEO of the State Ports Authority. "On the heels of last week's news, this is very good news." The corps in Charleston said July 11 that studies of the harbor deepening plan could be finished by the summer of 2016, and the dredging could potentially be completed in 2020, four years ahead of previous estimates. On Wednesday, the White House pledged that all federal reviews of the plan will be completed by September 2015, 10 months earlier than the revised timeline the corps just announced. The Obama administration's announcement caught local Army Corps and State Ports Authority officials by surprise, but Newsome said any reduction in the timeline for deepening the port is good news, and Gov. Nikki Haley called it a huge leap forward for the state. "This is a huge win for Charleston and for all of South Carolina," Haley said. "Back in February, I stressed to the president how important deepening Charleston's port was and how frustrating the Army Corps' timetable was, and I'm thrilled to see the administration has sped up our project." Port executives and elected officials had asked the White House to take action, after the corps initially said it could take eight years just to study the proposed deepening work. The new deadline, combined with project-shortening measures announced earlier by the corps, means the harbor could potentially be deepened by 2019, five years earlier than first estimated. The plan to dredge the harbor to 50 feet or more is aimed at accommodating larger container ships, which will be able to reach Southeast ports via the Panama Canal starting in 2015, after the canal is widened and deepened. Other U.S. ports are rushing to deepen waterways and raise bridges. Charleston's nearest rival, the Port of Savannah, is on the president's list of initial projects to expedite, as are Jacksonville, Miami and the Port of New York and New Jersey. The administration's move follows an executive order President Barack Obama issued in March, launching the streamlining initiative. The White House also has announced the creation of a multi-agency Navigation Task Force that "will develop a federal strategy and coordinated decision-making principles that focus on the economic return of investments into coastal ports and related infrastructure to support the movement of commerce throughout the nation." U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has been pushing for a national mechanism for prioritizing port projects, and introduced legislation calling for the corps to rank the ports for funding. The corps will be part of the new Navigation Task Force. No details were announced as to how the corps will finish the harbor study earlier than planned. "With new guidance from the White House, we'll certainly do what's asked of us," said Sean McBride of the Army Corps' Charleston district office. Barbara Melvin, director of governmental relations at the SPA, said Wednesday's announcement suggests an additional federal commitment to getting the Charleston Harbor deepened, and a positive sign for federal funding. In South Carolina, the General Assembly set aside a $300 million fund for the project, in case the federal government balks at that's providing a federal share. "We've gone from looking for $150,000 to get the study started to 'we can't wait' in just two years," Melvin said.

Obama has committed 650 million dollars toward port dredging—it’s their burden to prove the plan would do more

Arrington, 7/19/12 (Marvin Arrington Jr., Georgia democrat, potential politician, "White House commits to Port of Savannah dredging" marvinarringtonjr.com/white-house-commits-to-port-of-savannah-dredging.html)

President Barack Obama today will announce that the dredging of the Port of Savannah is among seven nationally significant infrastructure projects that have been placed on a funding fast track, with all necessary federal reviews to be finished by November. The program, part of what Obama has dubbed his “We Can’t Wait” initiative, amounts to a federal commitment to the $650 million deepening. Political and business leaders throughout Georgia have called the deepening is the most important infrastructure project in the state. Other ports to receive improvements: Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami, and the Port of New York and New Jersey. The administration says dozens of additional projects to be expedited will be announced in the coming months. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who helped open doors for Georgia Republicans in Washington, this morning praised Obama for expediting the process. “This is critical for the entire state of Georgia, and is yet another example of the importance of working together across bipartisan and regional lines to keep us competitive and create jobs,” the Atlanta mayor said. U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson likewise applauded the decision. “I am glad to see that the administration recognizes the importance of the Port of Savannah,” said Chambliss. “This project has been in the works for more than a decade. It is time that the planning phase come to an end, and we move to construction.” “This is a positive step by the administration in recognizing the importance of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project to our nation’s economy. We must be prepared for the larger vessels of the future, and I hope we can build on this momentum and begin the actual harbor deepening in Savannah as soon as possible,” Isakson said.

CP solves-public participation is key and equity norms make the plan more sustainable

There are many lessons to draw from the Chukchi Sea saga. For now, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we will focus on how employing the emerging norms associated with the right to a healthy environment might have channeled agency discretion down paths </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">that supported, rather than undermined, regulatory legitimacy</span>. As hard choices are made with regard to priorities, the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">emerging</span> international environmental <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">norms of </span>//precautionary decision-making//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, advanced </span>//informed consent//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, </span>//intergenerational equity//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, and common but </span>//differentiated responsibility// <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">might have led to </span>//better, more sustainable decision-making//<span class="BoldUnderlineChar">. </span>The NEPA requirement that the agency prepare an EIS before making a decision about leasing already serves a number of purposes related to those captured by emerging international environmental norms. First, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">an EIS promotes transparency by requiring the government to identify proposed actions and to solicit comments thereon</span>. Second, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">an EIS promotes participation by allowing all interested to comment</span>. However, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the</span> EIS <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">requirement would be enhanced if it were interpreted</span> in concert <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">with the emerging</span> international environmental <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">norm of advanced informed consent and the right to environmental information</span>. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">These norms embody a </span>//different//<span class="BoldUnderlineChar"> and more </span>//robust//<span class="BoldUnderlineChar"> concept of </span>//public participation// than currently seen under United States law. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">They require the government to make the right to participate concrete by actively soliciting participation from groups</span>, particularly indigenous groups, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that might otherwise not participate</span> in the decision-making process. If NEPA were interpreted along those lines, voices that typically do not get attention prior to post-decision-making litigation—if indeed they are heard at all—would become an integral part of shaping the EIS inquiry itself. As a result, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the government would hear a more diverse array of voices when they could do more good—</span>when the government is deciding the scope of activity to investigate, rather than at a later litigation phase, challenging a decision that is already a fait accomplis. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Giving</span> those typically <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">under-represented groups a special role</span> in the conduct of an environmental assessment, //a new and improved EIS process//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> would also help promote the additional emerging norm of </span>//inter-generational and intra-generational equity//. Particularly where irreversible changes are contemplated, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">intergenerational equity would put a thumb on the scale for precaution, </span>//sustainably managing and preserving rather than overexploiting resources//. Similarly, embracing the venerable international environmental norm that ―the polluter pays<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">‖</span> (which dates back to at least the 1941 Trail Smelter Arbitration)91 would keep regulatory attention focused on the environmental effects of conduct like oil and gas exploration. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A regulatory system infused with this principle would not sideline questions of environmental damage, and a court system that viewed polluter pays as an integral part of a justiciable human right would be far less likely to dismiss claims on political question or standing grounds.</span> Because the Chukchi Sea process was so poorly managed from an environmental rights perspective, it also raises the question of whether a human right to a healthy environment could have restrained the government in its relentless attempt to promote oil exploration in this pristine area. When a government does not care about the environment and bends existing law to avoid giving force to environmental rights, would a claimable human right make a difference? The answer is both yes and no. A government bent on violating human rights can certainly do so. But, the existence of a vibrant jurisprudence of human rights means that it can no longer do so with impunity. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If the United States recognized a human right to a healthy environment, it would have been much more difficult to play fast and loose with environmental statutes</span> than it was for the Bush Administration in the Chukchi Sea. Such a right would remove the standing hurdle that keeps so many of these issues out of court. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">Even without a justiciable human right to a healthy environment, if existing United States‘ environmental rights were imbued with more of a human rights sensibility it might create a culture shift that would make scenarios like the Chukchi Sea leases less likely. </span>

On the basis of the most recent data from the World Health Organization, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the United States ranks 32nd in the world in life expectancy</span>—behind such countries as Japan, Australia, Italy, Greece, Iceland, Malta, and Luxembourg— <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">despite ranking third in total expenditures on health car</span>e as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) (WHO 2010). Clearly, the United States still faces important challenges to promoting health and enhancing quality of life. For example, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">chronic diseases, </span>many of which are preventable,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> account for more than 50% of all deaths e</span>ach year (King et al. 2008). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Almost half of all adults have at least one chronic illness</span> (Wu and Green 2000). Obesity, a major risk factor for numerous health conditions, has grown to epidemic proportions in the United States (Ogden et al. 2007, 2008): one-third of all adults and almost one-fifth of people 6-19 years old are obese. Improvement in health has been inconsistent, and major disparities in health associated with socioeconomic circumstances, race, and ethnicity persist (Williams et al. 2010). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Despite</span> major medical <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">advances and large</span> health <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">expenditures</span>, many <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Americans are unable to achieve their full health potential</span>; this affects not only the quality and duration of their lives but their ability to be engaged and productive members of society. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Poor health also has important economic implications— for lost productivity and for the costs of diagnosing and treating chronic conditions</span>. Those costs affect individuals, communities, and society at large (WHO 2001; Hammitt 2007; Mackenbach et al. 2007). For example, costs for medical care have mushroomed both in amount and as a portion of the U.S. GDP because of the increases in medical care itself, the increases in use of the health-care system, the aging of the population, and the higher rates of chronic diseases. Health-<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">care spending accounted for 7% of the U.S. GDP in 1970 and 16% of it in 2008 (CMS 2011); it is projected to be close to 20% by 2019</span> (CMS 2010), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and this projection does not take into account the substantial increases in morbidity and mortality</span> that will result from the obesity and diabetes epidemics. Diabetes alone accounted for $174 billion in health-care costs in the United States in 2007; diabetes incidence is expected to increase from 7 per 1,000 to 15 per 1,000 by 2050 and diabetes prevalence from 14% to 21% by 2050 and in some scenarios up to 33% (Boyle et al 2010). Thus, the consequences of not preventing chronic health conditions are large, not only in years of healthy life lost but in monetary costs. There is growing recognition among scientists, communities, and policymakers that health is affected by an array of factors that operate on multiple levels and throughout a person’s lifetime (Adler and Stewart 2010). Although the importance of access to and quality of health care is well recognized, prevention is key. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Disease prevention and health promotion require addressing a much broader set of factor</span>s and policies that shape health-related behaviors in addition to trying to modify biologic processes specifically related to diseases. Efforts to improve early detection and treatment of diseases through improved access to high-quality medical care must be complemented by approaches that address the underlying or root causes of disease. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The underlying causes include the factors that shape the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age,</span> and the policies that affect them. Those factors and their implications for health have been highlighted in a number of recent reports (see, for example, WHO 2002; CSDH 2008; RWJF 2009). <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">The root causes that have been identified indicate that many policies or programs thought to be unrelated to health may have important health consequences</span>. Indeed, it has been argued that major health problems, such as the obesity epidemic and its associated health and monetary costs, are essentially unintended consequences of various social and policy factors related, for example, to the mass production and distribution of energy-dense foods (Ledikwe et al. 2006; Mendoza et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2008) and the engineering of physical activity out of daily life through changes in how transportation is organized and how neighborhoods are designed and built (Gordon-Larsen et al. 2005; Li et al. 2008; Frank and Kavage 2009; Fitzhugh et al. 2010). Such policy and planning decisions have powerful implications for individual behaviors and public health. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The prevention of today’s major health problems r</span>e<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">quires understanding and intervention to affect the root causes of ill health and the policies </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">that shape and affect the root causes</span>. To <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">address them effectively, a better understanding of t</span>he possible health <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">consequences of proposed policies</span> and planning decisions as they are being developed <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is needed</span> so that adverse health effects can be anticipated and minimized and health benefits maximized. In summary, the health implications of decisions need to be considered explicitly not only to prevent harm but to promote health. Indeed, it can be argued that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">major improvements in the health of the U.S. public </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">cannot be achieved without attention to the root causes of ill health and to the policies and programs that affect them</span>. Furthermore, <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">many root causes</span> of ill health a<span class="BoldUnderlineChar">re common to the entire</span> U.S. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">population</span>, <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">so interventions that address them can have broad-based impacts</span> that benefit both high-risk groups and the general public.



Increases public health and care accessibility is key to stop bioterrorism

Green, Ontario Genomics Institute Outreach Director, 2004

(Shane, “Bioterrorism and Health Care Reform: No Preparedness Without Access,”, May Virtual Mentor, the AMA Journal of Ethics, Vol. 6, No. 5, ldg)



But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">with the US presently engaged in a “war on terror,” in which not only soldiers but also civilians are targets, a healthy fighting force is no longer enough to ensure national security; the time has come for this country to take up reforms that promote the health of all Americans.</span> Reassuringly, this is not a novel proposal. Reflecting upon statements made in 1944 by American medical historian Henry E. Sigerist, MD, concerning the power of external security threats to stimulate reform, a recent editorial in the American Journal of Public Health suggested that, “[t]his incendiary moment may be just the time for rekindling reform" [2]. Similarly, emergency physician and medical ethicist C. Griffin Trotter, MD, PhD, recently declared: “National security, I submit, is the new banner for health care reform" [3]. Consider the threat of bioterrorism: the potential <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">use of biological weapons against this country raises the specter of a unique kind of war in which battles will be fought not against soldiers and artillery but against epidemics. Without significant reform to ensure access to health care for all Americans, the US will be unable to fight such battles effectively</span>. Why Access? <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Using infectious diseases as weapons, bioterrorism threatens to weaken the civilian workforce and</span>, hence, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a nation's ability to go about its daily business</span>. Moreover, in the case of diseases that are transmissible person to person, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">each infected individual becomes a human weapon</span>, infecting others, who then infect others, and so on, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">tying up medical responders and overwhelming medical resources. A nation's greatest defense against bioterrorism</span>, both in preparation for and in response to an attack, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is a population in which an introduced biological agent cannot get a foothold, ie, healthy people with easy access to health care</span>.



Extinction

Ochs, Chemical Weapons Working Group president, 6/9/02

[Richard, "Biological Weapons Must Be Abolished Immediately,” google]



While a "nuclear winter," resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE.

Domestic change spills over to international environment leadership

DeSombre, Wellesley university environmental studies and political science professor, 2010

(Elizabeth, “The United States and Global Environmental Politics: Domestic Sources of U.S. Unilateralism”, [[http://www.polisci.ufl.edu/usfpinstitute/2010/documents/readings/DeSombre%20Chapter.pdf]], DOA: 8-18-12, ldg)



<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">U.S. leadership (or even level of participation) in international environmental agreements has been mixed, and even can be seen as declining</span> in the last decade and a half. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">To simply attribute this trend to U.S. unilateral urges misses the opportunity</span>, however<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">,</span> to <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">understand</span> when and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">why the United States is</span> more or <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">less likely to lead internationally</span> on environmental issues. Within a domestic framework that can make international participation difficult, it is nevertheless possible for the United States to exercise international leadership<span class="BoldUnderlineChar">. It tends to do so on issues it has already addressed domestically and where</span> the form of the do<span class="BoldUnderlineChar">mestic regulation fits the format of </span>the <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">international regulation</span> being considered. Under those circumstances, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">domestic opposition to international action is muted or even avoided</span> because such domestic industries, which have disproportionate influence on the senators who have to vote for ratification of any international agreements, either are not additionally disadvantaged by new international regulations or even welcome those that restrict the actions of their international competitors. To the extent that the United States returns to global environmental leadership under President Obama, it is at least as likely to be attributable to the change in the composition of the Senate as it is to executive branch leadership. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The United States took an early lead in the domestic regulation of many environmental harms in the 1960s and 1970s, and those regulations set the groundwork for many international efforts to deal with the global versions of these proble</span>ms. It is thus no surprise that the United States would be both willing and able to lead globally in addressing them. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">To the extent that the United States has more recently ceased in many issue areas to be a domestic innovator on environmental policy, it is also no surprise that the United States resists international action on newer international environmental issues</span>. Although issues such as uncertainty and the effect on the United States of the environmental problem or the costliness of regulatory solutions certainly contribute to the difficulty of international regulation, where they are particularly important may be at the level of domestic regulation. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">Those who would prefer that the United States lead internationally should perhaps focus their efforts at creating the domestic regulations that give it the incentive to do so.</span>





US leadership key to multilateral cooperation on environmental destruction-it is the litmus test

Ivanova et al., William and Mary Government and Environmental Policy professor , 2008

(Maria, “Reclaiming U.S. Leadership in Global Environmental Governance”, SAIS Review, 28(2), Summer-Fall, project muse, ldg)



What has confused analysts and policymakers, especially those overseas, is that the United States has manifested “inconsistent, hot and cold, national policies toward international organizations.” 6 While the United States was the driving force behind the creation of the United Nations in the 1940s, a number of the specialized agencies in the 1950s and 1960s, and the international environmental architecture in the 1970s, subsequent <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">U.S. reluctance to join international agreements, limited support and</span> even <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">overt opposition</span> to the United Nations, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and preference for unilateral</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">voluntary, non-binding commitments</span> <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">have resulted in an almost perpetual crisis with multilateralism</span> in general and the UN organizations in particular. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">At the core of this phenomenon lies</span> American <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">exceptionalism</span>: 7 a sense that the United States is “so different in some important respects from other countries that it cannot (or it will not) fit comfortably into the decision-making and norm-setting structures of global political bodies.” 8 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As the world’s only superpower, the United States is indeed in a unique position</span>. Even in the face of increasing global interdependence and vulnerability to terrorism or other undeniably supranational threats, <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">American exceptionalism persists, undermining meaningful international cooperation in many circumstances</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Global environmental problems, and climate change in particular, offer a potential opportunity and platform for U.S. re-engagement in collaborative</span> international <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">affairs</span>. Clearly, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">environmental challenges have global dimensions</span> that illustrate the extent of interconnectedness of the earth’s ecology as well as its economic systems. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Climate change has emerged as a top-tier</span> threat 9 as the early effects of global warming are spreading across the planet, including the United States. Alaska’s permafrost is melting, taking down homes, roads, and livelihoods. Prolonged droughts in the West and Southwest have intensified the severity and frequency of wildfires and water reservoirs have dried up in the South. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Ozone depletion</span> due to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other chemicals <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">threatens to reduce agricultural productivity</span> and leave people exposed to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation and at a greater risk of skin cancer globally. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Over-fishing has led to a collapse of fisheries in most of the world’s oceans. Deforestation unleashes carbon dioxide</span> into the atmosphere, reduces the capacity of forests to serve as carbon “sinks,” <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and eliminates</span> the forest habitat that supports much of the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">biological diversity</span> of the planet<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. These problems are notable because they represent “super-externalities,” 10 </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">which inescapably require international collaboration. The</span> logic of collective action in this global context is awkward but unavoidable. Ecologically, the actions of one actor or a small subset of actors might delay but cannot solve a problem if others continue to run-down natural resource stocks or spread pollution. Economically, national action is likely to generate diffused benefits (spread across the world) and highly concentrated costs (on producers and consumers in the country taking action). The resulting cost-benefit analysis almost always argues against action. The realities of national self-interest make it difficult to get harm-causers or natural resource users to confront the trans-boundary impact of their actions. As a result, global public goods, including international environmental protection—controlling pollution and managing shared natural resources—tend to be underprovided. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">11 In the absence of a collaborative response that draws all harm-causers and harm-bearers into a regime that internalizes these externalities and provides an appropriate degree of global-scale environmental protection, a tragedy of the commons will likely unfold</span>. 12 Pollution-causing activities will be conducted at a large scale, and open-access resources, such as the atmosphere and the oceans, will be over-exploited. Protecting shared natural resources and preventing environmental spillovers at a global scale makes sense in the context of a shared destiny, as countries move together as a world community to address common threats. To this end, as countries recognize their inability to address critical environmental problems on a national basis, collective response will spur the development of international institutions and organizations. Almost forty years ago, global environmental governance took shape as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) was established as the core, or “anchor institution” for the global environment. 13 The organization was intended to serve as the world’s ecological conscience, provide impartial monitoring and assessment, be a global source of information on the environment, “speed up international action on urgent environmental problems,” and “stimulate further international agreements of a regulatory character.” 14 Subsequently, additional elements of today’s environmental architecture have sprung up under the auspices of the United Nations to address various environmental concerns. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As new problems were identified, new organizations and agreements were established and a multi-dimensional system of global environmental governance developed. However, the earlier constructive engagement on the part of the United States has given way to a progressively more guarded and even openly hostile attitude. </span>



Extinction

Why, exactly, should we care? Let's start with the most celebrated case: the rainforests. Their loss will worsen global warming - raising temperatures, melting icecaps, and flooding coastal cities. And, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as</span> the forest <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">habitat shrinks</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">so begins the inevitable contact between organisms</span> that have not evolved together, a scenario played out many times, and one that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is never good.</span> Dreadful <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">diseases</span> have successfully <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">jump</span>ed <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">species boundaries</span>, with humans as prime recipients. We have gotten aids from apes, sars from civets, and Ebola from fruit bats. Additional <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">worldwide plagues from unknown microbes are a very real possibility</span>. But it isn't just the destruction of the rainforests that should trouble us. Healthy <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ecosystems</span> the world over <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">provide hidden services</span> like waste disposal, nutrient cycling, soil formation, water purification, and oxygen production. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Such services are best rendered by ecosystems that are diverse</span>. Yet, through both intention and accident, humans have introduced exotic species that turn biodiversity into monoculture. Fast-growing zebra mussels, for example, have outcompeted more than 15 species of native mussels in North America's Great Lakes and have damaged harbors and water-treatment plants. Native prairies are becoming dominated by single species (often genetically homogenous) of corn or wheat. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Thanks to these developments, soils will erode and become unproductive -</span> which, along with temperature change, will diminish agricultural yields. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Meanwhile, with increased pollution and runoff, as well as reduced forest cover, ecosystems </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">will no longer be able to purify water; and a shortage of clean water spells disaster. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In many ways, oceans are the most vulnerable areas of all. As overfishing eliminates major predators, while polluted and warming waters kill off phytoplankton, the intricate aquatic food web </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">could collapse from both sides</span>. Fish, on which so many humans depend, will be a fond memory. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As phytoplankton vanish, so does the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen</span>. (Half of the oxygen we breathe is made by phytoplankton, with the rest coming from land plants.) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Species extinction is also imperiling coral ree</span>fs - a major problem since these reefs have far more than recreational value: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">They provide tremendous amounts of food for human populations and buffer coastlines against erosion. </span>In fact, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the</span> global value <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">of "hidden" services provided by ecosystems - those</span> services, like waste disposal, that aren't bought and sold in the marketplace - <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">has been estimated to be as much as $50 trillion per year</span>, roughly equal to the gross domestic product of all countries combined. And that doesn't include tangible goods like fish and timber. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">Life as we know it would be impossible if ecosystems collapsed. Yet that is where we're heading if species extinction continues at its current pace. </span>

The CP solves better

a) Equity-review would maintain intergenerational equity-that solves overexploitation and deploying risky technology that would make the project end in environmental disaster – that’s 1nc Bratspies

And it gives the project legitimacy and nullifies future backlash

Wolsink, Amsterdam geography professor, 2010

(Maarten, “Contested environmental policy infrastructure: Socio-political acceptance of renewable energy, water, and waste facilities”, Environmental Impact Assessment Review Volume 30, Issue 5, September 2010, Pages 302–311, ScienceDirect, ldg)



In the example case of the IPWA (InterProvincial Windfarm Afsluitdijk) we see this reflected. The case is analysed based on actor and process data and a survey conducted among the individuals who are most committed to the Wadden region, which is an internationally significant and ecologically sensitive landscape (Wolsink, 2010). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This project was an interesting hybrid between onshore and offshore wind power</span>. Within policy-making circles it is often suggested that siting wind farms offshore could solve the problems encountered onshore. This idea is extremely naïve; siting issues offshore are just as relevant as onshore (Jay, 2008). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This large wind farm project failed, because it was projected in the Wadden Sea. T</span>here has been a comprehensive EIA study, but as is the practice in the Netherlands, the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">participation in that process remained limited</span> to some tiers of government and the energy company Nuon. As appraisal in terms of SIA is only voluntary, the most important NGO and the obvious stakeholder to include in the process, the Wadden Vereniging, was excluded. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This national environmental organisation aiming to protect the Wadden area was not involved in planning</span> the IPWA, and neither was any local or regional “sense of ownership” created (Warren and McFadyen, 2010). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As neither any other important societal stakeholder was included in the process, the approach reinforced a relationship distrust between NGO's and the public on one side, and the energy organisations and government on the other</span> (Mumford and Gray, 2010). <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">This case clearly demonstrates the adverse consequences of planning a wind farm in a top–down and centralised manner.</span> The approach excluded crucial actors, also excluding the knowledge and values represented by those marginalised actors. The ignorance about existing options for securing conditional support was sustained. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The developers never learned that the landscape type of the site</span>, in the WaddenSea, is a landscape which sorely needs to be protected. That choice was the strongest reason for the WaddenVereniging to oppose the project, whereas the survey among its members who fully identify themselves with the ecologically sensitive WaddenSea, showed that wind turbines alongside the Afsluitdijk (the 32 km long dyke separating WaddenSea and IJsselmeer) would nevertheless have been acceptable to a clear majority (Wolsink, 2010). The <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">developers never learned about this feasible option, because their process was not designed for deliberation</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Eventually, the WaddenVereniging applied its strategic political influence </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">and the proposed project was cancelled.</span> The WaddenSea wind farm failure shows that institutional conditions that support the involvement of civil society must be created. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">Application of SIA principles could have helped the project to succeed</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, but clear socio-political acceptance of such necessary measures is absent among government agencies and other actors in the energy markets and spatial planning realm.</span> Despite strong rhetoric, Dutch wind power policy has been very inconsistent over more than two decades (Breukers and Wolsink, 2007) and the socio-political acceptance of effective measures among policy makers and the incumbent energy sector, has clearly been far below the level of Germany for example (Agterbosch and Breukers, 2008).



b) At worst minor repairs boost solvency

Yet <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">officials i</span>n transportation and other <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sectors like energy</span>, agriculture or housing <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">do not routinely</span> identify and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">address </span>the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">health implications</span> of their decisions. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">One way to address this shortcoming is a</span> powerful approach called a health impact assessment (<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">HIA</span>), which is being used worldwide to identify unintended health risks and unnecessary costs. At the same time, <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">HIAs build in solutions</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> aimed at keeping people healthy</span>. For example, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">collaboration</span> between city planners and health officials on an HIA for a proposed housing development in Colorado <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has led to new measures that will minimize the impact of pollution</span> from local roadways <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and offer residents greater opportunities for exercise, all with a minimum investment of time and expense. </span>



c) Leads to future policies that solve better

Bhatia et al., San Francisco Department of Public Health, 2009

(Rajiv, “Integrating human health into environmental impact assessment: an unrealized opportunity for environmental health and justice”, July/Aug, [[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1413-81232009000400022&script=sci_arttext]], DOA: 8-18-12, ldg)



<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The case examples also illustrate that the integrated HIA/EIA can result in new policies, regulatory measures, or project designs that protect and promote health</span>. In the case of Trinity Plaza, for example, documenting the potential impacts of displacement on health through the EIA process led the developer to modify the project design to include affordable housing units for existing tenants, mitigating the impact in advance of the EIA. The analysis of roadway air quality impacts in the Eastern Neighborhoods EIA is currently being translated into citywide planning and zoning regulations. In <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Alaska, integrated HIA/EIA led to the proposed adoption of new regulatory measures to monitor environmental and health indicators</span> and to require HIA and site-specific mitigation for future development proposals. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It also initiated a multilateral policy discussion regarding how to promote long-term</span> socioeconomic <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">stability and community well-being. The power of this approach is being recognized by diverse community and social justice groups</span>. In Oakland, California, for example, tenants’ advocates familiar with the San Francisco experience used public health evidence to articulate how a policy to facilitate the conversion of apartments to condominiums might lead to increased traffic, crowding, poor sanitation, and homelessness, thus requiring an EIA61. On this basis, advocates successfully argued for the city council to send the condo conversion policy back for further study and revision. In Alaska, tribes are now successfully bringing the issue of health into the regulatory process for a number of large industrial proposals.

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">The United States federal government should narrowly delegate authority over national inter-city and inter-state high-speed passenger rail to state governments, appropriate territories, and multi-state compacts related to corridors and hub networks.

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Chicago Tribune ‘1</span>

(“Let states drive high-speed train,” Dec 24, http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-12-24/news/0112240192_1_high-speed-rail-investment-high-speed-train-high-speed-rail)

Amtrak--the money-losing operation that poses as a national passenger railroad in the U.S.--is taking the lead in the development of a high-speed train network in the Midwest, comparable to the European trains that zoom by at more than 150 m.p.h. High-speed rail service in the Midwest is an interesting prospect--the market, as well as environmental, energy conservation and other concerns, may justify it. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">putting Amtrak in charge and expecting the feds to pay for most of it certainly is a recipe for waste and bad planning</span>. For the Midwest, at least, a frequent, comfortable and reliable <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">high-speed rail system</span> would be a new concept. It <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ought to be designed</span> and operated as such, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">according to market demand, </span>//with a rigorous bottom-line approach//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. In other words, everything Amtrak is not.</span> According to plans being circulated in Congress and promoted by several local groups, Chicago would be the hub of a series of high-speed rail lines zipping out to Minneapolis-St. Paul, Detroit, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Cleveland and other major urban areas, with stops at some smaller cities like Springfield, Ill., and Madison, Wis. New trains would run on upgraded freight tracks at estimated speeds of 110 m.p.h. The initial phase would be funded by approximately $4 billion, the Midwest's share of the $12 billion High Speed Rail Investment initiative, under consideration by Congress. Individual states have pledged smaller amounts to the effort, including Illinois' $50 million. A reverse logic animates this project: Instead of determining there is urgent demand--and then seeking funding--Midwestern supporters seem to be saying, "The pot of money is there, so we might as well get our share." That's not the way to build a new railroad, but to extend <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Amtrak</span> domain which, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">torn by the incompatible demands of politics,</span> public service and profitability, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has evolved into anything but an efficient train system. </span>//States ought to take the lead in//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the </span>//high-speed rail//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> effort, </span>//and contribute a substantial amount of the money.// Perhaps the federal government could pay for the start-up infrastructure improvements, as it did to build the original interstate highway system in the 1950s. Then <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">an independent multi-state agency could purchase the trains and turn over operations to a private concern. Such high stakes and strong participation by the states would lead to a far tougher analysis of what service is needed than the pinata-style planning at play here</span>. Built modestly and incrementally, high-speed rail could work and even make money, at which time full privatization would be the next step. A Chicago-to-St. Louis line, running on relatively underutilized freight tracks through Normal and Springfield, could be a key test. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Run efficiently, it could compete favorably</span> with airlines on speed of downtown-to-downtown service, and certainly on roominess and comfort. Regional high-speed service has caught on in California and in the Northwest, and it may well do so here. Although Amtrak's math is complicated, the agency projects that, when fully operational, its high-speed Acela line on the Northeast will make about $180 million in annual profit Are there enough commuters and are they willing to give up their cars or airline seats in favor of high-speed trains? //If it's their own money on the line,//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> state officials, planners--and taxpayers--would make sure the project makes sense before any money is invested</span>. High-speed train service in the Midwest is a prospect worth investigating, on the right terms.



Multi-State compacts specifically solve for HSR.

(Office of Public Affairs – US Department of Transportation – FACT SHEET , The Passenger Rail Investment Reform Act of 2003 – http://www.dot.gov/affairs/Passenger%20Rail%20Fact%20Sheet.htm)



* The Administration believes that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">states</span>, not Amtrak, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are best equipped to decide where rail service is important.</span> //States should be empowered to choose the rail service provider// of their choice, whether it's Amtrak, a private company or a public transit agency. Following a transition, the Administration's proposal would allow states to submit proposals for passenger rail capital investment to the U.S. Department of Transportation, as they have successfully done for highway and transit capital investments. * Amtrak would transition into three companies: * A private passenger rail company that would operate trains under contract to states and multi-state compacts - just as the current Amtrak operates trains under contract to commuter rail agencies; * A private rail infrastructure company that would maintain and operate the infrastructure on the Northeast Corridor under contract to a multi-state Northeast Corridor Compact. Title to Amtrak's current tracks, stations and other infrastructure on the Northeast Corridor will be held by the federal government and leased to the Northeast Corridor Compact; and * The National Passenger Rail Corporation, which would continue as a government corporation that would retain Amtrak's current right to use the tracks of the freight railroads, and the Amtrak corporate name. Both the track-access rights and the Amtrak brand would be provided under contract to states and multi-state compacts for qualifying passenger rail service they sponsor. * Separating train operations and infrastructure ownership is not a new concept. Train operations and infrastructure ownership have for decades been split in the United States. Amtrak operates trains over more than 22,000 miles of track in the United States, but owns only 730 miles of track (mostly on the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C. and Boston, and in Michigan). All other tracks are owned either by freight railroads or by the states. * <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Multi-state compacts are not new</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Multi-state coalitions are already operating intercity rail services, and</span> some are <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">planning for future </span>//high-speed rail operations//. The Administration believes <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">these cooperative partnerships between the states</span>, the federal government and freight railroads, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will improve </span>the efficiency of<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> intercity passenger rail service as a viable alternative to air and highway travel </span>in some corridors.

The next point is that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if a particular corridor extends beyond individual state borders, close coordination</span>—both formal and informal—<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">with </span>your <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">neighbors is essential</span>.

Allowing the states to deficit spend solves the economy

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Attewell 2009</span> (Steven Professor at the University of California Santa Barbra, in US Public Policy, MA from UCSB, BA from Columbia University , Dissertation done on Public at Work: Public Employment, the New Deal, and the American Welfare State," Fifty-State Keynesianism - Part Deux, July 31st http://www.economicpopulist.org/content/fifty-state-keynesianism-part-deux AS)

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Why</span> is it the case that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">America's state governments have become so strongly pro-cyclical</span>? <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The</span> basic <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">reason is that all but one state in the Union </span>(Vermont being the exception) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">have some form of a balanced budget or debt limitation requirement, which makes it impossible to deficit spend during recessions.</span> Many of these requirements date back over a hundred years, following the Panic of 1837, which caused nine states to default on their "internal improvement" (i.e, transportation infrastructure) related debts in 1842, which prompted a wave of anti-debt measures. The state of New York, for example, adopted a new constitution in 1846, which required a 2/3rds vote for appropriations bills and a 3/5ths vote for any bill that would raise taxes or incur debts. Illinois' 1848 constitution required a 2/3 vote for appropriations, a balanced budget requirement, and a $50,000 cap on state debts. Similar waves of constitutional redrafting tended to follow other major recessions in which states suddenly were unable to finance their debts, such as the Panics of 1857 and 1873 (triggered by the failure of banks that had over-speculated on railroads). The question is why we allow a "hobgoblin of little minds" over a hundred and seventy years old to continue to rule over us? Why, when even a total economics amateur like myself can pick up Keynes and learn about the "paradox of thrift," do we continue to allow the political cliche that "well, families have to balance their budgets, so the government should too" to be the conventional wisdom of the stump speech? (Incidentally, given the fact that most American families are horribly in debt and are relying on their credit cards to make ends meet, this couldn't be less accurate). A 50-State Solution: One of the things that's often puzzled me about the progressive movement is our lack of willingness to use the initiative process to our advantage in both achieving policy ends and mobilizing the electorate - consider the way in which the Republican Party used anti-gay marriage propositions in 2002 and 2004 to gin up their right-wing base, change the political debate from economic issues to their wedge issues, and attack the civil rights and civil liberties of queer Americans. In 2006, we saw a little bit of this strategy on the progressive side, using minimum wage initiatives to increase working class turnout in states like Ohio, but to the best of my knowledge it hasn't become a standard part of the Democratic Party political toolkit. Hence<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, the first step in establishing "50-state Keynesianism" is to promote, state-by-state an "Anti-Recession Budget Reform Initiative."</span> (if anyone has a better name for it, I'm open to suggestions). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This initiative should amend the state constitution's balanced budget requirement to allow the state, when the economy is in recession</span> (i.e, two quarters of negative economic growth) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to run a limited deficit </span>(<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">two years maximum) for the purposes of funding counter-cyclical stimulus programs (limited to</span> say, 5<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">-10% of state GDP</span>). We should begin our push in those areas which are deep blue states and which tend to have weaker balanced budget requirements - New England would be a good starting place, especially with Vermont as the lone non-balanced budget state sitting there as a model for how deficit spending won't destroy western civilization. The Rust Belt states that have been especially hit hard, like [[@http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/07/michigan-dems-hoping-for-a-populist-revival.php|Michigan ]]or Ohio, would probably be receptive to a message that it's better to spend money to create jobs than to balance a budget by throwing teachers and other state workers out of their jobs. As usual, the major prizes would be New York and California, given their size and political weight. Second, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in order to build state capacity for Keynesian economic policy, we should also push for the creation of State Reserve Banks.</span> Here, I really have to credit [[@http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellen-brown|Ellen Brown]] over at the Huffington Post for promoting this idea and bringing it to my attention. This amazingly simple yet powerful idea takes its example from, of all places, the state of North Dakota, which has operated the Bank of North Dakota since 1919. It works like this - <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the state charters a public bank, and instead of placing its reserves</span>, tax revenues, deeds for public lands, and so forth <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in a variety of state banks</span> (as most states do),<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> it puts all of them in the public bank to act as the bank's capital base.</span> (Note: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as long as the bank only circulates U.S dollars, it's perfectly constitutional,</span> avoiding the Article I, Section 10 bar against states issuing coin or bills of credit) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The bank then acts like a reserve bank, using the power of "</span>[[@http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking|fractional reserve lending]]<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">" </span>(i.e, that a bank can generate much more money in loans than it keeps in its vaults, thus multiplying many times over its actual reserves, as long as it keeps back a portion to redeem deposits) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to generate loans, act as a local "lender of last resort"</span> (thus buttressing the work of the Federal Reserve and FDIC during credit crises), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and </span>(this is the key bit) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">allowing the State to borrow money in order to deficit spend in a recession without relying on the ideologically-biased bond market and the credit agencies</span> who've taken a hammer to state bond ratings while maintaining A ratings for AIG and Lehman Brothers. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The State could then use these loans </span>(which would be much cheaper than ordinary bonds, given that its essentially paying interest to itself)<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to maintain public services and fund public works and other stimulus measures in a recession.</span> Third, as I've [[@http://realignmentproject.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/the-front-line-of-defense-unemployment-insurance-reform/|suggested ]][[@http://realignmentproject.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/public-employment-a-presentation/|before]], one of the best ways to fight a recession is to create jobs directly. Hence, with all this new fiscal and monetary muscle, we should set up a WPA-like system of State "Job Insurance." While the Federal government is best suited to this task, in that it has superior powers to deficit spend and print money, state governments could run their own permanent job insurance systems, establishing State J.I Funds, contributions from workers and employers, and assistance from the general fund. The idea would be to create short-term jobs (say 6-month duration, with a right to re-apply after a job search at the end of 6 months) at $10 an hour - the number of jobs directed at reducing unemployment by whatever proportion (say, 50% in the example below) needed to keep unemployment at or below a specific level. As the economy turned around, these jobs could be gradually eliminated (at 1/2 the rate of job growth, for example) in order to not damage the recovery as happened when the WPA was suddenly downsized in 1937-8.

The federal-state transit courtship ritual is by now a well-rehearsed dance. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Washington’s alluring checkbook tempts states enough that they commit matching funds to projects</span> they otherwise would not even dream of pursuing on their own. Take high-speed rail and other passenger rail projects—<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">they are expensive to build and maintain, and states are faced with many other pressing infrastructure needs but limited resources to pay for them</span>. So, “free” money from Washington seems too good to be true. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Then come project delays and construction cost overruns. Federal grants also have strings attached, such as union wage requirements, which send costs skyward. Soon, the price tag of an HSR project is substantially more than what states signed up for. Once</span> the HSR line is <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">built</span>, another pesky fact materializes: Actual rail <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ridership rates do not necessarily equal capacity estimates</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Poor ridership translates into large funding gaps, and befuddled states then have trouble covering operating expenses,</span> let alone capital costs.

Rails boost local property value – that incentivizes long-term private investment in the future

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Puentes ‘9</span>

Funding and Financing Policy Options for States – – January 05, 2009 – http://www.nga.org/files/live/sites/NGA/files/pdf/0901TRANSPORTATIONFUNDING.PDF)

The idea is that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">rail systems</span>, by improving accessibility, will <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">increase land values</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The </span>increment over any pre-existing <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">property value can then be taxed, thereby “capturing” the benefit that accrues </span>to private landowners <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">by virtue of the public rail investment and helping to defray rail construction or operating costs</span>. Although the idea of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">value capture has been</span> discussed in policy circles for years, it is <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">employed in</span> relatively few places and most prominently in the form of benefit assessment districts in metropolitan areas like <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Miami</span>, Florida; <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Los Angeles</span>, California; <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and Denver</span>, Colorado.103 For example, construction of a transit station is likely to increase land values in the walking radius near the area. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The local government could choose to dedicate the taxes from the incremental increase in property values to repaying bonds issued for its construction</span>, an approach known as tax increment financing (TIF). Alternatively, private property owners could choose to create a special tax district that would allocate costs of the project to beneficiaries. In most states, a vote of the affected landowners is required. The general principle at work here is known as value capture financing, where non-transportation users, primarily adjacent property owners who benefit from transportation projects, contribute to the costs of such projects. It should be noted that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the revenues generated</span> by value capture financing schemes generally <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">do not flow directly to the state</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">However, they are becoming an increasingly important source of local match revenues to state projects</span>, as such contributions grow as a percentage of total state project costs. In 2004, it is estimated that such specialized taxes and contributions amounted to $15.4 billion for highway projects ($3.8 billion federal and state, $11.6 billion local) and $9.5 billion for transit projects ($3.6 billion state, $6.1 billion local), for a total of $24.9 billion.104 Table 4 details the role that specialized taxes, such as TIF or special tax districts, play in funding highways and transit.

To begin with, as mentioned in [[http://realignmentproject.wordpress.com/2009/07/30/50-state-keynesianism-part-2/|part 2]], <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the establishment of state reserve banks are a critical structure for developing a stable and counter-cyclical source of financing during recessions, both to fund the consumption function programs , and to provide the capital to keep necessary public investments running in times when the private credit markets have frozen up.</span> However<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, it is only once “fractional reserve lending is combined with an agile use of the power to tax</span> (as opposed to the 2/3rds rule in California) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and a temporary suspension of balanced budget rules that individual states can muster enough financial muscle to be able to run counter-cyclically.</span>

Plan creates new forums for cooperation and manages Arctic tensions.

Antrim, Stimson Rule of Law Committee for the Oceans executive director, 2012

(Caitlyn, “Relocating the Reset: U.S.-Russian Partnership in the Arctic”, 2-29, [[http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/11627/relocating-the-reset-u-s-russian-partnership-in-the-arctic]], DOA: 9-29-12, ldg)

Instead, the U.S.-Russia relationship can be strengthened by opening a new front that engages governments, businesses and civil society at regional and local levels to address issues of economics, environment and quality of life. Just such an opportunity can be found in the Arctic, where both countries share a frontier as well as the challenge of managing the Arctic environment as climate change makes the region more accessible. Cooperation is already occurring in the Arctic, specifically the area between the North Pole and the Bering Strait along the antimeridian and the coasts of the Russian Far East, Alaska and Canada. Beyond the high-level forum of the Arctic Council, where national governments and indigenous people are represented, there is a history over the past two decades of relationship-building at the state and local levels, spearheaded by Alaskan and Russian governors. Issues of fisheries, Bering Strait shipping, regional development and environmental protection have led to increased regional cooperation. But differences in language and culture, business practices and law, and, most of all, legacies of nearly a century of national distrust have left these local ties in dire need of their own reset. Given the region’s distance from the two countries’ national capitals, ownership of this kind of initiative should be devolved to state and provincial leaders, indigenous people, civil society organizations and businesses, with encouragement and support from national governments and intergovernmental organizations. The countries of the antimeridianal Arctic, which is effectively separated from the more economically developed regions of the Barents and Kara seas, stand to gain from a regional partnership that addresses their common interests and concerns. Russia sees the opportunity to develop its vast Arctic watershed, which is becoming accessible with the rejuvenation of the Northern Sea Route across its Arctic coast. Alaska wants to capture benefits in energy development and trans-Arctic trade. The Canadian territories stand to gain from increased mineral development. All three countries have common interests in sustainable fisheries, a clean environment and protection of native cultures. These interests can open opportunities for regional cooperation toward a new and productive future for the people of eastern Russia and North America. But cooperation without structure runs the risk of being ad hoc and ineffective. That’s why such an initiative should take the form of a regional council representing the states, territories and populations of the antimeridianal Arctic to identify problems and implement solutions that benefit the people of the region and the nations themselves. In addition to developing a durable partnership across Russia, Alaska and northern Canada, a regional council should be a partner to the high-level Arctic Council, providing it with local insight and advice as well as assistance in implementing its recommendations in ways most compatible with local and regional concerns. The antimeridianal Arctic provides a promising new front on which to reinvigorate the U.S.-Russia reset. Far from the centers of national government and politics, local governments and populations may provide more stable and continuous leadership. Issues of economic development and environmental protection can provide common focus, in contrast to the competitive aspects of national security and great power politics. The participation of Canada's northern territories can moderate the inevitable spillover of Washington-Moscow politics into the development of a regional partnership for the antimeridianal Arctic. So, too, would the overarching interests of the Arctic Council and other international organizations -- as well as multinational businesses, environmental organizations and indigenous people’s organizations that transcend national borders -- help develop a new partnership in the Arctic. For the sake of the Arctic as well as for East-West relations, the three federal governments should encourage and support the creation of such a council and recognize that regional leadership will be the key to its success.



CP solves econ – labor force and investment.

Herman, Cleveland immigration lawyer, 2007

(Richard, “Immigration Opportunities...”, 12-26, [[http://realneo.us/blog/ed-morrison/immigration-opportunities]], DOA: 9-30-12, ldg)

Considering the economic situation in the Rustbelt, and in light of the immigration waves that the Rustbelt previously attracted, there clearly is an opportunity for the Rustbelt Region to collaborate and drive a federal lobbying strategy to create immigration incentives that would attract companies to co-locate, remain, and grow within the zone. Why would companies come? Because they would be free of many of the business-crushing immigration restrictions that severely limit their ability to hire foreign-born talent within U.S. borders --- the same talent demographic that is driving much of U.S.-based technology innovation and entrepreneurship. Increasing number of U.S. high-tech companies are publicly stating that the primary reason they are off-shoring R&D and high-tech jobs is because U.S. immigration law prevents them from hiring immigrant talent within the U.S. due to archaic visa quotas that have NO relationship to market realities and the globalization of talent (the current H1B visa cap of 65,000 was established in 1990!). For more on the economic development opportunities that are being suppressed due to unsound immigration policy on H1B visas, please see December, 2007 Policy Brief from the National Foundation for American Policy (which includes Ohio University Economist Richard Vedder), entitled “Driving Jobs & Innovation Offshore: The Impact of High Skill Immigration Restrictions on America”: http://www.nfap.com/pdf/071206study.pdf As several of you have eloquently stated, the proposal is intended to attract companies to locate and grow within the zone by reducing the barriers to hiring foreign talent. The hope would be that companies, some of whom are already outsourcing jobs due to immigration restrictions, would now consider “in-sourcing” those same jobs to U.S. based High Skill Immigration Zones. Such new or expanded company operations within the Zone would clearly include the creation of new jobs for local workers. The cumulative effect of the Zone would hopefully be the accelerated creation of deep pools of talent (innovators, researchers, technology entrepreneurs, global business professionals, etc.), which in turn would attract other companies (even those not interested in the immigration incentives), stimulate the creation of new businesses and industries, help globalize the region, and create new opportunities that would serve as a magnet for people of all backgrounds to relocate or return to the Rustbelt. A regional collaboration between Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Erie, Youngstown, Detroit/Ann Arbor, Buffalo, etc., may create a critical mass sufficient for successful H1B reform. In partnership with some of the largest non-Rustbelt technology companies in the world, a collaboration between Rustbelt technology companies, economic development orgs, foundations, and congressional leaders, might provide enough juice for a successful D.C. lobbying effort for 2009. Thanks to Ed Morrison for informing us of Ann Arbor's recent High Skill Immigration Efforts: http://www.useurl.us/17l http://www.annarborspark.org/ http://www.annarborspark.org/about-us/governance/ For those who are interested, a bit of background on the Zone may help. First, we started to shop this idea of a "high skill immigration zone" to technology business leaders around the country this past spring while immigration law reform was hot in D.C This proposal has received enthusiastic support from immigrant billionaire Michael Moritz (immigrant from Scotland), principal of Sequoia Capital in Silicon Valley, who was personally an early funder of immigrant-founded companies such as Google, Yahoo, and Paypal. The proposal also received interest from general counsels of Cisco and Infosys Technologies Ltd., the Director of the Software and Information Industry Association, Audrey Singer of Brookings, Joel Kotkin, Ellen Gallagher (Special Counsel, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service), and others. The idea to create a Rust Belt Technology Playground for Immigrant Scientists, Engineers and Technology Entrepreneurs (high skill immigration zone) is based on existing law that creates incentives for immigrant talent and capital to locate in struggling or under-served geographic regions. http://www.nobleoutreach.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/wsj-norlogo.pdf http://www.useurl.us/16e http://www.useurl.us/16f While the Investor Green Card Program creates incentives to attract foreign capital to distressed regions, we are similarly advocating for special incentives to attract foreign talent to distressed regions. Creative Class guru Richard Florida has dismissed the proposal of a High Skill Immigration Zone as elitist, as inefficient, and as a undue limitation on an immigrant’s freedom to live where they wish. While I agree with Dr. Florida that is critical to promote a more open/welcoming attitude to all talent (regardless of education, economic strata, national origin, sexual orientation, etc.), I think that he underestimates the boost that high skill immigration legislation could have on rustbelt economies if tied to regional market indicators. I think that efforts to create a more tolerant attitude towards immigrants (see below) AND create new immigration law that reflects those attitudes and the special needs of struggling post-industrial cities, is a combination that needs to be aggressively pursued. Many high skill immigrants are leaving the U.S. period, not just Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Youngstown, etc. for other U.S. cities. Upon graduation from our universities, international students are left with few opportunities to stay and work in the U.S. because of virtual non-existence of h1b professional worker visas. 65,000 H1b visas for 2007-2008 were exhausted on 1st day of application period; government received 115,000 applications on 4/1/07. And this not even mentioning the chilling effect that low H1b numbers are having on those outside the U.S. contemplating a move to u.s. to study or work. A high-skill immigration zone would not restrain an immigrant’s choice on where to reside in the U.S., it would provide an opportunity for the immigrant to reside in the U.S. period AND provide necessary talent to a struggling region. The focus of the proposal, however, is to attract companies with jobs to the Rustbelt and similarly situated regions. These jobs are already being outsourced from the U.S. because of the unavailability of U.S.-born talent, and the near-impossibility of U.S. companies to import those workers into the U.S. Just see the reasons give by Microsoft in setting up new R&D in Vancouver this summer. http://www.useurl.us/16g http://www.competeamerica.org/ Companies which are currently outsourcing these jobs overseas, would be very interested in a High Skill Immigration Zone that would allow them to establish operations in the zone without concern over immigration restrictions. Thousands of high-tech jobs are going unfilled in the rustbelt due to talent shortage, and this shortage is negatively impacting company growth, expansion and retention. http://www.neotechjobs.com/

(Neal, “Skilled Immigrants: The Stimulus We Need?”, 12-27, [[http://www.postwritersgroup.com/archives/peir091227.htm]], DOA: 9-30-12, ldg)

Are skilled and entrepreneurial immigrants the economic stimulus that America needs? Could lowered barriers help regions like the country's Rust Belt prosper again? This is the audacious case that Cleveland immigration attorney Richard T. Herman and his journalist co-author, Robert L. Smith, make in their new book -- "Immigrant Inc." The mere thought that immigrants are an American asset, not a liability, puts a whole new face on the Lou Dobbs-style attacks on America's 12 million undocumented immigrants that CNN so long tolerated and right-wing media still promote. The rancor over illegal immigrants, Herman and Smith argue, obscures the fact that legal immigrants make up the bulk of America's foreign-born population. Rather than agonize over youths scaling Mexican border walls, they'd have us focus on the thousands of would-be immigrants standing in consulate lines around the world, and often forced to wait years, if not decades to enter the U.S. legally. That queue of would-be legal migrants, they argue, encompasses "brilliant engineers, high-technology specialists, investors and merchants almost certain to become entrepreneurs." If our antiquated immigration laws didn't so often and needlessly exclude them, many more would be arriving to stoke economic activity "in whatever part of America they land." The story is not new. Immigrants were founders of such corporations as Dow Chemical, DuPont, Pfizer, Proctor & Gamble and Carnegie (later U.S.) Steel. And not just yesteryear: Immigrants founded Google, Yahoo, Intel, PayPal and YouTube. Since 1995, they've formed more than half of new Silicon Valley firms, driving one of the world's hottest economies. The problem is we have a dinosaur of an immigration system -- one that discriminates against talented scientists and engineers who want to come here. Only 9 percent of the coveted "green cards" -- immigrant visas for permanent U.S. residency -- go to people coming to practice a profession, pursue science or start a company. It's as if we weren't in a fiercely competitive century in which the globe's most talented mathematicians, engineers and chemists, if excluded here, can as easily choose to form their world-class companies in Banglalore, Beijing, Tel Aviv, Seoul or Singapore. And the gain is not just in super-scientists and high-flying corporate successes. Our cities benefit. Immigrant storefronts, University of Massachusetts researchers report, pack the power to spark commercial revivals on poor and lonely streets, their sales of fresh foods, flowers and phone cards generating foot traffic and enhancing safety. A case in point: the West Philadelphia neighborhood around 52nd and Market Streets, an African-American community fallen on hard times with job losses and violent crime. But Liberian immigrants have been flooding in so that even on weekdays, sidewalk tables laden with merchandise stretch for blocks, selling everything from clothing to watches and sunglasses. Immigrant-run shops, stores and restaurants are proliferating. There's a downside. At least for a time, immigrants may depress wages, especially in the lower-income range. But studies show high-immigrant cities enjoy more robust economies than those with few newcomers -- that immigrants and the businesses they create provide rundown neighborhoods with a powerful jolt of new investment and spinoff job opportunities. New York, Miami, Seattle and Boston all provide evidence that the formula works. But Herman argues such older and lagging cities as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo and Detroit need a shot of the same adrenaline. He praises a turnaround in Philadelphia, which managed to gain 113,000 immigrants from 2000 to 2006 despite City Hall indifference. By contrast, the new mayor, Michael Nutter, enthusiastically calls Philadelphia "an immigrant-friendly city." A Welcoming Center for New Pennsylvanians, formed by a citizen activist in 2003, has helped 6,000 immigrants from 86 countries with "English for Entrepreneurs" classes, employment, business and accounting courses. It's high time, Herman says, for the businesses and allied forces of the Midwest to press Congress to create a Great Lakes "High-Skill Immigration Zone" to let the Frost Belt cities more easily recruit skilled immigrants. The thicket of federal regulations restricting entry by skilled foreigners would be thinned for the region, with a goal of fresh startups and easier job recruitment to help its cities and metros start excelling in such emerging areas as biotechnology and clean and renewable energy technology.

CP key to sustain and diversify the region

McNess Pittsburgh Business Times 2008

(Barbara, “Time is now to realize great lakes region’s potential”, 12-1, [[http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2008/12/01/editorial1.html]], DOA: 9-30-12, ldg)

While pundits and political candidates can be quick to stereotype it as the “Rust Belt,” the fact that the binational Great Lakes region is the most important region in North America cannot be denied. Combined, the region makes up the second-largest economy in the world; accounts for 33 percent of the U.S. population, nearly a third of the national gross domestic product and 30 percent of exported goods; and is the hub of American innovation, accounting for nearly 30 percent of all U.S. patents. Furthermore, a fifth of all the fresh water in the world is found in this region. It is clear that we need a long-term plan that maximizes our ability to realize the potential of the entire region for generations to come. We must focus on federal policy priorities that will support the continued transition and integration of this binational region into the evolving global economy. For that reason, we at the Allegheny Conference on Community Development and the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce have been working throughout the year with more than 20 business organizations and chambers of commerce, as well as key staff from the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program, to establish a business agenda for the entire Great Lakes region. The agenda we’ve developed as a regional coalition includes five key federal policy priorities to strengthen our competitiveness and economic performance: 1. Create federal transportation infrastructure policy and funding to support the unique needs of inland metropolitan regions that today operate as global gateways and centers of trade and commerce. The federal government must lead the development of an intermodal transportation strategy focused on the competitiveness of the American economy. 2. Create a 21st-century northern border with Canada that balances national security with economic security through accelerating binational economic advantages in the movement of both goods and people. Specifically, we need to integrate policy, technology and procedures to move people and goods across the northern border in line with a 15-minute, just-in-time standard. 3. Establish federal immigration policy that facilitates significant international talent attraction, integration and retention. The federal government should move to establish High Skill Immigration Zones in metro areas throughout the region.

===1nc fiscal cliff=== 

Obama has the influence to prevail in fiscal cliff negotiations now---political capital is key

Sprung, Rochester PhD, 9-21-12

(Andrew, “Ezra Klein's unconvincing theory that Obama misunderstands (or misrepresents) "change”, [[http://xpostfactoid.blogspot.com/2012/09/ezra-kleins-unconvincing-theory-that.html]], DOA: 9-27-12, ldg)



In my view, Klein is viewing this question too narrowly. Obama is well aware of the limitations of the bully pulpit, and he's got to know better than any person on the planet that presidential advocacy polarizes, entrenching the opposing party in implacable opposition to whatever the president proposes. Yet, in presenting a revamped theory of how the presidency works, he's not just feeding us a line of BS. And if Obama wins reelection, I believe that we will look back five or ten or twenty years from now and recognize that yes, Obama did change the way Washington works. Or at the very least, he kept the US on a sane policy course in a time of extreme polarization and thus gave (will have given...) the system space to self-correct, as it has in the past. Let's start with Klein's objection to Obama's characterization of how healthcare reform got done: The health-care process, which I reported on extensively, was a firmly “inside game” strategy. There were backroom deals with most every major interest group and every swing legislator.... By the time the law passed, many more Americans viewed it unfavorably than viewed it favorably — exactly the opposite of what you’d expect if health care had passed through an “outside game” strategy in which, as Obama put it, “the American people … put pressure on Congress to move these things forward.” And yet, health care passed. The inside game worked. All true, laddie. And yet, in claiming that the impetus for healthcare reform came from the outside, I don't think Obama is attempting to whitewash this long and messy process -- or is even referring to it. He is alluding to the marshaling or channeling of popular will that got him elected. The essence of Obama's primary election argument against Hillary Clinton was that he was better equipped to marshal the popular will for fundamental change -- with healthcare reform as the centerpiece -- than she was. I well remember the moment when that argument first impressed itself on me. It was in a debate in the immediate aftermath of the Iowa caucuses, on Jan. 5, 2008: Look, I think it's easier to be cynical and just say, "You know what, it can't be done because Washington's designed to resist change." But in fact there have been periods of time in our history where a president inspired the American people to do better, and I think we're in one of those moments right now. I think the American people are hungry for something different and can be mobilized around big changes -- not incremental changes, not small changes. I actually give Bill Clinton enormous credit for having balanced those budgets during those years. It did take political courage for him to do that. But we never built the majority and coalesced the American people around being able to get the other stuff done. And, you know, so the truth is actually words do inspire. Words do help people get involved. Words do help members of Congress get into power so that they can be part of a coalition to deliver health care reform, to deliver a bold energy policy. Don't discount that power, because when the American people are determined that something is going to happen, then it happens. And if they are disaffected and cynical and fearful and told that it can't be done, then it doesn't. I'm running for president because I want to tell them, yes, we can. And that's why I think they're responding in such large numbers. Cue the political science eye-roll. The American people were not "determined" that healthcare reform per se had to occur. You can't read the results of the 2008 wave election as a "mandate" for a specific policy. In the aftermath, the electoral tide went back out with a vengeance. But it's also true that in two years of campaigning Obama's words did inspire people, that the American people were hungry for change after Bush, that Obama made a broad and conceptually coherent case for moving the center of American politics back to the left with a renewed commitment to shared prosperity and investment in the common good, and that healthcare reform was at the center of that case. True too that the results of that election gave him enough of a majority to persist, even when relentless Republican misinformation and bad-faith negotiation and delay eroded public support. Obama also used the bully pulpit at crucial points, if not to rally public opinion, at least to re-commit wavering Democrats -- and also to convince the public, as he enduringly has, that he was more of a good faith negotiator, more willing to compromise, than the Republicans. Those pressure points were the September 2009 speech he gave to a joint session of Congress, and the remarkable eight-hour symposium he staged with the leadership of both parties in late February 2010 to showcase the extent to which the ACA incorporated past Republican proposals and met goals allegedly shared by both parties, as well as his own bend-over-backwards willingness to incorporate any Republican ideas that could reasonably be cast as advancing those goals. In a series of posts about Ronald Reagan, Brendhan Nyhan has demonstrated that presidential rhetoric generally does not sway public opinion. Savvy politicians channel public opinion; transformative ones seize an opportunity when their basic narrative of where the country needs to go aligns with a shift in public opinion, usually in response to recent setbacks or turmoil. Obama, like Reagan, effected major change in his first two years because he caught such a wave -- he amassed the political capital, and he spent it, and we got what he paid for. The force from outside -- a wave election -- empowered Obama to work change from inside in a system that reached a new peak of dysfunctionality. Klein's also objects to Obama's pitch for how to effect change going forward. In 2011, he notes, Obama highlighted the substantial change won from the messy inside game of legislating, touting the long list of legislative accomplishments of the 111th Congress. In election season, he has reverted to a keynote of his 2008 campaign: change comes from you, the electorate; it happens when ”the American people … put pressure on Congress to move these things forward.” Klein regards this as election season hooey: But while this theory of change might play better, it’s the precise theory of change that the last few years have shattered. Whatever you want to say about the inside game, it worked. Legislation passed. But after the midterm elections, it stopped working. And so the White House moved towards an outside game strategy, where ”the American people … put pressure on Congress to move these things forward.” Perhaps the most public example was Obama’s July 2011 speech, in which he said: I’m asking you all to make your voice heard. If you want a balanced approach to reducing the deficit, let your member of Congress know. If you believe we can solve this problem through compromise, send that message. So many Americans responded that Congress’s Web site crashed. But Obama didn’t get his “balanced approach,” which meant a deal including taxes. Klein goes on to recount that throughout the past year of confrontation with the GOP, pushing a jobs package that had broad popular support, Obama won only one minor victory, extension of the payroll tax cut. He then reverts to two political science tenets: presidential advocacy entrenches the opposition, and it can't move popular opinion. But I think he misreads Obama's pitch, strategy and record on several counts. First, he understates Obama's (and the Democrats') successes in the year of confrontation that has followed the debt ceiling debacle. He writes off the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefit extension as small beer. But this was actually a near-total victory in two stages against entrenched opposition, and it won Obama some vital back-door stimulus for the second year running in the wake of the GOP House takeover. It was followed by a similar GOP cave-in on maintaining low student loan interest rates -- and then again, by the collapse of the House GOP effort to renege on the Budget Control Act and impose still more spending cuts. Presidential rhetoric may not change the public mind. But when it's in sync with voter's propensities, it can deploy public opinion to bring pressure to bear on the opposition. Second, it's true that under threat of GOP debt ceiling extortion, Obama successfully marshaled public opinion in favor of his "balanced" approach to deficit reduction but wasn't able to use that pressure to move the GOP off their no-new-taxes intransigence. But that battle ain't over yet, and popular support for Obama's position is political capital that's still in the bank. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">In the upcoming fiscal cliff negotiations, Obama</span>, if he wins reelection, <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">will have the whip hand, </span>given the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and Republican teeth-gnashing over the defense cuts in the sequester. Speaking of which, Obama's refusal to intervene in the supercommittee negotiations as Republicans stonewalled once again over any tax hikes banked him further capital in this upcoming fight. Republicans are screaming much louder than Democrats about the sequester, disastrous though the cuts may be on the domestic side. Third, it's rational for Obama to recast his bid for change in election season, because of course he's seeking further "change" from the outside, i.e., more Democrats elected to Congress. He's not going to win a mandate as in 2008, or, most likely, majorities in both houses of Congress. But he has to make the pitch for being granted renewed tools to advance his agenda. Finally, a key part of Obama's "you are the change" pitch in his convention speech was a frank call to play defense -- to protect the changes wrought in his first term and fend off the further capture of the electoral process and the nation's resources by the oligarchy the GOP represents: If you turn away now – if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isn’t possible … well, change will not happen. If you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference, then other voices will fill the void: lobbyists and special interests; the people with the $10 million checks who are trying to buy this election and those who are making it harder for you to vote; Washington politicians who want to decide who you can marry, or control health-care choices that women should make for themselves.

Presidential leadership is key to a compromise – the alternative is the collapse of hegemony, a double-dip recession, and war in the Middle East

Huthinson, US Senator, 9-21-12

(Kay Bailey, “A Looming Threat to National Security,” States News Service, lexis, ldg)



<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Despite warnings of the dire consequences, America is teetering at the edge of a fiscal cliff</span>, with January 1st, 2013 as the tipping point. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">On that date, </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">unless Congress and the White House can reach agreement</span> on how to cut the federal deficit, all taxpayers will be hit with higher taxes and deep cuts - called "sequestration" - will occur in almost all government spending, disrupting our already weak economy and putting our national security at risk. According to the House Armed Services Committee, if <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">sequestration</span> goes into <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">effect, it would put</span> us on course for more than $1 trillion in defense cuts over the next 10 years. What would that mean? A huge hit to our military personnel and their families; devastating cuts in funding for critical military equipment and supplies for our soldiers; and <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">a</span> potentially <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">catastrophic blow to our</span> national defense and <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">security capabilities</span> in a time of increasing violence and danger. All Americans feel a debt of gratitude to our men and women who serve in uniform. But Texas in particular has a culture that not only reveres the commitment and sacrifice they make to protect our freedom, we send a disproportionate number of our sons and daughters to serve. The burden is not borne solely by those who continue to answer the call of duty, but by their families as well, as they endure separation and the anxiety of a loved one going off to war. These Americans have made tremendous sacrifices. They deserve better than to face threats to their financial security and increased risks to their loved ones in uniform, purely for political gamesmanship. Sequestration would also place an additional burden on our economy. In the industries that support national defense, as many as 1 million skilled workers could be laid off. With 43 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent, it is beyond comprehension to add a virtual army to the 23 million Americans who are already out of work or under-employed. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Government and private economic forecasters warn that sequestration </span><span class="BoldUnderlineChar">will push the country back into recession next year.</span>The recent murder of our Ambassador to Libya and members of his staff, attacks on US embassies and consulates and continued riots across the Middle East and North Africa are stark reminders that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">great portions of the world remain volatile and hostile to the US</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">We have the mantle of responsibility that being the world's lone super-power brings</span>. In <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">the absence of U.S. military leadership, upheaval in the Middle East would be worse</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As any student of history can attest, instability does not confine itself to national borders</span>. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">Strife that starts in one country can spread like wildfire across a region.</span> Sequestration's cuts would reduce an additional 100,000 airmen, Marines, sailors and soldiers. That would leave us with the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest naval fleet since 1915 and the smallest tactical fighter force in the Air Force's history. With the destabilization in the Middle East and other areas <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">tenuous, we would be left with a crippled military, a diminished stature internationally and a loss of technological research,</span> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">development and advantage</span> - <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">just as actors across the globe are increasing their capabilities. Sequestration can still be avoided</span>. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">But that will require leadership from the President t</span>hat has thus far been missing. Congress and the White House must reach a long-term agreement to reduce $1 trillion annual budget deficits, without the harsh tax increases that could stall economic growth and punish working families.



ME war goes nuclear

Russell, Naval Postgraduate School National Security professor, 2009

(James, "Strategic Stability Reconsidered: Prospects for Nuclear War and Escalation in the Middle East", http://www.nps.edu/academics/sigs/ccc/people/biolinks/russell/PP26_Russell_2009.pdf, ldg)



<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Strategic stability in the region is thus undermined by various factors: (1) asymmetric interests i</span>n the bargaining framework that can introduce unpredictable behavior from actors; (2) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the presence of non-state actors that introduce unpredictability</span> into relationships between the antagonists; (3) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">incompatible assumptions about the structure of the deterrent relationship</span> that makes the bargaining framework strategically unstable; (4) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">perceptions by Israel and the United States that its window of opportunity for military action is closing, which could prompt a preventive attack; (5) the prospect that Iran’s response to pre-emptive attacks could involve unconventional weapons, which could prompt escalation by Israel</span> and/or the United States; (6) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the lack of a communications framework</span> to build trust and cooperation among framework participants. These systemic weaknesses in the coercive bargaining framework all suggest that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">escalation by any the parties could happen either on purpose or as a result of miscalculation or</span> the pressures of wartime circumstance. Given these factors, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is disturbingly easy to imagine scenarios under which a conflict could quickly escalate in which the regional antagonists would consider the use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. It would be a mistake to believe the nuclear taboo can somehow magically keep nuclear weapons from being used </span>in the context of an unstable strategic framework. Systemic asymmetries between actors in fact suggest a certain increase in the probability of war – a war in which escalation could happen quickly and from a variety of participants<span class="underline">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Once such a war starts, events would likely develop a momentum all their own and decision-making would consequently be shaped in unpredictable ways. The international community must take this possibility seriously, and muster every tool at its disposal to prevent such an outcome, which would be an unprecedented disaster for the peoples of the region, with substantial risk for the entire world</span><span class="underline">.</span>





===2nc fiscal cliff - turns military=== 

Turns military power – delay is sufficient to trigger all of our impacts including great power conflict and turns the case

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Bucci & Graham 12</span> (Steven Bucci, Senior Research Fellow for Defense and Homeland Security, The Heritage Foundation, Ph.D., M.A. International Relations, University of South Carolina, B.S. National Security, U.S. Military Academy at West Point, graduate of the U.S. Army War College, the Hellenic Army War College in Greece and the Senior Seminar of the Department of State; and Owen Graham, Research and Operations Coordinator for National Security and Foreign Policy, The Heritage Foundation, M.A. International Politics, B.A. International Studies, American University; “Sequestration’s Shadow on the Defense Industrial Base,” The Foundry, 7-13-2012, http://blog.heritage.org/2012/07/13/sequestrations-shadow-on-the-defense-industrial-base/)

Unless the President and Congress change current law, the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces will soon face an indiscriminate, across-the-board cut of more than $500 billion over the next decade.¶ Known as “sequestration,” this massive reduction in defense spending comes in addition to the $487 billion in long-term military cuts already proposed by President Obama this year.¶ Civilian and military leaders have repeatedly warned of the dangers of these deep defense cuts. In a November 2011 letter, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta cautioned lawmakers that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sequestration cuts will be “devastating” to national defense, yielding the “smallest ground forces since 1940,” “a fleet of fewer than 230 ships, the smallest level since 1915,” and the “smallest tactical fighter force in the history of the Air Force.”</span> Moreover, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bluntly told</span> the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2012, “I am prepared to say <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that sequestration would pose unacceptable risk” to national security</span>.¶ Although the multi-year process of sequestration does not technically begin until January 2, 2013, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is already casting a dark shadow on the future readiness and responsiveness of America’s defense industrial base</span>. As Robert J. Stevens, chairman and chief executive officer of Lockheed Martin, warned:¶ The sequestration process has occurred independent of any correlation with strategy, force structure, technology needs or operational reality.… <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The impact on industry would be devastating, with a significant disruption of ongoing programs and initiatives, facility closures and substantial additional personnel reductions that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operations, erode engineering expertise, and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge, directly undermining a key provision of our new national security strategy, which is to preserve the industrial base, not dismantle it</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Once such effects take hold, they will not be easy or inexpensive to reverse. What’s worse, they could have dire implications for the defense industrial base’s future readiness and responsiveness to the competitive and ever-changing international threat environment and also for the U.S. military’s future combat capabilities in unforeseen crises</span>. To help safeguard the country’s long-term national security, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the White House and Capitol Hill should therefore act quickly to responsibly reverse sequestration</span>.¶ Sequestration’s Dangers to America’s Defense Industrial Base¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Sequestration’s shadow creates great uncertainties for</span> the Department of Defense (<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">DOD</span>) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the defense industrial base—uncertainties that endanger much-needed efforts to modernize the U.S. military’s ships, planes, tanks, and other weapons platforms</span>. As Panetta explained in an August 2011 letter to Pentagon employees, “Platforms from the build-up of the 1980s are reaching the end of their shelf life and must be replaced, and units and equipment that have been stressed by a decade of combat must be reset.” The Heritage Foundation’s Baker Spring and Michaela Bendikova elaborated:¶ The U.S. military will need to replace most of its equipment over the next 10 years, a result of a high operational tempo and an under-funding of the procurement accounts since the end of the Cold War. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">With uncertainty regarding year-to-year appropriations, DOD would not be able to credibly plan its activities over even a five-year period required by DOD’s budget process, let alone the 10-year period covered by</span> [the Budget Control Act of 2011, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the law that mandates sequestration</span>.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Pentagon program managers, now facing the real possibility of severe reductions to near-term congressional appropriations, will likely suspend major actions for current contracts and delay bids for new contracts—even before sequestration formally begins</span>. As the American Enterprise Institute's Mackenzie Eaglen explained, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the Defense Department's "soft shutdown" on spending will delay procurement schedules and increase the risk that major programs will either be rendered "unexecutable" in the near future or further grow in cost to the point that they will need to be reduced or canceled</span>:¶ [G]overnment and industry officials will make certain assumptions in the absence of action by Congress regarding what will ultimately be appropriated. The expected lower amount will drive decision-making as defense officials obligate the dollars they ultimately receive. For instance, many construction projects may be canceled outright when they might have simply been delayed in previous budgetary cycles. Finally, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">operating at reduced funding for a fraction of the fiscal year means</span> personnel and [operations and maintenance] <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">accounts will be short of dollars</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The Pentagon will move money from other urgent priorities to cover the gaps in these “must-pay” shortfalls, shortchanging other priorities like modernization</span>.¶ In addition to putting future contracts at risk, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sequestration also undermines current defense research and investment opportunities</span>. David Fitzpatrick, managing director at AlixPartners, a leading business consulting and analysis firm, described the effect of sequestration as paralyzing: “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A lot of people in the industry and a lot of investment capital outside the industry are circling opportunities right now.” Until sequestration is settled, the industry will remain “sitting on their hands and their wallets</span>.”¶ In preparation for sequestration, Boeing has closed a facility in Kansas in order to protect research and development spending. Lockheed Martin has not only slashed millions of square feet of real estate but also plans to slash millions more. And other companies are delaying important investment and hiring decisions. David Hess, president of Pratt and Whitney, UTC’s engine-making unit, lamented the uncertainty, observing: “No one wants to hire. No one feels there’s enough certainty to make significant capital investments. We’re all kind of waiting on the sidelines to see what happens.”¶ As Stevens, one of sequestration’s most outspoken critics, warned, “When there is increasing uncertainty in the long-term horizon, it constrains the application of research-and-development dollars.” Mick Maurer, president of Sikorsky (another UTC company), concurred: “We are reluctant to make certain commitments and investments not knowing what will happen.… Why would I hire a bunch of employees if there is a chance six months after I bring them in I would have to let them go?”¶ Furthermore, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sequestration’s shadow is already beginning to erode a crucial component of the defense industrial base’s readiness—namely, its specialized supply chain</span>. As Matthew Mulherin, president of Newport News Shipbuilding and corporate vice president of Huntington Ingalls Industries, told the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces in March 2012:¶ We are finding that many in the supply base have decided that it is no longer in their economic best interests to participate in this marketplace.… When suppliers determine that they can no longer rely on future work, or conclude that the regulatory and contractual environment is unavailing of profitable contracts, they must adapt and turn to other opportunities.¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">When elements of the defense industrial base’s supply chain disappear, they will not be easily reconstituted or replaced</span>. In a May 2012 hearing before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the four vice chiefs of the U.S. Armed Forces reiterated concerns about the impact that sequestration’s shadow will have not only on the defense industrial base but also on the military’s future combat capabilities</span>. For example, General Philip Breedlove, vice chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, warned:¶ [O]n the industrial base, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there are some very key capabilities out there that are already very much at risk</span>. And in the aviation business, the number of [corporate] houses that can do stealth have reduced. And another cut to the capability and the effort that we’re putting into those stealth capabilities could cause us severe problems in that industrial base.¶ This mirrors a June 2012 statement by Stevens: “The widespread disruption of across-the-board cuts with significant layoffs means our industry will suffer a loss of learning, a loss of talent and an erosion of quality.”¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The specter of sequestration threatens the U.S. defense industrial base at a time when China, Russia, and other military competitors are ramping up their defense industries</span>. Indeed, the Office of the Secretary of Defense observed in its 2012 annual report to Congress on Chinese military developments that “China’s defense industry has benefited from China’s rapidly expanding civilian economy, particularly its science and technology sector.”¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In turn, military competitors will seek to translate improvements in their defense industrial base into strategic advantages</span>. For example, General David Deptula (ret.), the Air Force’s former deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, described worries about <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the potential erosion of U.S. air superiority</span>:¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has owned a monopoly on stealth for the last 25 years, and now, as both the Russians and Chinese acquire that same capability, you’re going to see that advantage we used to hold disappear very quickly, and that is going to have a very significant effect on our current operational plans</span>.¶ Similarly, Seth Cropsey of Hudson Institute, who served previously as Deputy Undersecretary of the Navy, cautioned lawmakers about the dangers of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">losing U.S. naval superiority</span>:¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">American naval forces need to remain larger than the combined power of its as-yet smaller potential competitors because of their ambition, their prospects for increasing wealth, and the possibility that their asymmetric strategy will diminish our current advantage. The U.S. is also the only seapower with a trans-oceanic, global reach. This allows us to project power, deter war, and communicate with our allies around the world—all at the same time. Surrendering this ability lays open the world’s strategic chokepoints to chaos or the will of states that possess an idea of international order that is wholly different from our own</span>.¶ In sum, while a strong U.S. defense industrial base is a sine qua non to sustaining and modernizing America’s military forces, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the shadow of sequestration is already threatening to undermine the defense industrial base’s readiness and responsiveness</span>.¶ Uncertain Prospects for Reversing Sequestration¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Conventional wisdom holds that lawmakers on Capitol Hill may ultimately modify sequestration during the “lame duck” session of Congress</span> that will occur between the November 2012 election and the beginning of the next presidential term. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Recent news reports suggest that lawmakers are meeting to find alternative reductions to federal spending in an attempt to stave off sequestration’s sudden impact</span>.¶ Moreover, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act of 1989 may create an “X factor” in the calculus of politicians. Under the WARN Act, large-scale employers must give a minimum of 60 days notice to employees whose jobs are being targeted for possible termination. It is therefore significant that a 60-day notice before the start of sequestration would fall on November 2, 2012, four days before the presidential and congressional elections.¶ Nonetheless, several factors may create formidable obstacles to any effort to reverse or delay sequestration.¶ First, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D–NV) has refused to bring to the Senate floor legislation passed by the House of Representatives that would replace the first year of sequestration cuts with alternative reductions to federal spending. Senator Reid has gone so far as to embrace sequestration, stating: “Sequester’s a tough pill to swallow, but it’s a balanced approach to reduce the deficit that shares the pain as well as the responsibility.”¶ So far, neither President Obama nor Senate Democrats have offered any concrete legislation to avert sequestration despite repeated statements from senior defense officials about its disastrous impact. As former Pentagon comptroller Dov Zakheim noted:¶ Despite the urgency of the sequester’s challenge, the administration continues to sit on its hands. No draft legislation has emerged from the White House that would at least postpone the sequester for a reasonable period to enable Congress to try its hand at another effort to reduce the deficit. The administration’s allies on the hill, particularly in the Senate, have been equally nonchalant about the coming programmatic and economic disaster.¶ Second, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is far from certain that a so-called “grand bargain” to stave off sequestration can be worked out among the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the President during the post-election lame-duck session of Congress</span>. Indeed, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the agenda for the lame-duck session is already becoming filled with highly contentious and divisive issues—in particular, expiration of the Bush tax cuts, expiration of the temporary payroll tax relief holiday, expiration of the annual “tax extenders” break, the Medicare “doc fix,” the farm bill reauthorization, the transportation bill reauthorization, the fiscal year 2013 appropriations bills, and the possible need to increase once again the federal debt ceiling—that will reduce what little time there is for sequestration fixes to be considered</span>.¶ Third, the outlines of the debate over the national debt have been well established, and there is little reason to believe that they will change. Both the President and congressional Democrats have repeatedly stated that they will not support any deal to resolve sequestration that does not include tax increases—an option viewed to be unpalatable to congressional Republicans. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Given the events of 2011 that gave rise to sequestration in the first place, it remains to be seen whether conservatives and liberals will be able to bridge their differences during the brief lame-duck session</span>.¶ The outcome of the November 2012 election is anything but certain and once again may yield a deeply divided government. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Nonetheless, lawmakers on both sides of the sequestration debate may decide to gamble for a better post-election bargaining position and postpone major legislation to deal with sequestration</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Yet the consequences of procrastination for America’s military and defense industrial base are real and severe</span>. As The Heritage Foundation’s James Carafano counseled: “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Finding alternatives to cutting essential military capabilities, without raising taxes or further ballooning the federal deficit, is prudent and necessary. It is the kind of next step we ought to demand from Washington</span>.”¶ Conclusion¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As the shadow of sequestration looms already over both the U.S. military and the nation’s defense industrial base, it is time for Congress and the President to act</span>. “The sequester is not meant to be policy,” former director of the Office of Management and Budget Jack Lew insisted last summer. “Rather, it is meant to be an unpalatable option that all parties want to avoid.”¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is clear that if the process of sequestration is fully implemented, the U.S. military will lack adequate resources to defend the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and its global interests</span>. As the American Enterprise Institute’s Gary J. Schmitt and Thomas Donnelly warned:¶ [Under full sequestration,] America’s defense “burden” will drop to just over 2.5 percent of GDP in a decade. This is a remarkable figure—half a percentage point lower than the lowest level reached in the post-World War II era and well below even the post-Cold War average. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">With this level of resources, the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">simply cannot continue to play the role it has over the past 60 years in keeping the great powers at peace and helping provide the global security environment that has seen America prosper.</span>¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The question of how best to reduce America’s federal debt and annual budget deficits will remain a contentious issue. Yet surely both Democrats and Republicans can agree that the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces—and the defense industrial base that provides them the cutting-edge tools they need to keep the country safe—should not be held hostage to politics</span>.

Cuts turn implementation and solvency – durable fiat doesn’t answer this

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Connor 12</span> (Cathy Connor, manager of government affairs, PB Transportation Update, “August 6, 2012 Update,” PB Washington Update, 8-6-2012, http://www.pbtransportationupdate.com/pdfs/wash_update/wu%208612.pdf)

Congress has started its summer recess/district work period and will not return to Washington until the week of September 10, a week later than usual to accommodate the Democratic convention being held in Charlotte, NC September 4, 5 and 6. The Republican convention will be held in Tampa, FL just prior to the Labor Day weekend on August 27, 28, 29 and 30. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">When they return in September, Congress will only be in session for about two weeks before they recess again through the November 6 elections. With significant unfinished work, it is assumed that Congress will return after the elections for a Lame Duck session</span> in late November and into December. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The unfinished issues include many controversial items such as numerous tax extenders, the expiring Bush tax cuts, and the massive government-wide sequester due to go into effect on January 1, 2013 as required by passage last fall of the Budget Control Act, which imposes automatic spending cuts on all domestic discretionary programs as well as all defense programs</span>. The only good news about the sequester is that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">recent analysis shows programs funded by the Highway and Aviation Trust Funds will be exempt from the cuts, however, other transportation programs that are funded from the General Fund, such as transit New Starts</span> and Amtrak, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will face cuts of as much as 7.8% if Congress does not agree to postpone the sequester</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">One issue that Congress will not have to deal with in the Lame Duck is completing all 13 federal agency FY'13 annual funding bills. Last week, the bi-partisan and bi-cameral congressional leadership decided to postpone final action on all the appropriations bills until early next year</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">When they return in September, Congress plans to pass a six-month Continuing Resolution (CR) to provide continued government spending from the October 1 start of the new fiscal year through March 31, 2013, thereby avoiding any fears of a government shutdown before the elections which both parties could be blamed for</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It will</span> be a "clean" CR, meaning it will <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">not include any extraneous provisions</span> or "riders". <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It will provide partial-year FY'13 funding based on the current FY'12 funding levels</span> which were established by the 2011 Budget Control Act, the bill that created last year's "SuperCommittee", rather than the greatly reduced levels proposed by the House Budget Committee.

A year ago, Moody's cut its outlook on U.S. debt to "negative," which acts as a warning that it might downgrade the rating, after partisan wrangling over raising the U.S. debt limit led the nation to the brink of default.



Collapses economy

Despite what you may have heard in the media let me clarify something, the probability of the U.S. defaulting on its debt is very low. The probability of the credit rating getting downgraded grows with every minute. The consequences of a lowering of our credit rating would have disastrous effects. A downgrading of our “AAA” credit rating would mean higher interest rates and subsequently higher costs not only for the U.S. debt but for home loans, credit card rates, student loans and loans to small businesses. The cost of borrowing money would skyrocket for consumers and businesses alike. Likewise, states and municipalities would also face higher borrowing costs. The cost of all capital projects like road repairs, water systems, hospitals and schools would become much more expensive. The ensuing credit crunch would lead to higher borrowing costs for all and we would find ourselves back in March of 2008, only this time we would be 14 trillion dollars deeper in debt. Add to this, with the dollar already in a year-long slump it would continue to sink against the other world’s currencies. S&P has estimated that a downgrade would cause the dollar to drop 10% or more in value. And a downgrade would cause the dollar to lose its status as the world’s reserve currency, an event that would be catastrophic for the U.S. economy. Combine all of the factors above and I think you will conclude as I have that the already shaky economy would implode. A recession would return - but this time with a vengeance. If Congress cannot get a measure passed in 6 short days I see the economy sinking even lower than it did in 2008 – 2009. The worst part of all is that this scenario would cause the global markets to freeze up and make the failure at Lehman Brothers look like a day at the beach.

Here's a map to help understand this precarious place, whether a cliff or a ledge: The term "fiscal cliff" has become shorthand for a group of budget (aka fiscal) policy changes that will be coming together around Jan. 1. That's when the Bush-era tax cuts expire, automatic spending cuts of $109 billion kick in, the alternative minimum tax starts hitting more middle-class families, and other measures also take effect. Congress keeps putting off the decisions that involve everything from the Pentagon budget to the expiring payroll tax holiday to cuts in Medicare payments. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">Economists are unanimous</span> in saying that unless the looming changes are stopped, softened or at least phased in, <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">the U.S. economy could plunge — as if falling off an economic cliff.</span>

Turns hegemony

Gates, former secretary of defense, 9-17-12

(Robert, “Strengthening of America,” Center for Strategic and International Studies, Federal News Service, lexis, ldg)



Then the Budget Control Act, signed later that year, required nearly $490 billion more in defense cuts over a decade. So by around the time I retired as secretary of defense in the summer of 2011, defense spending had already been cut by nearly $900 billion over the next 10 years. And that was before we have to deal with the nearly $600 billion in defense -- in reduced defense spending authority that would result of sequestration takes place. In short, contrary to popular concession -- conception, the defense budget already has been cut, and substantially. <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">What remains in our military modernization accounts are much needed capabilities relating to air superiority and mobilit</span>y<span class="BoldUnderlineChar">, long-range strike, nuclear deterrence</span>, marine -- <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">maritime access, space and cyberwarfare</span>, ground forces, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance -- capabilities that our nation's civilian and military <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">leadership deem absolutely critical to the futu</span>re. And while there's no equivalent of the former Soviet Union looming on the horizon, I do believe the threats America face today and down the road are, in many respects, more dangerous for their <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">complexity, variety, unpredictability and likelihood</span>. Let me be clear, not every defense dollar is sacrosanct. One need only spend 10 minutes walking around the Pentagon or any major military headquarters to see excess and redundancy. That's why I initiated an effort in 2010 to wring $100 billion more in overhead efficiencies out of the department over four years. Yet we should not fool ourselves that significant defense budget savings are possible, the kind that might put a dent in the annual federal deficit, without making substantial and, in the case of sequestration, very destructive cuts to the ability of our military to defend the United States and our vital interests around the world. Consider also the wider fiscal picture. The defense budget may have to be on the table as a matter of political reality, but as a matter of simple math it is not fundamentally the cause of the long- term debt problem. Roughly two-thirds of all federal spending going to entitlements whose share of the budget is escalating rapidly given the changing demographics of the U.S. population. Reducing defense spending by, say, even 15 to 20 percent in the near term would reduce the current annual budget deficit by just one-tenth -- ten percent. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But cuts on that scale would require dramatic reductions in the size, reduction and overall -- size, readiness and overall capabilities of the U.S. military</span>. And we need to be honest with the president, with the Congress, with the American people and with ourselves about what those consequences are -- that a smaller, less ready, less modernized military will be able to go fewer places and be able to do fewer things. And the risks to our men and women in uniform will only increase. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If our elected officials and body politic conclude that they truly want a diminished role for the United States in the world, then we can start paring back missions and ratcheting back the corresponding military investments</span> in force structure. If future defense reductions cannot be avoided, they should be phased in slowly, methodically and strategically, in a way that protects our core security interest and does right by those in uniform. But the history of past defense drawdowns is not encouraging in this regard. We almost never get it right because no matter how many times we say never again to particular kinds of military operations, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">America's adversaries will always have a vote, a</span>s will our future presidents. And if the history of the past century teaches us anything, it is that cutting defense too deeply too quickly, will lead ultimately to higher costs in blood and treasure later. Since I entered government 45 years ago I have shifted my views and changed my mind on a good many things as circumstances, new information or logic dictated. But I have yet to see evidence that would dissuade me from this fundamental belief: that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">America does have a special position and set of responsibilities on this planet</span>. This status provides enormous benefits for allies, partners and others abroad to be sure, but in the final analysis, the greatest beneficiaries of American leadership in the world are the American people in terms of our security, our prosperity and our freedom.

Sequestration is a bigger and faster internal link to every regional war and terrorism

Skelton, former House Armed Services committee chairman, 9-20-12

(Ike, “Sequestration means cuts we can’t afford,” Roll Call, lexis, ldg)



<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Sequestration will also erode America's military superiority over the next decade by cutting even the most essential defense programs</span>. Any military commander will tell you that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">our ability to dominate the battlefield is</span> not only dependent on critical thinking but is <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">fueled by superior aircraft, ships, weapons and intelligence</span>. Sequestration would cripple each of these categories, virtually interfere with professional military education at our war colleges, ending the modernization of fighter jets, combat ships, helicopters, ground vehicles, drone aircraft and satellite technologies. Without a thorough study of the art of war and first-rate equipment, <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">the U.S. military will be far less able to deter gathering conflicts or quickly resolve those conflicts we are unable to avoid.</span> The "Powell Doctrine" of risking our troops only when backed up by overwhelming force and a clear path to decisive victory could be at risk. With our unique portfolio of global responsibilities, <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">we could find it difficult to simultaneously pursue terrorists, contain Iran and North Korea, counter a rising China and deal with exploding hot spots such as Syria</span> today. Those that say we can risk skipping one or two generations of military development are poor students of military history. America rose from a young, regional power to a formidable military force over the course of World War I alone. And Germany rose from the ashes of that war to threaten all of Europe in less than two decades. Today, technology has accelerated the pace of change, <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">and our adversaries are certainly not sitting on their hands.</span> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Russia and China are both building sixth-generation stealth fighters, while Iran and North Korea race to develop nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles. The rise of cyber weapons puts America's highly networked economy and society at particular risk.</span> We can choose to delay our defenses against these developing threats, but the threats themselves won't wait.

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Are there actual existing threats to the survival of the United States? The answer is unquestionably “yes.” Both Russia and China have the nuclear potential to destroy the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates (and our allies) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and are modernizing their forces with the objective of targeting the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates.4 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">China is also increasing the number of its nuclear weapons</span>.5 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Russia is moving away from democracy, and China remains a Communist dictatorship.

Due to arms control, we do not have an in-kind deterrent. Both Iranian and Syria acquisition of nuclear weapons could be affected by sales from North Korea, which have been reported in the press.8 Russian Modernization of Its Nuclear Triad From the start of his political career, Vladimir <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Putin moved Russia toward a greater emphasis on nuclear weapons and a decrease in its nuclear use threshold. Russia explicitly reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in conventional war and is modernizing every element of its nuclear TRIAD</span>.9 Then-Defense Minister (now First Deputy Prime Minister) Sergei Ivanov wrote in January 2006 that, “At the end of last year, we deployed another strategic missile regiment armed with silo-based Topol-M (SS-27) systems; more road mobile Topol-Ms (SS-X-27), currently unmatched by world rivals, this year; and the Project 955 Borei Yury Dolgoruky strategic nuclear-powered submarine armed with the Bulava-30 (SS-NX-30) sealaunched ballistic missiles within several years. And this is just the top of the list” (emphasis added).10 The rest of the list includes the KH-102 nuclear cruise missile, the Sineva SLBM, the RS-24 (a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) SS-27) and recently the beginning of programs to build a newlarge liquid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a new stealth bomber and an air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) carrying Tu334.11 In 2006, Russia announced the construction of eight Borey class ballistic missile submarines carrying the Bulava-30.12 Russia plans to build 100 new silo and mobile Topol (SS-27) ICBMs and at MIRV.13 In May 2006 Yuriy Solomonov, the Director of Russia’s main missile design bureau, stated that, “By 2020 the number of warheads in the Russian missile-nuclear triad will be at least 2,000, and we will build the necessary number of complexes.”14 In July 2007 General Yuri Baluyevskiy, Chief of the General Staff, told the Duma that Russia would maintain “thousands” of nuclear weapons in 2010.15 In October 2007 Putin talked about the “grandiose” nature of Russia’s nuclear programs: “We shall pay attention not only to the entire nuclear triad, I mean the STM [Strategic Missile Troops], strategic aviation and nuclear submarines, but to other types of armaments as well. . . .Not only the Topols with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles, but completely new systems—I would like to stress this. I have spoken about it many times, and the work continues, and it continues successfully.”16 Russian Nuclear Weapons Modernization There is no similarity between the objectives of the post-Cold War U.S. nuclear weapons program (“stockpile stewardship” and a recent decision to develop a small number of replacement designs that trade weight and yield-to-weight ratios for robustness, enhanced safety, and security but with no effort to enhance military capabilities)17 and the Russian program, which is designed to achieve major advances in nuclear weapons performance with the objective of improved warfighting capability. In September 2003, Lev Ryabev, Deputy Atomic Energy Minister, stated that young Russian scientists are “doing real things” with the goal of “keeping and improving of Russia’s nuclear arsenal.”18 In January 2005, Sergei Ivanov declared that, “We will develop, improve and deploy new types of nuclear weapons. We will make them more reliable and accurate”19 (emphasis added). He also revealed that, “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">New types of nuclear weapons are already emerging in Russia</span>”20 (emphasis added). Viktor Mikhaylov, Russian’s Atomic Energy Minister under Yeltsin, publicly supported the modernization of all types of nuclear weapons from “megaton class” to “lowand super-lowyield nuclear weapons and precision weapons with nuclear warheads.”21 Apparently, that is just what the Russians did because after the April 29, 1999 Russian National Security Council meeting, then-Security Council Secretary Vladimir Putin said that the three Presidential decrees signed by Yeltsin “concern the development of the whole nuclear weapons complex and the endorsement of the concept of the development and use of strategic nuclear weapons”22 (emphasis added). A declassified CIA analysis dated May 4, 1999 stated that, “The Security Council Secretary Putin emphasized to journalists that the weapons covered by these decrees include tactical nuclear weapons” and that, “At a minimum the degrees point to a more robust tactical nuclear arsenal, suggesting Moscow is moving away from relying almost solely on strategic weapons for deterrence.”23 Unlike the United States, which would have transferred an existing nuclear weapon to a new ICBM if it had developed one, Nikol Voloshin, a senior official of the Ministry of Atomic Energy, revealed in June 2001 that work was nearing completion on a warhead for the Topol-M (SS-27), while “At the same time modernization is proceeding on the other warheads.”24 The SS-27 warhead is clearly a new design because as Colonel-General NikolayYevgenyevich Solovtsov and Lieutenant GeneralVitaliy Linnik, Head of Armament and Deputy Commander of Strategic Missile Troops both have stated, the SS-27 warhead has an “enhanced-yield charge” or “an increased yield.”25 The reported yield of the SS-27 is 800 kilotons, higher than the yield of Soviet era large-MIRV designs as stated by Russian generals and Duma members.26 The new warhead for the Bulava and the MIRVed version of the SS-27 are almost certainly high-performance ColdWar-type designs. Russian data provided under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) Treaty stated that the throw-weight for the six-warhead Bulava-30 (RSM-56) is much lower per warhead than any previous Soviet Cold War era missile and at least comparable to the best U.S. ColdWar design.27 Ivanov has characterized it as a “new warhead” and it is reported to be much lighter and about twice the yield as the best small Soviet Cold War design.28 To increase the yield of a thermonuclear weapon it is necessary to redesign the secondary. In addition, according to retired Lieutenant General Mikhail Vinogradov, the Russians are also redesigning the primaries: “Basically the mechanical and electronic assemblies of the design and the chemical explosive will undergo modernization.”29 The effect of this is what we would call a new weapon design and the focus is on enhancing military effectiveness. Russian nuclear weapons development has not been limited to increasing yield-toweight ratios. In November 1997, Viktor Mikhaylov, then-Atomic Energy Minister, stated that Russia was working on, “So-called nuclear weapons, which penetrate the ground before exploding. I must say that our developments here are at the highest level. . . .Right now we are standing firm.”30 In December 2002, he stated that, “The scientists are developing a nuclear ‘scalpel’ capable of ‘surgically removing’ and destroying very localized targets. The low-yield warhead will be surrounded with a superhardened casing which makes it possible to penetrate 30–40 meters into rock and destroy a buried target—for example, a troop command and control point or a nuclear munitions storage facility.”31 In August 2003 Mikhaylov revealed that, “Efforts to improve thermonuclear weapons continue even now in several countries, among them the United States and Russia. The range of such weapons that exist is quite broad. There are weapons in the megaton class, and weapons yielding hundreds of tons”32 (emphasis added). A declassified August 2000 CIA Intelligence Memorandum concluded that, “Judging from Russian writing since 1995 and Moscow’s evolving nuclear doctrine, new roles are emerging for very-low yield weapons—including weapons for tailored radiation outputs. . . .”33 (emphasis added). As reported by the Congressional EMP Commission, “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">China and Russia have considered limited nuclear attack options that</span>, unlike Cold War plans, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">employ EMP as the primary</span> or sole <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">means of attack</span>.”34 On April 29, 1999, President Yeltsin reportedly ordered Russian development of precision lowyield nuclear weapons that could be used for strategic or tactical nuclear strikes. On May 6, 1999, the distinguished Russian defense analyst Pavel Felgengauer wrote that Russia was developing “precision low-yield” nuclear weapons for strikes “anywhere in the world” and included weapons with “from several tens of tons to 100 tons of TNT equivalent.”35 He added, “. . . existing strategic nuclear warheads are to be upgraded so that they can deliver strikes with a yield of hundreds tons of TNT, which is thousands of times weaker than their current megaton-range potential.”36 In September 2003, Lev Ryabev revealed that Russia was researching the use of conventional explosives to achieve nuclear fusion for defense purposes.37 A declassified CIA intelligence report dated August 30, 2000 stated that: “. . . Moscow’s military doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons has been evolving and probably has served as the justification for the development of very low yield, high precision nuclear weapons.”38 Col. Gen. V. N. Zaritskiy, Chief of Missile Troops and Artillery of the RF Armed Forces, wrote in May 2007 that, “The basic guidelines for. . . the Concept for the Use of Tactical Nuclear Weapons and the Concept of Effective Engagement, both developed in the late 1990s, as well as new official enforceable legal documents that were issued in 2004.”39 Russia has been engaged in a major propaganda campaign alleging that the United States is developing low-yield nuclear weapons. Yet Russian Deputy Chief of the General Staff General Alexander Rukshin, when announcing Russia’s new supposed super conventional bomb, confirmed that Russia has low yield nuclear weapons: “The new vacuum aviation bomb will allow us to replace a whole series of previously created low-yield nuclear tactical nuclear ordnance with a yield of no more than 5 kilotons, which can be employed on the battlefield”40 (emphasis added). Indeed, it had a “large number” of them.41 A declassified CIA intelligence report dated June 4, 1999 concluded that “The development of low-yield warheads that could be used on high-precision tactical weapons systems—long advocated by former Minister and now First Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy Mikhaylov—would be consistent with Russia’s increasing reliance on nuclear weapons to deter conventional as well as nuclear aggression. . . .”42 Russian Nuclear Testing After the Testing Moratorium Russia may still be conducting yield producing nuclear tests. In January 1999 Lev Ryabev, then-head of the Nuclear Energy Ministry’s Nuclear Munitions Development and Testing Department, said that so-called “subcritical” tests produce very small nuclear yield (i.e., 0.1 gram).43 The Russian press reported that PresidentYeltsin’s April 29, 1999 decree on nuclear weapons approved “hydronuclear field experiments.”44 Hydronuclear tests are designed to produce measurable nuclear yields and are inconsistent with a zero yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) or a zero yield moratorium. It is interesting that then-Russian First Deputy Minister for Nuclear Energy Viktor Mikhaylov wrote on April 29, 1999 about the importance of hydronuclear testing to maintaining the nuclear arsenal. He stated: “No state will be able to create nuclear weapons for the first time based solely on hydronuclear experiments. . . . But developed traditional nuclear powers can use hydronuclear experiments to perform tasks of improving reliability of their nuclear arsenal and effectively steward its operation. All countries indirectly gain here inasmuch as the risk of nuclear accidents is lowered . . . . Determining the limits of ‘authorized activity’ is no simple process and only professionals can direct it correctly.”45 In July 2001, Mikhaylov again stated that, “. . . the developed, traditional nuclear powers, using hydronuclear experiments, can perform the task of improving reliability of the nuclear arsenal and effectively track its operation while reducing the risk of possible accident.”46 These reports have high credibility. Numerous declassified, but unfortunately heavily redacted, Clinton administration CIA intelligence reports discussed possible Russian nuclear testing and whether it was related to the development of new warheads.47 One declassified CIA report concluded that hydronuclear (low-yield) experiments . . . are far more useful for Russian weapons development” than subcritical tests.48 At a minimum these reports indicate that the CIA took this possibility very seriously. Russian Nuclear Threats Against the U.S. and Our Allies With the rise of Putin, the idea of using nuclear weapons in limited war was given a boost. Senior Russian generals have talked about using them in exercises and in limited war.49 In 2007 Russia went beyond this. President Putin unleashed an unprecedented attack on the United Sates and its missile defense plans, which soon featured overt threats of nuclear attack. In February 2007, then-Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov told the Duma that, “As regard to use of nuclear weapons in case of aggression, of course [it will use them in this case]. What else were they built for?”50 He did not mention any of the caveats associated with official Russian nuclear use doctrine. A few days later Colonel-General Nikolay Solovtsov, Commander of the Strategic Missile Forces, made nuclear threats against Poland and the Czech Republic if they allow a small U.S. missile deployment.51 Despite U.S. protests against such inflammatory tactics, General Yury Baluyevskiy in April 2007 once again threatened to target U.S. missile defense facilities in Europe: “If we see that these facilities pose a threat to Russia, these targets will be included in the lists of our planners—strategic, nuclear or others. The latter is a technicality.”52 In August 2007, President Putin sought to intimidate the United States, Japan and NATO Europe by announcing that, “Combat alert has begun today. Twenty strategic missile carriers are taking part in it. The planes that have scrambled will be in the air for 20 hours with refueling and in interaction with the Navy.”53 This same tactic was again applied in October 2007 when Putin declared: “Analogous actions by the Soviet Union, when it deployed missiles in Cuba, prompted the Caribbean crisis.”54 One wonders what he would be doing if the United States did not have a nuclear deterrent. In perhaps the most militant statement in the history of the Russian Federation, General Baluyevskiy in January 2008 stated that “We do not intend to attack anyone. But all our partners must realize that for the protection of Russia and its allies, if necessary, the Armed Forces will be used, including preventively and with the use of nuclear weapons.”55 China’s Strategic Nuclear Buildup Communist China is rapidly building up its military forces in preparation for an attack on Taiwan on the assumption that it will have to fight the United States. China’s objectives go beyond this. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) reportedly suggested to U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) Commander Adm. Timothy Keating that the Pacific be divided into spheres of influence.56 The official Chinese position is that it will suppress Taiwanese independence “at any cost”57 (emphasis added) which is understood to mean nuclear war.58 A 2003 Rand study concluded that, “the Chinese nuclear threat to the United States could evolve into a smaller version of the former Soviet Union.” 59 The November 2006 report of the Congressional U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission noted that “China continues to make significant strides in modernizing and enlarging its missile forces. Currently there are at least 10 types of ballistic missile systems that are either operational or under development.”60 The comparable number for the United States is two, with no new strategic missile under development. There are numerous press reports that China will MIRV its strategic missiles. A May 2007 report on the Hong Kong press stated that “The JL-2 series missile currently has three models; i.e. the JL-2, JL-2I, JL-2II” and that “the submarine can fire 48 warheads—each carrying the bomb equivalent of tens of thousands of tons—at 48 primary targets, which is sufficient to inflict heavy losses in a large country.”61 There are many press reports coming out of Hong Kong of plans to MIRV the new ballistic missiles it is producing (DF-31, DF-31A, and the JL-2) and that as many as 576 nuclear warheads will be deployed on the Chinese missile submarine fleet which is only one leg of the PRC’s nuclear TRIAD.62 A December 2000 Indian press report, attributed to Indian intelligence, reported that Chinese scientists were modifying a ‘bus’ to “carry about eight small nuclear warheads.”63 On six submarines, this adds up to 576 warheads. Chinese Nuclear Weapons Modernization There is no similarity between the post-ColdWar U.S. “stockpile stewardship” program and Chinese nuclear weapons development. China conducted nuclear tests after the 1992 moratorium and is dramatically improving its nuclear weapons.64 Yu Min, described by Xinhua as the “architect of the country’s first H-bomb,” claims that China’s key nuclear capabilities are “on a par with the United States and the former Soviet Union.”65 Xue Bencheng, one of the most important scientists involved in the development of China’s neutron bomb, stated that the July 1996 Chinese nuclear test was “a great spanning leap” because it solved the problem of nuclear weapons miniaturization.66 China’s Central Military Commission Vice Chairman Zhan Wannian told the Commission that there will be “further upgrading, and further development [of Chinese nuclear weapons] from 2001 to 2009.”67 The 2005 Pentagon report on Chinese military power observed that, “Some People’s Liberation Army (PLA) theorists . . . might consider using high-attitude electromagnetic pulses (HEMP) in an unconventional attack, believing that the United States and other nations would not consider it as a use of force and a crossing of the nuclear threshold.”68 China’s nuclear weapons development has clearly benefited from espionage against the U.S. The House Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military Commercial Concerns with the People’s Republic of China, generally known as the Cox Committee, concluded that: “The PRC has stolen classified information on all of the United States’ most advanced thermonuclear warheads, and several of the associated reentry vehicles. . . .The stolen U.S. secrets have helped the PRC fabricate and successfully test modern strategic thermonuclear weapons. . . .The stolen information also includes classified design information for an enhanced radiation weapon (commonly known as the ‘neutron bomb’).”69 Anumber of highly redacted Clinton administration CIA intelligence reports on China’s nuclear weapons testing have been declassified. They provide significant information concerning Chinese development of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons: A nuclear test at Lop Nor in 1990 “may be related to development of a warhead for a Chinese short-range ballistic missile.”70 The National Intelligence Daily (NID) in 1993 stated that accelerated Chinese testing expected by 1996 may also be related to “tactical systems to be developed in the future.”71 In September 1995, the NID reported that, “China could be seeking to confirm the reliability of a nuclear artillery shell designed in advance of a nuclear test ban” in order to defend against Russian invasion or an amphibious landing.72 The device may have been a gun assembled uranium device.73 The Chinese nuclear tests in 1993 were driven “by its need to modernize its nuclear force, built largely using 1960 and 1970 technology.”74 The NID in 1993 stated that China planned seven nuclear tests including “testing for new SLBM and ICBMs warheads, by 1996. . . . ”75 In June 1994, the NID assessed that China was developing new nuclear weapons that “may use more advanced concepts such as aspherical primaries and possibly a type of IHE [Insensitive High Explosive].”76 In 1995 the NID judged that Chinese testing was also aimed at developing “a cruise missile warhead and may involve safety upgrades to existing systems.”77 A Chinese nuclear test planned for 1994 was aimed at “the completion of warhead development for new intercontinental and submarine launched ballistic missiles and the development of technologies to enhance confidence in warheads for an enduring stockpile under a nuclear test ban.”78 China may have continued covert low yield nuclear testing after its announced moratorium in 1996. The Cox report concluded that “nuclear tests related to development of the PRC’s next generation of thermonuclear warheads may be continuing at the PRC test site at Lop Non Nor.”79 In May 2006 Chinese Defense Today also reported possible “low yield nuclear tests” after the declared end of testing.80 Chinese Threats of Nuclear Attack Against the United States There have been recurrent threats from the Chinese military concerning their first use of nuclear weapons in a Taiwan scenario. For example, in July 2005, at an official briefing for journalists organized in part by the Chinese Government, Major General Zhu Chenghu, a Dean at China’s National Defense University, stated that, “If the American[s] draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition on the target zone on China’s territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons. . . .We Chinese will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all cities east of Xiam. Of course the American[s] will have to be prepared that hundreds of cities will be destroyed by the Chinese.”81 The PRC’s “no first use” of nuclear weapons is largely propaganda. In an interview with Chinese Major General Cai Yuqiu, Vice Principal of Nanjing Army Command College, published in Ta Kung Pao, an internet version of a PRC-owned daily newspaper, reported that, “Cai Yuqiu said that he really appreciated the four sentence fight principle by Mao Zedong, i.e., we will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counter-attack. As to whether we will use nuclear weapons first, the above principle can also be followed. If we have been repeatedly ‘attacked,’ then there should not be a limit for our counter-attack.”82 Writing in January 2005 Colonel Wen Shang-hsien of the Taiwanese military noted that after the year 2000 the PRC adopted a nuclear doctrine which allowed for a “a preemptive strike strategy” under which the PRC would use “its tactical nuclear weapons in regional wars if necessary.”83 The Failed Experiment: Arms Control For a century, Western nations have tried unsuccessfully to use arms control as a means of reducing the threat of war. Yet it fails essentially 100% of the time because the nations that create the need for it either don’t sign the relevant treaties or ignore them if they do. The appeal of arms control is that it permits thinking noble thoughts and embracing the illusion of free, effortless security. Yet the conceptual basis of arms control is flawed— it is analogous to the idea of fighting crime by reducing and eventually eliminating the police while signing agreements with the criminals. As President Reagan affirmed in 1982: “Simply collecting agreements will not bring peace. Agreements genuinely reinforce peace only when they are kept. Otherwise, we are building a paper castle that will be blown away by the winds of war.”84 Arms control violations are the norm rather than the exception. As President Reagan stated in a December 1985 report to the Congress, “The Administration’s most recent studies support its conclusion that there is a pattern of Soviet noncompliance. As documented in this and earlier reports, the Soviet Union has violated its legal commitments to the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty-1 Anti-Ballistic Missile (SALTI ABM) Treaty and Interim Agreement, the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, the Geneva Protocol on ChemicalWeapons, and the Helsinki Final Act. In addition, the U.S.S.R. has likely violated provisions of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty.”85 Russian arms control violations did not stop with the demise of the Soviet Union. In addition to numerous violations of the START Treaty verification regime, Russia disregarded its legal obligation under START to eliminate at least 22 launchers for the SS-18 heavyICBMeach year until the final START level of 154 launchers was achieved.86 This is documented in Russia START Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) data, which show a reduction of only 6 launchers from January 1996 to July 1999.87 More recently, Putin’s Russia tested a MIRVed version of their SS-27 ICBM despite the fact that the START Treaty prohibits more than one warhead on this type of missile.88 All Russia did was to change its designator to the “RS-24.”89 This will increase the number of warheads on the Russian ICBM force by a factor of 3 to 6.90 Moreover, Russian 1991–1992 reciprocal Presidential commitments regarding tactical nuclear weapons reductions have not been honored. Russia has maintained a ColdWar-type tactical nuclear arsenal, including the type of weapons it agreed to eliminate completely— battlefield nuclear weapons and refraining from deploying weapons on naval vessels.91 Multilateral arms control has not prevented the proliferation of WMD to hostile states. Indeed, inNovember 2004, the Department of State characterized the situation with regard to the Non-proliferation Treaty as “A Crisis of Compliance.”92 In 2002 then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz revealed that there were 16 nations that had chemical weapons and at least 13 that had biological weapons.93 The state of current arms control violations is outlined in an excellent State Department report entitled “Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments.”94 It is being almost completely ignored by arms control enthusiasts. Despite the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons Convention: 1) North Korea has nuclear weapons (and may be selling them to Iran or Syria95), a large chemical arsenal and biological weapons; 2) Syria has a large chemical arsenal and possibly biological weapons and there are recent indications of nuclear weapons development; and 3) Iran is attempting to obtain nuclear warheads and probably has chemical weapons.96 Admiral Lowell Jacoby, then-Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2005 that irrespective of the outcome of the current Six Party negotiations “we judge that Kim is not likely to surrender all his nuclear weapons capabilities.”97 Inspection regimes are not substitutes for compliance and response to violations. Inspections themselves have serious limitations. Even after the defeat and occupation of Iraq, we can’t definitively determine what happened to a large quantity of Saddam Hussein’s WMD, despite the ability to go anywhere any time and after obtaining millions of documents. What then can we expect from a handful of inspectors with limited inspection rights literally under the guns of dictatorial regimes? Multilateral inspection regimes are even worse because of the politics of these agencies and the presence of agents of the dictatorships in their bureaucracies. In light of what we now know about nuclear EMP effects, how can one possibly assume that hostile states will not hide a small number of these warheads and use them at a time of their choosing? According to the Pentagon’s Quadrennial Defense Review, the United States must maintain a “robust nuclear deterrent, which remains a keystone of U.S. national power.”98 The reason should be self evident—<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">without a nuclear deterrent the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">could be destroyed as an industrial civilization and our conventional forces could be defeated by a state with grossly inferior conventional capability but powerful WMD</span>. We cannot afford to ignore existing and growing threats to the very existence of the United States as a national entity. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Missile defenses and conventional strike capabilities</span>, while critically important elements of deterrence and national power, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">simply can’t substitute for nuclear deterrence. In light of the emerging “strategic partnership” between Russia and China and their emphasis on nuclear weapons it would be foolish indeed to size U.S. strategic nuclear forces as if the only threat we face is that of rogue states and discard the requirement that the U.S. nuclear deterrent be “second to none</span>.” Ignoring the PRC nuclear threat because of Chinese “no first use” propaganda is just as irresponsible. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Absent a nuclear deterrent to their WMD use, rogue states could defeat our forces by the combination of few nuclear EMP weapons and large chemical and biological attacks. The situation would be much worse if they build a more extensive nuclear strike capability</span> as has been reported. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Freezing U.S. nuclear forces</span> at the technical level of the Reagan administration <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will assure that</span>, within two decades, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Russia, China, India, and probably others will be technically superior and U.S. deterrence ability against CBW attack will be reduced. U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nuclear forces must be modernized and tailored to enhance deterrence and damage limitation against the rogue WMD threat</span>. WMD capabilities have given otherwise inconsequential states the ability to kill millions of people. The right combination of missile defense and conventional and nuclear strike capabilities provide the best deterrent and damage limiting capability against the rogue state threat. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">We must not ignore the requirement to provide extended deterrence to our allies. British and French nuclear forces are not large enough, and these nations are not perceived as tough enough, to provide a deterrent for NATO Europe against Russia</span>. In the Far East, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is literally no nuclear deterrent capability against China other than that provided by the U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Failure to provide a credible deterrent will result in a wave of nuclear proliferation with serious national security implications</span>. When dealing with the rogue states, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the issue is not the size of the U.S. nuclear deterrent but the credibility of its use in response to chemical or biological weapons use and its ability to conduct low collateral damage nuclear attacks against WMD capabilities and delivery systems including very hard underground facilities for purposes of damage limitation</span>. We must also have the capability to respond promptly. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nuclear guarantee is a major deterrent to proliferation. If we do not honor that guarantee, or devalue it, many more nations will obtain nuclear weapons</span>. If arms control really becomes a substitute for nuclear deterrence and defense, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it may very well precipitate the most destructive war in history</span>. Effective verification is essentially impossible, and verification is not a substitute for compliance. Today, arms control has become part of the problem rather than a solution to the problem. The abolition of the in-kind deterrent to CBW use—which deterred CBW use in World War II—is making the world more unsafe almost on a daily basis. The START and Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaties prevent or inhibit the development of conventional strike capabilities with enhanced ability to counter WMD. The demise of the ABM Treaty, while very useful, does not completely address the problem of legacy arms control and its constraints upon U.S. conventional capabilities.



Entanglement and intervention in future conflicts is inevitable – the effectiveness of nuclear force posture determines escalation control for all scenarios for conflict

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Lieber & Press 9</span> (Keir A. Lieber, Associate Professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University’s Edmund A.Walsh School of Foreign Service; Daryl G. Press, Associate Professor of Government at Dartmouth College and Coordinator of the War and Peace Studies Program at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, "The Nukes We Need: Preserving the American Deterrent," Foreign Affairs, Nov/Dec 2009, [[http://www.afa.org/Edop/PDFs/Nukes_We_Need_Lieber&Press.pdf]])

The success of nuclear deterrence may turn out to be its own undoing. Nuclear weapons helped keep the peace in Europe throughout the Cold War, preventing the bitter dispute from engulfing the continent in another catastrophic conflict. But after nearly 65 years without a major war or a nuclear attack, many prominent statesmen, scholars, and analysts have begun to take deterrence for granted. They are now calling for a major drawdown of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and a new commitment to pursue a world without these weapons. Unfortunately, deterrence in the twenty-first century may be far more difficult for the United States than it was in the past, and having the right mix of nuclear capabilities to deal with the new challenges will be crucial. The United States leads a global network of alliances, a position that commits Washington to protecting countries all over the world. Many of its potential adversaries have acquired, or appear to be seeking, nuclear weapons. Unless the world’s major disputes are resolved—for example, on the Korean Peninsula, across the Taiwan Strait, and around the Persian Gulf—or the U.S. military pulls back from these regions, the United States will sooner or later find itself embroiled in conventional wars with nuclear-armed adversaries. Preventing escalation in those circumstances will be far more difficult than peacetime deterrence during the Cold War. In a conventional war, U.S. adversaries would have powerful incentives to brandish or use nuclear weapons because their lives, their families, and the survival of their regimes would be at stake. Therefore, as the United States considers the future of its nuclear arsenal, it should judge its force not against the relatively easy mission of peacetime deterrence but against the demanding mission of deterring escalation during a conventional conflict, when U.S. enemies are fighting for their lives. Debating the future of the U.S. nuclear arsenal is critical now because the Obama administration has pledged to pursue steep cuts in the force and has launched a major review of U.S. nuclear policy. (The results will be reported to Congress in February 2010.) The administration’s desire to shrink the U.S. arsenal is understandable. Although the force is only one-fourth the size it was when the Cold War ended, it still includes roughly 2,200 operational strategic warheads—more than enough to retaliate against any conceivable nuclear attack. Furthermore, as we previously argued in these pages (“The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy,” March/April 2006), the current U.S. arsenal is vastly more capable than its Cold War predecessor, particularly in the area of “counterforce”—the ability to destroy an adversary’s nuclear weapons before they can be used. Simply counting U.S. warheads or measuring Washington’s counterforce capabilities will not, however, reveal what type of arsenal is needed for deterrence in the twenty-first century. The only way to determine that is to work through the grim logic of deterrence: to consider what actions will need to be deterred, what threats will need to be issued, and what capabilities will be needed to back up those threats. The Obama administration is right that the United States can safely cut its nuclear arsenal, but it must pay careful attention to the capabilities it retains. During a war, if a desperate adversary were to use its nuclear force to try to coerce the United States—for example, by threatening a U.S. ally or even by launching nuclear strikes against U.S. overseas bases—an arsenal comprised solely of high-yield weapons would leave U.S. leaders with terrible retaliatory options. Destroying Pyongyang or Tehran in response to a limited strike would be vastly disproportionate, and doing so might trigger further nuclear attacks in return. A deterrent posture based on such a dubious threat would lack credibility. Instead, a credible deterrent should give U.S. leaders a range of retaliatory options, including the ability to respond to nuclear attacks with either conventional or nuclear strikes, to retaliate with strikes against an enemy’s nuclear forces rather than its cities, and to minimize casualties. The foundation for this flexible deterrent exists. The current U.S. arsenal includes a mix of accurate high- and low-yield warheads, offering a wide range of retaliatory options—including the ability to launch precise, very low-casualty nuclear counterforce strikes. The United States must preserve that mix of capabilities—especially the low-yield weapons—as it cuts the size of its nuclear force. deterrence in dark times The primary purpose of U.S. nuclear forces is to deter nuclear attacks on the United States and its allies. During peacetime, this is not a demanding mission. The chance that leaders in Beijing, Moscow, or even Pyongyang will launch a surprise nuclear attack tomorrow is vanishingly small. But peacetime deterrence is not the proper yardstick for measuring the adequacy of U.S. nuclear forces. Rather, the United States’ arsenal should be designed to provide robust deterrence in the most difficult of plausible circumstances: during a conventional war against a nuclear-armed adversary. In the coming decades, the United States may find itself facing nuclear-armed states on the battlefield. U.S. alliances span the globe, and the United States is frequently drawn into regional conflicts. Washington has launched six major military operations since the fall of the Berlin Wall: in Panama, Somalia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and twice in Iraq. Furthermore, most of the United States’ potential adversaries have developed—or seem to be developing—nuclear weapons. Aside from terrorism, the threats that dominate U.S. military planning come from China, North Korea, and Iran: two members of the nuclear club, and one intent on joining it. The central problem for U.S. deterrence in the future is that even rational adversaries will have powerful incentives to introduce nuclear weapons—that is, threaten to use them, put them on alert, test them, or even use them—during a conventional war against the United States. If U.S. military forces begin to prevail on the battlefield, U.S. adversaries may use nuclear threats to compel a cease-fire or deny the United States access to allied military bases. Such threats might succeed in pressuring the United States to settle the conflict short of a decisive victory. Such escalatory strategies are rational. Losing a conventional war to the United States would be a disastrous outcome for any leader, and it would be worth taking great risks to force a cease-fire and avert total defeat. The fate of recent U.S. adversaries is revealing. The ex-dictator of Panama, Manuel Noriega, remains in a Miami prison. The former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, awaits trial in The Hague, where Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic died in detention three years ago.Saddam Hussein’s punishment for losing the 2003 war was total: his government was toppled, his sons were killed, and he was hanged on a dimly lit gallows, surrounded by enemies. Even those leaders who have eluded the United States—such as the Somali warlord Muhammad Farah Aidid and Osama bin Laden—have done so despite intense U.S. efforts to capture or kill them. The United States’ overseas conflicts are limited wars only from the U.S. perspective; to adversaries, they are existential. It should not be surprising if they use every weapon at their disposal to stave off total defeat. Coercive nuclear escalation may sound like a far-fetched strategy, but it was nato’s policy during much of the Cold War. The Western allies felt that they were hopelessly outgunned in Europe at the conventional level by the Warsaw Pact. Even though nato harbored little hope of prevailing in a nuclear war, it planned to initiate a series of escalating nuclear operations at the outbreak of war—alerts, tactical nuclear strikes, and wider nuclear attacks—to force the Soviets to accept a cease-fire. The United States’ future adversaries face the same basic problem today: vast conventional military inferiority. They may adopt the same solution. Leaders in Beijing may choose gradual, coercive escalation if they face imminent military defeat in the Taiwan Strait—a loss that could weaken the Chinese Communist Party’s grip on power. And if U.S. military forces were advancing toward Pyongyang, there is no reason to expect that North Korean leaders would keep their nuclear weapons on the sidelines. Layered on top of these challenges are two additional ones. First, U.S. conventional military doctrine is inherently escalatory. The new American way of war involves launching simultaneous air and ground attacks throughout the theater to blind, confuse, and overwhelm the enemy. Even if the United States decided to leave the adversary’s leaders in power (stopping short of regime change so as to prevent the confrontation from escalating), how would Washington credibly convey the assurance that it was not seeking regime change once its adversary was blinded by attacks on its radar and communication systems and command bunkers? A central strategic puzzle of modern war is that the tactics best suited to dominating the conventional battlefield are the same ones most likely to trigger nuclear escalation. Furthermore, managing complex military operations to prevent escalation is always difficult. In 1991, in the lead-up to the Persian Gulf War, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker assured Iraq’s foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, that the United States would leave Saddam’s regime in power as long as Iraq did not use its chemical or biological weapons. But despite Baker’s assurance, the U.S. military unleashed a major bombing campaign targeting Iraq’s leaders, which on at least one occasion nearly killed Saddam. The political intent to control escalation was not reflected in the military operations, which nearly achieved a regime change. In future confrontations with nuclear-armed adversaries, the United States will undoubtedly want to prevent nuclear escalation. But the leaders of U.S. adversaries will face life-and-death incentives to use their nuclear arsenals to force a cease-fire and remain in power. the case for counterforce If the United States hopes to deter nuclear attacks during conventional wars, it must figure out how it might respond to such attacks, and it must retain the nuclear forces to do so. The most horrific retaliatory threat that the United States might issue—to destroy cities if enemy leaders brandish or use nuclear weapons—is a poor foundation for deterrence. First, this threat lacks credibility. Destroying cities would be a vastly disproportionate response if an enemy used nuclear weapons against a purely military target, such as a U.S. carrier group at sea or even a U.S. base located away from a major city (such as the U.S. airfields on Guam or Okinawa).During recent wars, the United States has labored to minimize enemy civilian casualties. It is hard to believe that Washington would reverse course and intentionally slaughter hundreds of thousands of civilians, especially if no U.S. or allied city has been destroyed. Moreover, a retaliatory strike on an enemy city would not even achieve critical military objectives, so the horrendous consequences would be inflicted for little purpose. If an enemy used nuclear weapons, the most pressing U.S. objective would be to prevent further nuclear attacks. Destroying one of the enemy’s cities—even its capital—would neither eliminate its nuclear forces nor even necessarily kill its leaders. Nor could the United States respond to an enemy’s limited nuclear strike simply by marching to its capital city to capture and hang its leaders; that would leave time for more strikes on allies’ cities. In such a crisis, the United States would need to stop the enemy’s nuclear attacks immediately. Of course, no one knows how a U.S. president would respond in such dark circumstances. It is possible that the United States would retaliate by attacking enemy cities—fear or anger might prevail over reason. But that mere possibility is a perilous foundation for deterrence. A credible deterrent must give U.S. leaders acceptable options in the event an enemy were to use nuclear weapons. An arsenal that can only destroy cities fails that test. The least bad option in the face of explicit nuclear threats or after a limited nuclear strike may be a counterforce attack to prevent further nuclear use. A counterforce strike could be conducted with either conventional or nuclear weapons, or a mix of the two. The attack could be limited to the enemy’s nuclear delivery systems—for example, its bombers and missile silos—or a wider range of sites related to its nuclear program. Ideally, a U.S. counterforce strike would completely destroy the enemy’s nuclear forces. But if an adversary had already launched a nuclear attack against the United States or its allies, a response that greatly reduced the adversary’s nuclear force could save countless lives, and it could open the door to decisive military actions (such as conquest and regime change) to punish the enemy’s leadership for using nuclear weapons.

No other legislative issues to distract now—that allows Obama to lay the groundwork for fiscal cliff negotiations

Sherman, Politico, 9-19-12

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A jolt of reality is rippling through the Capitol as discussions over how to solve the</span> so-called<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> fiscal cliff are suddenly swinging into action</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Leaders on both sides</span> of the dome, in both parties, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are meeting with key Obama</span> administration <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">officials</span> on Capitol Hill, quietly <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">mulling</span> different legislative <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">strategies to avoid</span> massive <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">tax hikes</span> on all Americans. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">At the same time, lawmakers are beginning to carve out positions for</span> their parties for what will become <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a months-long</span> rhetorical and legislative <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">war</span> leading up to a series of year-end deadlines. In one day, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner met with both House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.). The meeting with Camp was directly focused on the year-end expiration of tax rates — widely known in Washington as the “fiscal cliff.” Boehner’s office said he and Geithner spoke about the European debt crisis, but it declined to answer whether tax rates were dicussed. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf spoke with the Senate Finance Committee in a closed, off-the-record meeting. Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who chairs the Finance Committee, will hold separate calls with Geithner and Camp each week while Congress is in recess. Meanwhile, House Republican leadership — which is all but certain to control the lower chamber next Congress — has begun privately mulling different electoral outcomes and legislative scenarios they would present, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions. The Ways and Means Committee will meet Thursday in a rare bipartisan, closed session to discuss unfinished business. In reality, nothing substantive can be done until Nov. 7, after the country selects a president and decides on the composition of Congress. But the sessions are akin to a crash course — a way for lawmakers to get armed with details before the battle. “Frankly, if I wasn’t meeting with the secretary, I think there’d be an issue,” Camp said Wednesday morning. “It’s important we try to do our work, and that’s what I’m trying to do.” The range of scenarios vary widely, and that — in part — explains the flurry of activity. There are several scenarios that Congress could face come mid-November. Mitt Romney has said he wants to extend tax rates for everyone, and President Barack Obama said he would allow rates for married couples making more than $250,000 to snap back to 39.6 percent — where they stood for much of the 1990s. If the polls stay where they are today, and Republicans keep the House, Democrats hold the Senate and Obama wins the presidency, top aides in both parties insist that tax rates on the wealthy will go up. But those aides, who are involved in planning for the year-end battles, say the legislative gridlock could give both sides the incentive to strike a grand deficit and tax compromise. On K Street, rumors are flying about what Congress will do during the lame-duck session after the election. Republicans in the House could use this month or meetings in coming weeks to unveil which business tax breaks — called “extenders” — they plan to fight for in the Tax Code, lobbyists say. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was preparing to ask Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to create a formal conference committee to negotiate tax rates. Some sides are beginning to show their hand, representing the opening gambit in the lame-duck battle. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden said Democrats are curious how low rates could be pushed if all tax breaks were eliminated from the code. “The interest is mostly in discussing models,” Wyden said in an interview with POLITICO. Some senators say they’d like to eliminate all tax breaks in favor of keeping rates as low as possible Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) said lawmakers discussed fundamental tax reform. There’s a recognition, he said, that rewriting the Tax Code would take time — a six-month timeframe was discussed, he said. “There needs to be a down payment to show credibility,” Conrad said, adding that there needs to be some sort of action before tax reform to show Congress is serious about rewriting the code. Bernanke told lawmakers that the fed’s ability to support the economy is limited, and urged action of the nation’s dire fiscal situation, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) told reporters. Bernanke also discussed the European debt crisis and his controversial decision this month to further ease monetary policy, lawmakers said. Some members of the Finance Committee offered general ideas and scenarios but no official plans for avoiding the fiscal cliff were discussed, Baucus said. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It’s not rare for top administration officials to storm Capitol Hill</span> — <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">but closed-door sessions, and the frequency with which they’ve suddenly begun to happen, months before a legislative issue comes to head is unique</span>.

He’ll focus his capital on the budget deal—that leads to success

Potter, Australian Financial Review, 9-10-12

(Ben, “Agenda revealed on convention sidelines”, lexis, ldg)



<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A re-elected Obama</span>, jealous of his "legacy", <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would have</span> three months - or <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">100 days -of</span> maximum <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">political capital</span>, they said. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Look for him to plunge in.</span> Gene Spurling, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, laid out a three-point economic agenda at a National Journal/Atlantic event. First, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">securing the certainty of a long-term budget deal</span> to bring down deficits and debt as a share of the economy. Second, preserving enough fiscal space to foster growth and jobs creation in the short term. Third, making long-term "investments" in skills and infrastructure to boost competitiveness. Obama added new goals in his convention speech: double manufacturing exports to generate 1 million new jobs, exploit cheap shale gas to create work for another 600,000 people, and hire 100,000 new maths and science teachers. Like his Republican rival Mitt Romney, he didn't explain how we would reach his goals. Disappointing too was the lack of fresh ideas, or an "X" factor to stimulate the faltering economy without deepening the nation's debt trap. Shale gas was the exception. Shale, an agent of industrial revival, harbours vast reserves of oil too. Obama will also approve the contentious Keystone pipeline, delivering tar sands oil from Canada. The Obama administration dragged the chain on energy, focusing on renewables. Now it's playing catch-up. Spurling said he hoped the risk of the "fiscal cliff" pitching the economy into recession and slashing defence spending would bring Congressional Republicans back from their "extreme" stance that all deficit cuts must be spending cuts. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This could make a "framework" budget deal</span> that leaves the details to be filled in later <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">achievable in the lame duck, post-election Congress</span>, he said. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Republicans will feel little love for the President</span> after the bashing they got at the convention. So this could depend heavily on the margin of victory. New Hampshire senator Jeanne Shaheen said an extension into 2013 was more likely, to buy time. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Yet the feeling among Democrats that a deal could come easier after the election mirrored that of some Republicans at their convention</span> in Tampa, Florida a week earlier. Obama won't cut spending as deeply as Romney's running mate Paul Ryan would like to, in his budget plan. This would slash spending on items like early childhood learning for disadvantaged kids, and Medicaid funding for families with children suffering from severe autism or Down's Syndrome. These are deal breakers, as is any plan that's all spending cuts and no new revenues. Still, a <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">re-elected Obama would sit down with House speaker John Boehner and negotiate another budget deal</span>, Spurling said. Obama's plan would include his American Jobs Act, a $US447 billion bill to re-employ teachers, emergency and construction workers, to boost growth and preserve skills. That's been hanging around Congress for a year. It would produce a fifth year of US trillion dollar deficits, and Republicans are unlikely to support it in full. Tax reform can create enduring growth and bring in more revenue. Boehner nearly agreed to a revenue raising "grand bargain" last year. Its failure still rankles both sides. The imperatives grow stronger. The President realises it's critical to end the uncertainty that keeps firms with trillions of US dollars to invest on the sidelines, Shaheen said. And any serious person knows revenues, entitlements and defence must be on the table, she added. There's a gulf between Obama's manufacturing focused corporate tax reform plan (he has no personal tax plan), and Republican plans that don't explain how large rate cuts will be paid for. That all has to be filled in, in a way that serves efficiency - to boost growth - as well as fairness, Obama's bottom line. Entitlements, the biggest drivers of future debts, must also be part of the deal. Obama said he won't accept Romney and Ryan's "premium support" (voucher) model, even though it was first suggested by Alice Rivlin, President Clinton's budget director. Spurling said he hasn't seen a model that works. The costs of US healthcare must be reined in, and Obama's healthcare reform only moves the needle a bit, conceded Neera Tanden, who worked on the reforms for the administration. Healthcare "bundling" initiatives - paying for "wellness" not "illness" - are yielding dividends, Tanden said. If so, they should be expanded. Obama said he would fix Medicare by cutting its cost, not by asking seniors to pay more. Romney says he'd ask rich seniors to pay more, a logical step. Obama would have to bring more to the table to get a deal. The same goes for social security. Raising the entitlement age and means testing benefits seem inevitable. Obama prefers to pretend these can be preserved during the campaign. Maybe he'll be clearer later. Immigration reform, a pathway to legal residency for millions of undocumented immigrants, seems a long way off after the harsh rhetoric of the Republicans in the primaries. Yet there is surprising optimism here. There's broad understanding from industries ranging from high tech to farming that their business model depends on undocumented workers, said Melody Barnes, Obama's former domestic policy director. Republicans who supported former president George W Bush's failed bid for reform got cold feet as their party shifted rightward. Barnes and Shaheen think they can be lured out of hiding, especially if Hispanic and other minority voters heavily favour Obama again this year, and future leaders like Jebb Bush and Marco Rubio keep up the pressure for change. Visas for postgraduates would be a good place to start. Romney has toned down his rhetoric here, a hopeful sign. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There's a long way to go before</span> any of these <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">deals can be pencilled in.</span> Still, any one of them would be a shot in the arm for America. And <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a good budget deal would be a game changer</span>.



Obama’s PC forces compromise

Dennis, Roll Call, 9-24-12

(Steven, “Voters Will Likely Resolve Fiscal Cliff”, [[http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_24/Voters-Will-Likely-Resolve-Fiscal-Cliff-217774-1.html?pos=opolh]], DOA: 9-27-12, ldg)



While leaders still bluster publicly about holding the line during the lame-duck session even if they lose, they are increasingly eyeing the elections as the clarifying event to break the logjam over taxes and spending that has blocked a bipartisan debt deal for the past two years. Democrats for months have been ratcheting up their resolve on the fiscal cliff and believe that Republicans will finally bend if President Barack Obama is elected. And they pointed to a quote from conservative Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) to that effect that appeared in a Bloomberg story last week. "We might as well cut a deal," DeMint said of what would happen if Obama wins. "If Republicans want to maintain the defense, we're going to have to give tax increases to Obama." "When Jim DeMint is suddenly open to revenues, you know the tide is turning," a grinning Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday. Of course, DeMint's office quickly walked back the quote. "Senator DeMint strongly opposes tax hikes that destroy jobs. He was simply pointing out that President Obama won't agree to anything that doesn't include tax increases, which is one of the biggest reasons he should be defeated this November," spokesman Wesley Denton said. "And that's also why Senator DeMint opposes a lame-duck session. We shouldn't have politicians cut deals for higher taxes after they're kicked out of office. We need a new president and a new Congress address these issues next year." But DeMint isn't alone in acknowledging the reality that Obama will be able to force through a tax increase. Other Republicans, particularly in the Senate, have been meeting for months with Democratic counterparts in hopes of breaking the stalemate, although everyone has acknowledged that a deal simply isn't going to happen until voters speak. Schumer noted last week that on Wednesday alone he attended four meetings on the fiscal cliff, some of which were bipartisan. He said the discussions would continue while Congress is on recess for the next month and a half. Other Senators on the Finance Committee also held regular meetings to discuss the options, and the administration has opened talks with top Republicans, including a meeting last week between Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.). Senators including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) have openly expressed a willingness to consider new revenue as part of a year-end deal to block defense cuts and secure entitlement reforms. And then there's the simple math - the vast majority of the cliff comes from tax cuts and defense spending that are bigger Republican priorities than Democratic ones. It's a trigger Democrats, such as Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Patty Murray (Wash.), have made clear they are ready and willing to pull. But the House has largely remained implacable in public so far. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters Friday that he still would not support any tax hikes if Obama wins. "No. ... Our goal is to have tax reform and entitlement reform, and we all know that these are going to probably have to travel on parallel paths. But it's important for our country to fix our debt problem and have a tax code that's competitive in a worldwide economy," he said.¶ However, he also expressed a desire to avoid the "ugly" sequester. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), a deputy whip and senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, vowed that Republicans would not raise taxes. The current rates are set to expire if nothing is done, leaving the GOP seemingly little leverage in the fight. But Brady said the impact of the cliff on the economy would be the leverage against Democrats. "I think the economy is the major leverage. It's still going to be struggling in a major way," Brady said. Brady conceded the political winds would be against the GOP, saying "It's true that it will be perceived as a referendum on higher taxes. But I think if the public retains Republicans in the House, it's also a clear sign they don't want to see taxes go up. Because we're running on that same issue back home as well." He envisioned the two parties striking a deal to bring in increased revenue without raising rates. "I think perhaps a common ground is that if the president wants to talk about new revenues from increased growth, energy development, or better tax code, there's common ground there," he said. Still, there is some acknowledgement of the likelihood that the GOP will have to cave to Obama on the House side. Budget Committee member Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told the Washington Post last week that "if the president wins re-election, taxes are going up," adding, "There's not a lot we can do about that."



Vote counts but Obama leverage key

The Hill 9-21-12

(“GOP fears reelected Obama would have the upper hand on taxes”, [[http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/domestic-taxes/251095-gop-fears-reelected-obama-would-have-leverage-to-raise-taxes]], DOA: 9-27-12, ldg)



But Republicans are also eager to avoid the automatic spending cuts set to start in January that would slash heavily from defense and national security. GOP defense hawks like Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) have sounded more open to using revenue increases to avoid those cuts. If more Republicans take that position, it could give Democrats the upper-hand in the lame-duck negotiations. “In my view, their position becomes less and less defensible every day that goes on,” said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “Because come January, unless they agree to provide tax relief to 98 percent of Americans, those taxes are going to go up.” House GOP leaders would only need a small minority of their conference to pass any measure extending tax cuts up to $250,000 of family income, given that Democrats support that proposal. And while members of the GOP rank-and-file on Friday said they remain steadfast against tax increases, some said the votes would likely be there if leadership needed them. “I would not,” Rep. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said when asked if the votes could be found to pass a high-end tax increase. “Enough [votes], probably.” Top Republican officials say it is difficult to predict exactly what the political environment would look like in the immediate aftermath of an Obama victory. The newly reelected president could, for example, use his moment of maximum leverage to demand that Congress extend tax rates for the middle class, creating enormous pressure for Republicans coming off a loss at the polls.



Deal now but that could change

Fiscal Times 9-23-12

(“Republicans Brace for Four More Years of Obama”, [[http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2012/09/23/Republicans-Brace-for-Four-More-Years-of-Obama.aspx#BYku8GHeEvvd77kS.99|http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2012/09/23/Republicans-Brace-for-Four-More-Years-of-Obama.aspx#BYku8GHeEvvd77kS.99]])



Most telling of all is that House and Senate Republicans have begun openly speculating on how Congress and the White House would address the looming fiscal cliff if Obama wins a second term. Even while they were packing their bags and preparing to head home to campaign through the Nov. 6 election, some GOP lawmakers were privately conferring with administration officials and spinning out possible scenarios for action in the event of a Romney loss. Unless lawmakers and the administration can work out their differences over the budget, entitlements and taxes before the end of the year, the economy will be jarred next January by $665 billion worth of expiring tax cuts, vanishing unemployment benefits and automatic across-the-board cuts in defense and domestic spending that many fear would shove the country back into a recession. However, taxes are a major issue in the campaign between Obama and Romney, with the president insisting that wealthy Americans must pay more in taxes next year while the former Massachusetts governor is calling for an additional 20 percent across the board tax cut for all Americans. For the first time, Capitol Hill Republican veterans are saying that the winner of the presidential race will be able to claim a mandate for his policies. “This is a referendum on taxes,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior member of the House Budget Committee, told the Washington Post late last week. “If the president wins reelection, taxes are going up” for the nation’s wealthiest households, and “there’s not a lot we can do about that.” “I hope, obviously, the status quo doesn’t prevail” on Nov. 6,” Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told the Post. “But if things stay as they are, and all the players are generally the same ...finding a responsible reform for Medicare is the secret to unleashing very productive talks that would put in place a balanced solution to our fiscal problems. If you deal with the Medicare issue, then Republicans are far more open to looking at revenues.”¶ The implications of this sudden change in tone by at least some Republicans on Capitol Hill is obvious: Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke and a raft of other policy makers and politicians have been warning for months – to little avail -- that the country was headed for a fiscal cliff that would put an enormous drag on the economy and potentially throw millions more of Americans out of work. Now, the two parties are beginning to talk about finding ways to buy time after the election to work out a grand bargain of sorts that will avert a wholesale increase in taxes and block deep automatic cuts in defense. And they are acknowledging that increased tax revenues will be on the table for discussion. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner met with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., according to Politico. The meeting with Camp focused on the year-end expiration of tax rates.

With all attention now focused on the campaign for control of Congress and the Presidency, it might be easy to forget that the 112th <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Congress is still in session and returns to work in September</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">When Congress does return, a number of important decisions</span> affecting health care and energy policy, among other areas, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">remain to be considered. Added to this list of issues is the threat that the economy could fall back into a recession, or</span> as some put it – <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">fall off a "Fiscal Cliff"</span> – <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">should Congress fail to stop the tax hikes and spending cuts currently set to take effect</span> January 2, 2013. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">All of this promises </span>//a busy agenda//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> for the next few months, likely stretching into a Lame Duck Session of Congress after the November elections</span>.¶ Sequestration and Tax Increases: A recipe for recession?¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The biggest question is whether Congress will allow</span> the automatic spending cut process it set in motion under the Budget Control Act (Public Law 112-35, “Act”), known as "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sequestration," to proceed</span>. This is just the latest in a series of recent steps under the Act to reduce the federal debt. The first step involved a spending cut of $900 million that only came after the threat of government shutdowns that resulted in the government's credit rating falling for the first time. The second step involved the so-called congressional "Super Committee," which was unable to find $1.2 trillion in additional spending cuts. Now those $1.2 trillion in spending cuts will begin to take effect automatically over the next 10 years, with the first installment of $109 billion taking effect January 2, 2013. It will be distributed equally between most defense and non-defense programs, with only a few spared the budget ax (including Social Security and Medicaid). Cuts to Medicare are limited to 2 percent a year. More specifics are expected soon as Congress has passed – and the President signed – the Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012, which requires the Obama Administration to report to Congress as to how it will administer the cuts (Public Law 112-155).¶ Next in importance is whether Congress will allow a series of tax cuts to expire at the end of the year, as currently scheduled. The expiring tax cuts include the reduction in income, capital gains, estate and gift taxes found in the “Bush Tax Cuts.” Other tax cuts set to expire include the recently enacted 2 percent Social Security payroll tax cut.¶ In addition, other fiscal measures will need to be decided before the end of the year, including whether to extend unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed and whether to adjust Medicare’s rates so that physician payments are not cut (the so-called “doc fix”).¶ If Congress does nothing and allows all spending and tax measures to expire, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office forecasts the United States economy will fall back into a recession as a result, “with real [Gross Domestic Product] declining by 0.5 percent between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2013 and the unemployment rate rising to about 9 percent in the second half of calendar year 2013” (www.cbo.gov).¶ Would there be a 'Grand Compromise' and what could it include?¶ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Already, posturing by both parties has begun, to avoid any jumping off that Fiscal Cliff</span>. The posturing includes legislation passed in the House of Representatives that would shift cuts in defense spending to domestic programs (H.R. 5652, the Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act of 2012). Posturing actions also include legislation passed in the Senate that would limit income tax cut reductions to households making $250,000 or less (S. 3412, the Middle Class Tax Cut Act).¶ Neither of these bills passed their respective chamber with bipartisan support. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the </span>//pressure to compromise will build//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> as Congress gets closer to the edge of the Fiscal Cliff. We expect to see movement on the need to compromise likely, building </span>//to a resolution// either //during a Lame Duck session of Congress// or when a new Congress convenes in January. Other spending measures likely to be caught up in this include:¶ The budget for Fiscal Year 2013 (“FY 13”). Progress on the 12 spending bills needed to fund the federal government for the next fiscal year has slowed to a stop. This outcome is due entirely to the broader sequestration debate. As a result, Senate Majority Leader Reid (D-NV) announced on July 31 a deal with Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH-8) on a six-month continuing resolution (“CR”) that will fund the government through May 31, 2013 ([[http://www.dpcc.senate.gov/|www.dpcc.senate.gov]]).

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The stopgap spending agreement reached by House and Senate leaders may be the only way Congress will escape a post-election “lame duck” showdown over funding government agencies.

But no one should rationalize it as inevitable and necessary to overcome political gridlock or a “broken” budget process. It is a choice—and a concession to the intransigence of the Senate leadership. While perhaps expedient in the near term, it will have longer-range drawbacks that threaten Congress’s ability to manage the immense fiscal challenges looming ahead. Lawmakers should weigh these matters carefully when they take up the measure in September.

Members of the Congress may not want a bruising government shutdown fight just weeks before November's elections but there are some early signs, worrying to senior Republicans, that they might get one anyway. It would be instigated by fiscally conservative Republicans who may not go along quietly in mid- to late-September with a short-term spending extension necessary to keep the government running when the fiscal year ends at the end of that month. These House conservatives don't want to give up hard-fought budget cuts already baked into House-passed spending bills - or worse - punt spending decisions into a post-election lame-duck session. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The September vote on a spending extension, through a </span>//c//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ontinuing </span>//r//<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">esolution, will be the last piece of must-pass legislation before the November 6 elections</span>. With the current round of partisan show-votes on extending tax cuts expected to be blocked by the opposing party, some lawmakers could see it as the final chance to make a point about spending and taxes. "Since it's obvious that Republican leadership will do whatever it takes to pass a continuing resolution, conservatives are going to do what we can to limit the damage," said an aide to a conservative House Republican. How far they will push things as the September 30 fiscal year-end approaches is yet to be seen. "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There will be definitely be some noise and probably a lot of smoke over a continuing resolution, but it's unclear that they'll want to light a fire right before the deadline</span>," <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">said Chris Krueger, a political analyst with Guggenheim Partners</span> in Washington. "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">These guys will want to get home as soon as they can to make sure that they win their races</span>." Republican concern about a shutdown fight was reflected in a letter signed Wednesday by 20 House and Senate Republicans urging House Speaker John Boehner and top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell to seek immediate passage of a "fiscally responsible continuing resolution to extend federal operations well into next year". "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Taking the threat of a government shutdown off the table will allow a serious debate about tax and spending policy before the elections</span>," the lawmakers wrote. Fiscal 2013 levels for so-called discretionary spending, programs such as defense and education where Congress has more flexibility, were supposed to have been settled by the debt limit deal last year and the cuts it specified - to a $1.047 trillion discretionary spending level. But House bills have cut $19 billion from that level, and fiscal conservatives are pressing for more. Campaign ads in congressional races feature claims about the need to tame runaway Washington spending. SHUTDOWN BATTLE FATIGUE Republican aides say House leaders have little stomach for last year's bloody shutdown battles that devastated Congress' approval ratings. Their plan is to pass a shorter-term measure sooner rather than later, pushing funding decisions past the election. "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There is a consensus that we want to avoid any big battle that could hurt (Republican candidate Mitt) Romney between now and the election," said a Republican House leadership aide</span>. This stop-gap effort would likely continue current spending levels or those agreed in last year's debt limit deal. A fight over the length of the extension also is brewing. Some Republicans in both the House and Senate are insisting on a longer spending extension that goes into next year, when a newly elected Congress will take office. They fear that under a short extension into the lame-duck session between the election and the start of a new Congress in January 2013, defeated lawmakers will be able to spend with impunity. But these lawmakers will clash with other Republicans, such as House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, who want a short, three-month reprieve to finish spending bills - and cuts - for which they have fought all year. "CRs are not supposed to replace real funding bills. They're Band-Aids to give Congress extra time to complete the work that it's supposed to do during the regular fiscal year," said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for Rogers. A short-term CR would more likely win passage in the Democratic-controlled Senate, cutting chances of a messy shutdown fight down to "slim to none," she added. The Republican leadership aide said at this point, there were no plans to go beyond the lame duck session. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has given up on the normal appropriations process, saying last week that the Senate will not pass any spending bills this year. He blamed the decision on the House Republicans' insistence on undercutting the spending level laid out in last year's debt limit deal. House Speaker John Boehner has yet to publicly reveal his preferred path for a government funding extension. "Given Senate Democrats' inexcusable failure to pass a budget or a single appropriations bill, at some point we'll have to deal with the consequences of their inaction - but no decisions have been made yet on how to do that," said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A short-term extension also would heap the funding of government agencies and programs onto an already overcrowded agenda for Congress' lame duck session that includes much more pressing issues - year-end expiration of tax cuts, automatic spending cuts due in January and a likely debt limit increase</span>. "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It would be adding more fuel to the chaos</span>," <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">said Senator Lindsey Graham</span>, who signed the letter to Republican leaders. "A vast majority of Republicans would prefer, on the Senate side, that the CR go into the next Congress so that we don't have all of this hitting right before Christmas."

2013 appropriations bills are also being kept out of the lame duck now in order to deal with fiscal cliff

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Connor 12</span> (Cathy Connor, manager of government affairs, PB Transportation Update, “August 6, 2012 Update,” PB Washington Update, 8-6-2012, http://www.pbtransportationupdate.com/pdfs/wash_update/wu%208612.pdf)

Congress has started its summer recess/district work period and will not return to Washington until the week of September 10, a week later than usual to accommodate the Democratic convention being held in Charlotte, NC September 4, 5 and 6. The Republican convention will be held in Tampa, FL just prior to the Labor Day weekend on August 27, 28, 29 and 30. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">When they return in September, Congress will only be in session for about two weeks before they recess again through the November 6 elections. With significant unfinished work, it is assumed that Congress will return after the elections for a Lame Duck session</span> in late November and into December. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The unfinished issues include many controversial items such as numerous tax extenders, the expiring Bush tax cuts, and the massive government-wide sequester due to go into effect on January 1, 2013 as required by passage last fall of the Budget Control Act, which imposes automatic spending cuts on all domestic discretionary programs as well as all defense programs</span>. The only good news about the sequester is that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">recent analysis shows programs funded by the Highway and Aviation Trust Funds will be exempt from the cuts, however, other transportation programs that are funded from the General Fund, such as transit New Starts</span> and Amtrak, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will face cuts of as much as 7.8% if Congress does not agree to postpone the sequester</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">One issue that Congress will not have to deal with in the Lame Duck is completing all 13 federal agency FY'13 annual funding bills. Last week, the bi-partisan and bi-cameral congressional leadership decided to postpone final action on all the appropriations bills until early next year</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">When they return in September, Congress plans to pass a six-month Continuing Resolution (CR) to provide continued government spending from the October 1 start of the new fiscal year through March 31, 2013, thereby avoiding any fears of a government shutdown before the elections which both parties could be blamed for</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It will</span> be a "clean" CR, meaning it will <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">not include any extraneous provisions</span> or "riders". <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It will provide partial-year FY'13 funding based on the current FY'12 funding levels</span> which were established by the 2011 Budget Control Act, the bill that created last year's "SuperCommittee", rather than the greatly reduced levels proposed by the House Budget Committee.



The plan requires revisiting appropriations bills to insert funding for the new programs – necessarily disrupts the lame duck agenda and triggers our impacts

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Nessle 12</span> (Elaine Nessle, senior associate, Blakey & Agnew, LLC, DC public affairs and communications consulting firm, “Congress manages to pass the seemingly impossible,” Cargo Business News, 90(10), July 2012, http://digital.nexsitepublishing.com/i/75265/11)

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Hours before the Fourth of July recess</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Congress managed to do the seemingly impossible and pass a surface transportation authorization</span>. Media reports and statements by most members were tinged with pessimism leading up to the final hours, but House and Senate leadership forged on and left Washington with a passed 27-month surface transportation bill (and a one-week extension of current law to allow for President Obama to sign the bill). Valued at $105 billion, the bill will provide a reliable funding stream for State DOT financing needs. This $105 billion, though, is not entirely covered by the Highway Trust Fund’s (HTF) revenue stream. Instead, the HTF will require cash infusions from the General Fund in order to make good on obligations. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Mere days after passage, Congress is already speculating that the next surface transportation bill will need to establish new revenue streams to fully support the dwindling HTF</span>. Though the full House never actually passed its own comprehensive surface transportation bill, MAP-21 has many elements from the House Transportation and Infrastructure-passed bill, H.R. 7. This, perhaps, was the result of a concession made by the House to stand down on one of the Chamber’s utmost priorities: Keystone Pipeline XL. The approval language which had been identified as a priority by House leadership did not appear in the final bill. Chairwoman of the Surface Transportation Conference Committee, Senator Barbara Boxer, had been an outspoken opponent of the measure, citing unanswered public health and safety questions related to the Keystone Pipeline XL project. As for the Senate’s concessions, the Chamber’s passenger and freight rail title was eliminated from the bill, as was the National Freight Program, and though members of the Senate voiced displeasure with House project streamlining provisions, a great deal of them ended up in the final bill, including categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act. Though the Senate’s National Freight Program was eliminated, various pieces of the program do appear in the bill, including the establishment of a national freight policy, national freight strategic plan, and a road freight network. In lieu of a freight formula program that appeared in the Senate proposal, the bill authors included language that allows for a slightly-increased federal share payable for road freight projects. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While SAFETEA-LU’s Projects of National and Regional Significance (PNRS) competitive grant program was maintained in the final bill, the authorization for funding was slashed in half</span>, leaving the program with a $500 million authorization for appropriations in FY2013 only. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is worth noting, however, that the House and Senate have both written, and in the House’s case passed, appropriations bills – meaning that if the appetite exists, appropriators will need to revisit the bills to insert the PNRS program</span>. Call for the establishment of a national freight policy, national freight strategic plan, and a road freight network represent first steps by Congress to recognize freight movement as a national priority. These steps occur just weeks after the State of Washington’s Senator Maria Cantwell wrote U.S. DOT Secretary Ray LaHood, requesting a multimodal freight initiative be established, using current administrative powers, within the Office of the Secretary to “improve federal freight policy, planning, and investment across all modes.” Senator Cantwell’s request includes a suggestion that such an initiative could lead the development of the national freight strategic plan included in MAP-21. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Passage of the surface transportation authorization represents one of the great accomplishments by this Congress and clears the deck for high-profile items such as the impending budget sequestrations</span>.

New spending especially controversial—violates bipart spending agreement to keep the government running

Walsh, CNN, 9-11-12

(Deidre, “Congress has little motivation for compromise before election”, lexis, ldg)



After a five-week summer recess, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Congress returns to a long list of unfinished business</span>, but with 57 left days before Election Day, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it's likely it will tackle only the bare minimum</span> in its short fall session. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The one must-pass measure -- a short-term continuing resolution</span> to fund federal agencies -- <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will avoid any pre-election talk of a government shutdown</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">with which neither party wants to be tagged</span>. Republican and Democratic leaders struck a deal this summer on a six-month bill, but both chambers still need to pass the legislation before government funding expires at the end of this month. The House is expected vote on the bill Thursday, and two GOP leadership aides predict it will get a sizable bipartisan majority. A senior Senate Democratic aide tells CNN the Senate is expected to approve the measure next week. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the third-ranking GOP leader in the House, did not directly answer whether a majority of House Republicans would vote for the stopgap spending bill, but said, "<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">I expect that bill to be a bipartisan vote</span>, and I expect the Senate to pass it as well and not add anything to it." What could move -- It's possible that GOP and Democratic leaders could work out a deal on a farm bill to reform agriculture programs and provide some relief to drought-stricken states -- or at least agree to another short-term extension of the current law, according to multiple congressional aides. If they can't reconcile differences between the two varying approaches taken by the House and Senate, some money for drought assistance, plus some money for states affected by recent natural disasters, could be tacked onto the spending bill. McCarthy, who represents some agricultural interests in his California district, told reporters Monday he's still pressing to pass a bill before the election. He acknowledged to reporters on Capitol Hill that "the time frame is tough," but "it's our intent to get it done." -- The Senate will return and work on a veterans jobs bill this week. Senate Democrats are also considering action this month on a housing bill that President Barack Obama included on his congressional "to do" list earlier this summer, but House Republicans haven't expressed any desire to act on it. -- Some key provisions of the federal wiretapping bill known as FISA that was created after the 9/11 terror attacks under President George W. Bush are due to expire at the end of the year, and Congress is expected to pass an extension of the current law. House Republicans have slated a vote this week to renew the current law for another five years. Likely to be punted <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The</span> roughly eight-week <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sprint to Election Day means</span> several <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">major measures</span> that lawmakers have failed to make any progress on over the summer <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will continue to languish on Capitol Hill</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">These include</span> some <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">issues</span> that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">both parties</span> say they want to address but will <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">have little motivation to compromise on:</span> The renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, a bill providing new cybersecurity protections and legislation to reform the postal service, which recently defaulted on payments to the Treasury Department for employee health plans. In each case, the proposal favored by the GOP-led House is at odds with the bills in the Democrat-controlled Senate. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A divided Congress means these issues will be punted</span> into the lame duck session after the election, or even <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">postponed until next year</span>. Less legislating and more campaign messaging While there won't be much legislating, congressional aides say the messages from leaders and rank-and-file members on Capitol Hill will echo the campaign themes of Obama and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, particularly when it comes to the economy and jobs. On his first post-convention stop in New Hampshire on Friday, Obama prodded voters to urge Congress to pass his jobs legislation. "If the Republicans are serious about being concerned about joblessness, we could create a million new jobs right now if Congress would pass the jobs plan that I sent to them a year ago -- jobs for teachers, jobs for construction workers, jobs for folks who have been looking for work for a long time. We can do that," Obama said. Kevin Smith, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, emphasized that the House GOP has already approved legislation aimed at helping the economy. "The House has done its job. We've passed more than 30 jobs bills." Noting that House Republicans have also passed a bill to undo the automatic spending cuts scheduled to go into effect in January and extend all the current tax rates, Smith added, "We are ready to act on all of those measures if the president and Senate Democrats would show some courage to work with on those things with us." Romney continues to highlight the Obama administration's failed loan to the now-bankrupt energy company Solyndra. House Republicans will keep the issue out front with a vote this week on a bill to eliminate the federal loan guarantee program that funded several energy start-ups. Dubbed the "No more Solyndras Act," the GOP bill is expected to pass mostly along party lines, but won't move in the Senate. One open question is whether GOP vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin will return to the Capitol for any part of the September session. Under Wisconsin law, Ryan is allowed to also run for his House seat, so he may feel pressure to take a break from barnstorming battleground states to vote on the bipartisan deal to keep the government funded. McCarthy told reporters Monday that Ryan would be back in Washington on Thursday to vote on the continuing resolution, and a Romney campaign official confirmed that. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The six-month spending bill keeps the government funded at the level agreed to in last summer's debt deal</span> -- $1.047 trillion. But after criticism from a bloc of conservative House Republicans that the deal didn't cut spending fast enough, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Ryan introduced a budget that moved the</span> overall <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">spending level</span> about $20 billion lower to $1.028 trillion. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">That budget</span> passed the House, but <span class="BoldUnderlineChar">was immediately rejected</span> by Senate Democrats <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as violating the bipartisan</span> debt <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">deal</span>.

Passing new transportation infrastructure authorization occupies weeks of floor time

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Congressional surface transportation reauthorization efforts</span> stalled this week. The House and Senate were each scheduled to address – possibly finalize -- their respective surface transportation reauthorization bills. However, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">continual political complications underscore that legislation is being crafted during a presidential election year</span>. In the House, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has made it a top priority to pass H.R. 7, the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act. The House bill, however, has attracted controversy on many issues, including the elimination of the Federal fuel tax as a dedicated source of funding for transit programs; the use of changes to Federal employee retirement as a pay-for; the expansion of oil and gas exploration in areas some consider too environmentally sensitive; spending levels that have dismayed some conservative interest groups; and a bill development process that many Democrats considered too partisan and exclusive. The diverse array of these concerns has challenged the arithmetic of getting a majority of the House to vote in favor of the legislation. The House Rules Committee announced plans to divide the current legislation into three more politically palatable components that would be more likely to draw votes but support still appeared tepid. In light of the uncertainty regarding sufficient backing for the bill, Boehner announced that House floor consideration of the bill would be delayed until after next week’s Presidents’ Day holiday. In football parlance, quarterback Boehner opted to throw a pass to a receiver, who then immediately stepped out of bounds to stop the clock. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Republican leadership will likely use this time to test the viability of alternative legislative provisions and of different procedural scenarios</span>. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Ranking Member Nick J. Rahall (D-WV) told reporters on Wednesday that “The Republicans’ reckless attempt to jam through a partisan surface transportation bill that will never see the light of day has just backfired. Every day House Republicans refuse to return to the drawing board and work to develop a bipartisan bill is another day we waste in putting Americans back to work rebuilding our nation.” The Senate also faced political hurdles this week. S. 1813, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) has had more bipartisan support. Esoteric Senate rules, however, make it easy for just one senator to impede the entire floor progress of legislation</span>. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) suspended consideration of MAP-21 for two days seeking assurance that he would get a vote on his proposed amendment to the bill that called for the cessation of government subsidies to Egypt. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) on Friday lost a procedural vote to determine the rules for the first stage of floor consideration of the reauthorization bill when the Senate returns to business. The Senate resumed consideration of S. 1813 this afternoon before their departure for the Presidents’ Day holiday. Like the House, the Senate will have (at least) dozens of amendments to address during <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">floor deliberations</span>, which <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">may </span>//occupy weeks of floor time//. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Some Republican members expressed concerns that non-transportation-related funding would be added to the traditional Highway Trust Fund financing mechanisms and others in the GOP objected to what they saw as long-term pay-fors to cover a two-year bill</span>. Several senators are also opposed to a freight component sponsored by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Reid indicated his frustration</span> to POLITICO <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that his colleagues were promoting non-germane amendments, saying “We just can't let this bill be sidetracked with all these extraneous issues</span>."



Triggers our impacts

So far, neither President Obama nor Senate Democrats have offered any concrete legislation to avert sequestration despite repeated statements from senior defense officials about its disastrous impact. As former Pentagon comptroller Dov Zakheim noted:¶ Despite the urgency of the sequester’s challenge, the administration continues to sit on its hands. No draft legislation has emerged from the White House that would at least postpone the sequester for a reasonable period to enable Congress to try its hand at another effort to reduce the deficit. The administration’s allies on the hill, particularly in the Senate, have been equally nonchalant about the coming programmatic and economic disaster.¶ Second, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is far from certain that a so-called “grand bargain” to stave off sequestration can be worked out among the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the President during the post-election lame-duck session of Congress</span>. Indeed, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the agenda for the lame-duck session is already becoming filled with highly contentious and divisive issues—in particular, expiration of the Bush tax cuts, expiration of the temporary payroll tax relief holiday, expiration of the annual “tax extenders” break, the Medicare “doc fix,” the farm bill reauthorization, the transportation bill reauthorization, the fiscal year 2013 appropriations bills, and the possible need to increase once again the federal debt ceiling—that will reduce what little time there is for sequestration fixes to be considered</span>.¶ Third, the outlines of the debate over the national debt have been well established, and there is little reason to believe that they will change. Both the President and congressional Democrats have repeatedly stated that they will not support any deal to resolve sequestration that does not include tax increases—an option viewed to be unpalatable to congressional Republicans. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Given the events of 2011 that gave rise to sequestration in the first place, it remains to be seen whether conservatives and liberals will be able to bridge their differences during the brief lame-duck session</span>.¶



===2nc fiscal cliff - a2 plan = lame duck=== 



Even if they win this argument, our links still apply – and trying to force new spending through the lame duck independently triggers backlash

<span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Miniter 12</span> (Richard, New York Times, Leading from Behind: The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him, 2012, pg 85-6, ldg)

After the historic defeat, Axelrod went on to teach a course called Campaign Strategy at Northwestern University in the Chicago suburbs. The day after the election, many White House staffers described their mood as "depressed." The loss of the U.S. House of Representatives and only a skinny remaining majority in the U.S. Senate meant that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">passing new programs would be very difficult</span>. Would the next two years be an endless and enervating siege? Obama seemed strangely upbeat, '[he day after the midterm elections, the president convened a meeting with his senior Staff, While they saw clouds, he saw the sun through them. Democrats still ran both houses of Congress until January 3.2011. when the new session convened. To the surprise of some starters present, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">he enumerated an ambitious list of measures that he would like to see made law</span> in the next sixty days; "a tax deal, extending unemployment benefits, ratification of New START treaty reducing nuclear arms, repeal of the Pentagon's Don't Ask/ Don't Tell policy preventing gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military, passage of the DREAM Act (which would grant citizenship to undocumented young adults who met certain requirements), and a children's nutrition bill advocated by Michelle Obama."" <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The list was unrealistic</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It would have been a demanding agenda for Congress to accomplish</span> over two years. let alone two months. Besides, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">using a "lame duck" Congress to pass major legislation had enormous political risks</span>. It would be seen as an end-run around voters who had just elected a new majority with a new agenda. When President Carter had used a "lame duck' Congress to pass major bills (including the costly "Superfund" program) following the November 1980 elections in which he lost his reelection bid and Republicans won control of the Senate for the first time since I95-*. the public was outraged. The outrage would be much bigger this time: Since 1980. the Internet, talk radio, and the Fox News Channel had emerged as powerful forums for channeling outrage. liven if Congress could actually adopt these controversial measures in a few short months, the political price of such a strategy would he high. Still, Obama continued to back Axelrod's analysis, which held that "independent voters wanted a leader who would make all the squabbling schoolchildren in Washington do their assignments."12 Who would do the "assigning"? The voters or the White House? Neither Obama nor Axel-rod seemed to wonder. If the federal government would finally pass a liberal wish list. Axelrod and Obama contended, voters would be happy. It was an unusual view. Independent voters in swing districts had actually voted down candidates who had supported the president's policies in the 2010 elections. Even in safely Democratic districts, independent voters had reduced their support of liberal lawmakers compared with 2008, exit polls showed. Few staffers were persuaded ch.it the president was right, although none dared to contradict him during that meeting. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Passing Obama’s priorities during</span> the Thanksgiving and Christmas <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">holiday season had</span> yet another <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">obstacle</span>. A massive White House staff reorganization was in progress. Rahm Emmanuel had stepped down as chief of staff in October 2010 and many other staffers were returning to Chicago or to academia. Without staff, it would be harder to rally the already reluctant Congress to act. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Still, Obama was keen to proceed as planned. He was finally going to lead, but the timing and strategy were ill-considered. "Obama didn't care about the criticism that he was too insular," a White House aide said.

Capital on the budget deal key to success

Potter, Australian Financial Review, 9-10-12

(Ben, “Agenda revealed on convention sidelines”, lexis, ldg)



<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A re-elected Obama</span>, jealous of his "legacy", <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would have</span> three months - or <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">100 days -of</span> maximum <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">political capital</span>, they said. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Look for him to plunge in.</span> Gene Spurling, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, laid out a three-point economic agenda at a National Journal/Atlantic event. First, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">securing the certainty of a long-term budget deal</span> to bring down deficits and debt as a share of the economy. Second, preserving enough fiscal space to foster growth and jobs creation in the short term. Third, making long-term "investments" in skills and infrastructure to boost competitiveness. Obama added new goals in his convention speech: double manufacturing exports to generate 1 million new jobs, exploit cheap shale gas to create work for another 600,000 people, and hire 100,000 new maths and science teachers. Like his Republican rival Mitt Romney, he didn't explain how we would reach his goals. Disappointing too was the lack of fresh ideas, or an "X" factor to stimulate the faltering economy without deepening the nation's debt trap. Shale gas was the exception. Shale, an agent of industrial revival, harbours vast reserves of oil too. Obama will also approve the contentious Keystone pipeline, delivering tar sands oil from Canada. The Obama administration dragged the chain on energy, focusing on renewables. Now it's playing catch-up. Spurling said he hoped the risk of the "fiscal cliff" pitching the economy into recession and slashing defence spending would bring Congressional Republicans back from their "extreme" stance that all deficit cuts must be spending cuts. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This could make a "framework" budget deal</span> that leaves the details to be filled in later <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">achievable in the lame duck, post-election Congress</span>, he said. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Republicans will feel little love for the President</span> after the bashing they got at the convention. So this could depend heavily on the margin of victory. New Hampshire senator Jeanne Shaheen said an extension into 2013 was more likely, to buy time. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Yet the feeling among Democrats that a deal could come easier after the election mirrored that of some Republicans at their convention</span> in Tampa, Florida a week earlier. Obama won't cut spending as deeply as Romney's running mate Paul Ryan would like to, in his budget plan. This would slash spending on items like early childhood learning for disadvantaged kids, and Medicaid funding for families with children suffering from severe autism or Down's Syndrome. These are deal breakers, as is any plan that's all spending cuts and no new revenues. Still, a <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">re-elected Obama would sit down with House speaker John Boehner and negotiate another budget deal</span>, Spurling said. Obama's plan would include his American Jobs Act, a $US447 billion bill to re-employ teachers, emergency and construction workers, to boost growth and preserve skills. That's been hanging around Congress for a year. It would produce a fifth year of US trillion dollar deficits, and Republicans are unlikely to support it in full. Tax reform can create enduring growth and bring in more revenue. Boehner nearly agreed to a revenue raising "grand bargain" last year. Its failure still rankles both sides. The imperatives grow stronger. The President realises it's critical to end the uncertainty that keeps firms with trillions of US dollars to invest on the sidelines, Shaheen said. And any serious person knows revenues, entitlements and defence must be on the table, she added. There's a gulf between Obama's manufacturing focused corporate tax reform plan (he has no personal tax plan), and Republican plans that don't explain how large rate cuts will be paid for. That all has to be filled in, in a way that serves efficiency - to boost growth - as well as fairness, Obama's bottom line. Entitlements, the biggest drivers of future debts, must also be part of the deal. Obama said he won't accept Romney and Ryan's "premium support" (voucher) model, even though it was first suggested by Alice Rivlin, President Clinton's budget director. Spurling said he hasn't seen a model that works. The costs of US healthcare must be reined in, and Obama's healthcare reform only moves the needle a bit, conceded Neera Tanden, who worked on the reforms for the administration. Healthcare "bundling" initiatives - paying for "wellness" not "illness" - are yielding dividends, Tanden said. If so, they should be expanded. Obama said he would fix Medicare by cutting its cost, not by asking seniors to pay more. Romney says he'd ask rich seniors to pay more, a logical step. Obama would have to bring more to the table to get a deal. The same goes for social security. Raising the entitlement age and means testing benefits seem inevitable. Obama prefers to pretend these can be preserved during the campaign. Maybe he'll be clearer later. Immigration reform, a pathway to legal residency for millions of undocumented immigrants, seems a long way off after the harsh rhetoric of the Republicans in the primaries. Yet there is surprising optimism here. There's broad understanding from industries ranging from high tech to farming that their business model depends on undocumented workers, said Melody Barnes, Obama's former domestic policy director. Republicans who supported former president George W Bush's failed bid for reform got cold feet as their party shifted rightward. Barnes and Shaheen think they can be lured out of hiding, especially if Hispanic and other minority voters heavily favour Obama again this year, and future leaders like Jebb Bush and Marco Rubio keep up the pressure for change.

PC forces compromise

While leaders still bluster publicly about holding the line during the lame-duck session even if they lose, they are increasingly eyeing the elections as the clarifying event to break the logjam over taxes and spending that has blocked a bipartisan debt deal for the past two years. Democrats for months have been ratcheting up their resolve on the fiscal cliff and believe that Republicans will finally bend if President Barack Obama is elected. And they pointed to a quote from conservative Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) to that effect that appeared in a Bloomberg story last week. "We might as well cut a deal," DeMint said of what would happen if Obama wins. "If Republicans want to maintain the defense, we're going to have to give tax increases to Obama." "When Jim DeMint is suddenly open to revenues, you know the tide is turning," a grinning Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday. Of course, DeMint's office quickly walked back the quote. "Senator DeMint strongly opposes tax hikes that destroy jobs. He was simply pointing out that President Obama won't agree to anything that doesn't include tax increases, which is one of the biggest reasons he should be defeated this November," spokesman Wesley Denton said. "And that's also why Senator DeMint opposes a lame-duck session. We shouldn't have politicians cut deals for higher taxes after they're kicked out of office. We need a new president and a new Congress address these issues next year." But DeMint isn't alone in acknowledging the reality that Obama will be able to force through a tax increase. Other Republicans, particularly in the Senate, have been meeting for months with Democratic counterparts in hopes of breaking the stalemate, although everyone has acknowledged that a deal simply isn't going to happen until voters speak. Schumer noted last week that on Wednesday alone he attended four meetings on the fiscal cliff, some of which were bipartisan. He said the discussions would continue while Congress is on recess for the next month and a half. Other Senators on the Finance Committee also held regular meetings to discuss the options, and the administration has opened talks with top Republicans, including a meeting last week between Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.). Senators including John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) have openly expressed a willingness to consider new revenue as part of a year-end deal to block defense cuts and secure entitlement reforms. And then there's the simple math - the vast majority of the cliff comes from tax cuts and defense spending that are bigger Republican priorities than Democratic ones. It's a trigger Democrats, such as Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Patty Murray (Wash.), have made clear they are ready and willing to pull. But the House has largely remained implacable in public so far. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters Friday that he still would not support any tax hikes if Obama wins. "No. ... Our goal is to have tax reform and entitlement reform, and we all know that these are going to probably have to travel on parallel paths. But it's important for our country to fix our debt problem and have a tax code that's competitive in a worldwide economy," he said.¶ However, he also expressed a desire to avoid the "ugly" sequester. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), a deputy whip and senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, vowed that Republicans would not raise taxes. The current rates are set to expire if nothing is done, leaving the GOP seemingly little leverage in the fight. But Brady said the impact of the cliff on the economy would be the leverage against Democrats. "I think the economy is the major leverage. It's still going to be struggling in a major way," Brady said. Brady conceded the political winds would be against the GOP, saying "It's true that it will be perceived as a referendum on higher taxes. But I think if the public retains Republicans in the House, it's also a clear sign they don't want to see taxes go up. Because we're running on that same issue back home as well." He envisioned the two parties striking a deal to bring in increased revenue without raising rates. "I think perhaps a common ground is that if the president wants to talk about new revenues from increased growth, energy development, or better tax code, there's common ground there," he said. Still, there is some acknowledgement of the likelihood that the GOP will have to cave to Obama on the House side. Budget Committee member Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told the Washington Post last week that "if the president wins re-election, taxes are going up," adding, "There's not a lot we can do about that."

Everything sticks

If Ronald Reagan was the classic Teflon president, Barack <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama is made of Velcro. Through two terms, Reagan eluded much of the responsibility for recession and foreign policy scandal. In less than two years, Obama has become ensnared in blame</span>. Hoping to better insulate Obama, White House aides have sought to give other Cabinet officials a higher profile and additional public exposure. They are also crafting new ways to explain the president's policies to a skeptical public. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But Obama remains the colossus of his administration —</span> to a point where trouble anywhere in the world is often his to solve. The president is on the hook to repair the Gulf Coast oil spill disaster, stabilize Afghanistan, help fix Greece's ailing economy and do right by Shirley Sherrod, the Agriculture Department official fired as a result of a misleading fragment of videotape. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">What's not sticking to Obama is a legislative track record that his recent predecessors might envy. Political dividends from passage of a healthcare overhaul or a financial regulatory bill have been fleeting.</span> Instead, voters are measuring his presidency by a more immediate yardstick: Is he creating enough jobs? So far the verdict is no, and that has taken a toll on Obama's approval ratings. Only 46% approve of Obama's job performance, compared with 47% who disapprove, according to Gallup's daily tracking poll. "I think the accomplishments are very significant, but I think most people would look at this and say, 'What was the plan for jobs?' " said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.). "The agenda he's pushed here has been a very important agenda, but it hasn't translated into dinner table conversations."

Wins don’t help Obama

Bouie, American Prospect fellow, 2011

Among liberals, and most political observers, it’s widely acknowledged that President Obama took a major political hit when he pushed for health-care reform against Republican intransigence and public opposition. The cost of winning comprehensive health-care reform—a longtime liberal dream—was a resurgent and powerful Republican Party. If political courage is defined by the willingness to suffer politically for the sake of good public policy, then Affordable Care Act stands as a testament to the president’s political courage.



Empirically proven.

With this weekend’s decisive Senate repeal of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy for gay service members, can anyone seriously doubt Barack Obama’s patient willingness to play the long game? Or his remarkable success in doing so? In less than two years in office—often against the odds and the smart money’s predictions at any given moment—Obama has managed to achieve a landmark overhaul of the nation’s health insurance system; the most sweeping change in the financial regulatory system since the Great Depression; the stabilization of the domestic auto industry; and the repeal of a once well-intended policy that even the military itself had come to see as unnecessary and unfair. So why isn’t his political standing higher? Precisely because of the raft of legislative victories he’s achieved. Obama has pushed through large and complicated new government initiatives at a time of record-low public trust in government (and in institutions of any sort, for that matter), and he has suffered not because he hasn’t “done” anything but because he’s done so much—way, way too much in the eyes of his most conservative critics. With each victory, Obama’s opponents grow more frustrated, filling the airwaves and what passes for political discourse with fulminations about some supposed sin or another. Is it any wonder the guy is bleeding a bit? For his part, Obama resists the pugilistic impulse. To him, the merit of all these programs has been self-evident, and he has been the first to acknowledge that he has not always done all he could to explain them, sensibly and simply, to the American public.
