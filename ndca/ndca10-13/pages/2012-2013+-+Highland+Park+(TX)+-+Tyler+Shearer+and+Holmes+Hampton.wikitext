===1AC's=== 
====New Navy Scenario==== 
Turkey-Syrian war is likely and will happen
**Wright 12** (Robert is a senior editor at The Atlantic and the author, most recently, of <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.evolutionofgod.net/|The Evolution of God]]</span>, a New York Times bestseller and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, “Why Turkey and Syria are Heading toward War”, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/why-turkey-and-syria-are-heading-toward-war/263415/]]</span>)

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">make Syria even less inclined to keep its fire far from the border.</span>

Syrian defectors prove tensions are at a critical mass
**Sherlock 12** (Ruth has covered the Arab Spring for the Daily Telegraph from Egypt

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">a good human being, but he is worse than his father.''</span>

It’ll go nuclear
**Gatto 12** (July 12,2012, Timothy V., retired Army Sergeant and former Chairman of The Liberal Party of America, “Is Syria Worth World War III?”, http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2012/07/16/s-syria-worth-world-war-iii)\

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">strife in Syria so important that we would commit to destroying the world?</span>

Naval strength solves deterrence
**Vego 08** — professor of operations at the Naval War College, former commanding officer in the former Yugoslav Navy and former West German merchant marine (Milan N., “On Naval Power”, Joint Forces Quarterly, July 2008, http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/jfq-50/JFQ-50.pdf)

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">of sufficient size and combat power to </span>__defeat opposing forces quickly__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and decisively.</span>

Naval capacity is key—it’s a prerequisite to the rest of the military
**Trombly 12** (Daniel Trombly, 8/22/12 analyst and writer on international affairs and strategy. Contributor to “Abu Muqawama” and “Slouching Toward Columbia” “The cost of a Syria Intervention” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">[[http://news.usni.org/news-analysis/news/cost-syrian-intervention]]</span>)

Even if we don’t solve deterrence—the aff is key to rapid response and de-escalation
**Hickins 09**
(COLONEL KENNETH, United States Army, March 30, 2009, “STRATEGIC MOBILITY: FORGOTTEN CRITICAL REQUIREMENT OF THE CONTEMPORARY OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT”,)
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As I stated at the beginning of the paper, </span>Strategic Mobility<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has not been </span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Mobility Triad that is a critical requirement for any operational and strategic success.</span>

Naval budget cuts are a critical force multiplier and ensures the status quo doesn’t solve
**McNabb 11** – United States Air Force general who last served as the ninth Commander, U.S. Transportation Command from September 5, 2008 to October 17, 2011. He previously served as the 21st Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force. (Duncan, “We Measure Success Through the Eyes of the War Fighter,” Air and Space Power Journal, Winter, http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a555500.pdf)

We solve

1. Inland waterways are key to military mobility and response capabilities

2. Shipbuilding industry—that’s key to overall navy effectiveness—status quo ensures collapse
**Alberto, et al., 5** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Lieutenant Colonel Ronald P., U.S</span>
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span>

====Trade==== 
Panama canal expansion will make or break US trade—modernization is vital
**Bridges 2011** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Jerry A, Chairman of the Board of the American Association of Port Authorities and Executive Director of Virginia Port Authority, "Testimony of Jerry A.

b. Intermodals
AASHTO 11
(American Association of State Highway and Transportation, "House Subcommittee Hears Calls for Stronger
Federal Investment in Inland Waterways"; http://www.aashtojournal.org/Pages/092311waterways.aspx//HH)
The House Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee discussed Wednesday what some members described as the
AND
previous %24413 million surplus in the IWTF has run almost completely dry.


Put away those process CP's--certainty with funding is vital to solvency
**Bray 11**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—- Center for Transportation Research, University of Tennessee, Knoxville (9/21/2011, Larry G., Congressional Documents and Publications, House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment Hearing - "The Economic Importance and Financial Challenges of Recapitalizing the Nation~’s Inland Waterways Transportation System," Factiva, JMP)</span>
Has Aging Infrastructure Left US Inland Navigation at a Crossroads? While my years of
AND
wrongly-abandoned routes that can never be restored will top many lists.


Export competitiveness is vital to sustainable economic growth – prevents investment bubbles
Istrate et al, 10 – senior research analyst and associate fellow with the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative (Emilia, "Export Nation: How U.S. Metros Lead National Export Growth and Boost Competitiveness", July, Brookings, http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/reports/2010/7/26%20mountain%20exports%20muro/0726_exports_istrate_rothwell_katz.pdf)
Exports Could Contribute to the Rebalancing of the U.S. Economy and a
AND
of the U.S. economy and its distance from trading partners.


Slow growth causes conflict—statistics prove
**Royal 10** – Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, (Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises, Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215)
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.



US trade leadership is key to peaceful and cooperative world trade
**Kiefer et al 2000**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Jack, principal investigator for Planning and Management Consultants– study authorized by Section 401 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1999, report to the US Army Corps of Engineers, Planning and Management Consultants, "The National Dredging Needs Study of Ports and Harbors Implications to Cost-Sharing of Federal Deep Draft Navigation Projects Due to Changes in the Maritime Industry", May 2000, [[http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/docs/iwrreports/00-R-8.pdf-http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/docs/iwrreports/00-R-8.pdf]]) </span>

Indirect benefits of Corps projects include gains associated with international trade. Historical expenditures for
AND
trade are widespread and are not limited to a handful of coastal states.


That solves global escalatory conflict
**PANITCHPAKDI ~’4** (Supachai Panitchpakdi, secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development, 2/26/2004, American Leadership and the World Trade Organization, p. http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spsp_e/spsp22_e.htm
The second point is that strengthening the world trading system is essential to America~’s wider
AND
constrained, not by multilateral rules, but by the absence of rules.


Trade and globalization are impact buffers--they disincentiveize conflict
**Griswold 11** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Daniel Griswold is director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute and author of Mad about Trade: Why Main Street America Should Embrace Globalization. "Free Trade and the Global Middle Class," Hayek Society Journal Vol. 9 [[http://www.cato.org/pubs/articles/Hayek-Society-Journal-Griswold.pdf Accessed 6/30/12-http://www.cato.org/pubs/articles/Hayek-Society-Journal-Griswold.pdf Accessed 6/30/12]]</span>

Our more globalized world has also yielded a "peace dividend." It may not
AND
and less likely those gains will be destroyed by civil conflict and war.

====Sealift==== 

Global crises are inevitable – we can~’t stop them, but rapid response is critical
Wilson 06 – Former Fellow at the Robert Kennedy Memorial Foundation. (Ward, "Rationale for a study of City Annihilations", 2006, http://wardhayeswilson.squarespace.com/city_annihilation/)
One of the characteristics of international crises is that they come seemingly out of the
AND
nuclear weapons will probably be moral arguments and arguments about risk and rationality.


Budget cuts to the navy make your politics arguments non unique and doing the aff now key
McNabb 11 – United States Air Force general who last served as the ninth Commander, U.S. Transportation Command from September 5, 2008 to October 17, 2011. He previously served as the 21st Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force. (Duncan, "We Measure Success Through the Eyes of the War Fighter," Air and Space Power Journal, Winter, http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a555500.pdf)
Against a backdrop of rising national debt and an uncertain future security environment, USTRANSCOM
AND
a global network of interconnected ports in suitable positions to enable global reach.


Rapid sealift capabilities are key to disaster response
McDermott 11 (CAPT Charles U.S. Navy, 2011, "Joint Interagency Multinational Sea-based Logistics Platforms: Utilizing Strategic Sealift to Enhance Geographic Combatant Commanders~’ Theater Engagement Capabilities", http://www.dtic.mil.proxy.lib.umich.edu/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA545854)
On December 26, 2004, a 9.0 magnitude undersea earthquake centered off
AND
the Navy~’s Tarawa-class amphibious assault ship USS Nassau (LHA 4).


Rapid response to disasters and humanitarian emergencies is key to US diplomacy
Serafino 08
(Nina M. Serafino, Specialist in International Security Affairs, December 9, 2008, "The Department of Defense Role in Foreign Assistance: Background, Major Issues, and Options for Congress", FAS, [[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL34639.pdf-http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL34639.pdf]])
**We don~’t like gendered language**
The Department of Defense (DOD) has long played a role in U.
AND
capacity to carry out such activities in the absence of appropriate civilian forces.


Diplomacy prevents all conflict
Jervis 9
(Robert Jervis, Professor of International Politics at Columbia, 2009, "Unipolairty: A Structural Perspective", Project Muse)
To say that the system is unipolar is not to argue that the unipole can
AND
that others share the American vision and believe that its leadership is benign.


Sealift is independently key to overall deterrence and rapid response capabilities – we control escalation of all war
Hickins 09
(COLONEL KENNETH, United States Army, March 30, 2009, "STRATEGIC MOBILITY: FORGOTTEN CRITICAL REQUIREMENT OF THE CONTEMPORARY OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT",)
As I stated at the beginning of the paper, Strategic Mobility has not been
AND
Mobility Triad that is a critical requirement for any operational and strategic success.


Naval strength is key to deter PRC expansion into Taiwan—causes conflict
Vego, 11 — professor of operations at the Naval War College, former commanding officer in the former Yugoslav Navy and former West German merchant marine (Milan N., "CHINA~’S Naval Challenge", United States Naval Institute, Proceedings, 137, 4, pg. 36-40, April 2011, proquest, Deech)
A conventional war in East Asia might seem unlikely, but it could conceivably break
AND
so it can successfully conduct operations in deep and shallow western Pacific waters.


Nuclear
The Strait Times, 2000
~~["No one gains in war over Taiwan", June 25, Lexis~~]
The high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full
AND
cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.


We solve

Inland waterways are key to military mobility and response capabilities

Donald E. **Jackson**Jr. **%26**John F. **Troxell**, 3-30-**2007**, Colonel in the United States Army, economics instructor at the U. S. Military Academy, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, held assignments in the Department of Army War Plans Division and as a force planner for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Requirements, "Leveraging the Strategic Value of the U.S Inland Waterway System," USAWC STRATEGY RESEARCH PROJECT, [[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA469583-http://www.transportation.wv.gov/ports/Pages/WVPorts.aspx?AD=ADA469583]]
The inland waterway system is a potential resource upon which we can increase the flow
AND
truck, 420 miles by rail, and 530 miles by barge. 58


2. Shipbuilding industry—that~’s key to overall navy effectiveness—status quo ensures collapse
Alberto, et al., 5 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Lieutenant Colonel Ronald P., U.S. Army, Colonel Michael G. Archuleta, U.S. Air Force, Lieutenant Colonel Steven H. Bills, U.S. Air Force, Commander William A. Bransom, U.S. Navy, Mr. Kenneth Cohen, Department of State, Commander William A. Ebbs, U.S. Navy, George Manjgaladze, Ministry of Defense, Republic of Georgia, Commander Elizabeth B. Myhre, U.S. Navy, Audrea M. Nelson, DA, Robert L. Riddick, Department of Defense, Colonel Christopher M. Ross, U.S. Army, Julia N. Ruhnke, DA, Lieutenant Colonel Gregory M. Ryan, U.S. Marine Corps, Colonel David D. Thompson, U.S. Air Force, Commander Hugh D. Wetherald, U.S. Navy, Dr. Mark Montroll, faculty at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, Dr. Michael Farbman, USAID, faculty at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, Captain David B. Hill, U.S. Coast Guard, faculty at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, "SHIPBUILDING", The Industrial College of the Armed Forces, National Defense University, 2005, http://www.ndu.edu/icaf/programs/academic/industry/reports/2005/pdf/icaf-is-report-shipbuilding-2005.pdf, Deech) In conclusion, </span>our study found that the tremendous advantage the US enjoys in naval power directly supports our national security through global power projection and maintaining freedom of the seas. Our ability to build<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> large, highly capable </span>naval ships is a vital part of our naval superiority and is<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> therefore </span>inexorably linked to our national security. The US must maintain it lead in naval power by protecting its domestic shipbuilding industry<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is our conclusion that </span>the number one issue facing the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> American military </span>shipbuilder today is the uncertainty in future orders<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for ship construction. The year to year fluctuation in the projected naval order book adds uncertainty for the shipbuilder wanting to invest in capital and labor improvement, and adds cost to the vessels actually being delivered. This fluctuation is exacerbated when the US Navy cancels entire ship classes or severely limits procurement of vessels that have been programs of record, programs which the shipbuilders have used to make labor and capital investment decisions. We feel it is imperative for the Navy to identify the force of the future and commit to a stable procurement plan to implement that force. The concept of Seabasing must mature at least to the point where the major yards can invest in the infrastructure necessary to build the force. In this area, we also conclude that the requirement for full funding of naval vessels in the year of authorization hampers the ability of the Navy and the industry to maintain a steady shipbuilding plan. It is apparent to us that the US Navy shipbuilding program is often used as a "bill payer" for other DoD priorities. In addition to the reality that the money is not obligated in the year of funding, the temptation to use the US Navy shipbuilding account to pay current year expenses is greater if significant procurement dollars are available to pay the full cost of individual ships. While we are convinced </span>the nation must maintain sufficient shipbuilding capacity to allow for surge in national emergencies<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, we feel that </span>the current and projected<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> naval </span>order book does not support the<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> capacity being carried by the six largest </span>shipyards<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Restructuring of the industrial base is necessary. This restructuring may entail the politically difficult decision to allow some yards to close, but if the naval order book does not increase and the restructuring does not occur, unit cost will continue to skyrocket out of proportion to the value to the nation of the vessel.</span>


Waterway investment saves the shipbuilding industry—demand and employment
**MARAD ~’11** ~~[U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration~~], America~’s Marine Highway Report to Congress, Prepared in Consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, April 2011, p. 12-13~~]
Expanded use of Marine Highway services has the potential to generate orders for new vessels
AND
growth are the chief sources of new demand for workers throughout the economy.




====The Economy==== 


First, current revenues are insufficient—threatens the sustainability of the Marine Transportation System and the economy
AASHTO 11
(American Association of State Highway and Transportation, "House Subcommittee Hears Calls for Stronger
Federal Investment in Inland Waterways"; http://www.aashtojournal.org/Pages/092311waterways.aspx//HH)
The House Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee discussed Wednesday what some members described as the
AND
previous %24413 million surplus in the IWTF has run almost completely dry.


Even if there isn~’t a collapse, uncertainty in the industry undermines its sustainability
**Bray 11**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—- Center for Transportation Research, University of Tennessee, Knoxville (9/21/2011, Larry G., Congressional Documents and Publications, House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment Hearing - "The Economic Importance and Financial Challenges of Recapitalizing the Nation~’s Inland Waterways Transportation System," Factiva, JMP)</span>
Has Aging Infrastructure Left US Inland Navigation at a Crossroads? While my years of
AND
wrongly-abandoned routes that can never be restored will top many lists.




There are two internal links


First, waterways are key to effective shipping and avoiding congestion, both are essential to growth
Mica, 11
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(John L., Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, September 19, "HEARING TO FOCUS ON INLAND WATERWAYS TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM," http://transportation.house.gov/news/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=1396) </span>

Washington, DC – A Congressional hearing on Wednesday will focus on the importance
AND
and makes U.S. products more competitive on the world market.



Second is exports


The plan is key to boost import-export competitiveness
Gibbs 12 – Representative from Ohio, from a hearing in front of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. (Bob, "How Reliability of the Inland Waterway System Impacts Economic Competitiveness", House of Representatives, April 18, 2012, http://transportation.house.gov/News/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=1609, CALISWAGGER)
The Inland Waterways System provides a cost-effective and energy efficient alternative to truck
AND
within days of having to shut down due to exhausted supplies of coal."


Export competitiveness is vital to sustainable economic growth – prevents investment bubbles
Istrate et al, 10 – senior research analyst and associate fellow with the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative (Emilia, "Export Nation: How U.S. Metros Lead National Export Growth and Boost Competitiveness", July, Brookings, http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/reports/2010/7/26%20mountain%20exports%20muro/0726_exports_istrate_rothwell_katz.pdf)
Exports Could Contribute to the Rebalancing of the U.S. Economy and a
AND
of the U.S. economy and its distance from trading partners.


US interconnectedness via trade controls the internal link to every impact.
Panitchpakdi 4 – <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Supachai, "American Leadership and the </span>World Trade Organization: What is the Alternative?" 2/26/2004, [[http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spsp_e/spsp22_e.htm-http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spsp_e/spsp22_e.htm]])
The second point is that strengthening the world trading system is essential to America~’s wider
AND
ideas — was essential to peace and prosperity, a more just world.


Next, the plan independently spurs demand for goods and services, creates sustainable economic growth
DeVol et al, 10 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Ross, chief research officer at the Milken Institute, a non-partisan, independent economic think tank. He is also author of "Jobs for America: Investments and Policies for Economic Growth and Competitiveness.", January 2010, "Jobs for America",http://www.nam.org/~~/media/58F813B0D1E643DC91E564FE4C3B3C2F.ashx</span>
Certain infrastructure projects, such as building a smart grid or constructing inland waterways,
AND
these greater purchases of goods and services, wealth is created and sustained.


Collapse of economic competitiveness ensures great power war
Khalilzad, ~’11 – Bush~’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the UN and former director policy planning at the DOD (Zalmay, "The Economy and National Security", National Review, 2-8-11, [[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/259024/economy-and-national-security-zalmay-khalilzad-http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/259024/economy-and-national-security-zalmay-khalilzad]])

Today, economic and fiscal trends pose the most severe long-term threat to
AND
undercut our will to preclude or respond to international crises because of the higher
risk of escalation.



Slow growth causes conflict—statistics prove
**Royal 10** – Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, (Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises, Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215)
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.




====The Squo==== 

Status quo efforts to fund the inland waterway trust fund fail—it threatens the sustainability of our waterway infrastructure
Frelinghuysen 12
(Rodney P., Member of the House of Representatives, Head of a bipartisan committee on energy and water development, "Senate Report 112-075 – Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, 2012"; http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?%26sid=cp112ncvda%26r_n=sr075.112%26dbname=cp112%26%26sel=TOC_28798%26//HH)
In December 2010, the administration provided their views on the capital investment strategy.
AND

Two Scenarios


First, the DiB deters war with Russia

Since the 1950s, the US defense industrial base has been a source of long
AND
term advantage in the decades ahead as it has been since the 1950s.

Extinction
Bostrum ~’02

A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in

preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.


Scenario 2 is China


Loss of the defense industrial base risks a China-Taiwan War
Steven Mosher 2/14/06
(President of the Population Research Institute, CQ Congressional Testimony, "Chinese Influence on U.S. Foreign Policy" pg lexis)
The ruthless mercantilism practiced by the CCP is thus a form of economic warfare.
AND
American military assets in the Asian- Pacific will have to be neutralized.


Extinction

The high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full
AND
cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.

====Agriculture==== 
Lock collapse decimates agriculture exports – shipping costs destroy competitiveness
Kruse et al. 2011,<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Director at the Center for Ports and waterways, ("America~’s Locks %26 Dams: "A Ticking Time Bomb for Agriculture?", www.unitedsoybean.org/wp-content/uploads/Americas_Locks_And_Dams.pdf)</span>

Agriculture accounted for 22% of all transported tonnage and 31% of all ton
AND
via barge; for soybeans, the percentage was 87–89%.2


Roads and rails fail – spikes cost
USB, 12 (United Soybean Board, 2/8/12, "Dilapidated Locks on U.S. Rivers Put Farmers, Consumers at Risk," http://www.unitedsoybean.org/global-opportunities-briefings/dilapidated-locks-on-u-s-rivers-put-farmers-consumers-at-risk/)
The study expresses grave concern about aging locks and dams along these rivers that serve
AND
and improvement of locks, dams and other important infrastructure for agricultural shipping.



Even if there isn~’t a collapse, uncertainty in the industry undermines its sustainability

Has Aging Infrastructure Left US Inland Navigation at a Crossroads? While my years of
AND
wrongly-abandoned routes that can never be restored will top many lists.


Scenario One is Soybeans

Collapse of inland waterways crushes U.S. soybean exports

A failure at one of six focus locks in a new study would cost agricultural
AND
move our products in a manner that will help us feed the world."




US soybean competitiveness is key to prevent Brazil from dominating the market

US soybean exporters have only a "narrow window" when they will have the
AND
stocks will have been disposed of and South American exports are seasonally small".


Growth of Brazilian soybean exports triggers deforestation of the Amazon rainforest—collapses biodiversity
Brown, 9 <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">President of the Earth Policy Institute (Lester R. Brown, the recipient of many prizes and awards, including 25 honorary degrees, a MacArthur Fellowship, the 1987 United Nations~’ Environment Prize, In 2012, he was inducted into the Earth Hall of Fame Kyoto, "Growing Demand for Soybeans Threatens Amazon Rainforest", December 30, 2009, http://www.earth-policy.org/plan_b_updates/2009/update86)</span>

The Amazon rainforest sustains one of the richest concentrations of plant and animal biological diversity
AND
growth in demand for soybeans by stabilizing population worldwide as soon as possible.

Amazon deforestation causes extinction

So biodiversity keeps the world running. It has value and of itself, as
AND
of the next century - not with a bang but a whimper.14



Scenario Two is Ethanol
