The coalition's strategy in Afghanistan … the need for a negotiated settlement.

Even winning the war just means decades of failure – the only option is to leave now

Whatever US officials might concede … the breach of American ineffectuality.

Pakistan instability causes nuclear conflict – draws in China, India and Russia
Pitt 9 – a New York Times and internationally bestselling author of two books: "War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn't Want You to Know" and "The Greatest Sedition Is Silence."

Pena 9 - Senior Fellow, The Independent Institute (December 9, Charles, “Can the U.S. Withdraw from Afghanistan and Iraq?” http://www.independent.org/events/transcript.asp?eventID=145 )

This insoluble problem is why … than any other counterterrorism deployment.

Contention Two is HEGEMONY.

We’ll isolate three scenarios.

First is leadership.

Obama’s July 2011 deadline is conditioned on the success of counterinsurgency, but is perceived as an unconditional withdrawal and has created global confusion.
Rogin 10 - staff writer for Foreign Policy, Prior to that, Josh covered defense and foreign policy for Congressional Quarterly. Josh has also worked at the House International Relations Committee, and the Brookings Institution (Josh, “Petraeus: Withdrawal timeline does not mean "switching off the lights",” The Cable, 6/29, http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/06/29/petraeus_withdrawal_timeline_does_not_mean_switching_off_the_lights)

Fernholz 10 – writing fellow at the American Prospect and Research Fellow at the New America Foundation (Tim, The American Prospect, “The Ultimate Test Case,” March, 2010, lexis) Katulis = security policy analyst at the Center for American Progress
Obama's final decision in December … any of his other initiatives.

A robust foreign policy is key to solving global problems – withdrawal opens up agenda space
Cohen 9 - Michael Cohen, senior research fellow at the New America Foundation ("Mother of all decisions: If Obama escalates in Afghanistan, he'll set back progress on other fronts," The New York Daily News, 10/30/09, www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/11/30/2009-11-30_the_mother_of_all_decisions.html, accessed 9/16/10) [DHUANG]
Sending from 30,000 to 40,000 troops to … policy agenda - and his presidency.

Withdrawal preserves the United States as a role model for the world and its global leadership
Zachary 9 - G. Pascal Zachary, author, member of the In These Times Board of Editors, previous senior writer for the Wall Street Journal ("Get Out Now: The Case for Immediate Withdrawal from Afghanistan," 10/09/09, inthesetimes.com/article/5006/get_out_now, accessed 9/16/10) [DHUANG]

Holmes 9 – Kim R. Holmes , Ph.D., Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy Studies and Director of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for International Studies at The Heritage Foundation (“The Perils of Prediction and Unpreparedness in Building the Future Force,” Heritage Foundation Lecture #1131, September 2nd, Available Online at http://www.heritage.org/Research/NationalSecurity/hl1131.cfm , Accessed 10-27-2009)
I think the underlying assumption … have "run up the score.

However, withdrawal allows the US to replenish its strategic reserve.
Friedman 10 - American political scientist. He is the chief intelligence officer, and CEO of the private intelligence corporation Stratfor. Prior to Stratfor, Friedman spent almost twenty years in academia, teaching political science at Dickinson College. During this time, he regularly briefed senior commanders in the armed services as well as the U.S. Army War College (George, “The 30-Year War in Afghanistan,” Stratfor, 6/29, http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100628_30_year_war_afghanistan)

She served two tours in Iraq, including a year as a senior adviser to General Peter Chiarelli, the operational commander in Iraq in 2006 (Celeste, “False Promise of 'Counterinsurgency'”, 12/1, http://www.rand.org/commentary/2009/12/01/NYT.html)
An effort to conduct "counterinsurgency" … capable of applying overwhelming force.

Third is fiscal collapse.

Afghanistan will bankrupt the U.S. and collapse our financial leadership
Corn 9 – Ph.D. from the University of Paris and is a graduate of the U.S. Naval War College, currently on leave from the US State Department (Tony, “Toward a Kilcullen-Biden Plan?

Back in 1979, National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, plotting to draw the Soviets into a quagmire in Afghanistan, wrote President Jimmy Carter: "We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam War."
In fact, the CIA-backed … , meant for burials, not resurrections.

Hegemony de-escalates all conflict and solves great power wars
Thayer 6 – Bradley A. Thayer, November/December, 2006 “In Defense of Primacy,” NATIONAL INTEREST Issue 86
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability … are the equivalent of a blitzkrieg.

The alternative to U.S. hegemony is apolarity and global nuclear wars.
Ferguson 4 – Niall Ferguson, July/August 2004 “A World Without Power,” FOREIGN POLICY Issue 143
So what is left? Waning … such a not-so-new world disorder.

A multipolar world makes great power wars inevitable
Wohlforth 9 – William Wohlforth (professor of government at Dartmouth College) 2009 “ Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War” Project Muse
The upshot is a near scholarly … tend to be zero sum.9

Khanna 9 – Director of the Global Governance Initiative at the New America Foundation (Parag, The second world: how emerging powers are redefining global competition in the twenty-first century, p. 337-338)
Even this scenario is optimistic, … —before the next world war.67

America will cling to a false unipolar reality post-transition
Calleo 9 – David P. Calleo (University Professor at The Johns Hopkins University and Dean Acheson Professor at its Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)) 2009 “Follies of Power: America’s Unipolar Fantasy” p. 4-5
