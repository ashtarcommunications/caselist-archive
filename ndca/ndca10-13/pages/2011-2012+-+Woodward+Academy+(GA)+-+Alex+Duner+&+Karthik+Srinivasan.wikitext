==James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Affirmative== 
===1AC—Chattahoochee=== 
====1AC—Inherency==== 
**The Webb is on the chopping block – new funding is key to get it off the ground**
**__Leone, 8/27/11__** – Space News Staff Writer [August 27, 2011, Dan Leone, “NASA: James Webb Space Telescope to Now Cost $8.7 Billion,” [[http://www.space.com/12759-james-webb-space-telescope-nasa-cost-increase.html]]]
//WASHINGTON — NASA has confirmed a new cost estimate for its James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that a key congressional appropriator and critic cited in July in proposing to terminate the flagship-class astronomy mission…That means the effect of JWST overruns on other NASA science programs — and possibly on programs outside the Science Mission Directorate — will not be unveiled until February, when the White House, per tradition, submits its annual budget request to Congress.//

**And even if the Webb won’t be cut in Congress maintaining a flat budget will kill the project**
**__Smith, 11__** [Marcia Smith is President of the Space and Technology Policy Group, LLC, which specializes in news, information and analysis of civil, military and commercial space programs and other technology areas. “James Webb Space Telescope Needs More Money to Meet New 2018 Launch Date,” April 27, 2011, [[http://spacepolicyonline.com/pages/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1539:james-webb-space-telescope-needs-more-money-to-meet-new-2018-launch-date&catid=67:news&Itemid=27]]]
//The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will launch in 2018 only if NASA receives more funding for the program than the flat budget assumed in the President's FY2012 budget request according to an agency official…She has been an ardent advocate for JWST, but her displeasure at the new cost overruns that emerged last year was made clear when she demanded the independent review that led to the current replanning effort (the "Casani report," after its chair, John Casani).//

====1AC—Plan==== 
**Thus the plan:**
**The United States federal government should fully fund the James Webb Space Telescope.**
**We’ll Clarify.**

====1AC—Astronomy==== 
**The Webb will unlock a universe of scientific discoveries about dark matter, the formation of galaxies, and exoplanets**
**__Pachal, 7/8/11__** – PCMag's News Director and has been covering consumer technology in print and online for more than a decade, holds degrees in journalism and engineering [July 8, 2011, Peter Pachal, PCMag, “What We Could Lose if the James Webb Telescope Is Killed,” [[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388293,00.asp]]]
//NASA's James Webb telescope, the successor to the Hubble, is on the chopping block…"The discovery space is huge for this observatory."//

**Specifically, the Webb is key to future research on exoplanets**
**__Coulter, 10__** [Dauna Coulter is a Science Writer at Schafer Corporation for NASA, Senior Technical Writer at ADTRAN Senior Technical Writer at Lockheed Martin Technical Editor/Writer at Teledyne Brown Engineering. “Alien Planet Safari”, January 14th, 2010, [[http://nasascience.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/14jan_planetsafari/]]]
//The premiere observatory of the next decade, the James Webb Space Telescope, will launch in 2014 in search of "big game"--namely, the first stars and galaxies ever formed in our Universe…Transit science is changing so fast, it's hard to say exactly what wonders Webb's hunt will turn up//

**And that sparks a new era of space colonization – the Webb is key**
**__Harrold, 8__** – staff writer for the Gazette [July 18, 2008, Max Harrold, The Gazette, “Earth's twin coming into view; Scientists believe habitable planet will be spotted soon,” Lexis]
//With less fanfare than H.G. Wells's science fiction, but no less of the sweep, scientists in Montreal this week are conjuring new Earths…"Even the Vatican's astronomer has said it's okay to look."//

**Every delay in space colonization risks a hundred trillion lives per second**
**__Bostrum, 2__** – Department of Philosophy, Yale University, Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University [Nick, “Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development,” Preprint, Utilitas Vol. 15, No. 3, pp. 308-314, [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html]]]
//As I write these words, suns are illuminating and heating empty rooms, unused energy is being flushed down black holes, and our great common endowment of negentropy is being irreversibly degraded into entropy on a cosmic scale…Even with the most conservative estimate, assuming a biological implementation of all persons, the potential for one hundred trillion potential human beings is lost for every second of postponement of colonization of our supercluster.[6]//

**Colonization is key to prevent extinction**
**__Garan, 10__** – astronaut [Ron, 3/30/10, Speech published in an article by Nancy Atkinson, “The Importance of Returning to the Moon,” [[http://www.universetoday.com/61256/astronaut-explains-why-we-should-return-to-the-moon/]]]
//Resources and Other Benefits: Since we live in a world of finite resources and the global population continues to grow, at some point the human race must utilize resources from space in order to survive…The first step is a sustainable permanent human lunar settlement.//

**Independently, cancelling the Webb will undermine all future US astronomy projects**
**__The Washington Post, 7/29__**/11 [July 29, 2011, The Washington Post, “NASA budget is seeing stars,” http://www.aura-astronomy.org/news/2011/NASA%20budget%20is%20seeing%20stars%20-%20The%20Washington%20Post.pdf]
//THE LAST SHUTTLE has landed. Soon, without space shuttles to perform repairs, the Hubble Space Telescope will break down and plummet into the ocean…But to jettison it now, when so much depends on it and we have nothing to take its place, would be shortsighted — as shortsighted as we will be without it.//

**Astronomical discoveries can spur national interest in STEM – that’s key to long term growth and competitiveness**
**__Elmegreen, 11__** – President of the American Astronomical Society and is the Maria Mitchell Professor of Astronomy and Department Chair in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Vassar [March 11, 2011, Dr. Debra Elmegreen, “Testimony of Dr. Debra M. Elmegreen President of the American Astronomical Society Before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies On Astronomy and Astrophysics in the FY 2012 Budget,” [[http://blog.aas.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/AAS-Testimony-to-Congress.pdf]]]
//The excitement of scientific discovery is a powerful force among our Nation’s youth, and leads directly to an improved standard of living in our Nation by attracting talented young people to pursue STEM careers…The public science literacy rate is less than 30%, and the US must improve to remain competitive. Astronomy offers one way to help because it is a mind-opening field that engages the public and schoolchildren in science; 60 million people go to museums and planetariums every year, 15% of all future K-12 teachers take astronomy as their only college science course, and 250,000 college students are enrolled in astronomy courses annually.//

**STEM education is the key internal link to the US economy**
**__The Hill, 11__** [Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), “U.S. Economic Future Needs STEM Education”, April 1th, 2011, [[http://opportunityequation.org/news-press/us-economic-future-needs-stem]]]
//The United States has begun to lose its status as a scientific and technological leader, and the only way we can hope to compete in the 21st century global economy is if we invest in research and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education…The NAEP revealed that, on a zero to 300 scale, Black fourth-graders and eighth-graders scored an average of 36 points lower than their White counterparts and Black 12th-graders scored an average of 34 points lower than their White counterparts.//

**Economic decline causes war—multiple reasons**
**__Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the DoD, 10__** — Jedidiah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, M.Phil. Candidate at the University of New South Wales, 2010 (“Economic Integration, Economic Signalling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” //Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives//, Edited by Ben Goldsmith and Jurgen Brauer, Published by Emerald Group Publishing, ISBN 0857240048, p. 213-215)
//Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict…As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.//

====1AC—Science Diplomacy==== 
**Science is emerging as an integral part of our foreign policy – it’s the underpinning of all diplomacy**
**__Campbell, 10__** – president and CEO of CRDF Global, an independent nonprofit organization that promotes international scientific and technical collaboration [October 27, 2010, Cathy Campbell, “Send in the Scientists,” Science Progress, [[http://www.scienceprogress.org/2010/10/send_scientists/]]]
//Scientists as diplomats? Beyond longstanding cross-border, science-specific collaboration, the role of individual scientists representing the United States abroad would not immediately jump out as the best use of U.S. government resources of U.S. universities’ faculty members…Furthermore, as we have seen all around the world, when science and technology flourishes, so do economies.//

**And, cancelling the James Webb will undermine current and future cooperation**
**__Borowiz, Research Analyst at the Space Foundation, 11__** – the Space Foundation has become one of the world's premier nonprofit organizations supporting space activities [July, 2011, Mariel John Borowitz, “The James Webb Space Telescope A Worthy Investment in Space Science,” [[http://www.aura-astronomy.org/news/2011/James_Webb_Space_Telescope_-_A_Worthy_Investment.pdf]]]
//JWST is being developed in international partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency. Unilaterally canceling this program, especially so close to completion, will significantly undermine our relationships with key allies on both sides of the Atlantic….Unilaterally canceling JWST would send a disheartening message to existing and potential partners and allies, and damage to U.S. credibility would likely make future joint endeavors much more problematic.//

**It’s try or die – extinction is inevitable without science-based, multilateral cooperation.**
**__Sackett, 10__** – former Chief Scientist for Australia, former Program Director at the NSF, PhD in theoretical physics, the Director of the Australian National University (ANU) Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics and Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories (2002 – 07) [August 10, 2010, Penny Sackett, “Science diplomacy: Collaboration for solutions,” published in the Forum for Australian-European Science and Technology cooperation magazine, http://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/2010/08/science-diplomacy-collaboration-for-solutions/]
//Imagine for a moment that the globe is inhabited by a single individual who roams free across outback plains, through rainforests, across pure white beaches — living off the resources available…The keys then are forging links at the ground level and providing clear and consistent bi-national and multi-national policy and funding frameworks to sustain these links.//

**And science diplomacy prevents all their impacts from escalating**
**__The Royal Society, 10__** – a Fellowship of more than 1400 outstanding individuals from all areas of science, mathematics, engineering and medicine, who form a global scientific network of the highest calibre. The Fellowship is supported by over 130 permanent staff with responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Society and its activities. [January, 2010, “New frontiers in science diplomacy”]
//Cooperation on the scientific aspects of sensitive issues may sometimes be the only way to initiate a wider political dialogue…encouraging independent scientific bodies to provide science policy briefings for foreign ministry and embassy staff.//

**Specifically, current US science cooperation with Europe solves disease spread, climate change, and ocean degridation.**
**__Leshner and Turekian, 9__** – *the chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and executive publisher of the journal Science AND the chief international officer at AAAS and director of its Center for Science Diplomacy [February 2009, Alan I. Leshner and Vaughan Turekian, Editorial, “Europe and the United States: A Crucial Moment for Science Cooperation,” http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/downloads/jrc_newsletter_2009_02.pdf]
//Today, however, a new moment of challenge and opportunity awaits the transatlantic alliance…As we prepare for the tests ahead, history reminds us that a strong commitment to the Euro ­U.S. partnership will give us a foundation for work that will help solve many of the world’s most pressing problems and improve life for our children, our grand­ children, and billions of people on every continent.//

**And disease spread causes extinction**
**__Yu, 9__** [Victoria Yu, Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science, “Human Extinction: The Uncertainty of Our Fate,” May 22, 2009, http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2009/human-extinction-the-uncertainty-of-our-fate]
//A pandemic will kill off all humans. In the past, humans have indeed fallen victim to viruses…Perhaps even more frightening is the fact that only 25 mutations were required to convert the original viral strain — which could only infect birds — into a human-viable strain (10).//

**And climate change causes extinction**
**__Sify, 10__** – Sydney newspaper citing Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, professor at University of Queensland and Director of the Global Change Institute, and John Bruno, associate professor of Marine Science at UNC [Sify News, “Could unbridled climate changes lead to human extinction?” http://www.sify.com/news/could-unbridled-climate-changes-lead-to-human-extinction-news-international-kgtrOhdaahc.html]
//The findings of the comprehensive report: 'The impact of climate change on the world's marine ecosystems' emerged from a synthesis of recent research on the world's oceans, carried out by two of the world's leading marine scientists…These findings were published in Science.//

**And warming is real and anthropogenic – prefer scientific concensus over fringe theories**
__**Alley, 10**__ – Professor of Geoscience at Penn State, authored over 200 refereed scientific papers, which are "highly cited" according to a prominent indexing service, erved with distinguished national and international teams on major scientific assessment bodies [Richard, 11-17-2010, “Climate Change Science; Committee: House Science and Technology; Subcommittee: Energy and Environment,” CQ Congressional Testimony, Lexis]
//Background on Climate Change and Global Warming. Scientific assessments such as those of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (e.g., National Research Council, 1975; 1979; 2001; 2006; 2008; 2010a; 2010b), the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have for decades consistently found with increasingly high scientific confidence that human activities are raising the concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, that this has a warming effect on the climate, that the climate is warming as expected, and that the changes so far are small compared to those projected if humans burn much of the fossil fuel on the planet…Also see the assessment of the long climatic history of the Arctic by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP, 2009), showing that in the past warming has led to shrinkage of Arctic ice including sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet, and that sufficiently large warming has removed them entirely.//

**Warming is an existential threat**
__**Mazo 10**__ – PhD in Paleoclimatology from UCLA [Jeffrey Mazo, Managing Editor, Survival and Research Fellow for Environmental Security and Science Policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, 3-2010, “Climate Conflict: How global warming threatens security and what to do about it,” pg. 122]
//The best estimates for global warming to the end of the century range from 2.5-4.~C above pre-industrial levels, depending on the scenario…What is certain is that there is no precedent in human experience for such rapid change or such climatic conditions, and even in the best case adaptation to these extremes would mean profound social, cultural and political changes.//

**Independently, science cooperation is the underpinning of all EU-US cooperation**
**__Potočnik, European Commissioner for Science and Research, 6__** [March 7, 2006, Janez Potočnik, “Between cooperation and Competition - Science and Research as a Transatlantic Bridge Builder,” The American European Community Association Round-table Luncheon in Brussels]
//The EU and the United States have a unique relationship as international partners…I intend use the opportunity of a visit to the United States before the summer - my first visit there in my present capacity - to make progress in this direction.//

**A strong relationship with Europe is key to solve every major problem**
**__Daalder and Goldgeier, 2__** – *Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, served on the National Security Council during President Clinton's first term AND the Whitney Shepardson senior fellow for transatlantic relations at the CFR, was previously the Henry A. Kissinger scholar in foreign policy and international relations at the Library of Congress, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, received his PhD from UC Berkeley [Spring 2002, Ivo H. Daalder and James M. Goldgeier, “Putting Europe First,” //Survival//, [[http://nato.gov.si/slo/novinarsko-sredisce/clanki/putting-europe-first/]]]
//The Bush administration enters office at a time when flash-points around the globe - from the Middle East to Colombia and from the Persian Gulf to the Taiwan Straits - threaten to explode…Such a Europe requires that the new administration continue where the Clinton administration left off, which is by pursuing a strategy towards the region that puts Europe - not NATO or Russia - first.//

**A weak alliance will spur great power war**
**__O’Sullivan, 4__** – vice president of the Mission Critical Networks business area, which includes all FAA programs, as well as the Alaska Flight Services Modernization and OASIS programs [March 31, 2004, John O'Sullivan, “Europe and the Establishment,” The National Interest, [[http://nationalinterest.org/article/europe-and-the-establishment-2608]]]
//The report's starting point -- that U.S.-European relations are extremely important -- is undeniable…By contrast, a disunited West would tempt such powers to play off Europe and America against each other and foster a global jockeying for power not unlike the maneuvering between a half-dozen great powers that led to 1914.//
