The other two, both on NATO’s southern flank (Italy and Turkey) – that together possess today 2 out of 3 US nuclear weapons based in Europe – are involved in the nuclear burden sharing of NATO by hosting US airplanes and the nuclear warheads assigned to them. </span>

Dramatic changes have taken place in the international security environment over the last decade……. Nevertheless, the official view is diametrically opposed to their withdrawal. Below is an account of why this is the case.

In recent months there were news reports on possible attacks on the Incirlik Air Base by Iran’s Sahab-3 missiles, and newspapers ran a story on plans by Al-Quaeda to attack the base…… The NATO-Russia Council brings the countries together as equal partners and gives the opportunity to identify and pursue joint actions. 



<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Terrorists haven’t acquired nuclear weapons yet, but they have the will to steal and use them. </span>

<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">However, these should not be seen as insurmountable difficulties provided that the US also starts seriously drawing down its own nuclear arsenal; it also must put off the projects in the pipeline for developing new, ever more sophisticated nuclear weapons that were to assure its nuclear supremacy in the decades to come………. If the family of sovereign nations is lucky, there may be enough time to implement a number of sober-minded steps that will get rid of the existing nuclear weapons, wherever they may be deployed or stockpiled. </span>

What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? …… When nuclear pollution infects the whole planet, we will all be losers. 
Removing the TNWs from Turkey would restore regional security and remove the terrorist threat.

<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Apparently, the dangers are now perceived to come from the Middle East…. Sending these nuclear weapons back to the US and moving NATO towards peace-keeping rather than war-making would take us all on a path of peace and true security </span>
