US primacy solves 6 scenarios for war – also proves only US dominance solves escalation
Brzezinski 12 ~~[Zbignbiew Brzezinski, national security advisor under U.S. President Jimmy Carter, January/February 2012, "8 Geopolitically Endangered Species", Foreign Policy, [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/01/03/8_geopolitically_endangered_species?page=full-http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/01/03/8_geopolitically_endangered_species?page=full]], Moorhead~~]

With the decline of America~’s global preeminence, weaker countries will be more susceptible to
AND
extremism; a worldwide energy crisis; vulnerability of America~’s Persian Gulf allies.


The first scenario is Russian Expansionism:

US gets pulled in to a NATO-Russian war and that causes extinction
**Yesin 2007**(Colonel General Vladimir Senior Vice President of the Russian Academy of the Problems of Security, Defense, and Law. "WILL AMERICA FIGHT RUSSIA?;". Defense and Security, No 78. July, Lexis)

Yesin: Should the Russian-American war begin, it will inevitably deteriorate into the Third World War. The United States is a NATO member and this bloc believes in collective security. In fact, collective security is what it is about. Vladimirov: This war will inevitably deteriorate into a nuclear conflict. Regardless of what weapons will be used in the first phase.


German vulnerabilities in the face of Russian aggression alone trigger nuclear war
**Mearsheimer 01**, Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago (John, "The Future of the American Pacifier", Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct, p 46)

FIVE EUROPEAN STATES now have sufficient wealth and population to qualify as potential great powers
AND
would perceive these actions as hostile and respond with measures of its own.

Ukraine War also causes extinction
Oliker et al 02 – Senior International Policy Analysts for the RAND Corporation (Olga and Tanya Charlick-Paley, "Assessing Russia~’s Decline," September, (http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/2007/MR1442.pdf)
The preceding chapters have illustrated the ways in which Russia~’s decline affects that country and
AND
rogue states and nonstate terrorist actors, increasing the risk of nuclear war.

We don~’t even need to win an expansionism internal link to get the impact, US-Russian war alone causes extinction
**Bostrom 2** (Nick Bostrom, Gannon Award Winner, Professor of philosophy at Oxford University, 2002, [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html-http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html]])

A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in
AND
preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.


Second is war over Taiwan:

Goes nuclear and causes extinction
Glaser, Professor of Political Science and International Affairs – George Washington University, ~’11
(Charles, "Will China~’s Rise Lead to War?" Foreign Affairs Vol. 9 Iss. 2, March/April)
THE PROSPECTS for avoiding intense military competition and war may be good, but growth
AND
military efforts and a general poisoning of U.S.-Chinese relations.


Third is Korean war:

It causes extinction
Peter **Hayes**, prof at Victoria University, **and** Michael **Green**, Executive Director of the Nautilus Institute, 1-5-**2010**, "The Path Not Taken, the Way Still Open: Denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia", http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/10001HayesHamalGreen.pdf
The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments
AND
threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community.


Fourth is indo-pak war:

Even without intervention, a war between these two powers alone causes extinction
**Robock 11** – Distinguished Professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers, PhD from MIT (5/19/2011, Alan, "Nuclear winter is a real and present danger", Nature, Vol. 473, http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/NatureNuclearWinterComment.pdf) MGM

In the 1980s, discussion and debate about the possibility of a ~’nuclear winter~’
AND
support further reductions in arms. The New START treaty is not enough.



Fifth is Central Asian Instability:

It spills over to nuclear war
Ahrari, 01 (M. Ehsan, Professor of National Security and Strategy of the Joint and Combined Warfighting School at the Armed Forces Staff College, "Jihadi Groups, Nuclear Pakistan and the New Great Game," August, Questia)

South and Central Asia constitute a part of the world where a well-designed
AND
partners for the United States, thus representing a gain for all concerned.


Sixth is Israel-Palestine war:

It causes extinction
Kamal **Nawash** <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(immigration lawyer and legal director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee) 20</span>**09**<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> " Israel/Palestine Conflict May Lead to Nuclear War" [[http://www.freemuslims.org/news.php?id=4240-http://www.freemuslims.org/news.php?id=4240]]</span>
Surprise, surprise, once again the Palestinian/Israeli conflict spirals out of control
AND
to end the conflict? The answer is YES but time is running out


Luckily, high-speed rail solves
**Dutzik et al. 10** — Tony Dutzik, Senior Policy Analyst with Frontier Group specializing in energy, transportation, and climate policy, holds an M.A. in print journalism from Boston University and a B.S. in public service from Penn State University, et al., with Siena Kaplan, Analyst with Frontier Group, and Phineas Baxandall, Federal Tax and Budget Policy Analyst with U.S. PIRG, holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a B.A. in Economics from the College of Social Studies at Wesleyan University, 2010 ("Why Intercity Passenger Rail?," The Right Track: Building a 21st Century High-Speed Rail System for America, Published by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, Available Online at http://americanhsra.org/whitepapers/uspirg.pdf, Accessed 06-10-2012, p. 11-13)
Building a modern passenger rail network will be a boost to America~’s economy. Besides
AND
rail needs to be a central focus of this new wave of investment.


Finally, the U.S. will always try to maintain hegemony—it is only a question of success.
Ferguson 9<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Niall, American Interest, http://www.the-american-interest.com/ai2/article.cfm?Id=335%26MId=16)</span>
So much for the American predicament. What of Posen~’s alternative grand strategy based on
AND
to restart mainstream debate on American grand strategy, that is pretty rich.


===Economy=== 

Contention two is the economy

First, growth solves environmental collapse and conflict
**Silk 93** — Leonard Silk, Distinguished Professor of Economics at Pace University, Senior Research Fellow at the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and former Economics Columnist with the New York Times, 1993 ("Dangers of Slow Growth," Foreign Affairs, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Lexis-Nexis)
Like the Great Depression, the current economic slump has fanned the firs of nationalist
AND
, a healthier environment, and more liberal and open economies and societies.


And, economic decline increases the risk of war—diversionary conflict theory and strong statistical support
**Royal 10** — Jedidiah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, M.Phil. Candidate at the University of New South Wales, 2010 ("Economic Integration, Economic Signalling and the Problem of Economic Crises," Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Edited by Ben Goldsmith and Jurgen Brauer, Published by Emerald Group Publishing, ISBN 0857240048, p. 213-215)
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.


Your dedev arguments are wrong – econ collapse doesn~’t spur a mindset shift and only growth solves the transition to green technologies
**Tierney 9** – (John Tierney, Science Columnist for the New York Times, April 21, 2009, "Use Energy, Get Rich and Save the Planet," online: [[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/science/earth/21tier.html?_r=1%26pagewanted=print-http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/science/earth/21tier.html?_r=1%26pagewanted=print]])

Two internal links:

First is short term,


Infrastructure stimulus is super effective:

Highest multiplier effect
**New America Foundation 10** — New America Foundation—"a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy institute that invests in new thinkers and new ideas to address the next generation of challenges facing the United States," 2010 ("The Case for an Infrastructure-Led Jobs and Growth Strategy," February 23^^rd^^, Available Online at http://www.newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_case_for_an_infrastructure_led_jobs_and_growth_strategy, Accessed 06-09-2012)
As the Senate takes up a greatly scaled down %2415 billion jobs bill stripped

Investing in infrastructure creates jobs and yields lasting benefits for the economy, including increasing

This implies a total of more than 3 million jobs created or saved.


Short term inflation solves risk aversion

The problem is extreme risk aversion. And it~’s being enabled by low inflation.¶
AND
with moderate inflation being less painful than a Japanese-style deflationary spiral.

It also solves the deficit
**Mirhaydari 10** — Anthony Mirhaydari, investment columnist at MSN Money, former senior research analyst at Markman Capital Insight—an investment advisory and money management firm, 2010 ("Why Inflation Would Be Good For Us," MSN Money, April 13^^th^^, Available Online at http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/MutualFunds/why-inflation-would-be-good-for-us.aspx, Accessed 09-08-2011)
Inflation would<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span>act as a stealthy fiscal reform. Though tax revenues are affected only slightly by inflation, two-thirds of government expenditures are affected more<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That~’s why </span>the real cost of government spending would wilt away in a high-inflation environment<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Broda estimates that </span>a run of 5% inflation would reduce the deficit by an additional 1% of GDP per year<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>


Even if their economic theory is true generally, Econ is collapsing because of lack of demand – only inflation can solve
**Baker 10** — Dean Baker, Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, 2010 ("Why printing money makes sense," Guardian, October 12th, Available Online at http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/11/useconomy-usemployment, Accessed 09-08-2011)
Obviously, we have to teach some elementary economics to the geniuses who design economic
AND
needs. The list of necessary tasks is long and well-known.


Right wing think tanks are more biased than Bob Marley talking about drug laws
**Abrams 7** — Paul Abrams, B.A. in Political Science and Economics, J.D., and M.D. from Yale University, Biotechnology Consultant, has published more than 35 peer-reviewed articles, Board Member of the Washington Progress Alliance, the Women~’s Bioethics Project, the Apollo Alliance, and the Economic Opportunity Institute, has testified before Congress, 2007 ("Belief Tank=Think Tank Without the Doubt," The Huffington Post, January 30^^th^^, Available Online at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-abrams/belief-tankthink-tank-wit_b_40036.html, Accessed 04-27-2010)
Gary Trudeau~’s Sunday Doonesbury has, once again, crystallized a social phenomenon into a

Our indictment of conservative think tanks does not apply to evidence from "liberal" leaning think tanks—there~’s no comparison.

Tevelow, Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Communication at the University of Pittsburgh, 2005 ("From Corporate Liberalism To Neoliberalism: A History Of American Think Tanks," Thesis Submitted to the Graduate Faculty of Arts and Sciences in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Available Online at http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-08192005-162045/unrestricted/FinalTevelowETD.pdf, Accessed 04-25-2010, p. 266-267)
In addition, at the purely rhetorical level, liberal foundations are not "liberal

Other forms of stimulus don~’t solve - Manufacturing jobs are key to recovery because of innovation spillover.
**Freeman and Lind 12** — Michael Lind, Policy Director of the Economic Growth Program at the New America Foundation, and Joshua Freeman, Program Associate in the Economic Growth Program at the New America Foundation, 2012 ("Value Added: America~’s Manufacturing Future," New America Foundation, April 18^^th^^, Available Online at http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/value_added_americas_manufacturing_future, Accessed 06-26-2012)
Manufacturing matters. That is the rapidly emerging consensus in the United States, after

**Martin Prosperity Institute 10** — Martin Prosperity Institute—think tank affiliated with the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, 2010 ("High speed, high costs, hidden benefits: a broader perspective on high-speed rail," February 23^^rd^^, Available Online at http://martinprosperity.org/2010/02/23/907/, Accessed 06-10-2012)
Opponents of high-speed rail have a common thread in their reasoning. Trains
AND
right characteristics to help facilitate another wave of productivity-driven economic growth.

And, thriving mega-regions facilitate concentration and clustering—this "spatial fix" is crucial to sustainable economic recovery.
**Florida 10** — Richard Florida, Senior Editor at The Atlantic, Director of the Martin Prosperity Institute and Professor of Business and Creativity at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, previously held professorships at George Mason University and Carnegie Mellon University and taught as a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT, holds a Ph.D. from Columbia University, 2010 ("The Roadmap to a High-Speed Recovery," The New Republic, August 12^^th^^, Available Online at http://www.tnr.com/print/article/economy/76961/richard-florida-reset-recovery-economy-future, Accessed 06-10-2012)
Instead of further encouraging the growth of an auto-housing-suburban complex,
AND
their parts; they not only produce but consume, spurring further demand.



===Warming=== 

Contention three is warming:

Warming is anthropogenic and THE ONLY existential risk
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Warrants: sci consensus, disease, ice caps, shorter winters, sea temp, NASA measurent, runaway</span>
**Deibel 7** (Terry L, Professor of IR @ National War College, "Foreign Affairs Strategy: Logic for American Statecraft", Conclusion: American Foreign Affairs Strategy Today)

Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as
AND
States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.

Consensus is not even a question – reject their non-scientific paid off evidence

===Warming=== 

Contention two is warming:

Warming is anthropogenic and THE ONLY existential risk

**Deibel 7** (Terry L, Professor of IR @ National War College, "Foreign Affairs Strategy: Logic for American Statecraft", Conclusion: American Foreign Affairs Strategy Today)

Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as

Consensus is not even a question – reject their non-scientific paid off evidence

Certainty in science¶ If you ask a scientist whether something is "settled"

U.S. automobiles and light trucks are responsible for nearly half of all

One of the best new ideas in transportation is a mode that~’s been around for

and service requests across the lines, speeding repairs before they impact operations.


HSR construction doesn~’t increase warming
**Jehanno et al 11** (engineering leader of urban transportation at Systra, " High Speed Rail and Sustainability", International Union of railways report, November 2011, [[http://uic.org/IMG/pdf/hsr_sustainability_main_study_final.pdf-http://uic.org/IMG/pdf/hsr_sustainability_main_study_final.pdf]]")

Another objection to HSR is that the track construction is linked with a high emission

CO2 /pkm) is in the same order of magnitude as HSR.



===Plan=== 

Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase investment in a national network of inter-city high-speed passenger rail.

Trains are often a preferred mode of travel, especially for distances between 100 and 500 miles. A<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 2009 </span>survey found that if fare and travel time were equal, 54 percent of Americans would prefer to travel to cities in their region by high-speed rail, with only 33 percent preferring car travel and 13 preferring air travel. Of Americans who had actually ridden high-speed rail, an overwhelming 82 percent preferred it to air travel<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.29</span>
