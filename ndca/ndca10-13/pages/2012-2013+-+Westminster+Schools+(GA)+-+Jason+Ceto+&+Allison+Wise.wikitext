===1AC ECONOMY:=== 

**Contention one is growth –**

**Specifically the NIB solves through 4 internal links-**

**First is __stimulus__ -** **confidence is collapsing now and destroying investment --- a national infrastructure bank is the __best short term stimulus__ that __doesn’t drive up the deficit__**

**//<span style="font-size: 10pt;">But could a National Investment Bank…</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="font-size: 10pt;">long-term investors.</span>//**

**//<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Analysis of all stimulus…furthers economic growth,</span>//**
