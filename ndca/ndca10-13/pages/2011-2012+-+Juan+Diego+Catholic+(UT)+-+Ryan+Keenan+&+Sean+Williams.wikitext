====Kappeler PIC==== 

**Text: Ryan and think we should _ (take USFG out of advocacy statement)**

**Political violence is sustained by organized thinking that looks at violence through meta-analysis. We need to have deeper insight that realizes that each of us are culpable for violence. This is integral to ending the cycle of violence.**

Moreover, personal behaviour is no … not acting or doing nothing.

====Zizek PIC==== 

**Text: Ryan and think we should _ (take USFG out of advocacy statement)**

**Ideological transgression is a continuation of the existing order—the power of the protest structurally depends upon the continued authority of the system. The critique functions as a carnivalesque reversal of authority—we make a gesture of non-compliance that posits us as the “real” masters of fate.**
**Zizek 95** (Slavoj, International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, president of the Society for Theoretical Psychoanalysis, LAW AND THE POSTMODERN MIND: SUPEREGO BY DEFAULT, Cardozo Law Review, 1995, 16 Cardozo L. Rev. 925

**-funding and completing a comprehensive resource assessment of OTEC potential in the US,**

Unlike most renewable energy options… means for mitigating global warming.

==Kritiks== 
===Buddhism Kritik=== 

**Suffering and conflict are not external obstacles but internal blockages – we fight an enemy we imagined ourselves, causing more conflicts. The alt is zero sum with plan action, focusing on removing troops trades off with our ability to disarm ourselves from violence and find true peace.**
**Khema, 94**
(Ayya, 1994, Buddhist monk, “All of us beset by Birth, Decay, and Death.” Buddhism Today, http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/003-allofus-5.htm

Cosmopolitans assert the existence of ... awareness of our fundamental interconnection.

===Cosmic Enchantment Kritik=== 

**The quest to know the mystic is the most visible example of human ego-centrism, it will inevitably lead to our destruction**
**Beckman, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Harvey Mudd, 2000**
[Tad, Harvey Mudd College, Martin Heidegger and Environnmental Ethics, page @ http://www2.hmc.edu/~tbeckman/personal/HEIDART.HTML]

The threat of nuclear annihilation … need to fabricate convincing arguments?

**The alternative is to view space through a lens of co-habitation rather than competition, spills over to thinking on earth**
**Elizabeth Lockard 08**

Symbiocracy, a proposed concept for … for living in the cosmos.

===DeLanda Kritik=== 

**Our advocacy agrees with everything except their appeal to a universal capitalist system that we are trapped as cogs– their totalizing kritik makes objective analysis of economic power impossible**
**Manuel DeLanda, 1997**
Adjunct Associate Professor – Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation – Columbia University, A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History, p. 46-8

Even in this age of ... of commercial and industrial institutions.63

**Ethical judgments about capitalism in the abstract should be avoided – its complete abandonment is neither possible nor desirable – an insistence on meshwork alternatives will result in worse forms of oppression**
**Manuel DeLanda, 1997**
Adjunct Associate Professor – Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation – Columbia University, A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History, p. 66-70

Thus, much as sedimentary rocks … humanity, and all their mixtures.

**Our alternative is to reject their representation of homogenous capitalist system in which we are all cogs – Our discursive rejection is key to a new hope in transforming economic institutions**
**Manuel DeLanda, 1997**
Adjunct Associate Professor – Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation – Columbia University, A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History, p. 266-274

===Ehrenfeld Kritik=== 

**The aff’s worship of a technological solution to the world’s problems creates a view of humanity as useless and incomplete and makes their solution inevitably fail**
**Ehrenfeld, 81**
(David, professor of biology at Rutgers University, studied at Harvard, Ph.D in Zoology from University of Florida, known author, The Arrogance of Humanism, Ch. 3 Pg. 84-86) Idriss

===Fear Kritik=== 

**The affirmative is a product of a death drive that will kill us all because of its will to sustain life.**
**ZUPANCIC IN 2003**
[Alenka; Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy, Slovene Academy of Sciences, Ljubljana; The Shortest Shadow: Nietzsche’s Philosophy of the Two; Cambridge: The MIT Press; 2003; p. 63-65; 47-49]

The core of the ascetic ... concludes in our not willing.

**Our alternative is an ethic of joy. Embracing the joy of the present without linking it to a better world of the future has massive life affirming potential. We embrace the current world, the status quo, for all its faults, to find the joy in it, DO NOT link this joy of the present to a solution for the future.**
**MASSUMI AND ZOURNAZI IN 2002**
[Brian Massumi is Associate Professor of Communications at the Université de Montréal; Mary Zournazi is a Philosopher and Ph.D in Cultural Theory; Hope: New Philosophies for Change; New York: Routledge; 2002; p. 241-242]

Yes, and there is a ... or for more to life.

===Heidegger Kritik=== 

**The aff’s uncritical use of technology separates us from the Earth and produces the ability to destroy the planet, causing extinction. Their use of technology to save us will just reproduce violence and destruction in worse forms. Reflection about technology is the only alternative**
**McWhorter, 09**
Ladelle, Holds the James Thomas Chair in the Department of Philosophy and is jointly appointed a professor In the Department of Women’s, Gender, and Sexualities Studies at the University of Richmond (“Guilt as Management Technology: A Call to Heideggerian Reflection,” Heidegger and The Earth: Essays in Environmental Philosophy, Second Edition, ed. Ladelle McWhorter and Gail Stenstad, University of Toronto Press, pp.5-8)Red

Heidegger often refers in his … problems, what should we do?

===Methodology Kritik=== 

**The affirmative makes decisions in the way that they research, and their decision to not experience and collaborate with those whom have experienced space policy, because that is what their aff prescribed to do- their privilege as scholars provides them with the necessity of collaborating with and providing an opportunity for the voiceless to present their voices in your research on their own terms and in their own words- Lack of this kind of research ignores your responsibility- This reenacts forms of domination and colonization on those you claim to speak for and help.**
**Kirsch, 1997**
(Gesa, Prof. of , “Multi-vocal Texts and Interpretive Responsibility”, College English, Vol. 59, No. 2 (Feb., 1997), pp. 191-202, jstor.org)

At the same time, however, we need …. with our new interpretive responsibilities.

**Epistemological considerations precede politics—it is the most authentic way to understand oppression to create effective responses to exploitation. Rejecting epistemology results in macro-socioengineering, which makes all impacts inevitable. Our alternative of learning through first hand, corporeal experiential suffering solves the methodological problems that the 1ac presents**
**RAJAN ‘92**
(Roby, The Discourse of Exploitation and the Exploitation of Discourse.)

How then are human beings to be …. call for and are in turn responsive to change in the larger society.

**And our Alternative is the rejection of the exclusive use of the laboratory type research that the 1ac has engaged in- This promotes research that would actually include excluded voices on the peripher of space policy in the context of debate- This is not a link of omission because you chose second hand research, which we criticize**
**MITCHELL 1998**
[Gordon R. Mitchell, Associate Professor, University of Pittsburgh, “PEDAGOGICAL POSSIBILITIES FOR ARGUMENTATIVE AGENCY IN ACADEMIC DEBATE”, Argumentation & Advocacy, 1998, Vol. 35 Issue 2, p41-60]

====Decentralization Kritik==== 

**The affirmatives acceptance of centralization prevents social movements by discouraging individual action—the result is extinction**
**Papworth 01**
(John, Senior Editor @ Ecologist + Founder of Fourth World Review, Peace Through Social Empowerment, "Primary Causes," http://www.williamfranklin.com/4thworld/academicinn/jp14.html)

It is simply this; that … to any genuine social progress.

**Voting negative challenges the inevitability of centralization and opens up local communities for action**
**Papworth 01**
(John, Senior Editor @ Ecologist + Founder of Fourth World Review, Peace Through Social Empowerment, "Primary Causes," http://www.williamfranklin.com/4thworld/academicinn/jp14.html)

Supposing then our reform movements … under one Brussels-dominated Government.

====Lack K==== 

**The basic thesis of Lacanian psychoanalysis is that the subject is constituted by a fundamental lack. Unlike Freud’s conception of the ego, Lacan conceived of the subject not in terms of an essential identity but as based on an impossible gap or lack. Regardless of whether this theory of the individual subject is correct or not, basing politics on this psychoanalytic vocabulary has dangerous consequences—psychoanalytic politics paralyzes radical social resistance**
**Robinson, Prof Pol @ U Nottingham, 2005**
(Andrew, “The Political Theory of Constitutive Lack: A Critique”, Theory & Event, 8:1)

Amongst a plethora of radical … parameters of this new theoretical paradigm2.

**And, Lacanian psychoanalysis relies on a conception of the unconscious and the subject that is fixed and unchanging, one that is removed from its social context—this ahistorical conception of the subject makes social resistance impossible**
**Butler, Prof Rhetoric & Comp Lit @ UC-Berkeley, 2000**
(Judith, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, ed Butler, Laclau, Zizek, p 12-13)

I have indicated to both … by anomalous or subversive practices.

**Psychopolitics negates the possibility of compassion and reaffirms the oppression they try to resist—their form of politics based on psychoanalysis can be used to justify any atrocity**
**Robinson, Prof Pol @ U Nottingham, 2005**
(Andrew, “The Political Theory of Constitutive Lack: A Critique”, Theory & Event, 8:1)

Žižek's anti-capitalism has won him … of tactics by dominant elites.

**Our alternative is to embrace radical difference and contingency in opposition to the Lacanian conception of a constitutive lack**
**Robinson, Prof Pol @ U Nottingham, 2005**
(Andrew, “The Political Theory of Constitutive Lack: A Critique”, Theory & Event, 8:1)

The myth of constitutive lack … a starting-point of contingency.

**Don’t be fooled by the apparent novelty of the Lacanian insight—while it may seems that Lacan subverts modernist notions of a stable and essentialized subject, their politics of constitutive lack is not anti-essentialist—rather, it shores up a new kind of essentialism**
**Robinson, Prof Pol @ U Nottingham, 2005**
(Andrew, “The Political Theory of Constitutive Lack: A Critique”, Theory & Event, 8:1)

Constitutive lack as "anti-essentialism"? … constitutive lack" call the shots.
