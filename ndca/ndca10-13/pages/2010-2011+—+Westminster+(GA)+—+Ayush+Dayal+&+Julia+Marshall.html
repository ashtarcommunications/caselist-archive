 <strong>We’re not leaving in 2011 but it kills cred anyway</strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>O’Hanlon 10</strong> (Michael O’Hanlon, </span>Director of Research and Senior Fellow of Foreign Policy @ Brookings, “Staying Power,” Sep/Oct 2010, Foreign Affairs, Vol. 89 Issue 5, p63-79, 17p)<br />
<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Such doubts would matter less if U.S. President Barack Obama did not seem to share them. Obama has more than doubled the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan since taking office, and his administration's protracted decision-making process last fall--which resulted in the president's authorizing 30,000 additional troops for the Afghan mission--was deliberate, serious, and intense. But to some in Washington, Kabul, and elsewhere, the length of that review signaled fundamental uncertainty on the part of the president himself. Contributing to this impression were leaks to the media that revealed major disagreements among top administration advisers.</span><br />
<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Most important, in announcing his decision last December, Obama pledged to begin removing U.S. forces from Afghanistan by July 2011. By itself, the plan to make the military buildup temporary was not misguided or surprising; the Bush administration did much the same thing with the surge in Iraq. But Obama seemed to be promising a fairly rapid end to the war. Indeed, that appeared to be the message he wanted to highlight most for the U.S. Congress and the U.S. electorate. Aware of the nation's war fatigue, Obama tried to be muscular enough to create a chance to win the war while at the same time keeping the war's critics acquiescent.</span><br />
<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Obama's attempt to have his cake and eat it, too, has had its downsides. To Afghans, Obama's words signaled that U.S. forces might depart before they had sufficiently built the Afghan security forces or achieved other key goals. Such a message may motivate some Afghans to accelerate reforms, as the Obama administration hopes, but it will also make many of them hedge their bets, unsure of what will come next. Obama's speech has had a similar effect in </span>Pakistan<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">, where the country's traditional support for the Afghan Taliban has diminished more </span><br />
<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">slowly than it might otherwise have. Some Pakistani military leaders still consider the Afghan Taliban to be their best defense against the potential consequences of a premature U.S. departure: either chaos or too much Indian influence in the country. That many of these fears are exaggerated or incorrect does not make them any less important.</span><br />
<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">In fact, the Obama administration's statements about July 2011 and realistic projections of how long the mission will take suggest that no sudden withdrawal will occur. Given the nature of the Afghan insurgency's dramatic recovery since 2005 and the reasons Obama agreed to a major troop increase in the first place, the drawdown will likely be gradual, with at least 50,000 U.S. troops still in Afghanistan through 2012.</span><br />

&quot;All We Need Is Time.&quot;<br />
<span class="reality"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Wrong.</span></span> This is the same argument that the war's supporters have used for nearly a decade now to justify more troops and rationalize continued involvement in Afghanistan, but the outlook is worsening. Some believe that given time, the current strategy can change the course of the war and defeat the Taliban. But just because President Barack Obama's administration has &quot;surged&quot; U.S. troop strength to over 100,000 and Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, is aggressively targeting militant safe havens in Pakistan does not mean that the fundamentals of this war have changed. It's now a nine-year war -- not nine one-year wars. There is no reset button in Afghanistan, and the coalition lost its political capital with the Afghans long ago.<br />
With conditions deteriorating on the ground and the Taliban gaining strength across the country, coalition forces will be in an even worse position next year than they are now. The situation around the major cities of Jalalabad and Kabul is seriously deteriorating, and the state structure in the north is disappearing. In the southern city of Kandahar, a sustained U.S.-led effort has proved unable to dislodge the Taliban from their traditional stronghold; the Taliban have also launched a systematic campaign targeting anyone ready to work with the coalition, killing hundreds since last spring. Instead of being able to start pulling out troops next summer, as Obama has pledged, the United States will be forced to send additional troops just to hold ground. And the longer Washington waits, the harder it will be to negotiate. As the Taliban solidify their power, they will be less and less likely to talk. It's time to negotiate -- this is the only way forward. The Taliban's Quetta Shura, an insurgent organization led by former Taliban leader Mullah Omar, has repeatedly <span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">made contacts</span> with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, but real negotiations must involve the United States and the Pakistani military.<br />
&quot;Like in Iraq, the Troop Surge Will Work.&quot;<br />
<span class="reality"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">No it won't.</span></span> The situation in Afghanistan is often compared to the war in Iraq and, with the arrival of Petraeus, the architect of the surge in Iraq, the new strategy in Afghanistan is seen as nearly the same thing. After all, critics argued the United States faced an impossible situation in Iraq, and they were proved too pessimistic.<br />
But Iraq is the wrong metaphor, and the surge is often misread. That situation turned around largely because Iraqi Sunni groups, fed up with al Qaeda, switched sides -- not because of the extra U.S. troops. The situation is different in Afghanistan, as there isn't a comparable group that opposes the Taliban and could be coaxed into supporting U.S. forces. Additional U.S. troops are not even leading to a tactical victory, as we've already seen in the southern provinces of Kandahar and in Helmand, where the Taliban are holding their ground and the coalition's outposts are surrounded by insurgents. And the concentration of troops in the south, mostly European troops who are not trained for intense combat or willing to accept a high level of casualties, merely opens the rest of the country up to the Taliban.<br />
&quot;The Civilian Surge Is Critical.&quot;<br />
<span class="reality"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Not so fast.</span></span> Despite a lack of empirical evidence, there is widespread belief that providing more money for development will marginalize the Taliban and improve people's lives. This civilian surge would complement the military surge -- the two go hand in hand.<br />
But if anything, the reverse is true: The civilian surge is only making the military's job harder.<br />
The United States is pumping billions into Afghanistan -- some $30 billion in the last three years alone. There's no way the country, whose annual GDP barely exceeds $27 billion, can absorb that kind of cash infusion. The new money destabilizes the population, feeds corruption, and props up an economy that perpetuates violence. It is common knowledge in Afghanistan that subcontractors and logistics companies are paying off the Taliban -- this phenomenon was even the subject of a U.S. congressional report, titled &quot;<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Warlord Inc.</span>,&quot; which detailed how trucking companies paid off insurgents in return for protection. According to the report, the trucking companies paid tens of millions of dollars every year to local warlords, &quot;in what amounts to a vast protection racket.&quot; So even with the best intentions, a rapid increase in development assistance in the most violent provinces is a mistake.<br />
&quot;The Afghan Army Will Soon Be Ready to<br />
Take the Lead.&quot;<br />
<span class="reality"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Wishful thinking.</span></span> U.S. strategy relies on a credible partner in Afghanistan, and Obama's planned troop drawdown slated for next year depends on an effective Afghan army. Neither of these exists, and there are no signs of change.<br />
Karzai's administration has lost all credibility and -- more importantly -- the government's presence is quickly disappearing, not increasing, across the country. NGOs have less and less access to the countryside and have publicly stated that the deterioration of stability is becoming a primary obstacle to their work. It's incredibly difficult to build an army if the civilian structures around it are crumbling. And the Afghan Army continues to suffer from high turnover rates and will not be ready to face the Taliban without support anytime soon. The Afghan Army's disastrous offensive in the northeastern Laghman province in August, which left dozens of Afghan soldiers dead or captured after a Taliban ambush, was a stern reminder of the military's lack of trained officers and fighting spirit.<br />
&quot;Pakistan Can Be Persuaded to Ditch the Taliban.&quot;<br />
<span class="reality"><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">No way.</span></span> U.S. officials have made clear that they view the Taliban's sanctuaries in Pakistan as a mortal threat to their mission in Afghanistan and have leaned hard on the Pakistanis to crack down on these safe havens while escalating a campaign of drone strikes against al Qaeda-linked militants along the border areas. It's clear, however, that the Pakistani military plans to continue its support for the Taliban. The Pakistani military's ties to these groups go back decades, and it is unrealistic to expect it to cut off these relationships after a few months of U.S. pressure. In any case, the Pakistani Army doesn't have the resources to launch a serious offensive against insurgents operating within its territory anytime soon.<br />
Meanwhile, NATO logistics remain dependent on Pakistan -- as we saw recently, when the Pakistani Army <span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">sealed</span> one of the two main roads used by the coalition to send military supplies into Afghanistan in response to a U.S. helicopter strike that destroyed a Pakistani military outpost, killing two soldiers. The idle convoys left sitting near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border made a perfect target for the Taliban, which has burned dozens of trucks over the past week.<br />

<span style="color: black;"> Over the winter break I had an epiphany about the interrelation of U.S. hard and soft power: <span class="Underline">I</span> now <span class="Underline">oppose a </span></span><span class="Underline">counterinsurgency</span> (COIN) <span class="Underline">strategy</span><span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline">in Afghanistan and advocate a purely counterterror</span> (CT) <span class="Underline">strategy</span> (PDF link) there instead.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> Blame history—or histories—that I've read recently, starting with Livy's works on early Rome (books I-V) last spring and Donald Kagan's <em>The Peloponnesian War</em> at the end of 2009. I've taken occasional dips back into Robert Kaplan's <em>Warrior Politics</em> and his source materials (Churchill, the Federalists, Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and several others).</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> What I've taken from that reading is that <span class="Underline">the U.S. must pull back</span> from its current efforts to remake Iraq and Afghanistan in the image of a Western democracy, <span class="Underline">or risk long-term political and economic exhaustion</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> What follows is not an argument about morality, and readers may find much of it amoral. It <em>is</em> about making cold-blooded political and economic calculations about where U.S. national interests will lie in the next decade. They do not lie in an open-ended COIN mission.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> The history of the Peloponnesian War is particularly relevant here. Athens began fighting Sparta with the resources of an empire and thousands of talents of silver in the bank—enough to fight expensive, far-flung naval and land campaigns for three years without lasting financial consequences.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> Athens was <em>rich</em>, and if peace with Sparta had come by the end of the third year, Athens would have continued to prosper and rule over much of the Mediterranean. (Athens had a &quot;hard&quot;—conquered or cowed—empire as opposed to the &quot;soft&quot; empire of alliances and treaties the U.S. currently has.)</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> But the war with Sparta dragged on for decades, despite occasional peace overtures by both sides. By war's end—despite the spoils of battle and increased taxes and tribute extracted from its shrinking dominion—Athens was broke, depopulated by fighting and plague, bereft of its empire, and could no longer project power into the Mediterranean. Where its former interests ranged from Black Sea Turkey to southern Italy, it spent decades as a small-bore power and never regained its former strength or influence.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> I worry that the U.S. is similarly locked into an open-ended commitment to democratize a nation that is of regional rather than global importance—a parallel to Athens convincing itself that it had to conquer distant, militarily insignificant Sicily.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> &quot;Winning&quot; in Afghanistan</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline">The U.S. could &quot;win&quot; in Afghanistan</span> where victory is defined as a stable, legitimate central government that can project power within its own borders. I don't doubt that the U.S. and its allies could accomplish this given enough time and resources. <span class="Underline">But</span> I think—as many COIN experts also do—that <span class="Underline">it will take at least another decade or more of blood and treasure to produce such a result, if ever</span>.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> Of course I'd like to see the results of a successful COIN campaign: a stable democracy, women's rights, and general prosperity for Afghans, who among all Asia's peoples surely deserve those things. I certainly want to end al-Qa'ida's ability to operate freely in South Asia and elsewhere.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> The U.S. is the only country that would both conceive of these missions and attempt to carry them out. But goals beyond keeping al-Qa'ida on the run don't serve the long-term interests of the U.S., and I am more interested in regaining and preserving U.S. hard power than I am in the rewards that would come from &quot;winning&quot; a lengthy COIN war.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline">I fear the U.S. people and government becoming exhausted from the costs of a lengthy COIN effort, just as they are already exhausted from</span> (and have largely forgotten about) the <span class="Underline">Iraq</span> war. I worry that <span class="Underline">if this fatigue sits in, the U.S. will abandon foreign-policy leadership</span> as it has done periodically throughout history.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline">This outcome would be worse than a resurgent Taliban</span>, worse than Afghan women and men being further oppressed, <span class="Underline">and worse than al-Qa'ida having plentiful additional caves </span>to plot in.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> Here are some signs of an exhaustion of U.S. power: <span class="Underline">The U.S. is already overextended</span>, with commitments in Iraq (shrinking for now), Afghanistan (expanding), Yemen (pending) and Iran (TBD). At home, the U.S. economy remains feeble and in the long term is increasingly hostage to other nations for goods and services it no longer produces (and increasingly, no longer <em>can</em> produce).</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> Even more worrisome is the U.S. credit situation. The wars, and much other U.S. government spending, are now heavily underwritten by other countries' purchases of debt the U.S. issues. It has borrowed trillions from foreign countries and especially China, which continues its steady, highly rational policy of promoting exports while freeriding under the American security umbrella (just as the U.S. once rode for free beneath Britain's).</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> Over time, those countries accrue enough debt to have a say in U.S. policies that may threaten the dollar's value, which is why you now see high U.S. officials flying to Beijing to soothe PRC nerves and explain why America keeps borrowing money.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> At home, there are few resources to apply following a major disaster, such as a Katrina-style hurricane or a major earthquake.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline">The U.S. needs to start rebuilding its reserves—of capital, of credit, of political goodwill abroad, of military force—to be ready for these and more serious crises</span>, <span class="Underline">for which we currently have few resources to spare. Such challenges may involve humanitarian crises (think Darfur, a Rwanda-style genocide, Indian Ocean tsunamis);</span> Latin American instability (Mexico, Venezuela, post-Castro Cuba); <span class="Underline">rogue-state nuclear development (Iran, North Korea); or complex challenges from a rising power (China, a reinvigorated Russia</span>).</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Afghanistan is a quagmire sapping our morale, readiness and cred</strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="color: black;"><strong>Kuhner, 9</strong> - </span></span><span style="color: black;">the president of the Edmund Burke Institute for American Renewal<span class="Underline"> (Jeffrey, Washington Times, “Obama’s quagmire; US should look to its own interests,” 9/7, Lexis Academic) </span></span><br />
<span style="color: black;">America is losing the war in Afghanistan. Rather than change course, President Obama is sending 21,000 additional U.S. troops. This will bring the total to 68,000 American soldiers fighting in Afghanistan, bolstering coalition forces to 110,000.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">The troop surge</span>, however, <span style="color: black;">will not work. Afghanistan has become</span> Mr.<span style="color: black;"> Obama's Vietnam - a protracted quagmire draining precious American blood and treasure. August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces, with 47 soldiers killed by Taliban insurgents. More than 300 coalition troops have died in 2009. This is the highest toll since the war began in 2001, and there are still four months to go. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The </span><span style="color: black;">tide of battle has turned against the West. The Taliban is resurgent. It has reasserted control over its southern stronghold in Kandahar. The Taliban is launching devastating attacks in the western and northern parts of the country - formerly stable areas. U.S. casualties are soaring. The morale of coalition forces is plummeting. Most of our allies - with the exception of the Canadians and the British - are reluctant to engage the Islamist militants. </span><span class="Underline">American public support for the war is waning.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">The conflict has dragged on for nearly eight years. (U.S. involvement in World War II was four years, World War I less than one.) Yet, America's strategic objectives remain incoherent and elusive.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">The war's initial aim was to topple the Taliban and eradicate al Qaeda bases from Afghan territory. Those goals have been achieved. Washington should have declared victory and focused on the more important issue: preventing Islamic fundamentalists from seizing power in Pakistan, along with its nuclear arsenal.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Instead, America is engaged in futile nation-building. Mr. Obama, like President George W. Bush before him, believes Afghanistan must be transformed by erecting a strong central government, democracy and a modern economy. Washington argues this will prevent terrorism from taking root and bring about lasting &quot;stability.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Hence, following a recent reassessment of the war by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the Obama administration is contemplating deploying 20,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops - on top of the 21,000 already pledged. Moreover, billions have been spent building irrigation canals, schools, hospitals and factories. Civilian advisers are being sent to encourage farmers to grow other cash crops besides opium poppies. Western aid money has been used to establish a massive Afghan army, a large police force and a swollen government bureaucracy.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Gen. McChrystal said this week that the situation is &quot;serious,&quot; but not impossible. He still believes victory is within reach. His new strategy is to protect Afghan civilians from Taliban attacks. He also wants to create a lucrative jobs programs and improve local government services. The goal is to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of the Afghan people. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says we must combat Afghanistan's &quot;culture of poverty.&quot; Call it humanitarian war through social engineering.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Mr. Obama's policy will result in a major American defeat - one that will signal the end of America as a superpower and expose us to the world as a paper tiger. Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. The mighty British and Russian armies were humiliated in drawn-out guerrilla campaigns. The country's mountainous geography and primitive tribal culture are ideally suited for insurgent warfare. By sending in more troops, Washington is playing right into the Taliban's hands: We are enabling the Taliban to pick off our forces one by one as they wage a campaign of attrition.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">The Taliban blend with the local population, making it almost impossible for U.S. forces to distinguish combatants from civilians. American counterinsurgency efforts are thus alienating some of the locals. Initially welcomed as liberators, we are now viewed in some quarters as occupiers. Moreover, much of the West's aid money is siphoned off by greedy politicians in Kabul. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">President Hamid Karzai's government is corrupt, venal and ineffective. It barely controls one-third of the country. It is despised by many Afghans for its brutality and incompetence. In addition, Mr. Karzai's vice-presidential running mate is a drug trafficker.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">The West's efforts to forge a cohesive national state based on federalism and economic reconstruction have failed. Warlords are increasingly asserting power in the provinces. The country is fractured along tribal and ethnic lines. The center cannot hold: Afghanistan remains mired in anarchy, blood feuds and weak, decentralized rule.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">U.S. troops should be deployed to defend U.S. national interests. Their lives should never be squandered for an experiment in liberal internationalism. In fact, such a policy is morally grotesque and strategically reckless.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Mr. Obama should quickly withdraw most U.S. forces from Afghanistan. American air power and small, flexible Special Forces units are more than enough to wipe out al Qaeda terrorists. The Taliban is too hated to reoccupy the country - unless our huge military and economic footprint drives numerous </span>Afghans into the<span style="color: black;"> evil, welcoming arms of extremists.</span><br />

<span style="color: black;">If the Soviet Union could not win after eight years of fighting in Afghanistan, what makes our leaders think that we can? The longer we keep large numbers of our troops bogged down fighting two no-win counterinsurgency wars of attrition in Iraq and Afghanistan, the weaker and more vulnerable we will become to the point where eventually the American Empire, as some call it, may decline precipitously or perhaps even collapse altogether. Worse yet, America’s increasing military weakness highlighted further by Obama’s ongoing demolition of our nuclear deterrent, might invite a catastrophic attack from our from our Sino-Russian alliance enemies.</span><br />

This high tempo of deployments has resulted in much of our military equipment to break down while procurement and readiness are at their lowest levels over the past quarter century</span>. Our national security always suffers when we get bogged down in wars where our troops are asked to bleed and die, but are not permitted by our political leaders to win. Our brave soldiers should never be allowed to sacrifice in this way without the hope of victory! The best way to support our troops is to bring them home to their families and make a commitment that we will not let a week go by without thanking a soldier for their willingness to risk life and limb to defend us all.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">What is it going to take to get our political leaders to realize that the costs of staying and fighting the long war in Iraq and Afghanistan greatly outweigh the costs of redeploying out of theater? The same voices we hear calling for us to send another 40,000 to 100,000 troops to Afghanistan are the ones that would have called for us to keep surging and fighting in Vietnam in perpetuity at the cost of hundreds of thousands of our soldiers lives. It didn’t make sense to do that then and it doesn’t make sense to do so now. Ronald Reagan won the Cold War against the Evil Soviet Empire in part by employing proxies to fight and win our battles for us.

<span style="color: black;">Thayer, 6 - professor of security studies at Missouri State (Bradley, The National Interest, “In Defense of Primacy”, November/December, p. 32-37)</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">A grand strategy based on American primacy means ensuring the United States stays the world's number one power‑the diplomatic, economic and military leader. Those arguing against primacy claim that the United States should retrench, ei­ther because the United States lacks the power to maintain its primacy and should withdraw from its global commitments, or because the maintenance of primacy will lead the United States into the trap of &quot;imperial overstretch.&quot; In the previous issue of The National Interest, Christopher Layne warned of these dangers of pri­macy and called for retrenchment.1 Those arguing for a grand strategy of retrenchment are a diverse lot. They include isolationists, who want no foreign military commitments; selective engagers, who want U.S. military commitments to centers of economic might; and offshore balancers, who want a modified form of selective engagement that would have the United States abandon its landpower presence abroad in favor of relying on airpower and seapower to defend its in­terests. But retrenchment, in any of its guis­es, must be avoided. If the United States adopted such a strategy, it would be a profound strategic mistake that would lead to far greater instability and war in the world, imperil American security and deny the United States and its allies the benefits of primacy. There are two critical issues in any discussion of America's grand strategy: Can America remain the dominant state? Should it strive to do this? America can remain dominant due to its prodigious military, economic and soft power capa­bilities. The totality of that equation of power answers the first issue. The United States has overwhelming military capa­bilities and wealth in comparison to other states or likely potential alliances. Barring some disaster or tremendous folly, that will remain the case for the foreseeable future. With few exceptions, even those who advocate retrenchment acknowledge this. So the debate revolves around the desirability of maintaining American pri­macy. Proponents of retrenchment focus a great deal on the costs of U.S. action­ but they fall to realize what is good about American primacy. The price and risks of primacy are reported in newspapers every day; the benefits that stem from it are not. A GRAND strategy of ensur­ing American primacy takes as its starting point the protec­tion of the U.S. homeland and American global interests. These interests include ensuring that critical resources like oil flow around the world, that the global trade and monetary regimes flourish and that Washington's worldwide network of allies is reassured and protected. Allies are a great asset to the United States, in part because they shoulder some of its burdens. Thus, it is no surprise to see NATO in Afghanistan or the Australians in East Timor. In contrast, a strategy based on re­trenchment will not be able to achieve these fundamental objectives of the United States. Indeed, retrenchment will make the United States less secure than the present grand strategy of primacy. This is because threats will exist no mat­ter what role America chooses to play in international politics. Washington can­not call a &quot;time out&quot;, and it cannot hide from threats. Whether they are terror­ists, rogue states or rising powers, his­tory shows that threats must be confront­ed. Simply by declaring that the United States is &quot;going home&quot;, thus abandoning its commitments or making unconvinc­ing half‑pledges to defend its interests and allies, does not mean that others will respect American wishes to retreat. To make such a declaration implies weak­ness and emboldens aggression. In the anarchic world of the animal kingdom, predators prefer to eat the weak rather than confront the strong. The same is true of the anarchic world of interna­tional politics. If there is no diplomatic solution to the threats that confront the United States, then the conventional and strategic military power of the United States is what protects the country from such threats. And when enemies must be confront­ed, a strategy based on primacy focuses on engaging enemies overseas, away from .American soil. Indeed, a key tenet of the Bush Doctrine is to attack terrorists far from America's shores and not to wait while they use bases in other countries to plan and train for attacks against the United States itself. This requires a phys­ical, on‑the‑ground presence that cannot be achieved by offshore balancing. Indeed, as Barry Posen has noted, U.S. primacy is secured because America, at present, commands the &quot;global com­mon&quot;‑‑the oceans, the world's airspace and outer space‑allowing the United States to project its power far from its borders, while denying those common avenues to its enemies. As a consequence, the costs of power projection for the United States and its allies are reduced, and the robustness of the United States' conventional and strategic deterrent ca­pabilities is increased.' This is not an advantage that should be relinquished lightly. A remarkable fact about international politics today‑-in a world where Ameri­can primacy is clearly and unambiguous­ly on display--is that countries want to align themselves with the United States. Of course, this is not out of any sense of altruism, in most cases, but because doing so allows them to use the power of the United States for their own purposes, ­their own protection, or to gain greater influence. Of 192 countries, 84 are allied with America‑-their security is tied to the United States through treaties and other informal arrangements‑and they include almost all of the major economic and military powers. That is a ratio of almost 17 to one (85 to five), and a big change from the Cold War when the ratio was about 1.8 to one of states aligned with the United States versus the Soviet Union. Never before in its history has this coun­try, or any country, had so many allies. U.S. primacy‑-and the bandwagon­ing effect‑has also given us extensive in­fluence in international politics, allowing the United States to shape the behavior of states and international institutions. Such influence comes in many forms, one of which is America's ability to cre­ate coalitions of like‑minded states to free Kosovo, stabilize Afghanistan, invade Iraq or to stop proliferation through the Pro­liferation Security Initiative (PSI). Doing so allows the United States to operate with allies outside of the where it can be stymied by opponents. American‑led wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq stand in contrast to the UN's inability to save the people of Darfur or even to conduct any military campaign to realize the goals of its charter. The quiet effec­tiveness of the PSI in dismantling Libya's WMD programs and unraveling the A. Q. Khan proliferation network are in sharp relief to the typically toothless attempts by the UN to halt proliferation. You can count with one hand coun­tries opposed to the United States. They are the &quot;Gang of Five&quot;: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Venezeula. Of course, countries like India, for example, do not agree with all policy choices made by the United States, such as toward Iran, but New Delhi is friendly to Washington. Only the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; may be expected to consistently resist the agenda and ac­tions of the United States. China is clearly the most important of these states because it is a rising great power. But even Beijing is intimidated by the United States and refrains from openly challenging U.S. power. China proclaims that it will, if necessary, re­sort to other mechanisms of challenging the United States, including asymmetric strategies such as targeting communica­tion and intelligence satellites upon which the United States depends. But China may not be confident those strategies would work, and so it is likely to refrain from testing the United States directly for the foreseeable future because China's power benefits, as we shall see, from the international order U.S. primacy creates. The other states are far weaker than China. For three of the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; cases‑‑Venezuela, Iran, Cuba‑it is an anti‑U.S. regime that is the source of the problem; the country itself is not intrin­sically anti‑American. Indeed, a change of regime in Caracas, Tehran or Havana could very well reorient relations. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power‑‑Rome, Britain or the United States today. Schol­ars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of when we con­sider the current international order‑free trade, a robust monetary regime, increas­ing respect for human rights, growing de­mocratization‑‑is directly linked to U.S. power. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it. In that they are dead wrong and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons: Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages fol­lowed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles. With­out U.S. power, the liberal order cre­ated by the United States will end just as assuredly. </span>As country and western great Rai Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washing­ton and the world. <br />
The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today,<span style="color: black;"> American primacy helps keep a number of complicated rela­tionships aligned‑-between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. Wars still occur where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly war's worst form: great power wars. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Second, American power gives the United States the ability to spread de­mocracy </span>and other elements of its ideol­ogy of liberalism. Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview.3 So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition, <span style="color: black;">once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced. This is not because democracies do not have clashing inter­ests. Indeed they do. Rather, it is because they are more open, more transparent and more likely to want to resolve things amicably in concurrence with U.S. lead­ership. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States. Critics have faulted the Bush Admin­istration for attempting to spread democ­racy in the Middle East, labeling such an effort a modern form of tilting at windmills. It is the obligation of Bush's crit­ics to explain why democracy is good enough for Western states but not for the rest, and, one gathers from the argument, should not even be attempted. Of course, whether democracy in the Middle East will have a peaceful or sta­bilizing influence on America's interests in the short run is open to question. Per­haps democratic Arab states would be more opposed to Israel, but nonetheless, their people would be better off. The United States has brought democracy to Afghanistan, where 8.5 million Af­ghans, 40 percent of them women, voted in a critical October 2004 election, even though remnant Taliban forces threat­ened them. The first free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. It was the military power of the United States that put Iraq on the path to democracy. Wash­ington fostered democratic governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caucasus. Now even the Middle East is increasingly democratic. They may not yet look like Western‑style democracies, but democratic progress has been made in Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, Ku­wait, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt. By all accounts, the march of democracy has been impressive. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Third, along with the growth in the number of democratic states around the world has been the growth of the glob­al economy. With its allies, the United States has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network character­ized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, and mo­bility of capital and labor markets. The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is a glob­al public good from which all states ben­efit, particularly the poorest states in the Third World. The United States created this network not out of altruism but for the benefit and the economic well‑being of America. This economic order forces American industries to be competitive, maximizes efficiencies and growth, and benefits defense as well because the size of the economy makes the defense burden manageable. Economic spin‑offs foster the development of military technology, helping to ensure military prowess. Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the economic network comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat and researcher at the World Bank, who started his ca­reer confident in the socialist ideology of post‑independence India. Abandoning the positions of his youth, Lal now recog­nizes that the only way to bring relief to desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the adoption of free market economic policies and globaliza­tion, which are facilitated through Amer­ican primacy.4 As a witness to the failed alternative economic systems, Lal is one of the strongest academic proponents of American primacy due to the economic prosperity it provides. </span><br />

<strong>We solve—plan replenishes key strategic reserves</strong><br />
<strong>Friedman, 10</strong> - American political scientist. He is the chief intelligence officer, and CEO of the private intelligence corporation Stratfor.

<span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4560:http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100628_30_year_war_afghanistan --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100628_30_year_war_afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100628_30_year_war_afghanistan</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4560 --></span>)<br />
There is an anomaly in this strategy, however. Where the United States previously had devolved operational responsibility to allied groups, or simply hunkered down, this strategy tries to return to devolved responsibilities by first surging U.S. operations. The fourth phase actually increases U.S. operational responsibility in order to reduce it.<br />
<span class="Underline">From <span style="color: black;">the grand strategic point of view</span>, the United States needs to withdraw from Afghanistan, a landlocked country where U.S. forces are dependent on tortuous supply lines</span>. Whatever <span style="color: black;">Afghanistan’s vast mineral riches</span>, mining them in the midst of war is not going to happen. More important, <span class="Underline">the U</span>nited <span class="Underline">S</span>tates <span class="Underline">is overcommitted in the region and lacks a strategic reserve of ground forces.</span> Afghanistan ultimately is not strategically essential, and this is why the United States has not historically used its own forces there.<br />
Obama’s attempt to return to that track after first increasing U.S. forces to set the stage for the political settlement that will allow a U.S. withdrawal is hampered by the need to begin terminating the operation by 2011 (although there is no fixed termination date). It will be difficult to draw coalition partners into local structures when the foundation — U.S. protection — is withdrawing. Strengthening local forces by 2011 will be difficult. Moreover, <span style="color: black;">the Taliban’s motivation</span> to enter into talks is limited by the early withdrawal. At the same time, <span class="Underline">with no ground combat strategic reserve, the U</span>nited <span class="Underline">S</span>tates <span class="Underline">is vulnerable elsewhere in the world, and the longer the Afghan drawdown takes, the more vulnerable it becomes</span> (hence the 2011 deadline in Obama’s war plan).<br />
In sum, this is the quandary inherent in the strategy: <span class="Underline">It is necessary to withdraw as early as possible</span>, but early withdrawal undermines both coalition building and negotiations. The recruitment and use of indigenous Afghan forces must move extremely rapidly to hit the deadline (though officially on track quantitatively, there are serious questions about qualitative measures) — hence, the aggressive operations that have been mounted over recent months. But the correlation of forces is such that the United States probably will not be able to impose an acceptable political reality in the time frame available. Thus, Afghan President Hamid Karzai is said to be opening channels directly to the Taliban, while the Pakistanis are increasing their presence. Where a vacuum is created, regardless of how much activity there is, someone will fill it.<br />
Therefore, the problem is to define how important Afghanistan is to American global strategy, bearing in mind that <span class="Underline">the forces absorbed in</span> Iraq and <span class="Underline">Afghanistan have left the U</span>nited <span class="Underline">S</span>tates <span class="Underline">vulnerable elsewhere in the world</span>. The current strategy defines the Islamic world as the focus of all U.S. military attention. But <span class="Underline">the world has rarely been so considerate as to wait until the U</span>nited <span class="Underline">S</span>tates <span class="Underline">is finished with one war before starting another. Though unknowns remain unknowable, a principle of warfare is to never commit all of your reserves in a battle — one should always maintain a reserve for the unexpected. Strategically, it is imperative that the United States begin to free up forces and re-establish its ground reserves</span>. <br />

<strong>Shift to counterterrorism focus creates sustainable presence</strong><br />
<strong>Stewart, 9 -</strong> <span class="apple-style-span">Ryan Family Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (9/16/09, Rory, “The Future of Afghanistan,” </span><span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4561:http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4561 --></span>)<br />
The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops from the current level of 90,000 to far fewer – perhaps 20,000. In that case, two distinct objectives would remain for the international community: development and counter-terrorism. Neither would amount to the building of an Afghan state or winning a counter-insurgency campaign. <span class="Underline">A</span> reduction in troop numbers and a turn away from state-building should not mean total withdrawal: good projects could continue to be undertaken in electricity, water, irrigation, health, education, agriculture, rural development and in other areas favoured by development agencies. Even a light US presence could continue to allow for aggressive operations against Al Qaeda terrorists, in Afghanistan, who plan to attack the United States. The US has successfully prevent Al Qaeda from re-establishing itself since 2001 (though the result has only been to move bin Laden across the border.). The US military could also (with other forms of assistance) support the Afghan military to prevent the Taliban from seizing a city or taking over the country.<br />
These twin objectives will require a very long-term presence, as indeed is almost inevitable in a country which is as poor, as fragile and traumatized as Afghanistan (and which lacks the internal capacity at the moment to become independent of Foreign aid or control its territory). But a long-term presence will in turn mean a much lighter and more limited presence (if it is to retain US domestic support). We should not control and cannot predict the future of Afghanistan. It may in the future become more violent, or find a decentralised equilibrium or a new national unity, but if its communities continue to want to work with us, we can, over 30 years, encourage the more positive trends in Afghan society and help to contain the more negative.<br />
Such a policy can seem strained, unrealistic, counter-intuitive and unappealing. They appear to betray the hopes of Afghans who trusted us and to allow the Taliban to abuse district towns. No politician wants to be perceived to have underestimated, or failed to address, a terrorist threat; or to write off the ‘blood and treasure’ that we have sunk into Afghanistan; or to admit defeat. Americans are particularly unwilling to believe that problems are insoluble; Obama’s motto is not ‘no we can’t’; soldiers are not trained to admit defeat or to say a mission is impossible. And to suggest that what worked in Iraq won’t work in Afghanistan requires a detailed knowledge of each country’s past, a bold analysis of the causes of development and a rigorous exposition of the differences, for which few have patience.<br />
The greatest risk of our inflated ambitions and fears, encapsulated in the current surge is that it will achieve the exact opposite of its intentions and in fact <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">precipitate a total withdrawal</span>. The heavier our footprint, and the more costly, the less we are likely to be able to sustain it. <span class="Underline">Public opinion is already turning against it.</span> Nato allies are mostly staying in Afghanistan simply to please the United States and have little confidence in our objectives or our reasons. Contemporary political culture tends to encourage black and white solutions: either we garrison or we abandon.<br />
While, I strongly oppose troop increases, I equally strongly oppose a total flight. We are currently in danger of <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">lurching from troop increases to withdrawal and from engagement to isolation</span>. We are threatening to provide instant electro-shock therapy followed by abandonment. This is the last thing Afghanistan needs. The international community should aim to provide a patient, tolerant long-term relationship with a country as poor and traumatized as Afghanistan. Judging by comparable countries in the developing world (and Afghanistan is very near the bottom of the UN Human Development index), making Afghanistan more stable, prosperous and humane is a project which will take decades. It is a worthwhile project in the long-term for us and for Afghans but we will only be able to sustain our presence if we massively reduce our investment and our ambitions and begin to approach Afghanistan more as we do other poor countries in the developing world. <span class="Underline">The best way of avoiding the mistakes of the</span> 1980s and <span class="Underline">1990s – the familiar cycle of investment and abandonment which most Afghan expect and fear and which have contributed so much to instability and danger - is to</span> husband and conserve our resources, limit our objectives to counter-terrorism and humanitarian assistance and work out how to work with fewer troops and less money over a longer period. In Afghanistan in the long-term, less will be more.<br />

<span class="Underline"><span style="color: black;">But this moderate tone gains Obama the leverage that Bush lacked.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> As long as the <span class="caps">US</span> asserted that Afghanistan was an existential threat, the front line in the war on terror, and that, therefore, failure was not an option, the <span class="caps">US</span> had no leverage over Karzai. The worse Afghanistan behaved—the more drugs it grew and terrorists it fostered—the more money it received. If it sorted out its act, it risked being relegated to a minor charitable recipient like Tajikistan. A senior Afghan official warned me this year “to stop referring to us as a humanitarian crisis: we must be the number one terrorist threat in the world, because if we are not we won’t get any money.” <span class="Underline">By asserting convincingly that Afghanistan is not the be-all and end-all and that the US could always ultimately withdraw, Obama</span> escapes this codependent trap and <span class="Underline">regains some leverage over the Afghan government</span>. In his politer words: </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">But perhaps even more importantly, defining a more moderate and limited strategy gives him leverage over his own generals. By refusing to endorse or use the language of counterinsurgency in the speech, he escapes their doctrinal logic. <span class="Underline">By no longer committing the US to defeating the Taliban or state-building, he dramatically reduces the objectives and the costs of the mission</span>. By talking about costs, the fragility of public support, and other priorities, he reminds the generals why this surge must be the last. All of this serves to “cap” the troop increases at current levels and provide the justification for beginning to reduce numbers in 2011. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="color: black;">But the brilliance of its moderate arguments cannot overcome that statement about withdrawal. With seven words, “our troops will begin to come home,” he loses leverage over the Taliban, as well as leverage he had gained over Karzai and the generals</span></span><span style="color: black;">. It is a cautious, lawyerly statement, expressed again as “[we will] begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011.” It sets no final exit date or numbers. But the Afghan students who were watching the speech with me ignored these nuances and saw it only as departure. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="color: black;">This may be fatal for Obama’s ambition to “open the door” to the Taliban</span></span><span style="color: black;">. <span class="Underline">The lighter,</span></span><span class="Underline"> more political,<span style="color: black;"> and less but still robust militarized presence that his argument implies could facilitate a deal with the Taliban, if it appeared semi-permanent.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> As the President asserted, the Taliban are not that strong. They have nothing like the strength or appeal that they had in 1995. They cannot take the capital, let alone recapture the country. There is strong opposition to their presence, particularly in the center and the north of the country. <span class="Underline">Their only hope is to negotiate. But the Taliban need to acknowledge this. And the only way they will is if they believe that we are not going to allow the Kabul government to collapse</span>. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Afghanistan has been above all a project not of force but of patience. It would take decades before Afghanistan achieved the political cohesion, stability, wealth, government structures, or even basic education levels of Pakistan. A political settlement requires a reasonably strong permanent government. The best argument against the surge, therefore, was never that a <span class="caps">US</span> operation without an adequate Afghan government partner would be unable to defeat the Taliban—though it won’t. Nor that the attempt to strengthen the <span class="caps">US</span> campaign will intensify resistance, though it may. Nor because such a deployment of over 100,000 troops at a cost of perhaps $100 billion a year would be completely disproportional to the <span class="caps">US</span>’s limited strategic interests and moral obligation in Afghanistan—though that too is true. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Instead, <span class="Underline">Obama should not have requested more troops because doing so intensifies opposition to the war</span> in the <span class="caps">US</span> and Europe <span class="Underline">and accelerates the pace of withdrawal demanded by political pressures at home. To keep domestic consent for a long engagement we need to <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">limit troop numbers</span></span> and in particular limit our casualties. The surge is a Mephistophelian bargain, in which the President has gained force but lost time. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="color: black;">What can now be done to <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">salvage the administration’s position</span>?</span></span><span style="color: black;"> Obama has acquired leverage over the generals and some support from the public by making it clear that he will not increase troop strength further. He has gained leverage over Karzai by showing that he has options other than investing in Afghanistan. Now <span class="Underline">he needs to regain leverage over the Taliban by showing them that he is not about to abandon Afghanistan </span>and that their best option is to negotiate. In short, he needs to follow his argument for a call strategy to its conclusion. <span class="Underline">The date of withdrawal <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">should be recast </span>as a time for reduction to a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">lighter, more sustainable, and more permanent presence</span></span>. This is what the administration began to do in the days following the speech. As National Security Adviser General James Jones said, “That date is a ‘ramp’ rather than a cliff.” And as Hillary Clinton said in her congressional testimony on December 3, their real aim should be to “develop a long-term sustainable relationship with Afghanistan and Pakistan so that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, primarily our abandonment of that region.”</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">A more realistic, affordable, and therefore sustainable presence would not make Afghanistan stable or predictable. It would be merely a small if necessary part of an Afghan political strategy. The </span><span class="caps"><span style="color: black;">US</span></span><span style="color: black;"> and its allies would only moderate, influence, and fund a strategy shaped and led by Afghans themselves. The aim would be to knit together different Afghan interests and allegiances sensitively enough to avoid alienating independent local groups, consistently enough to regain their trust, and robustly enough to restore the security and justice that Afghans demand and deserve from a national government. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">What would this look like in practice? Probably a mess. It might involve a tricky coalition of people we refer to, respectively, as Islamists, progressive civil society, terrorists, warlords, learned technocrats, and village chiefs. Under a notionally democratic constitutional structure, it could be a rickety experiment with systems that might, like Afghanistan’s neighbors, include strong elements of religious or military rule. There is no way to predict what the Taliban might become or what authority a national government in Kabul could regain. Civil war would remain a possibility. But an intelligent, long-term, and tolerant partnership with the United States could reduce the likelihood of civil war and increase the likelihood of a political settlement. This is hardly the stuff of sound bites and political slogans. But it would be better for everyone than boom and bust, surge and flight. With the right patient leadership, a political strategy could leave Afghanistan in twenty years’ time more prosperous, stable, and humane than it is today. That would be excellent for Afghans and good for the world.</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Meanwhile, Obama’s broader strategic argument must not be lost. He has grasped that the foreign policy of the president should not consist in a series of extravagant, brief, Manichaean battles, driven by exaggerated fears, grandiloquent promises, and fragile edifices of doctrine. Instead <span class="Underline">the foreign policy of a great power should be the responsible exercise of limited power and knowledge in concurrent situations of radical uncertainty.</span> Obama, we may hope, will develop this elusive insight. And then <span class="Underline">it might become possible to find the right places in which to deploy the wealth, the courage, and the political capital of the U</span>nited <span class="Underline">S</span>tates. <span class="Underline">We might hope in South Asia,</span> for example, <span class="Underline">for a lighter involvement in Afghanistan but a much greater focus on Kashmir</span>.1 </span><br />

 <strong>Afghanistan stalemate limits Obama’s ability to reorient foreign policy towards effective diplomacy</strong><br />
<strong>Fernholz, 10 –</strong> writing fellow at the American Prospect and Research Fellow at the New America Foundation (Tim, The American Prospect, “The Ultimate Test Case,” March, 2010, lexis) Katulis = security policy analyst at the Center for American Progress<br />
Obama's final decision in December offered something for everyone, or tried to: The U.S. would deploy an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan, fewer than McChrystal requested but still a tripling of the troop commitment to the conflict since Obama's inauguration. The strategy was virtually unchanged from what Obama had offered in the spring. The goal also remained the same: &quot;to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan and to prevent their return to either country in the future.&quot; <span class="Underline">Obama's plan echoed the surge he opposed in Iraq: An escalation to protect civilians in population centers and train Afghan security forces</span> that will, in theory, reverse the momentum of the insurgents and even co-opt those who are willing to lay down their arms. Along with aid from a &quot;civilian surge&quot; of U.S. officials and contractors with expertise in engineering, agriculture, justice, and local politics, the hope is that this will give the Afghan government time to recover from corruption and incompetence (the euphemism is &quot;capacity building&quot;).<br />
The one new development was a timeline: In July of 2011, the U.S. will start handing over responsibilities to the Afghans so that coalition forces can begin to withdraw. The president insisted on this timeline, and it remains the single most progressive aspect of the plan--a recognition that, in the greater scheme of things, the U.S. has better things to do for its national security than muck about in Afghanistan.<br />
&quot;Any American president has to think about the political sustainability of his policies, and an American president that launches into policies that he can't sustain politically isn't doing his job,&quot; Hurlburt says. &quot;That's true of Obama, that's true of Bush, it's true of everybody. You look at some of the things that Bush started and couldn't sustain--that's the worst of all possible worlds.&quot;<br />
<span class="bold">OBAMA'S TINKERING AROUND THE EDGES</span>--the timeline, the counterinsurgency strategy, the emphasis on development, the whole-of-government approach--marks a real departure from the previous administration's efforts. His rhetoric still holds the promise of the overhaul he campaigned on. But <span class="Underline">the president's failure to fundamentally reorient the Afghan conflict has broad ramifications for his</span> promised <span class="Underline">foreign-policy </span>reforms.<br />
Perhaps the most significant loss is the big picture. <span class="Underline">Nearly 100,000 troops are committed to pursuing Obama's &quot;narrow goal&quot; of defeating al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.</span> But is this extensive involvement in an Afghan civil war the best way to fight al-Qaeda and like-minded groups? After all, <span class="Underline">one of al-Qaeda leaders' stated goals is drawing the U</span>nited <span class="Underline">S</span>tates<span class="Underline"> into expensive and intractable long-term conflicts. Even as we're leaving Iraq, doubling-down on Afghanistan plays into their hands.</span><br />
&quot;We did not ask for this fight,&quot; the president said in a major speech on Afghanistan in December. &quot;On September 11, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people.&quot; It was an explanation straight out of the Bush era. Much of the 9-11 operation was carried out not in Afghanistan or Pakistan (or Iraq, for that matter) but in places like Germany and Florida. And terrorism experts warn that officials should not take for granted that al-Qaeda could re-establish a safe haven in Afghanistan, or that such safe havens are threats to the United States. <span class="Underline">The administration admits that fewer than 100 al-Qaeda terrorists remain in Afghanistan--and that many insurgents aren't ideological opponents of the U</span>nited <span class="Underline">S</span>tates. Some are petty criminals, some are simply armed local groups tired of being pushed around by the central government, and others fight merely for pay. (The U.S. was embarrassed to find out in December that the Taliban paid its fighters more than the Afghan National Army paid its soldiers.) <span class="Underline">Many of these insurgents are angry at the U.S. simply because we're there.</span><br />
&quot;The importance of a people not wanting to be occupied cannot be underestimated,&quot; says Matthew Hoh, a former Foreign Service officer who was the first person to resign a government post in protest of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. &quot;National will or ethnic will cannot be downplayed or misunderstood or denied.&quot;<br />
Meanwhile, the transnational terrorists we're supposedly fighting don't need bases in Afghanistan and Pakistan to attack us. Officials concede that safe havens in other failed or failing states must be pressed as well. Just weeks after Obama announced his strategy, a Nigerian man obtained explosives from an al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen--which, along with places like Pakistan, Algeria, and Somalia, provides a &quot;safe haven&quot; for the group--and attempted to destroy an international flight as it landed in Detroit. U.S. intelligence agencies, despite having some relevant information, didn't act in time to prevent the bomber from getting on the flight. Perhaps the billions of dollars dedicated to the new troops in Afghanistan would be better served fixing structural failures in intelligence-gathering.<br />
Instead, we're seeing the considerable militarization of intelligence-gathering. After a suicide bomber killed seven Central Intelligence Agency employees in Afghanistan, CIA Director Leon Panetta wrote that &quot;like our military, CIA officers are on the front lines against al-Qaeda and its violent allies.&quot; The officers were stationed there to manage a drone program that hunts terrorists in the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan. While fighting terrorists requires both intelligence-gathering and the kind of targeted strikes the CIA performs, there is a clear imbalance when a camp in Afghanistan has dozens of CIA employees but the National Counterterrorism Center has only eight or nine Middle East analysts.<br />
<span class="Underline">The focus on troops has also hampered Obama's goal of placing equal emphasis on civilian and military aspects of our foreign </span>policy. The military, which <span class="Underline">has increasingly become America's primary presence abroad, </span>is resisting the attempt to narrow the focus of the war. Despite <br />
the White House's goal of training just over 200,000 Afghan soldiers and police, Pentagon officials plan to train 400,000. And Holbrooke, intended to be the civilian counterpart to Petraeus, has seen his influence diminish commensurate with his lack of resources. Though his office is still an important center of coordination, he plays a smaller-than-expected role in the White House-driven decision-making process.<br />
Obama's foreign-policy vision professed a need to address the root causes of conflict by building up local infrastructure and actively fostering better lives for people in places like Afghanistan. <span class="Underline">Despite a consensus</span>--which even includes Defense Secretary Robert Gates--<span class="Underline">that civilian development, medical access, and agricultural expertise are critical to counterinsurgency, the administration's budget request</span> in March <span class="Underline">reflected a heavy emphasis on defense over development.</span> Ambassador Eikenberry protested in a cable to Washington, asking for an additional $2.5 billion--60 percent more than he had been given. The military was receiving $68 billion.<br />
Even if civilian efforts were given more resources, overhauling the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to make them more effective remains a challenge--despite the fact that the State Department created a position to do just that. Although the administration expects to have 974 civilians on the ground by early 2010, beating a goal it set in March, this is a drop in the bucket: Afghanistan has a population of 28 million. Reports show a deep frustration from U.S. officials working on development projects, because they are almost entirely dependent on the military. Indeed, despite the growing acceptance of the need for civilian expertise, the military often finds itself trying to do the work of civilian agencies that aren't set up to operate in a war zone.<br />
&quot;We're in a 'build the airplane while you're flying it' kind of situation,&quot; Hurlburt says. &quot;If the effort to produce a better, much more energetic and smartly focused civilian effort in Afghanistan succeeds, it will become the template for broader reform of the institutions.&quot; That template could be useful, Hurlburt adds, or it could be detrimental, since the lessons U.S. development officers learn in Afghanistan may not apply so well to countries that need U.S. help but aren't in the middle of a war.<br />
<span class="Underline">This narrow focus on the military conflict also distracts from Pakistan</span>, Afghanistan's nuclear neighbor, <span class="Underline">where an unstable government and the proliferation of extreme Islamist groups are of much more interest to the U</span>nited <span class="Underline">S</span>tates. &quot;I am not sure what 40,000 additional troops in Afghanistan can do about the greater global security threat, instability in Pakistan,&quot; Katulis told me last fall. &quot;You have nearly daily--and sometimes twice-a-day--attacks targeted inside of Pakistan, which is five times more populous and has nuclear weapons.&quot; Just consider the numbers: Obama is spending $1.5 billion a year on aid to Pakistan and over $68 billion fighting a war in Afghanistan.<br />
With Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visiting Pakistan, the administration has had some success in navigating the nation's complex politics. Clinton is trying to broaden the U.S.-Pakistan relationship from working with the government on national-security issues toward a holistic engagement with the entire country. It's exactly the kind of approach that Obama promised, but it is undermined by the use of drone strikes on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, which have increased anti-American sentiment.<br />
The Obama team has set aside the Bush administration's end goal of installing a democracy and instead made a limited version of that aim the means to their central end: Everything comes down to eliminating the terrorist presence in Afghanistan. Vikram Singh, Holbrooke's defense adviser, says the region is the &quot;epicenter&quot; of al-Qaeda's action, which is why the administration has made preventing the group's re-establishment there a more pressing goal than dealing with al-Qaeda globally. With even John Kerry, now the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, using the distinctly Bush-administration phrase &quot;global counterinsurgency&quot; in his speeches on Afghanistan, progressive attempts to change the way we think about terrorism threats have taken a step back.<br />
<span class="bold">THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE</span> settled into the Washington consensus that he criticized as an up-and-coming senator. His Afghanistan strategy buys into the idea that American troops can defeat tenacious insurgencies, that our officials have the ability to build even the most basic state from the ground up, and that terrorists represent a monolithic enemy around the world. The cocky senator of last spring has been replaced by a cautious and tightly controlled president. There was a time when Obama could flout conventional wisdom, but now he must accommodate it. It's true that Obama did not start this war, did not under-resource it for eight years, and did not fail to pursue Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora. The credit for those dubious achievements goes to George W. Bush. But the new president has missed opportunities to shift how our government approaches these problems.<br />
Many of the campaign aides who helped craft Obama's forward-thinking foreign-policy vision remain in his inner circle, but are superseded by a group of veteran officials (Clinton, Gates, Petraeus, Holbrooke, National Security Adviser James Jones) whose commitment to new ideas varies. It remains to be seen how much they--and the responsibilities of being president--have shifted Obama's personal foreign-policy vision.<br />
<span class="Underline">The stakes are high in Afghanistan</span> not only on the merits but <span class="Underline">because success buys him the credibility to advance other foreign-policy initiatives that don't tend to go over well with domestic audiences</span>: closing Guantanamo Bay, engaging Iran, pressuring Israel toward peace, reaching out to the Muslim community, and reducing nuclear weapons in America and the world. Even given the daunting odds, <span class="Underline">it is still possible that a new mode of foreign policy--one that is executed by civilians and soldiers equally--could spring from the crucible of Afghanistan.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The other scenario, though, is that using the military in Afghanistan</span> as the central means of fighting terrorism leaves reform of law enforcement and intelligence out in the cold, <span class="Underline">hinders the transformation of the civilian agencies, and prevents Obama from spending resources on other projects</span>. <span class="Underline">A failure in Afghanistan is a failure to change the way this country approaches foreign policy. </span>Worse, if the next two years don't show an Afghan government that can handle basic governing and security, then <span class="Underline">all of Obama's ideas will be wrapped in that failure, hindering his ability to execute any of his other initiatives</span>.<br />

<span class="apple-style-span">Afghanistan is becoming a deepening vortex for both the United States military and for the country's national security policies. In addition to the financial and human toll (80 ISAF soldiers have died so far this month), Afghanistan is imposing other costs on the U.S. military, on U.S. defense planning, and on America's diplomatic leverage around the world. When assessing the benefits to be achieved by the Afghan campaign, these costs also merit consideration.</span><br />
<span class="apple-style-span">The administration and its military advisers have chosen a manpower-intensive counterinsurgency strategy for Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and a long list of officials have expressed their concerns about the implications of repeated deployments for the all-volunteer force. Afghanistan also seems to chew up generals. Gen. David McKiernan was replaced out of frustration with a lack of progress. The same frustration, expressing itself in behind-the-scenes contempt and bickering, brought down Gen. Stanley McChrystal. Now Petraeus has been recalled from a depleted bench. This move has its price. After jumping into the Afghan vortex, Petraeus will leave behind his critical duties at Central Command, which include diplomacy across the Middle East and Central Asia, the containment of Iran, and supervising the endgame in Iraq. The administration has yet to announce who, if anyone, will replace Petraeus at Centcom.</span><br />
<span class="apple-style-span">The Afghan vortex has implications for defense planning elsewhere in the world. In a speech he delivered to the Navy League in May, Gates said that the costs of rehabilitating the Army and Marine Corps, combined with the ground force's long term manpower and family support costs, will mean that the Navy will see no increases in its budget. The secretary general of Japan's ruling party recently argued that U.S. naval power is in decline and that Japan needs to adjust its maritime security policy accordingly. When that view spreads throughout Asia, an arms race will be inevitable.</span><br />
<span class="apple-style-span">The deepening commitment has forced the U.S. government into the position of pleading for favors from Pakistan and Russia in order to open new supply lines to the growing army in Afghanistan. The price has been to forfeit diplomatic leverage with implications for U.S. relations in Europe, India, and China.</span><br />
<span class="apple-style-span"> Are the campaign objectives in Afghanistan worth all of these costs? Evidently, Obama has decided that they are. A smaller commitment to Afghanistan would presumably reduce or eliminate the costs described above. But such a course would have its own risks, which Obama has presumably considered and rejected.</span><br />

<span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Sending</span></span> from <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">30,000</span></span> to 40,000 <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">troops to that tumultuous nation will likely wreak havoc on Obama's broader first-term foreign policy agenda - consuming resources, sucking up time and attention, and ultimately subverting his larger foreign policy goals</span></span>.<br />
In August, National Intelligence Council Chairman John Brennan declared that under Obama, &quot;the fight against terrorists and violent extremists has been returned to its right and proper place: no longer defining - indeed, distorting - our entire national security and foreign policy, but rather serving as a vital part of those larger policies.&quot;<br />
But <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the military commitment endorsed by</span></span> President <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama would </span></span>have the reverse effect - <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">officially making stabilization in Afghanistan and the war against Al Qaeda and the Taliban the President's top priority.</span></span><br />
For example, one of the most serious challenges facing the country's national security bureaucracy - one Obama and Secretary of State Clinton have expressed serious concern about in the past - is the skewed balance between resources for our military and civilian agencies. Nearly everyone in the foreign policy community agrees that both State and the U.S. Agency for International Development are badly under-resourced.<br />
But <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">with Obama's likely troop increase in Afghanistan, agencies like the State Department and USAID will see their dwindling capacity devoted to assisting the military as opposed to the long-term diplomacy and development work that can further U.S. interests in places not named Afghanistan or Pakistan</span></span>. The civilian-military balance will only become further skewed.<br />
And if the administration requests $100 billion a year for the war in Afghanistan, in the face of looming budget deficits, what are the chances Congress will loosen its purse strings further for two underappreciated foreign policy agencies?<br />
Finally, <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama and his advisers will be pressed in devoting their attention and political capital to other foreign policy matters, whether it's pushing for a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, organizing an international coalition to confront the Iranian nuclear program or hammering out international agreements on climate change and trade</span></span>. <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">It's never easy for Presidents and their advisers to proverbially &quot;walk and chew gum at the same time,&quot; and having 100,000 troops in Afghanistan will make it that much harder.</span></span><br />
But above all, <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama's goal</span></span> of changing America's mind-set from the belief that there is a military solution to every national <br />
security challenge <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">will be dealt a defining and perhaps fatal blow</span></span> - and in the end, that is probably the most important reason why troop levels in Afghanistan matter and why the President should think twice. <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The opportunity costs will be profound</span></span>, and Obama will risk becoming the one thing he likely did not want to be: a war President.<br />
As he prepares to announce a decision that will define his presidency, <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama would be wise to consider the words of</span></span> one of his predecessors in the Oval Office, <span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Lyndon Johnson</span></span>, who after leaving office told a biographer, &quot;<span class="CardsFont12ptChar"><span style="text-decoration: none;">History provided too many cases where the sound of the bugle put an immediate end to the hopes and dreams of the best reformers</span></span>.&quot; No doubt Obama knows what ultimately happened to Johnson's policy agenda - and his presidency.<br />

But I particularly wanted to make the point to this audience and to circulate to a wider audience certain points about climate change this morning, which is perhaps the 21st century's biggest foreign- policy challenge, along with preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. I believe those two threats over the longer term are the biggest threats to the peace and security of the world.<br />
A world that is failing to respond to climate change is one in which the values embodied in the United Nations will not be met, and it's a world in which competition and conflict would win out over collaboration.<br />
We're at a very crucial point in the global debate on this subject. Many people are questioning, in the wake of Copenhagen, whether we should continue to seek a response to climate change through the U.N. and whether we can ever hope to deal with this enormous challenge.<br />
And I will first argue today that an effective response to climate change underpins our security and prosperity; second, that our response should be to strive for a binding global deal, whatever the setbacks; and third, I will set out why effective deployment of foreign policy assets is crucial to mobilizing the political will needed if we're going to shape an effective response.<br />
Now, Ban Ki-moon is right to have made climate change his top priority. Two weeks ago, I was talking about Britain's values in a networked world. I said then that a successful response to climate change must be a central objective of British foreign policy. And I said this not only because I believe action against climate change is in line with a values-based foreign policy, but because it underpins our prosperity and security.<br />
You can't have food, water or energy security without climate security; they are interconnected and inseparable. They form four resource pillars on which global security, prosperity and equity stand. Each depends on the other. Plentiful, affordable food requires reliable and affordable access to water and energy. Increasing dependence on coal, oil and gas threatens climate security, increasing the severity of floods and droughts, damaging food production, exacerbating the loss of biodiversity, and in countries that rely on hydropower, undermining energy security through the impact on the availability of water.<br />
As the world becomes more networked, the impact of climate change in one country or region will affect the prosperity and security of others around the world.<br />
No one can have failed to be appalled by the devastating floods in Pakistan. They overwhelmed the capacity of government to respond and opened political space for extremists. While Pakistan has borne the brunt of the human impact, China too has been hit on a vast scale by a seemingly endless sequence of droughts, floods and deadly mudslides. The Russian drought last month damaged the wheat harvest, leading to an export ban. World prices surged, hitting the poorest hardest, and sparking riots over bread prices in far away Mozambique.<br />
While no one weather event can ever be linked with certainty to climate change, the broad patterns of abnormality seen this year are consistent with climate-change models. They provide an illustration of the events we will be encountering increasingly in the future.<br />
So the clock is ticking, and the time to act is now. We must all take responsibility for this threat and take robust action. But we must also be clear-headed about the difficulties of reaching agreement and not lose heart when the going gets tough.<br />
The post-war leaders set up the United Nations in the aftermath of conflagration. They saw the pressing need for global solutions to global problems: cooperation not conflict, through frameworks and institutions embedded in the rule of law, and an international system that is fair and offers everyone a realistic prospect of security and prosperity.<br />
Failure to respond to climate change is inimical to all these values, undermining trust between nations, intensifying competition for resources, and shrinking the political space available for cooperation. It is an affront to fairness, since it puts the greatest burden on those who have done least to cause the problem and are least able to deal with its consequences.<br />
It is incompatible with the values and aspirations that the U.N. embodies. And it's incompatible with the values and aspirations of British foreign policy.<br />
For more than 20 years, we've been striving to build an effective international response to climate change. But we have lacked the collective ambition required. We need to shift investment urgently from high-carbon &quot;business as usual&quot; to the low-carbon economy. This means building an essentially decarbonized global economy by mid- century.<br />
At the same time, we must ensure development is climate resilient; otherwise, the changes in climate that are already unavoidable will block the path for hundreds of millions of people from poverty to prosperity. These changes also threaten to sweep away the investments in development we have made, and just as the bridges and schools in Pakistan were swept away.<br />
To drive that shift in investment from low to high carbon, we need a global climate change deal under the United Nations.<br />
Now, some have argued that we should abandon hope of doing so. They say Copenhagen proved it's all too difficult; we should focus instead on less inclusive and less demanding responses, such as coalitions of the willing. But we believe this would be a strategic error. It mistakes the nature of the task, which is to expand the realm of the possible, not to lower our ambition by accepting its current limits.<br />
And we must recognize this at Cancun. One thing Copenhagen did give us was a set of political commitments, captured in the Copenhagen Accord, on which we can build. More than 120 countries have now associated themselves with that accord, and that represents a broad and growing consensus. We now need to ensure that we live up to the commitments we made to each other in the accord, and reach out even more widely.<br />
Copenhagen, despite those accords, was a strategic setback, but it was not by any means the end of the road. We need to be clear why it failed to live up to high expectations and why it did not deliver a legally binding deal.<br />
Many people say that it failed because of process: The diplomats and the politicians had created a negotiation that was too difficult and too complex. But this misses the point. International treaties are an outcome, not an input, of political bargains. If you've made the political commitment to deliver, you can make the process work to deliver.<br />
The real reason Copenhagen did not deliver on high expectations was a lack of political will. Many in developing countries saw a gap between the words and the deeds of the industrialized economies. They questioned whether we really believed our own rhetoric. And to answer those questions, we each need to start at home.<br />
That is why the coalition government to which I belong has committed itself to being the greenest government ever in the United Kingdom, and why, with others in Europe, we are calling on the European Union to commit to a 30-percent cut in emissions by 2020 without waiting for the rest of the world to act.<br />
The UK is already the world leader in offshore wind, with more projects installed, in planning and in construction than any other country in the world. We're undertaking the most radical transformation of our electricity sector ever. We aim to provide over 30 percent of our domestic electricity from renewables by 2020. We have committed to build no new coal-fired power stations without carbon capture and storage technology, and we've announced our intention to continue the demonstration projects of that.<br />
And because it's imperative that foreign and domestic policies are mutually reinforcing, we must ensure that our approach is coherent. Now, that's one reason we have established the new British National Security Council: to ensure this happens across the full range of issues, including climate change.<br />
And that's why I work hand in glove with Chris Huhne, the British Energy and Climate Change secretary, and Andrew Mitchell, the International Development secretary, to ensure that our domestic action reflects our level of international ambition.<br />
But we won't succeed, of course, if we act alone. We must aim for a framework that is global and binding. It needs to be global because climate change affects everyone. Only a response that allows everyone a voice will generate a sense of common purpose and legitimacy. Only a response that is binding will convince investors that we intend to keep the promises we make to each other. Businesses need clear political signals, so let's show them an unequivocal green light.<br />
We are now a few weeks away from the 16th Conference of Parties on Climate Change in Cancun. And I commend the consultative and collaborative approach Mexico has taken ahead of this meeting. Thanks to their determination and foresight, we have a chance in Cancun to regain momentum and make progress on key issues such as forests, technology, finance and transparency of commitments. Cancun will -- may not get us all the way to a full agreement, but it can put us back on track to one.<br />
That said, the negotiations can't succeed inside a bubble. The negotiators in the U.N. process can't themselves build political will. They have to operate on the basis of current political realities in the countries they represent. And it's those realities that limit the ambition that we can set in the -- in such negotiations, and it's those realities that we now need to shift.<br />
There is no global consensus on what climate change puts at risk, geopolitically and for the global economy, and thus on the scale and urgency of the response we need. We must build a global consensus if we are to guarantee our citizens security and prosperity. That is a job for foreign policy.<br />
A fundamental purpose here for foreign policy is to shift the political debate, to create the political space for leaders and negotiators to reach agreement. We didn't get that right before Copenhagen, and we must get it right now.<br />
So we urgently need to mobilize foreign ministers and the diplomats they lead, as well as institutions such as the Council on Foreign Relations, to put climate change at the heart of foreign- policy thinking.<br />
When I became foreign secretary in May, I said the core goals of our foreign policy were to guarantee Britain's security and prosperity. Robust global action on climate change is essential to that agenda. That is why the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, under my leadership, is a vocal advocate for climate diplomacy. All British ambassadors carry the argument for a global low-carbon transition in their breast pocket or in their handbag. Climate change is part of their daily vocabulary, alongside the traditional themes of foreign policy. And they're supported by our unique network of climate attaches throughout the world.<br />
The core assets of foreign policy are its networks and its convening power. Foreign policy can build political impulses to overcome barriers between sectors and cultures. In a networked world, diplomacy builds partnerships beyond government. And nowhere are those partnerships more vital than on climate.<br />
So we must mobilize all our networks, not just across government but between governments, using organizations such as the Commonwealth as well. We must reach out, beyond, to NGOs, faith groups and businesses. And of all these, perhaps business engagement is the key to making a difference. It's business that will lead low-carbon transition. It's business that best understands the incentives needed to help us all prosper.<br />
We must also harness scientific expertise in cutting-edge low- carbon technologies. The scientific community will develop the goods which will power the low-carbon economy and drive global ambition on climate change. And that's why the British government has a science and innovation network, which fosters collaborative research in the U.K. and other countries.<br />
Now, what can the U.K. and the European Union do to make that fundamental shift and shape a global consensus on climate change? The most serious problem at Copenhagen, and the strongest brake on political will, was and is a lack of confidence in the low-carbon economy. Too few people in too few countries are yet convinced that a rapid move to low carbon is compatible with economic recovery and growth. They see the short-term economic and domestic stability risks before the opportunities and the longer-term risks of inaction.<br />
There should be only one European response to that confidence gap. The EU, in my view, must accelerate its own progress and demonstrate that a low-carbon growth path makes us more competitive. I am convinced this is in the long-term interests of Europe's economy. We have learned painful lessons from the oil price shocks. We must modernize our infrastructure. The opportunities are out there. The global industry in low-carbon and environmental goods and services is already estimated to be worth up to 3.2 trillion pounds a year. Nearly a million British people are now employed in this sector, and that's why we are creating a green investment bank to ensure that we can properly support and develop low-carbon industry.<br />
But we need to redouble our efforts, both in the EU (itself ?) and in our engagement with partners. Each of us as member states will be better able to accelerate if we're doing so together as the world's largest single market. And by opening up this effort through partnership with others, we can make it easier for them to accelerate, too.<br />
So we'll be at the forefront of pushing for low-carbon modernization of Europe's infrastructure and energy policy. The European Union's budget until 2013 is set out in the current &quot;financial perspective&quot;.<br />
We will argue -- we will need to agree the financial perspective for the seven years after that, the period including our 2020 climate goals. And it's -- as ever, it's right that the EU budget should reflect the prevailing economic circumstances. It's also right that we direct the budget to today's challenges, not those of yesterday. And that means one that supports the transition to a low-carbon economy.<br />
Action in Europe alone will not be enough. We need both the developed and developing world to take action. And this week Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, and I have tasked our teams to come together to shape a coordinated, diplomacy-led effort on climate change, combining the strengths of our respective foreign services.<br />
I've just put the case for bringing a new urgency for low-carbon transition within the EU. But together we should carry that urgency in external dialogues, whether they are with the United States, China or India.<br />
The transition to low carbon will happen faster and maximize the benefit for all if the United States -- historically the world's largest emitter -- is at the leading edge. I recognize the political challenges that the U.S. administration faces and welcome President Obama's commitment to combat climate change. As he said in his State of the Union speech, &quot;the nation that leads the clean-energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy.&quot;<br />
Whatever the outcome of the upcoming midterm elections in the U.S., there is scope for political unity around an economic agenda that targets new energy opportunities and new jobs. American business understands this new market and should want to lead it. But to make these new clean-energy investments at the required pace and on a sufficient scale, they need the right incentives.<br />
On climate, as in so many areas, the world looks to the US for leadership, because it has the economic clout and diplomatic leverage to shift the global debate.<br />
And I look forward to working with the U.S. administration and indeed with the Council on Foreign Relations to raise global ambitions and put us back on the path to sustainable growth.<br />
A key challenge for Europe is to build an economic partnership with China that reinforces the steps China is taking towards a low- carbon economy. These steps include its recent announcement of the five provinces and eight cities that have been designated as China's low-carbon pilots. Together these pilots cover 350 million people, so an ambitious approach to these schemes, tenaciously implemented, could provide a critical boost to global confidence in the concept of low- carbon development and help put China on the path to sustainable prosperity.<br />
It could also produce huge two-way investment and partnership opportunities. Europe should place itself at the heart of these, working with China to maximize the ambition and the opportunities and to build the shared technology standards that will shape a global low- carbon market.<br />
In China's case, low-carbon opportunity is matched by urgent low- carbon need. The pace of growth in China means average Chinese per- capita emissions could soon eclipse those of Europe. So while China has taken some very welcome steps, without a commitment from China to further decisive action, the efforts of others will be in vain.<br />
The emerging economies face a dilemma. Often they are the most vulnerable to the direct effects of climate change. But they are concerned that action against climate change will adversely affect their development. The challenge to all countries is to have a high- growth, low-carbon economy. Some, like Brazil, which derives nearly half its energy from clean and renewable resources, are rising to that challenge.<br />
India is another, embodying in microcosm the challenge that climate change poses to us all. Threatened by food, water and energy insecurity, India has responded with ambitious plans to generate 20 gigawatts of solar power by 2022.<br />
South Africa, a coal-dependent economy, the success of which is so important to growth and prosperity within the continent, has made a significant offer to deviate their emissions from the business-as- usual pathway.<br />
The opportunity is for the emerging economies -- for the emerging economies is to make a direct leap to low carbon, avoiding the high- carbon lock-in that we see in the developed world: a new, sustainable pathway for prosperity and security. A global low-carbon economy is not an idealist's pipe dream but a 21st-century realist's imperative. Countries that adapt quickly to a carbon-constrained world will be better able to deliver lasting prosperity for their citizens. As a Permanent Security Council member, I'm determined that the U.K. will play its full part in that, not least by supporting climate finance for the poorest.<br />
Collectively, we share a responsibility to those most vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Bangladesh, with its densely populated coastal region, is particularly susceptible to rising sea levels. Glacial melt, sea-level rises and El Nino-type events threaten the lives of millions across South America. And the very existence of many small island states is under threat.<br />
We have a shared vision to meet the Millennium Development Goals. But in a world without action on climate change, that vision will remain a dream, and the efforts of the last 10 years would<br />
So climate change is one of the gravest threats to our security and prosperity. Unless we take robust and timely action to deal with it, no country will be immune to its effects. However difficult it might seem now, a global deal under the U.N. is the only response to this threat which will create the necessary confidence to drive a low- carbon transition.<br />
We must be undaunted by the scale of the challenge.<br />
We must continue to strive for agreement. We must not accept that because there is no consensus on a way forward now, that there never will be one. And to change the debate, we must imaginatively deploy all of the foreign policy assets in our armory until we've shaped that global consensus.<br />
A successful response to climate change will not only stabilize the climate, but open the way to a future in which we can meet our needs through cooperation, in accordance with the ideals of the United Nations. Failure to do so will enhance competitive tendencies and make the world more dangerous, so this is not actually a hard choice.<br />
We have to get this right. If we do, we can still shape our world. And if we don't, the world will determine our destiny for us.<br />
Warming kills billions. Risks extinction.<br />

The hour is late. Leading climate scientists such as James Hansen are literally shouting at the top of their lungs that the world needs to reduce emissions by 20-40% as soon as possible, and 80-90% by the year 2050, if we are to avoid climate chaos, crop failures, endless wars, melting of the polar icecaps, and a disastrous rise in ocean levels. Either we radically reduce CO2 and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e, which includes all GHGs, not just CO2) pollutants (currently at 390 parts per million and rising 2 ppm per year) to 350 ppm, including agriculture-derived methane and nitrous oxide pollution, or else survival for the present and future generations is in jeopardy. As scientists warned at Copenhagen, business as usual and a corresponding 7-8.6 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperatures means that the carrying capacity of the Earth in 2100 will be reduced to one billion people. Under this hellish scenario, billions will die of thirst, cold, heat, disease, war, and starvation. If the U.S. significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, other countries will follow. One hopeful sign is the recent EPA announcement that it intends to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Unfortunately we are going to have to put tremendous pressure on elected public officials to force the EPA to crack down on GHG polluters (including industrial farms and food processors). Public pressure is especially critical since &quot;just say no&quot; Congressmen-both Democrats and Republicans-along with agribusiness, real estate developers, the construction industry, and the fossil fuel lobby appear determined to maintain &quot;business as usual.&quot;<br />

Born in Newfoundland, he received degrees from Canadian, American and British universities, finishing with a Ph.D. in Military and Middle Eastern History from the University of London. [Gwynne, &quot;The end of war,&quot; Toronto Star, 12/30, l/n]<br />
War is deeply embedded in our history and our culture, probably since before we were even fully human, but weaning ourselves away from it should not be a bigger mountain to climb than some of the other changes we have already made in the way we live, given the right incentives. And we have certainly been given the right incentives: The holiday from history that we have enjoyed since the early '90s may be drawing to an end, and another great-power war, fought next time with nuclear weapons, may be lurking in our future..<br />
The &quot;firebreak&quot; against nuclear weapons use that we began building after Hiroshima and Nagasaki has held for well over half a century now. But the proliferation of nuclear weapons to new powers is a major challenge to the stability of the system. So are the coming crises, mostly environmental in origin, which will hit some countries much harder than others, and may drive some to desperation.<br />
Add in the huge impending shifts in the great-power system as China and India grow to rival the United States in GDP over the next 30 or 40 years and it will be hard to keep things from spinning out of control. With good luck and good management, we may be able to ride out the next half-century without the first-magnitude catastrophe of a global nuclear war, but the potential certainly exists for a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">major die-back of human population</span>.<br />
We cannot command the good luck, but good management is something we can choose to provide. It depends, above all, on preserving and extending the multilateral system that we have been building since the end of World War II. The rising powers must be absorbed into a system that emphasizes co-operation and makes room for them, rather than one that deals in confrontation and raw military power. If they are obliged to play the traditional great-power game of winners and losers, then history will repeat itself and everybody loses.<br />
Our hopes for mitigating the severity of the coming environmental crises also depend on early and concerted global action of a sort that can only happen in a basically co-operative international system. <br />
When the great powers are locked into a military confrontation, there is simply not enough spare attention, let alone enough trust, to make deals on those issues, so the highest priority at the moment is to keep the multilateral approach alive and avoid a drift back into alliance systems and arms races. And there is no point in dreaming that we can leap straight into some never-land of universal brotherhood; we will have to confront these challenges and solve the problem of war within the context of the existing state system.<br />

<strong>If it is a war against extremists and militancy inside Pakistan, it is a civil war because its origins stem from the US, NATO occupation of neighboring Afghanistan. The conflict should be seen as an extension of the ongoing resistance of the Afghan people to alien domination. It is inaccurate to say that the US invaded Afghanistan because of the 9/11 attacks by Al-Qaeda. Former BBC correspondent George Arney reported on September 18, 2001, that Niaz Naik, the former Pakistani foreign secretary, had told him that he was informed by US officials at a UN-sponsored international contact group on Afghanistan in Berlin during July that year that unless Osama bin Laden were handed over swiftly, America would take military action to kill or capture both Bin Laden and Mullah Omar. The wider objective, however, was to topple the Taliban regime and install a transitional government under King Mohammad Zahir Shah. The invasion was to take place in mid-October 2001. Mr. Naik went on to say that he doubted that the US would have abandoned its plan to invade Afghanistan even if Osama were handed over by the Taliban. Arney's story is corroborated by the Guardian correspondent David Leigh in his report published on September 26, 2001, in which he revealed that the Taliban had received specific warning by the US through secret diplomacy in Berlin in July that the Bush Administration would topple the entire regime militarily unless Osama is extradited to the US. This was part of the larger design of US military, industrial complex to bring about regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. As the US needed bases in Pakistan to accomplish its pre-planned invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush Administration sought to use Islamabad as a cat's paw to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. Fortunately for President Bush, a usurper ruled there, devoid of all legitimacy, legal and moral, and he readily and willingly succumbed to US pressure and made a U-turn by severing all links with the Taliban. He even joined the war against Afghanistan instead of using his leverage with the Taliban to exhaust all means of peaceful settlement of the dispute. The entire region, including Pakistan, was declared a war zone by the US military command, and the flights of all passenger planes were prohibited over a certain altitude, while no merchant ships could enter the harbors of Pakistan, thus bringing maritime trade (which comprises approximately 95 percent of Pakistan's import-export trade) to a standstill. It is no wonder that Pakistan suffered a loss of 34 billion dollars because of its involvement in the Afghan war. America's War As one can see, it was America's war that was imposed upon Pakistan. Whether Pakistan could have avoided the war is a matter of controversy among politicians and political observers. But the war has fuelled insurgency in Pakistan's hitherto peaceful tribal territory adjacent to Afghanistan. This insurgency shows no sign of abatement, as terrorist attacks on military and civilian centers in the capital and major cities of the North-West Frontier Province and Punjab continue with a vengeance, posing threat to the security of the state. In the meantime, routine predator strikes by the US in Waziristan have taken a heavy toll of civilian lives amid accusations of Islamabad's complicity in the piratical attacks on tribespeople, which prompts them to resort to retaliatory strikes on the perpetrators. Not satisfied with Pakistan's military operations in the tribal region, the US Administration has compelled Islamabad's fragile government to pull out its troops from the tense Indo-Pak border and deploy them in the restive tribal belt along the Pak-Afghan border. Now Pakistan faces existential threat from the Taliban and not India, a perception which the country's military leadership is not prepared to share, given the unresolved disputes with New Delhi, which triggered four wars during the last 62 years. At the same time, speculation (not entirely unfounded) is rife about the involvement of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the former Blackwater (now christened Xe Services) in murder, mayhem, and gunrunning as evidenced by the armed Americans who drive consulate vehicles through cities and, when intercepted, refuse to disclose their identity. It is here that one recalls with dismay the role of General Stanley McChrystal, who until last year headed the Joint Special Operations Command, which runs drone attacks and targeted assassinations with the assistance of the operatives of the former Blackwater. This was revealed by Jeremy Scahill's investigative report published in the US weekly the Nation. That may, perhaps, solve the mystery surrounding a series of assassinations of ulama belonging to various Islamic movements. The sinister motive behind such acts of terror is to incite sectarian violence in Pakistan and lay the blame at the doors of religious extremists. Similar death squads were organized by the CIA in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to carry out political assassinations of nationalists who were opposed to US intervention. At the time, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua complained to the International Court of Justice about the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the violation of the country's airspace, the killing and kidnapping of individuals on the Nicaraguan territory, and the threat or use of force by the US. The court in its decision in June 1986 held that the US was in breach of the customary rules of international law and international humanitarian law. The above case is titled the &quot;Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua.&quot; The precedent set by this case may be invoked by Pakistan to prevent the US drone attacks on its territory. Once the piratical attacks of the US have stopped, the irritant in the tribal insurgency would have gone, paving the way for pacification of the conflict. If this were Pakistan's war, the government would have exercised its own judgment in dealing with the militants at home, either by conciliation or by resort to force. But Islamabad's so-called operation against militants is subordinated to US military designs in the region, aimed at the encirclement of the People's Republic of China and the control of the transit of gas pipelines from Central Asia to South Asia. It is not aimless that China expressed its concern over the concentration of US, NATO troops in the region. India fits in the American scheme of things, hence the US-India nuclear deal.</strong><br />
<strong>Pakistan's National Interest In this emerging security environment, Pakistan will have to be content with its role as a junior partner of India. Therefore, the sooner Islamabad extricates itself from the US &quot;war on terror,&quot; the better it is for its security and independence. Doesn't Islamabad realize that its military operation against the militants would leave its border with India vulnerable to a New Delhi offensive? If Pakistan permits the US to attack the suspected training centers of militants on its territory, will it be able to prevent India from doing so? With Islamabad embroiled in internecine strife, it cannot negotiate with India from a position of strength. It may be forced to make a compromise that might be detrimental to its national interest. Pakistan's preoccupation with tribal rebellion would not permit it to deal with separatist ethnic forces in Baluchistan. Undoubtedly, this is a threat to the territorial integrity of Pakistan. After the total failure of the military operation in Baluchistan, the federal government has come round to the painful conclusion that political and not military action can bring militancy to an end. Granting general amnesty to the dissidents and engaging them in a meaningful dialogue on contentious issues is a laudable initiative. The same gesture should be made to the militants in the tribal areas. But Islamabad has adopted double standards in dealing with the Baluchistan militants and the Pashtun militants, as if there were good militants and bad ones. This discriminatory policy would intensify the Pashtun insurgency and might drive them toward even more escalation. The rulers have seen the consequences of military operations in the former East Pakistan, Baluchistan, Karachi, Sind, and FATA (federally administered tribal areas). If anything, the situation has only worsened. The surge of US troops, the expansion of war beyond the borders of Afghanistan, and the attacks on Quetta and Muridke as envisaged by Obama's new strategy would mean that US troops are at war with the people of Pakistan.</strong><br />
<strong>Any Solution?</strong><br />
<strong>The Obama Administration would be better advised to concentrate on its exit strategy, and to that end, it is imperative that it involve the UN in its peace-making efforts aimed at the establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan, because the Karzai Government has no legitimacy. To fill the vacuum, the UN peacekeeping force, made up of troops of states not involved in the Afghan war, may be deployed until a government of national unity is able to assume full responsibility. Here the US can contribute to the postwar reconstruction of Afghanistan under the aegis of the UN. The insurgency in the tribal region is the spillover effect of US military occupation of Afghanistan, but Pakistan faces a far greater threat: the threat of ethnic violence as manifested in the bloody clashes among various linguistic groups in urban and rural Sind. These have been overshadowed by the counterinsurgency operations in FATA, but they may erupt at any moment, thus destabilizing the state.</strong><br />
<strong>Pakistan collapse causes nuclear war</strong><br />

<strong>But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep filled with troops today, killing five and wounding as many as 21, including several children who were waiting for a ride to school. Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. This, unfortunately, is a whole new ballgame. It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all. Pakistan is now trembling on the edge of violent chaos, and is doing so with nuclear weapons in its hip pocket, right in the middle of one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world. The situation in brief: Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan. All this is piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity in the region for more than half a century. The fact that Pakistan, and India, and Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons and share the same space means any ongoing or escalating violence over there has the real potential to crack open the very gates of Hell itself.</strong><br />

<strong>Recently, the Taliban made a military push into the northwest Pakistani region around the Swat Valley. According to a recent Reuters report: The (Pakistani) army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power last year and tried to reach a negotiated settlement. A peace accord fell apart in May 2008. After that, hundreds — including soldiers, militants and civilians — died in battles. Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools. About 1,200 people were killed since late 2007 and 250,000 to 500,000 fled, leaving the militants in virtual control. Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in the Swat valley and neighboring areas in a bid to take the steam out of the insurgency. The militants announced an indefinite cease-fire after the army said it was halting operations in the region. President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation imposing sharia in the area last month. But the Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner and another district adjacent to Swat, intent on spreading their rule. The United States, already embroiled in a war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, must now face the possibility that Pakistan could collapse under the mounting threat of Taliban forces there. Military and diplomatic advisers to President Obama, uncertain how best to proceed, now face one of the great nightmare scenarios of our time. &quot;Recent militant gains in Pakistan,&quot; reported The New York Times on Monday, &quot;have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as 'one of the very most serious problems we face.'&quot; &quot;Security was deteriorating rapidly,&quot; reported The Washington Post on Monday, &quot;particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbor al-Qaeda and the Taliban, intelligence chiefs reported, and there were signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistan's populous Punjabi heartland. The Pakistani government was mired in political bickering. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counterinsurgency fight. But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a U.S. combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.&quot; It is believed <span class="Underline">Pakistan is currently in possession of between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons</span>. Because Pakistan's stability is threatened by the wide swath of its population that shares ethnic, cultural and religious connections to the fundamentalist Islamic populace of Afghanistan, fears over what could happen to those nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government collapses are very real. &quot;As the insurgency of the Taliban and Al Qaeda spreads in Pakistan,&quot; reported the Times last week, &quot;senior American officials say they are increasingly concerned about new vulnerabilities for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, including the potential for militants to snatch a weapon in transport or to insert sympathizers into laboratories or fuel-production facilities. In public, the administration has only hinted at those concerns, repeating the formulation that the Bush administration used: that it has faith in the Pakistani Army. But that cooperation, according to officials who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the exchanges between Washington and Islamabad, has been sharply limited when the subject has turned to the vulnerabilities in the Pakistani nuclear infrastructure.&quot; &quot;The prospect of turmoil in Pakistan sends shivers up the spines of those U.S. officials charged with keeping tabs on foreign nuclear weapons,&quot; reported Time Magazine last month. &quot;Pakistan is thought to possess about 100 — the U.S. isn't sure of the total, and may not know where all of them are. Still, if Pakistan collapses, the U.S. military is primed to enter the country and secure as many of those weapons as it can, according to U.S. officials. Pakistani officials insist their personnel safeguards are stringent, but a sleeper cell could cause big trouble, U.S. officials say.&quot; In other words, a shaky Pakistan spells trouble for everyone, especially if America loses the footrace to secure those weapons in the event of the worst-case scenario. If Pakistani militants ever succeed in toppling the government, several very dangerous events could happen at once. Nuclear-armed India could be galvanized into military action of some kind, as could nuclear-armed China or nuclear-armed Russia. If the Pakistani government does fall, and all those Pakistani nukes are not immediately accounted for and secured, the specter (or reality) of loose nukes falling into the hands of terrorist organizations could place the entire world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster. We have all been paying a great deal of attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, and rightly so. The developing situation in Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner. The Obama administration appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.</strong><br />
<strong>The plan won’t cause Taliban takeover or terrorism and counterterrorism solves</strong><br />
ASG 8/16 <strong><span class="apple-style-span">—The Afghanistan Study Group, an ad hoc group of public policy practitioners, former U.S. government officials, academics, business representatives, policy-concerned activists and association leaders concerned with the Obama administration’s policy course in Afghanistan,</span></strong> 8/16/10, <strong><span class="apple-style-span">(“What’s Wrong With The Current U.S Strategy,” A New Way Forward: Rethinking U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan”)</span> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afghanistanstudygroup.org/2010/08/13/the-way-fo-rward-a-five-point-approach/" rel="nofollow">http://www.afghanistanstudygroup.org/2010/08/13/the-way-fo-rward-a-five-point-approach/</a></strong><br />
<strong>Second, a U.S. drawdown would not make Al Qaeda substantially more lethal. In order for events in Afghanistan to enhance Al Qaeda’s ability to threaten the U.S. homeland, three separate steps must occur: 1) the Taliban must seize control of a substantial portion of the country, 2) Al Qaeda must relocate there in strength, and 3) it must build facilities in this new “safe haven” that will allow it to plan and train more effectively than it can today.</strong><br />
<strong>Each of these three steps is unlikely, however, and the chances of all three together are very remote. For starters, a Taliban victory is unlikely even if the United States reduces its military commitment. The Taliban is a rural insurgency rooted primarily in Afghanistan’s Pashtun population, and its seizure of power in the 1990s was due to unusual circumstances that no longer exist and are unlikely to be repeated. Non-Pashtun Afghans now have ample experience with Taliban rule, and they are bound to resist any Taliban efforts to regain control in Kabul. Moreover, the U.S. military presence has helped the Taliban rally its forces, meaning that the group may well fragment and suffer a loss of momentum in the face of a U.S. drawdown. Surveys suggest that popular support for the Taliban among Afghans is in the single digits.</strong><br />
<strong>Even with significantly reduced troop levels, we can build a credible defense against a Taliban takeover through support for local security forces, strategic use of airpower, and deployment in key cities without committing ourselves to a costly and counterproductive COIN (counterinsurgency) campaign in the south. And if power-sharing and political inclusion is negotiated, the relevance of the Taliban as an alternative to Kabul is likely to decline.</strong><br />
<strong>And even if the Taliban were to regain power in some of Afghanistan, it would likely not invite Al Qaeda to re-establish a significant presence there. The Taliban may be reluctant to risk renewed U.S. attacks by welcoming Al Qaeda onto Afghan soil. Bin Laden and his associates may well prefer to remain in Pakistan, which is both safer and a better base from which to operate than isolated and land-locked Afghanistan.</strong><br />
<strong>Most importantly, no matter what happens in Afghanistan in the future, Al Qaeda will not be able to build large training camps of the sort it employed prior to the 9/11 attacks. Simply put, the U.S. would remain vigilant and could use air power to eliminate any Al Qaeda facility that the group might attempt to establish. Bin Laden and his associates will likely have to remain in hiding for the rest of their lives, which means Al Qaeda will have to rely on clandestine cells instead of large encampments. Covert cells can be located virtually anywhere, which is why the outcome in Afghanistan is not critical to addressing the threat from Al Qaeda.</strong><br />
<strong>In short, a complete (and unlikely) victory in Afghanistan and the dismantling of the Taliban would not make Al Qaeda disappear; indeed, it would probably have no appreciable effect on Al Qaeda. At the same time, dramatically scaling back U.S. military engagement will not significantly increase the threat from Al Qaeda.</strong><br />
<strong>Third, the current U.S. military effort is helping fuel the very insurgency we are attempting to defeat. An expanded U.S. presence has reinforced perceptions of the United States as a foreign occupier. Religious extremists have used the U.S. presence as an effective recruiting tool for their cause. Efforts to limit civilian casualties and other forms of collateral damage have been only partially successful, leading additional Afghans to take up arms against us.</strong><br />
<strong>Fourth, the expanded U.S. presence and a more energetic counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan and Pakistan have reinforced a tacit alliance among different extremist groups whose agendas are not identical. The Taliban is itself a loose coalition of Pashtuns, many of whom are motivated by local concerns rather than by any deep commitment to global jihad. Al Qaeda, by contrast, is a global network of radical Islamists seeking to topple governments throughout the Middle East. The “Pakistani Taliban” are a separate alliance of different Islamist groups challenging the authority of the Pakistani state. The Haqqani network in Waziristan is led by a local warlord who is strongly opposed to foreign interference but reportedly also a sometime ally of Pakistan’s Inter-Service Intelligence agency (ISI).</strong><br />
<strong>Although cooperation among these disparate groups has increased in recent years, this development is largely a reaction to the increased foreign presence in the region and our efforts to convince the Pakistani government to take more aggressive action against these groups. Thus, our current strategy is helping drive these groups together, when our real aim should be to drive wedges between as many of them as possible and to win over those who do not share Al Qaeda’s anti-Western agenda or its commitment to global jihad.</strong><br />
<strong>Fifth, keeping 100,000-plus U.S. troops in yet another Muslim country lends credence to jihadi propaganda about America’s alleged hostility to Islam. Their presence may actually be increasing the overall danger that we face back home. Anger at U.S. military action in the Af/Pak theater inspired Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen, to attempt an unsuccessful car bomb attack in Times Square, and other home-grown terrorists appear to have been inspired by similar motivations.</strong><br />

<strong>When General David Petraeus testifies today on Capitol Hill, his main job will be to carefully define the timeline for the beginning of America's exit from Afghanistan, a timeline that has stakeholders in Washington and throughout the region confused and concerned.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;As the President has stated, July 2011 is the point at which we will begin a transition phase in which the Afghan government will take more and more responsibility for its own security,&quot; <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Petraeus wrote</span></span> in his <span style="color: black;">advanced questions</span> submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee and obtained by <em>The Cable</em>. &quot;As the President has also indicated, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">July 2011 is not a date when we will be rapidly withdrawing our forces</span></span> and -switching off the lights and closing the door behind us.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">His job will</span></span> also <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">be to defend</span></span> President <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama's decision to set a public date for the beginning of the withdrawal in the first place</span></span>, by arguing that having a time line in the public discussion helps pressure the Afghans to move faster toward being able to govern and secure their country on their own.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;I believe <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">there was value in sending a message of urgency -- July 2011... But it is important that July 2011 be seen for what it is: the date when a process begins, in which the reduction of US forces must be based on the conditions at the time, and not a date when the U.S. heads for the exits</span></span>,&quot; he wrote to the committee. He stressed that multiple times that the pace of the drawdown would be &quot;conditions based.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>But even in his own writing to the committee, Petraeus acknowledged that the enemy, the Taliban and other insurgents in Afghanistan, are waiting out the coalition and biding their time until foreign forces decide to leave.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;Insurgent leaders view their tactical and operational losses in 2010 as inevitable and acceptable. The Taliban believe they can outlast the Coalition's will to fight and believe this strategy will be effective despite short-term losses. The Taliban also believe they can sustain momentum and maintain operational capacity,&quot; he wrote.</strong><br />
<strong>One of the main enablers of any U.S. exit is the development of the Afghan National Security Forces, which has not gone at the pace the coalition had hoped. Petraeus wrote that he would review the situation of the ANSF within four months of assuming command, if confirmed.</strong><br />
<strong>As of the latest review, only 5 out of 19 Afghan National Army brigades can function without a majority of their functions supported by the U.S., according to Petraeus, and only 2 out of 7 major headquarters can function properly without significant coalition support. As of June 27, there are 7,261 ANA troops in the city of Kandahar and 6,794 Afghan soldiers in Helmand province, Petraeus wrote.</strong><br />
<strong>He also said that a comprehensive plan to reintegrate some Taliban fighters is under final review with President Hamid Karzai and &quot;offers the potential to reduce violence and provide realistic avenues to assimilate Pashtun insurgents back into Afghanistan society.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>Petraeus promised to take a look at the rules of engagement that U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan feel are tying their hands in the fight, but he didn't say whether he was leaning toward changing them or not.</strong><br />
<strong>Meanwhile, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">confusion over the president's timeline persists both in Washington and abroad as interested parties try to interpret the July 2011 date in a way that serves their own political interests.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, said Monday that there would be &quot;<span style="color: black;">a serious drawdown</span>&quot; next summer, seemingly getting ahead of the administration in an effort to appease the liberal wing of her caucus, which is threatening to not support more funding for the war.</strong><br />
<strong>Two of the committee members Petraeus will face today, Sens. John McCain</strong>, <strong>R-AZ, and Lindsey Graham, R-SC, held a press conference Thursday to <span style="color: black;">announce their opposition</span> to setting any public date, no matter what the caveats.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Foreign leaders are especially confused, particularly the Afghan and Pakistani governments, who see a difference between public promises of drawdowns and private assurances from the administration </span></span>that the July 2011 date would not precipitate large scale troop reductions.</strong><br />
<strong>One high level diplomatic source said that Pakistani and Afghan leaders believe that they were told by National Security Advisor Jim Jones that there was not going to be a big withdrawal and the there would be &quot;no reduction in commitment&quot; in July 2011.</strong><br />
<strong>But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">regardless of whether the administration sent mixed messages, the nuance of their time line policy has been misunderstood or ignored in the region, as various actors start to plan strategies with the expectation that U.S. troops are leaving</span></span>.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;In retrospect, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">despite all the caveats, it was a mistake to put such a date certain for the beginning of withdrawal</span></span>,&quot; said Shuja Nawaz, director of the South Asia Center at the Atlantic Council. &quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The word beginning was lost and it strengthens the ability of different interests to hedge, which is exactly what they've been doing</span></span>.&quot;</strong><br />

<strong>Q1: General McChrystal is expected to request up to 40,000 additional troops and recommend a greater focus on counterinsurgency operations. Is this approach likely to succeed in strengthening the Afghan state, defeating the Taliban, and advancing America’s fight against terrorism?</strong><br />
<strong>A1: Probably not. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Counterinsurgency doctrine</span></span>, or COIN, has captured the hearts and minds of many in the D.C. policy community. Upon close inspection, however, it becomes clear that COIN, at least <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">as applied to Afghanistan, is built on a number of shaky assumptions. Consider:</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Even if</span></span> General <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">McChrystal gets all 40,000 troops</span></span> he has requested, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the combined</span></span> International Security Assistance Force (<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">ISAF</span></span>), Operation Enduring Freedom (<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">OEF), and Afghan contingent would still number less than 250,000—far fewer than the 670,000 troops the U.S. Army’s own Counterinsurgency Field Manual suggests is necessary to secure a state of Afghanistan’s size.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Widespread corruption in the</span></span> August 20 <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">election has widened the trust gap between the Karzai government and the Afghan people. Because successful counterinsurgency requires a government that is credible and responsive to its citizens, these developments threaten to derail the U.S. </span></span>and NATO <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">mission</span></span>. And as our experience in South Vietnam made painfully clear, the White House is usually powerless to force any host nation to enact good-government reforms.</strong><br />
<strong>General <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">McChrystal’s strategic review emphasizes “population protection” as the key to drying up support for the Taliban</span></span>. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The claim is based on the assumption that insurgencies require the backing</span></span>, or at least acquiescence, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">of surrounding communities</span></span> in order to function. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">But </span></span>a recent article in the <em>Washington Post</em> noted that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the Taliban rely primarily on foreign, rather than local, funding sources, a fact that suggests that population protection may ultimately do little to diminish the insurgency’s strength.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong>P<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">ublic support for a counterinsurgency campaign of such massive proportions simply does not exist.</span></span> Recent polls suggest that over 50 percent of Americans are against sending more troops to Afghanistan. And our European allies are even less enthusiastic about escalating the war.</strong><br />
<strong>Finally, the COIN framework is built on the larger assumption that eliminating the Taliban and stabilizing Afghanistan is the best use of American resources in the broader effort to combat terrorism. Al Qaeda’s presence in a pre-9/11, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan has convinced many officials that a Taliban takeover would result in al Qaeda’s inevitable return to the state. But al Qaeda already has established itself in Pakistan’s semi-governed spaces. Along with Taliban and other extremist militants, the group enjoys the relative safety of these territories, where Pakistani sovereignty precludes any substantive U.S. ground force. Even if al Qaeda were to reenter Afghanistan sometime in the future, the United States would face the same basic terrorist threats that it does today. Critics will argue that Afghanistan served as a base and planning center for 9/11. True enough; but al Qaeda, in establishing a presence in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen has already developed numerous “safe havens.” In short, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">our overwhelming focus on Afghanistan fails to serve a more nuanced counterterrorism strategy that acknowledges the many other areas in which al Qaeda operates</span></span>.</strong><br />
<strong>Q2: So how should the United States approach the war?</strong><br />
<strong>A2: We need to reframe our thinking about U.S. goals and the means to achieve them. As outlined above, COIN in Afghanistan is only tenuously linked to counterterrorism, the original purpose of our efforts. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Obama administration should implement a more minimalist policy in the region, one that employs special operations forces and airstrikes to directly target terrorists, especially leaders of cells</span></span>.</strong><br />
<strong>Critics charge that these operations are mere tactical successes, detached from any larger strategy. This is a disingenuous assessment. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Targeted strikes do, in fact, serve the greater strategic purpose of disrupting the planning and execution of terrorist attacks. Unlike COIN</span></span>—<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">which seems to harbor the grandiose notion of eliminating terrorism by transforming societies,</span></span> regardless of cost—<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">counterterrorism acknowledges that radicalism will always exist and that policymakers should directly seek to contain it.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong>At the core of this shift is an acknowledgment that our best Afghanistan policy is no better than our best Pakistan policy. ISAF and Afghan forces can do everything imaginable to eliminate Taliban influence in the country, but any effort that does not address the presence of militants in Pakistan’s semi-governed spaces ultimately does little to reduce the threat posed by al Qaeda. At a most basic level, the Obama administration must change the calculus of the Pakistani military and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) with regard to extremists in the country’s northwest. Doing so will force the United States to play a central role in rapprochement between Pakistan and India—and be a fair broker to both parties.</strong><br />
<strong>What about Afghanistan? Proponents of an “all-in” approach tend to misrepresent a minimalist strategy as complete withdrawal, arguing that the United States abandoned Afghanistan after the Soviet war and that doing so again would plunge the country into anarchy. But few serious analysts are talking about abandoning Afghanistan, and there is no reason to believe that a smaller, more specialized force would not be able to confront any resumption of al Qaeda activity in the country. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">As far as the Taliban are concerned, there is reason to believe that an ever-larger foreign troop presence simply swells the movement’s ranks </span></span>(to wit<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">: it has been dismaying to watch increased troop levels correlate with recent Taliban gains)</span></span>. Until the administration can convincingly demonstrate how additional troops will, in fact, support broader national security and counterterrorism goals, the United States is better served by a strategy that minimizes the loss of life and dizzying levels of expenditure that any “all-in” approach would entail.</strong><br />
<br />
Cross border sanctuaries, government corruption, tensions within the Afghan army and the utter failure of population protection all make this failure inevitable<br />

<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The coalition's strategy in Afghanistan is at an impasse. The renewed efforts undertaken since the summer of 2009 have failed to temper the guerrilla war. A few tactical successes are possible, but this war cannot be won. The coalition cannot defeat the Taliban as long as Pakistan continues to offer them sanctuary. And increasing resources to wage the war is not an option. The costs of continuing the war--to use Ambassador Karl Eikenberry's expression in the leaked telegram to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton--are &quot;astronomical.&quot;</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The entire U.S. strategy revolves around a swift Afghanization of the conflict, yet the coalition's Afghan partner is weaker than it was a year ago. The state's presence in the provinces has declined sharply and the legitimacy of President Hamid Karzai's government is contested.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">As a result of the massive fraud in the August 2009 presidential elections, the government has no popular legitimacy, and the legislative elections slated for fall 2010 will probably undermine the political system even further because fraud is inevitable. It is unlikely that the Afghan regime will ever be able to assume responsibility for its own security.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">As a result, the coalition faces an endless war accompanied by an intolerable loss of life and treasure. A less costly alternative would be to negotiate a broad agreement with the Taliban leadership to form a national unity government, with guarantees against al Qaeda's return to Afghanistan. But even if such negotiations might occur, they hold no guarantee of success.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Yet the cost of their failure is negligible compared with the potential gain: a relatively swift way out of the crisis that preserves the coalition's essential interests. Time is not on the coalition's side. The United States should contact Taliban leaders as soon as possible rather than waiting for the situation to deteriorate further.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">In pursuit of a losing strategy</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Taliban cannot be defeated militarily because the border with Pakistan is and will remain open for the insurgents. The Pakistani army, which refuses to launch an offensive against the Afghan Taliban, has never considered taking action against the Taliban leadership based in Pakistan. The February arrest of acting Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is probably a sign that the Pakistani military wants more control over the insurgency to prepare for the negotiation process.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">What's more, the insurgency is now nationwide and cannot be contained by counterinsurgency (COIN) operations in two or three southern provinces. The COIN strategy cannot succeed because of the immense resources it requires. In a marginal, strategically unimportant district such as Marjah, the coalition would have to keep thousands of troops for years to prevent the Taliban's return. To replicate such strategy, even in one province, would overstretch the U.S. military.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">In addition to COIN, military strategists think they can quickly weaken the Taliban through the creation of militias, the co-opting of Taliban groups and targeted assassinations. These policies will not strengthen the Afghan government's legitimacy or influence; to the contrary, they are destroying the Karzai government's credibility. The effects of this strategy are irreversible, and with the acceleration of political fragmentation, the coalition is faced with the prospect of a collapse of Afghan institutions.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The Karzai government is unlikely to engage in institutional reform, given that it is increasingly dependent on the networks that ensured its fraudulent re-election. Consequently, the coalition is having more and more trouble influencing Karzai. The weakness of the central political institutions means that the development of the army and the police force--the coalition's priorities--is occurring in a vacuum. Transferring security responsibilities to our Afghan partner will probably not be possible in the foreseeable future.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Afghans perceive their representative institutions as illegitimate. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of Afghan voters are believed to have supported Karzai during the 2009 presidential elections. All indications point to a high level of cynicism among the people and their rejection of the government; in fact, they massively refrained from voting even in places where security was reasonably good.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The legislative elections scheduled for September 2010 will further erode faith in the political system. The lack of security makes it impossible to hold credible elections in at least half of Afghanistan. And in February 2010, Karzai seized control of the ECC (Electoral Complaints Commission); there is no longer an independent institution to validate the process.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Aside from fraud and corruption, Karzai's lack of legitimacy is linked to his presumed lack of autonomy vis-à-vis the coalition. Internal U.S. Army studies, and the experiences of numerous journalists and researchers indicate that a majority of the population in combat zones now considers the foreign forces as occupiers. Military operations are polarizing the population against foreign forces and further weakening Karzai's regime, which appears irreparably unpopular and illegitimate. The coalition is perceived as the main provider of insecurity. Villagers do not want to see the establishment of coalition outposts that can bring only bombings and IEDs.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Furthermore, the coalition is hurt by the dependence of Karzai on his local allies, who generally oppose the coalition's objectives. The coalition is also undermined when the Afghan government aggressively distances itself from the coalition when civilians are killed by &quot;friendly fire.&quot;</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The failed Karzai government</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The government in Kabul is now too weak to reassert control over the periphery of the country. As a result, the coalition is increasingly dependent on local strongmen who it helped put in place or with whom it has worked.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The weakening of the Afghan regime is very bad news for the coalition, which is promoting Afghanization in order to reduce its own investment. It is hard to build a military that is independent of the institutional network that constitutes the state. Problems such as ethnic tensions, local and national corruption, and the lack of a clear purpose make it hard to motivate soldiers and officers.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The coalition should recognize that an autonomous Afghan army is a very distant goal. The coalition's large offensive to &quot;clear&quot; Taliban territory will not work, because the Afghan army and the police are not ready. If the coalition tries to secure Taliban territory on a long-term basis, it will overstretch itself and casualties will increase significantly.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Modest objectives would be more realistic. Most observers recognize the impossibility of a military solution. Nonetheless, different arguments have been put forward to reject negotiations. First, the coalition needs more time. Reinforcements are not yet fully in place, so talk of failure is premature. Second, experts such as Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid explain that the Taliban have reached the height of their influence, implying that the coalition would be in a stronger position in the future.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">One can counter that the coalition should begin negotiations now while it still has the means to exert military pressure. There is nothing to indicate that the Taliban are going to slow their advance. They are pursuing a strategy that includes expanding their influence in the cities. And nothing indicates that the Karzai regime won't be even weaker a year from now.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">From this perspective, the Afghan surge will have had the same result as all troop increases since 2003: a deterioration of security. Consequently, marginal military gains for the coalition in the next 18 months are the exact equivalent of a strategic defeat. Hence the need for a negotiated settlement.</span></span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="color: black;"> Over the winter break I had an epiphany about the interrelation of U.S. hard and soft power: <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">I</span></span> now <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">oppose a </span></span></span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">counterinsurgency</span></span> (COIN) <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">strategy</span></span><span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">in Afghanistan and advocate a purely counterterror</span></span> (CT) <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">strategy</span></span> (PDF link) there instead.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> Blame history—or histories—that I've read recently, starting with Livy's works on early Rome (books I-V) last spring and Donald Kagan's <em>The Peloponnesian War</em> at the end of 2009. I've taken occasional dips back into Robert Kaplan's <em>Warrior Politics</em> and his source materials (Churchill, the Federalists, Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and several others).</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> What I've taken from that reading is that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the U.S. must pull back</span></span> from its current efforts to remake Iraq and Afghanistan in the image of a Western democracy, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">or risk long-term political and economic exhaustion</span></span>.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> What follows is not an argument about morality, and readers may find much of it amoral. It <em>is</em> about making cold-blooded political and economic calculations about where U.S. national interests will lie in the next decade. They do not lie in an open-ended COIN mission.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> The history of the Peloponnesian War is particularly relevant here. Athens began fighting Sparta with the resources of an empire and thousands of talents of silver in the bank—enough to fight expensive, far-flung naval and land campaigns for three years without lasting financial consequences.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> Athens was <em>rich</em>, and if peace with Sparta had come by the end of the third year, Athens would have continued to prosper and rule over much of the Mediterranean. (Athens had a &quot;hard&quot;—conquered or cowed—empire as opposed to the &quot;soft&quot; empire of alliances and treaties the U.S. currently has.)</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> But the war with Sparta dragged on for decades, despite occasional peace overtures by both sides. By war's end—despite the spoils of battle and increased taxes and tribute extracted from its shrinking dominion—Athens was broke, depopulated by fighting and plague, bereft of its empire, and could no longer project power into the Mediterranean. Where its former interests ranged from Black Sea Turkey to southern Italy, it spent decades as a small-bore power and never regained its former strength or influence.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> I worry that the U.S. is similarly locked into an open-ended commitment to democratize a nation that is of regional rather than global importance—a parallel to Athens convincing itself that it had to conquer distant, militarily insignificant Sicily.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> &quot;Winning&quot; in Afghanistan</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The U.S. could &quot;win&quot; in Afghanistan</span></span> where victory is defined as a stable, legitimate central government that can project power within its own borders. I don't doubt that the U.S. and its allies could accomplish this given enough time and resources. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">But</span></span> I think—as many COIN experts also do—that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">it will take at least another decade or more of blood and treasure to produce such a result, if ever</span></span>.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> Of course I'd like to see the results of a successful COIN campaign: a stable democracy, women's rights, and general prosperity for Afghans, who among all Asia's peoples surely deserve those things. I certainly want to end al-Qa'ida's ability to operate freely in South Asia and elsewhere.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> The U.S. is the only country that would both conceive of these missions and attempt to carry them out. But goals beyond keeping al-Qa'ida on the run don't serve the long-term interests of the U.S., and I am more interested in regaining and preserving U.S. hard power than I am in the rewards that would come from &quot;winning&quot; a lengthy COIN war.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">I fear the U.S. people and government becoming exhausted from the costs of a lengthy COIN effort, just as they are already exhausted from</span></span> (and have largely forgotten about) the <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Iraq</span></span> war. I worry that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">if this fatigue sits in, the U.S. will abandon foreign-policy leadership</span></span> as it has done periodically throughout history.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">This outcome would be worse than a resurgent Taliban</span></span>, worse than Afghan women and men being further oppressed, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">and worse than al-Qa'ida having plentiful additional caves </span></span>to plot in.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> Here are some signs of an exhaustion of U.S. power: <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The U.S. is already overextended</span></span>, with commitments in Iraq (shrinking for now), Afghanistan (expanding), Yemen (pending) and Iran (TBD). At home, the U.S. economy remains feeble and in the long term is increasingly hostage to other nations for goods and services it no longer produces (and increasingly, no longer <em>can</em> produce).</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> Even more worrisome is the U.S. credit situation. The wars, and much other U.S. government spending, are now heavily underwritten by other countries' purchases of debt the U.S. issues. It has borrowed trillions from foreign countries and especially China, which continues its steady, highly rational policy of promoting exports while freeriding under the American security umbrella (just as the U.S. once rode for free beneath Britain's).</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> Over time, those countries accrue enough debt to have a say in U.S. policies that may threaten the dollar's value, which is why you now see high U.S. officials flying to Beijing to soothe PRC nerves and explain why America keeps borrowing money.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> At home, there are few resources to apply following a major disaster, such as a Katrina-style hurricane or a major earthquake.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The U.S. needs to start rebuilding its reserves—of capital, of credit, of political goodwill abroad, of military force—to be ready for these and more serious crises</span></span>, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">for which we currently have few resources to spare. Such challenges may involve humanitarian crises (think Darfur, a Rwanda-style genocide, Indian Ocean tsunamis);</span></span> Latin American instability (Mexico, Venezuela, post-Castro Cuba); <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">rogue-state nuclear development (Iran, North Korea); or complex challenges from a rising power (China, a reinvigorated Russia</span></span>).</span></strong><br />

Afghanistan is a quagmire sapping our morale and readiness.<br />
<span style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Kuhner, 9 - </span><strong><span style="color: black;">the president of the Edmund Burke Institute for American Renewal<span class="Underline"> <span style="text-decoration: none;">(Jeffrey, Washington Times, “Obama’s quagmire; US should look to its own interests,” 9/7, Lexis Academic) </span></span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">America is losing the war in Afghanistan. Rather than change course, President Obama is sending 21,000 additional U.S. troops. This will bring the total to 68,000 American soldiers fighting in Afghanistan, bolstering coalition forces to 110,000.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">The troop surge</span>, however, <span style="color: black;">will not work. Afghanistan has become</span> Mr.<span style="color: black;"> Obama's Vietnam - a protracted quagmire draining precious American blood and treasure. August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces, with 47 soldiers killed by Taliban insurgents. More than 300 coalition troops have died in 2009. This is the highest toll since the war began in 2001, and there are still four months to go. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The </span></span><span style="color: black;">tide of battle has turned against the West. The Taliban is resurgent. It has reasserted control over its southern stronghold in Kandahar. The Taliban is launching devastating attacks in the western and northern parts of the country - formerly stable areas. U.S. casualties are soaring. The morale of coalition forces is plummeting. Most of our allies - with the exception of the Canadians and the British - are reluctant to engage the Islamist militants. </span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">American public support for the war is waning.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">The conflict has dragged on for nearly eight years. (U.S. involvement in World War II was four years, World War I less than one.) Yet, America's strategic objectives remain incoherent and elusive.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">The war's initial aim was to topple the Taliban and eradicate al Qaeda bases from Afghan territory. Those goals have been achieved. Washington should have declared victory and focused on the more important issue: preventing Islamic fundamentalists from seizing power in Pakistan, along with its nuclear arsenal.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Instead, America is engaged in futile nation-building. Mr. Obama, like President George W. Bush before him, believes Afghanistan must be transformed by erecting a strong central government, democracy and a modern economy. Washington argues this will prevent terrorism from taking root and bring about lasting &quot;stability.&quot;</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Hence, following a recent reassessment of the war by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the Obama administration is contemplating deploying 20,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops - on top of the 21,000 already pledged. Moreover, billions have been spent building irrigation canals, schools, hospitals and factories. Civilian advisers are being sent to encourage farmers to grow other cash crops besides opium poppies. Western aid money has been used to establish a massive Afghan army, a large police force and a swollen government bureaucracy.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Gen. McChrystal said this week that the situation is &quot;serious,&quot; but not impossible. He still believes victory is within reach. His new strategy is to protect Afghan civilians from Taliban attacks. He also wants to create a lucrative jobs programs and improve local government services. The goal is to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of the Afghan people. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says we must combat Afghanistan's &quot;culture of poverty.&quot; Call it humanitarian war through social engineering.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Mr. Obama's policy will result in a major American defeat - one that will signal the end of America as a superpower and expose us to the world as a paper tiger. Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. The mighty British and Russian armies were humiliated in drawn-out guerrilla campaigns. The country's mountainous geography and primitive tribal culture are ideally suited for insurgent warfare. By sending in more troops, Washington is playing right into the Taliban's hands: We are enabling the Taliban to pick off our forces one by one as they wage a campaign of attrition.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">The Taliban blend with the local population, making it almost impossible for U.S. forces to distinguish combatants from civilians. American counterinsurgency efforts are thus alienating some of the locals. Initially welcomed as liberators, we are now viewed in some quarters as occupiers. Moreover, much of the West's aid money is siphoned off by greedy politicians in Kabul. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">President Hamid Karzai's government is corrupt, venal and ineffective. It barely controls one-third of the country. It is despised by many Afghans for its brutality and incompetence. In addition, Mr. Karzai's vice-presidential running mate is a drug trafficker.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">The West's efforts to forge a cohesive national state based on federalism and economic reconstruction have failed. Warlords are increasingly asserting power in the provinces. The country is fractured along tribal and ethnic lines. The center cannot hold: Afghanistan remains mired in anarchy, blood feuds and weak, decentralized rule.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">U.S. troops should be deployed to defend U.S. national interests. Their lives should never be squandered for an experiment in liberal internationalism. In fact, such a policy is morally grotesque and strategically reckless.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Mr. Obama should quickly withdraw most U.S. forces from Afghanistan. American air power and small, flexible Special Forces units are more than enough to wipe out al Qaeda terrorists. The Taliban is too hated to reoccupy the country - unless our huge military and economic footprint drives numerous </span>Afghans into the<span style="color: black;"> evil, welcoming arms of extremists.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black;">This will obliterate primacy</span><br />

<strong><span style="color: black;">If the Soviet Union could not win after eight years of fighting in Afghanistan, what makes our leaders think that we can? The longer we keep large numbers of our troops bogged down fighting two no-win counterinsurgency wars of attrition in Iraq and Afghanistan, the weaker and more vulnerable we will become to the point where eventually the American Empire, as some call it, may decline precipitously or perhaps even collapse altogether. Worse yet, America’s increasing military weakness highlighted further by Obama’s ongoing demolition of our nuclear deterrent, might invite a catastrophic attack from our from our Sino-Russian alliance enemies.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Already some of our retired generals have stated that they believe our Army and Marine Corps ground forces have been broken by their over-deployment in</span></span><span style="color: black;"> the desert sands of Iraq and <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Afghanistan. This high tempo of deployments has resulted in much of our military equipment to break down while procurement and readiness are at their lowest levels over the past quarter century</span></span>. Our national security always suffers when we get bogged down in wars where our troops are asked to bleed and die, but are not permitted by our political leaders to win. Our brave soldiers should never be allowed to sacrifice in this way without the hope of victory! The best way to support our troops is to bring them home to their families and make a commitment that we will not let a week go by without thanking a soldier for their willingness to risk life and limb to defend us all.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">What is it going to take to get our political leaders to realize that the costs of staying and fighting the long war in Iraq and Afghanistan greatly outweigh the costs of redeploying out of theater? The same voices we hear calling for us to send another 40,000 to 100,000 troops to Afghanistan are the ones that would have called for us to keep surging and fighting in Vietnam in perpetuity at the cost of hundreds of thousands of our soldiers lives. It didn’t make sense to do that then and it doesn’t make sense to do so now. Ronald Reagan won the Cold War against the Evil Soviet Empire in part by employing proxies to fight and win our battles for us.

Heg is good<br />
<span style="color: black;">Thayer, 6 - </span><strong><span style="color: black;">professor of security studies at Missouri State (Bradley, The National Interest, “In Defense of Primacy”, November/December, p. 32-37)</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">A grand strategy based on American primacy means ensuring the United States stays the world's number one power‑the diplomatic, economic and military leader. Those arguing against primacy claim that the United States should retrench, ei­ther because the United States lacks the power to maintain its primacy and should withdraw from its global commitments, or because the maintenance of primacy will lead the United States into the trap of &quot;imperial overstretch.&quot; In the previous issue of The National Interest, Christopher Layne warned of these dangers of pri­macy and called for retrenchment.1 Those arguing for a grand strategy of retrenchment are a diverse lot. They include isolationists, who want no foreign military commitments; selective engagers, who want U.S. military commitments to centers of economic might; and offshore balancers, who want a modified form of selective engagement that would have the United States abandon its landpower presence abroad in favor of relying on airpower and seapower to defend its in­terests. But retrenchment, in any of its guis­es, must be avoided. If the United States adopted such a strategy, it would be a profound strategic mistake that would lead to far greater instability and war in the world, imperil American security and deny the United States and its allies the benefits of primacy. There are two critical issues in any discussion of America's grand strategy: Can America remain the dominant state? Should it strive to do this? America can remain dominant due to its prodigious military, economic and soft power capa­bilities. The totality of that equation of power answers the first issue. The United States has overwhelming military capa­bilities and wealth in comparison to other states or likely potential alliances. Barring some disaster or tremendous folly, that will remain the case for the foreseeable future. With few exceptions, even those who advocate retrenchment acknowledge this. So the debate revolves around the desirability of maintaining American pri­macy. Proponents of retrenchment focus a great deal on the costs of U.S. action­ but they fall to realize what is good about American primacy. The price and risks of primacy are reported in newspapers every day; the benefits that stem from it are not. A GRAND strategy of ensur­ing American primacy takes as its starting point the protec­tion of the U.S. homeland and American global interests. These interests include ensuring that critical resources like oil flow around the world, that the global trade and monetary regimes flourish and that Washington's worldwide network of allies is reassured and protected. Allies are a great asset to the United States, in part because they shoulder some of its burdens. Thus, it is no surprise to see NATO in Afghanistan or the Australians in East Timor. In contrast, a strategy based on re­trenchment will not be able to achieve these fundamental objectives of the United States. Indeed, retrenchment will make the United States less secure than the present grand strategy of primacy. This is because threats will exist no mat­ter what role America chooses to play in international politics. Washington can­not call a &quot;time out&quot;, and it cannot hide from threats. Whether they are terror­ists, rogue states or rising powers, his­tory shows that threats must be confront­ed. Simply by declaring that the United States is &quot;going home&quot;, thus abandoning its commitments or making unconvinc­ing half‑pledges to defend its interests and allies, does not mean that others will respect American wishes to retreat. To make such a declaration implies weak­ness and emboldens aggression. In the anarchic world of the animal kingdom, </span></strong>predators prefer to eat the weak rather than confront the strong<strong>. The same is true of the anarchic world of interna­tional politics. If there is no diplomatic solution to the threats that confront the United States, then the conventional and strategic military power of the United States is what protects the country from such threats. And when enemies must be confront­ed, a strategy based on primacy focuses on engaging enemies overseas, away from .American soil. Indeed, a key tenet of the Bush Doctrine is to attack terrorists far from America's shores and not to wait while they use bases in other countries to plan and train for attacks against the United States itself. This requires a phys­ical, on‑the‑ground presence that cannot be achieved by offshore balancing. Indeed, as Barry Posen has noted, U.S. primacy is secured because America, at present, commands the &quot;global com­mon&quot;‑‑the oceans, the world's airspace and outer space‑allowing the United States to project its power far from its borders, while denying those common avenues to its enemies. As a consequence, the costs of power projection for the United States and its allies are reduced, and the robustness of the United States' conventional and strategic deterrent ca­pabilities is increased.' This is not an advantage that should be relinquished lightly. A remarkable fact about international politics today‑-in a world where Ameri­can primacy is clearly and unambiguous­ly on display--is that countries want to align themselves with the United States. Of course, this is not out of any sense of altruism, in most cases, but because doing so allows them to use the power of the United States for their own purposes, ­their own protection, or to gain greater influence. Of 192 countries, 84 are allied with America‑-their security is tied to the United States through treaties and other informal arrangements‑and they include almost all of the major economic and military powers. That is a ratio of almost 17 to one (85 to five), and a big change from the Cold War when the ratio was about 1.8 to one of states aligned with the United States versus the Soviet Union. Never before in its history has this coun­try, or any country, had so many allies. U.S. primacy‑-and the bandwagon­ing effect‑has also given us extensive in­fluence in international politics, allowing the United States to shape the behavior of states and international institutions. Such influence comes in many forms, one of which is America's ability to cre­ate coalitions of like‑minded states to free Kosovo, stabilize Afghanistan, invade Iraq or to stop proliferation through the Pro­liferation Security Initiative (PSI). Doing so allows the United States to operate with allies outside of the where it can be stymied by opponents. American‑led wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq stand in contrast to the UN's inability to save the people of Darfur or even to conduct any military campaign to realize the goals of its charter. The quiet effec­tiveness of the PSI in dismantling Libya's WMD programs and unraveling the A. Q. Khan proliferation network are in sharp relief to the typically toothless attempts by the UN to halt proliferation. You can count with one hand coun­tries opposed to the United States. They are the &quot;Gang of Five&quot;: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Venezeula. Of course, countries like India, for example, do not agree with all policy choices made by the United States, such as toward Iran, but New Delhi is friendly to Washington. Only the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; may be expected to consistently resist the agenda and ac­tions of the United States. China is clearly the most important of these states because it is a rising great power. But even Beijing is intimidated by the United States and refrains from openly challenging U.S. power. China proclaims that it will, if necessary, re­sort to other mechanisms of challenging the United States, including asymmetric strategies such as targeting communica­tion and intelligence satellites upon which the United States depends. But China may not be confident those strategies would work, and so it is likely to refrain from testing the United States directly for the foreseeable future because China's power benefits, as we shall see, from the international order U.S. primacy creates. The other states are far weaker than China. For three of the &quot;Gang of Five&quot; cases‑‑Venezuela, Iran, Cuba‑it is an anti‑U.S. regime that is the source of the problem; the country itself is not intrin­sically anti‑American. Indeed, a change of regime in Caracas, Tehran or Havana could very well reorient relations.</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power‑‑Rome, Britain or the United States today. Schol­ars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of when we con­sider the current international order‑free trade, a robust monetary regime, increas­ing respect for human rights, growing de­mocratization‑‑is directly linked to U.S. power. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it. In that they are dead wrong and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons: Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages fol­lowed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles. With­out U.S. power, the liberal order cre­ated by the United States will end just as assuredly. </span>As country and western great Rai Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washing­ton and the world.</strong><br />
<strong>The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today,<span style="color: black;"> American primacy helps keep a number of complicated rela­tionships aligned‑-between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. Wars still occur where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly war's worst form: </span></strong>great power wars<strong>.</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Second, American power gives the United States the ability to spread de­mocracy </span>and other elements of its ideol­ogy of liberalism. Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview.3 So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition, <span style="color: black;">once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced. This is not because democracies do not have clashing inter­ests. Indeed they do. Rather, it is because they are more open, more transparent and more likely to want to resolve things amicably in concurrence with U.S. lead­ership. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States. Critics have faulted the Bush Admin­istration for attempting to spread democ­racy in the Middle East, labeling such an effort a modern form of tilting at windmills. It is the obligation of Bush's crit­ics to explain why democracy is good enough for Western states but not for the rest, and, one gathers from the argument, should not even be attempted. Of course, whether democracy in the Middle East will have a peaceful or sta­bilizing influence on America's interests in the short run is open to question. Per­haps democratic Arab states would be more opposed to Israel, but nonetheless, their people would be better off. The United States has brought democracy to Afghanistan, where 8.5 million Af­ghans, 40 percent of them women, voted in a critical October 2004 election, even though remnant Taliban forces threat­ened them. The first free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. It was the military power of the United States that put Iraq on the path to democracy. Wash­ington fostered democratic governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Caucasus. Now even the Middle East is increasingly democratic. They may not yet look like Western‑style democracies, but democratic progress has been made in Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, Ku­wait, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt. By all accounts, the march of democracy has been impressive. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Third, along with the growth in the number of democratic states around the world has been the growth of the glob­al economy. With its allies, the United States has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network character­ized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, and mo­bility of capital and labor markets. The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is a glob­al public good from which all states ben­efit, particularly the poorest states in the Third World. The United States created this network not out of altruism but for the benefit and the economic well‑being of America. This economic order forces American industries to be competitive, maximizes efficiencies and growth, and benefits defense as well because the size of the economy makes the defense burden manageable. Economic spin‑offs foster the development of military technology, helping to ensure military prowess. Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the economic network comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat and researcher at the World Bank, who started his ca­reer confident in the socialist ideology of post‑independence India. Abandoning the positions of his youth, Lal now recog­nizes that the only way to bring relief to desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the adoption of free market economic policies and globaliza­tion, which are facilitated through Amer­ican primacy.4 As a witness to the failed alternative economic systems, Lal is one of the strongest academic proponents of American primacy due to the economic prosperity it provides. </span></strong><br />

<strong>There is an anomaly in this strategy, however. Where the United States previously had devolved operational responsibility to allied groups, or simply hunkered down, this strategy tries to return to devolved responsibilities by first surging U.S. operations. The fourth phase actually increases U.S. operational responsibility in order to reduce it.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">From <span style="color: black;">the grand strategic point of view</span>, the United States needs to withdraw from Afghanistan, a landlocked country where U.S. forces are dependent on tortuous supply lines</span></span>. Whatever <span style="color: black;">Afghanistan’s vast mineral riches</span>, mining them in the midst of war is not going to happen. More important, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is overcommitted in the region and lacks a strategic reserve of ground forces.</span></span> Afghanistan ultimately is not strategically essential, and this is why the United States has not historically used its own forces there.</strong><br />
<strong>Obama’s attempt to return to that track after first increasing U.S. forces to set the stage for the political settlement that will allow a U.S. withdrawal is hampered by the need to begin terminating the operation by 2011 (although there is no fixed termination date). It will be difficult to draw coalition partners into local structures when the foundation — U.S. protection — is withdrawing. Strengthening local forces by 2011 will be difficult. Moreover, <span style="color: black;">the Taliban’s motivation</span> to enter into talks is limited by the early withdrawal. At the same time, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">with no ground combat strategic reserve, the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is vulnerable elsewhere in the world, and the longer the Afghan drawdown takes, the more vulnerable it becomes</span></span> (hence the 2011 deadline in Obama’s war plan).</strong><br />
<strong>In sum, this is the quandary inherent in the strategy: <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">It is necessary to withdraw as early as possible</span></span>, but early withdrawal undermines both coalition building and negotiations. The recruitment and use of indigenous Afghan forces must move extremely rapidly to hit the deadline (though officially on track quantitatively, there are serious questions about qualitative measures) — hence, the aggressive operations that have been mounted over recent months. But the correlation of forces is such that the United States probably will not be able to impose an acceptable political reality in the time frame available. Thus, Afghan President Hamid Karzai is said to be opening channels directly to the Taliban, while the Pakistanis are increasing their presence. Where a vacuum is created, regardless of how much activity there is, someone will fill it.</strong><br />
<strong>Therefore, the problem is to define how important Afghanistan is to American global strategy, bearing in mind that <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the forces absorbed in</span></span> Iraq and <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Afghanistan have left the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">vulnerable elsewhere in the world</span></span>. The current strategy defines the Islamic world as the focus of all U.S. military attention. But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the world has rarely been so considerate as to wait until the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is finished with one war before starting another. Though unknowns remain unknowable, a principle of warfare is to never commit all of your reserves in a battle — one should always maintain a reserve for the unexpected. Strategically, it is imperative that the United States begin to free up forces and re-establish its ground reserves</span></span>.</strong><br />

Shift to counterterrorism focus creates sustainable presence<br />
Stewart, 9 - <strong><span class="apple-style-span">Ryan Family Professor of the Practice of Human Rights and Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, studied at Oxford and served briefly in the British army before working in the diplomatic service in Indonesia and as British representative to Montenegro (9/16/09, Rory, “The Future of Afghanistan,” </span><span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4573:http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan" rel="nofollow">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/testimonies/rory-stewart-on-afghanistan</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4573 --></span>)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The best Afghan policy would be to reduce the number of foreign troops from the current level of 90,000 to far fewer – perhaps 20,000. In that case, two distinct objectives would remain for the international community: development and counter-terrorism. Neither would amount to the building of an Afghan state or winning a counter-insurgency campaign. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">A</span></span> reduction in troop numbers and a turn away from state-building should not mean total withdrawal: good projects could continue to be undertaken in electricity, water, irrigation, health, education, agriculture, rural development and in other areas favoured by development agencies. Even a light US presence could continue to allow for aggressive operations against Al Qaeda terrorists, in Afghanistan, who plan to attack the United States. The US has successfully prevent Al Qaeda from re-establishing itself since 2001 (though the result has only been to move bin Laden across the border.). The US military could also (with other forms of assistance) support the Afghan military to prevent the Taliban from seizing a city or taking over the country.</strong><br />
<strong>These twin objectives will require a very long-term presence, as indeed is almost inevitable in a country which is as poor, as fragile and traumatized as Afghanistan (and which lacks the internal capacity at the moment to become independent of Foreign aid or control its territory). But a long-term presence will in turn mean a much lighter and more limited presence (if it is to retain US domestic support). We should not control and cannot predict the future of Afghanistan. It may in the future become more violent, or find a decentralised equilibrium or a new national unity, but if its communities continue to want to work with us, we can, over 30 years, encourage the more positive trends in Afghan society and help to contain the more negative.</strong><br />
<strong>Such a policy can seem strained, unrealistic, counter-intuitive and unappealing. They appear to betray the hopes of Afghans who trusted us and to allow the Taliban to abuse district towns. No politician wants to be perceived to have underestimated, or failed to address, a terrorist threat; or to write off the ‘blood and treasure’ that we have sunk into Afghanistan; or to admit defeat. Americans are particularly unwilling to believe that problems are insoluble; Obama’s motto is not ‘no we can’t’; soldiers are not trained to admit defeat or to say a mission is impossible. And to suggest that what worked in Iraq won’t work in Afghanistan requires a detailed knowledge of each country’s past, a bold analysis of the causes of development and a rigorous exposition of the differences, for which few have patience.</strong><br />
<strong>The greatest risk of our inflated ambitions and fears, encapsulated in the current surge is that it will achieve the exact opposite of its intentions and in fact <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">precipitate a total withdrawal</span>.</strong> The heavier our footprint, and the more costly, the less we are likely to be able to sustain it. <strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Public opinion is already turning against it.</span></span> Nato allies are mostly staying in Afghanistan simply to please the United States and have little confidence in our objectives or our reasons. Contemporary political culture tends to encourage black and white solutions: either we garrison or we abandon.</strong><br />
<strong>While, I strongly oppose troop increases, I equally strongly oppose a total flight. We are currently in danger of <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">lurching from troop increases to withdrawal and from engagement to isolation</span>. We are threatening to provide instant electro-shock therapy followed by abandonment. This is the last thing Afghanistan needs. The international community should aim to provide a patient, tolerant long-term relationship with a country as poor and traumatized as Afghanistan. Judging by comparable countries in the developing world (and Afghanistan is very near the bottom of the UN Human Development index), making Afghanistan more stable, prosperous and humane is a project which will take decades. It is a worthwhile project in the long-term for us and for Afghans but we will only be able to sustain our presence if we massively reduce our investment and our ambitions and begin to approach Afghanistan more as we do other poor countries in the developing world. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The best way of avoiding the mistakes of the</span></span> 1980s and <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">1990s – the familiar cycle of investment and abandonment which most Afghan expect and fear and which have contributed so much to instability and danger - is to</span></span> husband and conserve our resources, limit our objectives to counter-terrorism and humanitarian assistance and work out how to work with fewer troops and less money over a longer period. In Afghanistan in the long-term, less will be more.'</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">But this moderate tone gains Obama the leverage that Bush lacked.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> As long as the <span class="caps">US</span> asserted that Afghanistan was an existential threat, the front line in the war on terror, and that, therefore, failure was not an option, the <span class="caps">US</span> had no leverage over Karzai. The worse Afghanistan behaved—the more drugs it grew and terrorists it fostered—the more money it received. If it sorted out its act, it risked being relegated to a minor charitable recipient like Tajikistan. A senior Afghan official warned me this year “to stop referring to us as a humanitarian crisis: we must be the number one terrorist threat in the world, because if we are not we won’t get any money.” <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">By asserting convincingly that Afghanistan is not the be-all and end-all and that the US could always ultimately withdraw, Obama</span></span> escapes this codependent trap and <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">regains some leverage over the Afghan government</span></span>. In his politer words: </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">But perhaps even more importantly, defining a more moderate and limited strategy gives him leverage over his own generals. By refusing to endorse or use the language of counterinsurgency in the speech, he escapes their doctrinal logic. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">By no longer committing the US to defeating the Taliban or state-building, he dramatically reduces the objectives and the costs of the mission</span></span>. By talking about costs, the fragility of public support, and other priorities, he reminds the generals why this surge must be the last. All of this serves to “cap” the troop increases at current levels and provide the justification for beginning to reduce numbers in 2011. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">But the brilliance of its moderate arguments cannot overcome that statement about withdrawal. With seven words, “our troops will begin to come home,” he loses leverage over the Taliban, as well as leverage he had gained over Karzai and the generals</span></span><span style="color: black;">. It is a cautious, lawyerly statement, expressed again as “[we will] begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011.” It sets no final exit date or numbers. But the Afghan students who were watching the speech with me ignored these nuances and saw it only as departure. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">This may be fatal for Obama’s ambition to “open the door” to the Taliban</span></span><span style="color: black;">. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The lighter,</span></span></span><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> more political,<span style="color: black;"> and less but still robust militarized presence that his argument implies could facilitate a deal with the Taliban, if it appeared semi-permanent.</span></span></span><span style="color: black;"> As the President asserted, the Taliban are not that strong. They have nothing like the strength or appeal that they had in 1995. They cannot take the capital, let alone recapture the country. There is strong opposition to their presence, particularly in the center and the north of the country. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Their only hope is to negotiate. But the Taliban need to acknowledge this. And the only way they will is if they believe that we are not going to allow the Kabul government to collapse</span></span>. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Afghanistan has been above all a project not of force but of patience. It would take decades before Afghanistan achieved the political cohesion, stability, wealth, government structures, or even basic education levels of Pakistan. A political settlement requires a reasonably strong permanent government. The best argument against the surge, therefore, was never that a <span class="caps">US</span> operation without an adequate Afghan government partner would be unable to defeat the Taliban—though it won’t. Nor that the attempt to strengthen the <span class="caps">US</span> campaign will intensify resistance, though it may. Nor because such a deployment of over 100,000 troops at a cost of perhaps $100 billion a year would be completely disproportional to the <span class="caps">US</span>’s limited strategic interests and moral obligation in Afghanistan—though that too is true. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Instead, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama should not have requested more troops because doing so intensifies opposition to the war</span></span> in the <span class="caps">US</span> and Europe <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">and accelerates the pace of withdrawal demanded by political pressures at home. To keep domestic consent for a long engagement we need to <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">limit troop numbers</span></span></span> and in particular limit our casualties. The surge is a Mephistophelian bargain, in which the President has gained force but lost time. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">What can now be done to <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">salvage the administration’s position</span>?</span></span><span style="color: black;"> Obama has acquired leverage over the generals and some support from the public by making it clear that he will not increase troop strength further. He has gained leverage over Karzai by showing that he has options other than investing in Afghanistan. Now <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">he needs to regain leverage over the Taliban by showing them that he is not about to abandon Afghanistan </span></span>and that their best option is to negotiate. In short, he needs to follow his argument for a call strategy to its conclusion. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The date of withdrawal <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">should be recast </span>as a time for reduction to a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">lighter, more sustainable, and more permanent presence</span></span></span>. This is what the administration began to do in the days following the speech. As National Security Adviser General James Jones said, “That date is a ‘ramp’ rather than a cliff.” And as Hillary Clinton said in her congressional testimony on December 3, their real aim should be to “develop a long-term sustainable relationship with Afghanistan and Pakistan so that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, primarily our abandonment of that region.”</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">A more realistic, affordable, and therefore sustainable presence would not make Afghanistan stable or predictable. It would be merely a small if necessary part of an Afghan political strategy. The </span><span class="caps"><span style="color: black;">US</span></span><span style="color: black;"> and its allies would only moderate, influence, and fund a strategy shaped and led by Afghans themselves. The aim would be to knit together different Afghan interests and allegiances sensitively enough to avoid alienating independent local groups, consistently enough to regain their trust, and robustly enough to restore the security and justice that Afghans demand and deserve from a national government. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">What would this look like in practice? Probably a mess. It might involve a tricky coalition of people we refer to, respectively, as Islamists, progressive civil society, terrorists, warlords, learned technocrats, and village chiefs. Under a notionally democratic constitutional structure, it could be a rickety experiment with systems that might, like Afghanistan’s neighbors, include strong elements of religious or military rule. There is no way to predict what the Taliban might become or what authority a national government in Kabul could regain. Civil war would remain a possibility. But an intelligent, long-term, and tolerant partnership with the United States could reduce the likelihood of civil war and increase the likelihood of a political settlement. This is hardly the stuff of sound bites and political slogans. But it would be better for everyone than boom and bust, surge and flight. With the right patient leadership, a political strategy could leave Afghanistan in twenty years’ time more prosperous, stable, and humane than it is today. That would be excellent for Afghans and good for the world.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Meanwhile, Obama’s broader strategic argument must not be lost. He has grasped that the foreign policy of the president should not consist in a series of extravagant, brief, Manichaean battles, driven by exaggerated fears, grandiloquent promises, and fragile edifices of doctrine. Instead <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the foreign policy of a great power should be the responsible exercise of limited power and knowledge in concurrent situations of radical uncertainty.</span></span> Obama, we may hope, will develop this elusive insight. And then <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">it might become possible to find the right places in which to deploy the wealth, the courage, and the political capital of the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">We might hope in South Asia,</span></span> for example, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">for a lighter involvement in Afghanistan but a much greater focus on Kashmir</span></span>.1 </span></strong><br />

 The Stalemate in Afghanistan limits Obama’s ability to effectively reorient foreign policy towards effective diplomacy<br />
Fernholz, 10 <strong>– writing fellow at the American Prospect and Research Fellow at the New America Foundation (Tim, The American Prospect, “The Ultimate Test Case,” March, 2010, lexis) Katulis = security policy analyst at the Center for American Progress</strong><br />
<strong>Obama's final decision in December offered something for everyone, or tried to: The U.S. would deploy an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan, fewer than McChrystal requested but still a tripling of the troop commitment to the conflict since Obama's inauguration. The strategy was virtually unchanged from what Obama had offered in the spring. The goal also remained the same: &quot;to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan and to prevent their return to either country in the future.&quot; <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama's plan echoed the surge he opposed in Iraq: An escalation to protect civilians in population centers and train Afghan security forces</span></span> that will, in theory, reverse the momentum of the insurgents and even co-opt those who are willing to lay down their arms. Along with aid from a &quot;civilian surge&quot; of U.S. officials and contractors with expertise in engineering, agriculture, justice, and local politics, the hope is that this will give the Afghan government time to recover from corruption and incompetence (the euphemism is &quot;capacity building&quot;).</strong><br />
<strong>The one new development was a timeline: In July of 2011, the U.S. will start handing over responsibilities to the Afghans so that coalition forces can begin to withdraw. The president insisted on this timeline, and it remains the single most progressive aspect of the plan--a recognition that, in the greater scheme of things, the U.S. has better things to do for its national security than muck about in Afghanistan.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;Any American president has to think about the political sustainability of his policies, and an American president that launches into policies that he can't sustain politically isn't doing his job,&quot; Hurlburt says. &quot;That's true of Obama, that's true of Bush, it's true of everybody. You look at some of the things that Bush started and couldn't sustain--that's the worst of all possible worlds.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong><span class="bold">OBAMA'S TINKERING AROUND THE EDGES</span>--the timeline, the counterinsurgency strategy, the emphasis on development, the whole-of-government approach--marks a real departure from the previous administration's efforts. His rhetoric still holds the promise of the overhaul he campaigned on. But <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the president's failure to fundamentally reorient the Afghan conflict has broad ramifications for his</span></span> promised <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">foreign-policy </span></span>reforms.</strong><br />
<strong>Perhaps the most significant loss is the big picture. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Nearly 100,000 troops are committed to pursuing Obama's &quot;narrow goal&quot; of defeating al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.</span></span> But is this extensive involvement in an Afghan civil war the best way to fight al-Qaeda and like-minded groups? After all, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">one of al-Qaeda leaders' stated goals is drawing the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> into expensive and intractable long-term conflicts. Even as we're leaving Iraq, doubling-down on Afghanistan plays into their hands.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong>&quot;We did not ask for this fight,&quot; the president said in a major speech on Afghanistan in December. &quot;On September 11, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people.&quot; It was an explanation straight out of the Bush era. Much of the 9-11 operation was carried out not in Afghanistan or Pakistan (or Iraq, for that matter) but in places like Germany and Florida. And terrorism experts warn that officials should not take for granted that al-Qaeda could re-establish a safe haven in Afghanistan, or that such safe havens are threats to the United States. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The administration admits that fewer than 100 al-Qaeda terrorists remain in Afghanistan--and that many insurgents aren't ideological opponents of the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates. Some are petty criminals, some are simply armed local groups tired of being pushed around by the central government, and others fight merely for pay. (The U.S. was embarrassed to find out in December that the Taliban paid its fighters more than the Afghan National Army paid its soldiers.) <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Many of these insurgents are angry at the U.S. simply because we're there.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong>&quot;The importance of a people not wanting to be occupied cannot be underestimated,&quot; says Matthew Hoh, a former Foreign Service officer who was the first person to resign a government post in protest of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. &quot;National will or ethnic will cannot be downplayed or misunderstood or denied.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>Meanwhile, the transnational terrorists we're supposedly fighting don't need bases in Afghanistan and Pakistan to attack us. Officials concede that safe havens in other failed or failing states must be pressed as well. Just weeks after Obama announced his strategy, a Nigerian man obtained explosives from an al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen--which, along with places like Pakistan, Algeria, and Somalia, provides a &quot;safe haven&quot; for the group--and attempted to destroy an international flight as it landed in Detroit. U.S. intelligence agencies, despite having some relevant information, didn't act in time to prevent the bomber from getting on the flight. Perhaps the billions of dollars dedicated to the new troops in Afghanistan would be better served fixing structural failures in intelligence-gathering.</strong><br />
<strong>Instead, we're seeing the considerable militarization of intelligence-gathering. After a suicide bomber killed seven Central Intelligence Agency employees in Afghanistan, CIA Director Leon Panetta wrote that &quot;like our military, CIA officers are on the front lines against al-Qaeda and its violent allies.&quot; The officers were stationed there to manage a drone program that hunts terrorists in the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan. While fighting terrorists requires both intelligence-gathering and the kind of targeted strikes the CIA performs, there is a clear imbalance when a camp in Afghanistan has dozens of CIA employees but the National Counterterrorism Center has only eight or nine Middle East analysts.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The focus on troops has also hampered Obama's goal of placing equal emphasis on civilian and military aspects of our foreign </span></span>policy. The military, which <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">has increasingly become America's primary presence abroad, </span></span>is resisting the attempt to narrow the focus of the war. Despite</strong><br />
<strong>the White House's goal of training just over 200,000 Afghan soldiers and police, Pentagon officials plan to train 400,000. And Holbrooke, intended to be the civilian counterpart to Petraeus, has seen his influence diminish commensurate with his lack of resources. Though his office is still an important center of coordination, he plays a smaller-than-expected role in the White House-driven decision-making process.</strong><br />
<strong>Obama's foreign-policy vision professed a need to address the root causes of conflict by building up local infrastructure and actively fostering better lives for people in places like Afghanistan. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Despite a consensus</span></span>--which even includes Defense Secretary Robert Gates--<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">that civilian development, medical access, and agricultural expertise are critical to counterinsurgency, the administration's budget request</span></span> in March <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">reflected a heavy emphasis on defense over development.</span></span> Ambassador Eikenberry protested in a cable to Washington, asking for an additional $2.5 billion--60 percent more than he had been given. The military was receiving $68 billion.</strong><br />
<strong>Even if civilian efforts were given more resources, overhauling the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to make them more effective remains a challenge--despite the fact that the State Department created a position to do just that. Although the administration expects to have 974 civilians on the ground by early 2010, beating a goal it set in March, this is a drop in the bucket: Afghanistan has a population of 28 million. Reports show a deep frustration from U.S. officials working on development projects, because they are almost entirely dependent on the military. Indeed, despite the growing acceptance of the need for civilian expertise, the military often finds itself trying to do the work of civilian agencies that aren't set up to operate in a war zone.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;We're in a 'build the airplane while you're flying it' kind of situation,&quot; Hurlburt says. &quot;If the effort to produce a better, much more energetic and smartly focused civilian effort in Afghanistan succeeds, it will become the template for broader reform of the institutions.&quot; That template could be useful, Hurlburt adds, or it could be detrimental, since the lessons U.S. development officers learn in Afghanistan may not apply so well to countries that need U.S. help but aren't in the middle of a war.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">This narrow focus on the military conflict also distracts from Pakistan</span></span>, Afghanistan's nuclear neighbor, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">where an unstable government and the proliferation of extreme Islamist groups are of much more interest to the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates. &quot;I am not sure what 40,000 additional troops in Afghanistan can do about the greater global security threat, instability in Pakistan,&quot; Katulis told me last fall. &quot;You have nearly daily--and sometimes twice-a-day--attacks targeted inside of Pakistan, which is five times more populous and has nuclear weapons.&quot; Just consider the numbers: Obama is spending $1.5 billion a year on aid to Pakistan and over $68 billion fighting a war in Afghanistan.</strong><br />
<strong>With Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visiting Pakistan, the administration has had some success in navigating the nation's complex politics. Clinton is trying to broaden the U.S.-Pakistan relationship from working with the government on national-security issues toward a holistic engagement with the entire country. It's exactly the kind of approach that Obama promised, but it is undermined by the use of drone strikes on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, which have increased anti-American sentiment.</strong><br />
<strong>The Obama team has set aside the Bush administration's end goal of installing a democracy and instead made a limited version of that aim the means to their central end: Everything comes down to eliminating the terrorist presence in Afghanistan. Vikram Singh, Holbrooke's defense adviser, says the region is the &quot;epicenter&quot; of al-Qaeda's action, which is why the administration has made preventing the group's re-establishment there a more pressing goal than dealing with al-Qaeda globally. With even John Kerry, now the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, using the distinctly Bush-administration phrase &quot;global counterinsurgency&quot; in his speeches on Afghanistan, progressive attempts to change the way we think about terrorism threats have taken a step back.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="bold">THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE</span> settled into the Washington consensus that he criticized as an up-and-coming senator. His Afghanistan strategy buys into the idea that American troops can defeat tenacious insurgencies, that our officials have the ability to build even the most basic state from the ground up, and that terrorists represent a monolithic enemy around the world. The cocky senator of last spring has been replaced by a cautious and tightly controlled president. There was a time when Obama could flout conventional wisdom, but now he must accommodate it. It's true that Obama did not start this war, did not under-resource it for eight years, and did not fail to pursue Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora. The credit for those dubious achievements goes to George W. Bush. But the new president has missed opportunities to shift how our government approaches these problems.</strong><br />
<strong>Many of the campaign aides who helped craft Obama's forward-thinking foreign-policy vision remain in his inner circle, but are superseded by a group of veteran officials (Clinton, Gates, Petraeus, Holbrooke, National Security Adviser James Jones) whose commitment to new ideas varies. It remains to be seen how much they--and the responsibilities of being president--have shifted Obama's personal foreign-policy vision.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The stakes are high in Afghanistan</span></span> not only on the merits but <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">because success buys him the credibility to advance other foreign-policy initiatives that don't tend to go over well with domestic audiences</span></span>: closing Guantanamo Bay, engaging Iran, pressuring Israel toward peace, reaching out to the Muslim community, and reducing nuclear weapons in America and the world. Even given the daunting odds, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">it is still possible that a new mode of foreign policy--one that is executed by civilians and soldiers equally--could spring from the crucible of Afghanistan.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The other scenario, though, is that using the military in Afghanistan</span></span> as the central means of fighting terrorism leaves reform of law enforcement and intelligence out in the cold, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">hinders the transformation of the civilian agencies, and prevents Obama from spending resources on other projects</span></span>. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">A failure in Afghanistan is a failure to change the way this country approaches foreign policy. </span></span>Worse, if the next two years don't show an Afghan government that can handle basic governing and security, then <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">all of Obama's ideas will be wrapped in that failure, hindering his ability to execute any of his other initiatives</span></span>.</strong><br />

<strong>For President Obama, the stakes are high. His young presidency is on the line. Perhaps because his secretary of defense, Gates, is a Republican, <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Obama has personalized the decision on Afghan strategy to a dangerous degree. Afghanistan is now Obama's war. By deciding to reduce</span></span>, if not altogether remove,<span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> U.S. combat troops from the country, the president will take a step towards the moral high ground</span></span> that he so often desperately seeks to inhabit.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Morality must return to the center of America's relations with the world.

The Bush presidency damaged both the image of the United States as a role model for promoters of democratization around the world, and further entrenched a darker counter-view of America as a reactionary force in world affairs. The Obama presidency creates an opening to restore the brighter side. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">In continuing the war in Afghanistan, Obama risks destroying his chances to redeem the United States in the eyes of the world.

<strong><span class="CardsFont12ptChar">Sending</span> from <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">30,000</span> to 40,000 <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">troops to that tumultuous nation will likely wreak havoc on Obama's broader first-term foreign policy agenda - consuming resources, sucking up time and attention, and ultimately subverting his larger foreign policy goals</span>.</strong><br />
<strong>In August, National Intelligence Council Chairman John Brennan declared that under Obama, &quot;the fight against terrorists and violent extremists has been returned to its right and proper place: no longer defining - indeed, distorting - our entire national security and foreign policy, but rather serving as a vital part of those larger policies.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>But <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">the military commitment endorsed by</span> President <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">Obama would </span>have the reverse effect - <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">officially making stabilization in Afghanistan and the war against Al Qaeda and the Taliban the President's top priority.</span></strong><br />
<strong>For example, one of the most serious challenges facing the country's national security bureaucracy - one Obama and Secretary of State Clinton have expressed serious concern about in the past - is the skewed balance between resources for our military and civilian agencies. Nearly everyone in the foreign policy community agrees that both State and the U.S. Agency for International Development are badly under-resourced.</strong><br />
<strong>But <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">with Obama's likely troop increase in Afghanistan, agencies like the State Department and USAID will see their dwindling capacity devoted to assisting the military as opposed to the long-term diplomacy and development work that can further U.S. interests in places not named Afghanistan or Pakistan</span>. The civilian-military balance will only become further skewed.</strong><br />
<strong>And if the administration requests $100 billion a year for the war in Afghanistan, in the face of looming budget deficits, what are the chances Congress will loosen its purse strings further for two underappreciated foreign policy agencies?</strong><br />
<strong>Finally, <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">Obama and his advisers will be pressed in devoting their attention and political capital to other foreign policy matters, whether it's pushing for a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, organizing an international coalition to confront the Iranian nuclear program or hammering out international agreements on climate change and trade</span>. <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">It's never easy for Presidents and their advisers to proverbially &quot;walk and chew gum at the same time,&quot; and having 100,000 troops in Afghanistan will make it that much harder.</span></strong><br />
<strong>But above all, <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">Obama's goal</span> of changing America's mind-set from the belief that there is a military solution to every national</strong><br />
<strong>security challenge <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">will be dealt a defining and perhaps fatal blow</span> - and in the end, that is probably the most important reason why troop levels in Afghanistan matter and why the President should think twice. <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">The opportunity costs will be profound</span>, and Obama will risk becoming the one thing he likely did not want to be: a war President.</strong><br />
<strong>As he prepares to announce a decision that will define his presidency, <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">Obama would be wise to consider the words of</span> one of his predecessors in the Oval Office, <span class="CardsFont12ptChar">Lyndon Johnson</span>, who after leaving office told a biographer, &quot;<span class="CardsFont12ptChar">History provided too many cases where the sound of the bugle put an immediate end to the hopes and dreams of the best reformers</span>.&quot; No doubt Obama knows what ultimately happened to Johnson's policy agenda - and his presidency.</strong><br />

<strong>The solution—born of separate proposals from the developing and developed world— asks for a global carbon budget to be divided among every human on earth, and is meant to enter currently stalled negotiations in 2010.</strong><br />

<strong>We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told the Guardian last week. At first sight this looks like wise counsel from the climate science adviser to Defra.

multilateral cooperation is key to ensure rising proliferators are stable<br />
Dyer, 04 <strong>- worked as a freelance journalist, columnist, broadcaster and lecturer on international affairs for more than 20 years, but he was originally trained as an historian. Born in Newfoundland, he received degrees from Canadian, American and British universities, finishing with a Ph.D. in Military and Middle Eastern History from the University of London. [Gwynne, &quot;The end of war,&quot; Toronto Star, 12/30, l/n]</strong><br />
<strong>War is deeply embedded in our history and our culture, probably since before we were even fully human, but weaning ourselves away from it should not be a bigger mountain to climb than some of the other changes we have already made in the way we live, given the right incentives. And we have certainly been given the right incentives: The holiday from history that we have enjoyed since the early '90s may be drawing to an end, and another great-power war, fought next time with nuclear weapons, may be lurking in our future..</strong><br />
<strong>The &quot;firebreak&quot; against nuclear weapons use that we began building after Hiroshima and Nagasaki has held for well over half a century now. But the proliferation of nuclear weapons to new powers is a major challenge to the stability of the system. So are the coming crises, mostly environmental in origin, which will hit some countries much harder than others, and may drive some to desperation.</strong><br />
<strong>Add in the huge impending shifts in the great-power system as China and India grow to rival the United States in GDP over the next 30 or 40 years and it will be hard to keep things from spinning out of control. With good luck and good management, we may be able to ride out the next half-century without the first-magnitude catastrophe of a global nuclear war, but the potential certainly exists for a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">major die-back of human population</span>.</strong><br />
<strong>We cannot command the good luck, but good management is something we can choose to provide. It depends, above all, on preserving and extending the multilateral system that we have been building since the end of World War II. The rising powers must be absorbed into a system that emphasizes co-operation and makes room for them, rather than one that deals in confrontation and raw military power. If they are obliged to play the traditional great-power game of winners and losers, then history will repeat itself and everybody loses.</strong><br />
<strong>Our hopes for mitigating the severity of the coming environmental crises also depend on early and concerted global action of a sort that can only happen in a basically co-operative international system.</strong><br />
<strong>When the great powers are locked into a military confrontation, there is simply not enough spare attention, let alone enough trust, to make deals on those issues, so the highest priority at the moment is to keep the multilateral approach alive and avoid a drift back into alliance systems and arms races. And there is no point in dreaming that we can leap straight into some never-land of universal brotherhood; we will have to confront these challenges and solve the problem of war within the context of the existing state system.</strong><br />

<strong>If it is a war against extremists and militancy inside Pakistan, it is a civil war because its origins stem from the US, NATO occupation of neighboring Afghanistan. The conflict should be seen as an extension of the ongoing resistance of the Afghan people to alien domination. It is inaccurate to say that the US invaded Afghanistan because of the 9/11 attacks by Al-Qaeda. Former BBC correspondent George Arney reported on September 18, 2001, that Niaz Naik, the former Pakistani foreign secretary, had told him that he was informed by US officials at a UN-sponsored international contact group on Afghanistan in Berlin during July that year that unless Osama bin Laden were handed over swiftly, America would take military action to kill or capture both Bin Laden and Mullah Omar. The wider objective, however, was to topple the Taliban regime and install a transitional government under King Mohammad Zahir Shah. The invasion was to take place in mid-October 2001. Mr. Naik went on to say that he doubted that the US would have abandoned its plan to invade Afghanistan even if Osama were handed over by the Taliban. Arney's story is corroborated by the Guardian correspondent David Leigh in his report published on September 26, 2001, in which he revealed that the Taliban had received specific warning by the US through secret diplomacy in Berlin in July that the Bush Administration would topple the entire regime militarily unless Osama is extradited to the US. This was part of the larger design of US military, industrial complex to bring about regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. As the US needed bases in Pakistan to accomplish its pre-planned invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush Administration sought to use Islamabad as a cat's paw to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. Fortunately for President Bush, a usurper ruled there, devoid of all legitimacy, legal and moral, and he readily and willingly succumbed to US pressure and made a U-turn by severing all links with the Taliban. He even joined the war against Afghanistan instead of using his leverage with the Taliban to exhaust all means of peaceful settlement of the dispute. The entire region, including Pakistan, was declared a war zone by the US military command, and the flights of all passenger planes were prohibited over a certain altitude, while no merchant ships could enter the harbors of Pakistan, thus bringing maritime trade (which comprises approximately 95 percent of Pakistan's import-export trade) to a standstill. It is no wonder that Pakistan suffered a loss of 34 billion dollars because of its involvement in the Afghan war. America's War As one can see, it was America's war that was imposed upon Pakistan. Whether Pakistan could have avoided the war is a matter of controversy among politicians and political observers. But the war has fuelled insurgency in Pakistan's hitherto peaceful tribal territory adjacent to Afghanistan. This insurgency shows no sign of abatement, as terrorist attacks on military and civilian centers in the capital and major cities of the North-West Frontier Province and Punjab continue with a vengeance, posing threat to the security of the state. In the meantime, routine predator strikes by the US in Waziristan have taken a heavy toll of civilian lives amid accusations of Islamabad's complicity in the piratical attacks on tribespeople, which prompts them to resort to retaliatory strikes on the perpetrators. Not satisfied with Pakistan's military operations in the tribal region, the US Administration has compelled Islamabad's fragile government to pull out its troops from the tense Indo-Pak border and deploy them in the restive tribal belt along the Pak-Afghan border. Now Pakistan faces existential threat from the Taliban and not India, a perception which the country's military leadership is not prepared to share, given the unresolved disputes with New Delhi, which triggered four wars during the last 62 years. At the same time, speculation (not entirely unfounded) is rife about the involvement of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the former Blackwater (now christened Xe Services) in murder, mayhem, and gunrunning as evidenced by the armed Americans who drive consulate vehicles through cities and, when intercepted, refuse to disclose their identity. It is here that one recalls with dismay the role of General Stanley McChrystal, who until last year headed the Joint Special Operations Command, which runs drone attacks and targeted assassinations with the assistance of the operatives of the former Blackwater. This was revealed by Jeremy Scahill's investigative report published in the US weekly the Nation. That may, perhaps, solve the mystery surrounding a series of assassinations of ulama belonging to various Islamic movements. The sinister motive behind such acts of terror is to incite sectarian violence in Pakistan and lay the blame at the doors of religious extremists. Similar death squads were organized by the CIA in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to carry out political assassinations of nationalists who were opposed to US intervention. At the time, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua complained to the International Court of Justice about the mining of Nicaraguan ports, the violation of the country's airspace, the killing and kidnapping of individuals on the Nicaraguan territory, and the threat or use of force by the US. The court in its decision in June 1986 held that the US was in breach of the customary rules of international law and international humanitarian law. The above case is titled the &quot;Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua.&quot; The precedent set by this case may be invoked by Pakistan to prevent the US drone attacks on its territory. Once the piratical attacks of the US have stopped, the irritant in the tribal insurgency would have gone, paving the way for pacification of the conflict. If this were Pakistan's war, the government would have exercised its own judgment in dealing with the militants at home, either by conciliation or by resort to force. But Islamabad's so-called operation against militants is subordinated to US military designs in the region, aimed at the encirclement of the People's Republic of China and the control of the transit of gas pipelines from Central Asia to South Asia. It is not aimless that China expressed its concern over the concentration of US, NATO troops in the region. India fits in the American scheme of things, hence the US-India nuclear deal.</strong><br />
<strong>Pakistan's National Interest In this emerging security environment, Pakistan will have to be content with its role as a junior partner of India. Therefore, the sooner Islamabad extricates itself from the US &quot;war on terror,&quot; the better it is for its security and independence. Doesn't Islamabad realize that its military operation against the militants would leave its border with India vulnerable to a New Delhi offensive? If Pakistan permits the US to attack the suspected training centers of militants on its territory, will it be able to prevent India from doing so? With Islamabad embroiled in internecine strife, it cannot negotiate with India from a position of strength. It may be forced to make a compromise that might be detrimental to its national interest. Pakistan's preoccupation with tribal rebellion would not permit it to deal with separatist ethnic forces in Baluchistan. Undoubtedly, this is a threat to the territorial integrity of Pakistan. After the total failure of the military operation in Baluchistan, the federal government has come round to the painful conclusion that political and not military action can bring militancy to an end. Granting general amnesty to the dissidents and engaging them in a meaningful dialogue on contentious issues is a laudable initiative. The same gesture should be made to the militants in the tribal areas. But Islamabad has adopted double standards in dealing with the Baluchistan militants and the Pashtun militants, as if there were good militants and bad ones. This discriminatory policy would intensify the Pashtun insurgency and might drive them toward even more escalation. The rulers have seen the consequences of military operations in the former East Pakistan, Baluchistan, Karachi, Sind, and FATA (federally administered tribal areas). If anything, the situation has only worsened. The surge of US troops, the expansion of war beyond the borders of Afghanistan, and the attacks on Quetta and Muridke as envisaged by Obama's new strategy would mean that US troops are at war with the people of Pakistan.</strong><br />
<strong>Any Solution?</strong><br />
<strong>The Obama Administration would be better advised to concentrate on its exit strategy, and to that end, it is imperative that it involve the UN in its peace-making efforts aimed at the establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan, because the Karzai Government has no legitimacy. To fill the vacuum, the UN peacekeeping force, made up of troops of states not involved in the Afghan war, may be deployed until a government of national unity is able to assume full responsibility. Here the US can contribute to the postwar reconstruction of Afghanistan under the aegis of the UN. The insurgency in the tribal region is the spillover effect of US military occupation of Afghanistan, but Pakistan faces a far greater threat: the threat of ethnic violence as manifested in the bloody clashes among various linguistic groups in urban and rural Sind. These have been overshadowed by the counterinsurgency operations in FATA, but they may erupt at any moment, thus destabilizing the state.</strong><br />

<strong>But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep filled with troops today, killing five and wounding as many as 21, including several children who were waiting for a ride to school. Residents of the region where the attack took place are fleeing in terror as gunfire rings out around them, and government forces have been unable to quell the violence. Two regional government officials were beheaded by militants in retaliation for the killing of other militants by government forces. As familiar as this sounds, it did not take place where we have come to expect such terrible events. This, unfortunately, is a whole new ballgame. It is part of another conflict that is brewing, one which puts what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan in deep shade, and which represents a grave and growing threat to us all. Pakistan is now trembling on the edge of violent chaos, and is doing so with nuclear weapons in its hip pocket, right in the middle of one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world. The situation in brief: Pakistan for years has been a nation in turmoil, run by a shaky government supported by a corrupted system, dominated by a blatantly criminal security service, and threatened by a large fundamentalist Islamic population with deep ties to the Taliban in Afghanistan. All this is piled atop an ongoing standoff with neighboring India that has been the center of political gravity in the region for more than half a century. The fact that Pakistan, and India, and Russia, and China all possess nuclear weapons and share the same space means any ongoing or escalating violence over there has the real potential to crack open the very gates of Hell itself.</strong><br />

<strong>Recently, the Taliban made a military push into the northwest Pakistani region around the Swat Valley. According to a recent Reuters report: The (Pakistani) army deployed troops in Swat in October 2007 and used artillery and gunship helicopters to reassert control. But insecurity mounted after a civilian government came to power last year and tried to reach a negotiated settlement. A peace accord fell apart in May 2008. After that, hundreds — including soldiers, militants and civilians — died in battles. Militants unleashed a reign of terror, killing and beheading politicians, singers, soldiers and opponents. They banned female education and destroyed nearly 200 girls' schools. About 1,200 people were killed since late 2007 and 250,000 to 500,000 fled, leaving the militants in virtual control. Pakistan offered on February 16 to introduce Islamic law in the Swat valley and neighboring areas in a bid to take the steam out of the insurgency. The militants announced an indefinite cease-fire after the army said it was halting operations in the region. President Asif Ali Zardari signed a regulation imposing sharia in the area last month. But the Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner and another district adjacent to Swat, intent on spreading their rule. The United States, already embroiled in a war against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, must now face the possibility that Pakistan could collapse under the mounting threat of Taliban forces there. Military and diplomatic advisers to President Obama, uncertain how best to proceed, now face one of the great nightmare scenarios of our time. &quot;Recent militant gains in Pakistan,&quot; reported The New York Times on Monday, &quot;have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as 'one of the very most serious problems we face.'&quot; &quot;Security was deteriorating rapidly,&quot; reported The Washington Post on Monday, &quot;particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbor al-Qaeda and the Taliban, intelligence chiefs reported, and there were signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistan's populous Punjabi heartland. The Pakistani government was mired in political bickering. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counterinsurgency fight. But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a U.S. combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.&quot; It is believed <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Pakistan is currently in possession of between 60 and 100 nuclear weapons</span></span>. Because Pakistan's stability is threatened by the wide swath of its population that shares ethnic, cultural and religious connections to the fundamentalist Islamic populace of Afghanistan, fears over what could happen to those nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government collapses are very real. &quot;As the insurgency of the Taliban and Al Qaeda spreads in Pakistan,&quot; reported the Times last week, &quot;senior American officials say they are increasingly concerned about new vulnerabilities for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, including the potential for militants to snatch a weapon in transport or to insert sympathizers into laboratories or fuel-production facilities. In public, the administration has only hinted at those concerns, repeating the formulation that the Bush administration used: that it has faith in the Pakistani Army. But that cooperation, according to officials who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the exchanges between Washington and Islamabad, has been sharply limited when the subject has turned to the vulnerabilities in the Pakistani nuclear infrastructure.&quot; &quot;The prospect of turmoil in Pakistan sends shivers up the spines of those U.S. officials charged with keeping tabs on foreign nuclear weapons,&quot; reported Time Magazine last month. &quot;Pakistan is thought to possess about 100 — the U.S. isn't sure of the total, and may not know where all of them are. Still, if Pakistan collapses, the U.S. military is primed to enter the country and secure as many of those weapons as it can, according to U.S. officials. Pakistani officials insist their personnel safeguards are stringent, but a sleeper cell could cause big trouble, U.S. officials say.&quot; In other words, a shaky Pakistan spells trouble for everyone, especially if America loses the footrace to secure those weapons in the event of the worst-case scenario. If Pakistani militants ever succeed in toppling the government, several very dangerous events could happen at once. Nuclear-armed India could be galvanized into military action of some kind, as could nuclear-armed China or nuclear-armed Russia. If the Pakistani government does fall, and all those Pakistani nukes are not immediately accounted for and secured, the specter (or reality) of loose nukes falling into the hands of terrorist organizations could place the entire world on a collision course with unimaginable disaster. We have all been paying a great deal of attention to Iraq and Afghanistan, and rightly so. The developing situation in Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner. The Obama administration appears to be gravely serious about addressing the situation. So should we all.</strong><br />

<span style="text-decoration: none;">Chellany, 09 - </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">professor of strategic studies at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi (9/14/09, Brahma, Japan Times, “An Advantagous U.S. Exit,” </span><span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4579:http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20090914bc.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20090914bc.html" rel="nofollow">http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20090914bc.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4579 --></span>)</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">When the administration's principal war target is not the Taliban but rather al-Qaida remnants on the run, why chase a troop-intensive strategy pivoted on protecting population centers to win grassroots support? In reality, what it calls a &quot;clear, hold, build&quot; strategy is actually a &quot;surge, bribe, run&quot; strategy, except that the muddled nature of the mission and the deepening U.S. involvement crimp the &quot;run&quot; option.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">America's quandary is a reminder that it is easier to get into a war than to get out. In fact, Obama undermined his unfolding war strategy last March by publicly declaring, &quot;There's got to be an exit strategy.&quot; The message that sent to the Taliban and its sponsor, the Pakistani military, was that they ought to simply out-wait the Americans to reclaim Afghanistan.</span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Before Afghanistan becomes a Vietnam-style quagmire, Obama must rethink his plan for another troop surge. Gradually drawing down U.S. troop levels indeed makes more sense because what holds the disparate constituents of the Taliban syndicate together is </span></span>a common opposition to foreign military presence.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">An American military exit from Afghanistan will not come as a shot in the arm for the forces of global jihad, as many in Washington seem to fear. To the contrary, </span></span>it will remove the common unifying element and unleash developments whose significance would be largely internal or regional. In Afghanistan, a vicious power struggle would break out along sectarian and ethnic lines. The Taliban, with the active support of the Pakistani military, would certainly make a run for Kabul to replay the 1996 power grab.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">But it won't be easy to repeat 1996. For one, the Taliban is splintered today, with the tail (private armies and militias) wagging the dog. For another, the non-Taliban and non-Pashtun forces now are stronger, more organized and better prepared than in 1996 </span></span>to resist the Taliban's advance to Kabul, having been empowered by the autonomy they have enjoyed in provinces or by the offices they still hold in the Afghan federal government.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Also, by retaining Afghan bases to carry out covert operations and Predator missions and other airstrikes, the U.S. military would be able to unleash punitive air power to prevent a 1996 repeat. </span></span>After all, it was the combination of American air power and the Northern Alliance's ground operations that ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.</strong><br />
<strong>Against this background, the most likely outcome of the Afghan power struggle triggered by an American decision to pull out would be the formalization of the present de facto partition of Afghanistan along ethnic lines. Iraq, too, is headed in the same direction.</strong><br />
<strong>The Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras and other ethnic minorities would be able to ensure self-governance in the Afghan areas they dominate, leaving the Pashtun lands on both sides of the British-drawn Durand Line in ferment. Thanks to ethnic polarization, the Durand Line, or the Afpak border, exists today only on maps. On the ground, it has little political, ethnic and economic relevance.</strong><br />
<strong>As in Iraq, an American withdrawal would potentially let loose forces of Balkanization in the Afpak belt. That may sound disturbing, but this would be an unintended and perhaps unstoppable consequence of the U.S. invasion.</strong><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">An American pullout actually would aid the fight against international terrorism. Instead of staying bogged down in Afghanistan and seeking to cajole and bribe the Pakistani military from continuing to provide succor to Islamic militants, </span>Washington would become free to pursue a broader and more-balanced counterterrorism strategy.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Also, minus the Afghan-war burden, the U.S. would better appreciate the dangers to international security posed by Pakistani terror groups</span></span> like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e- Mohammed. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The threat of an Islamist takeover of Pakistan comes not from the Taliban but from these groups that have long drawn support from the Pakistani army as part of the deep-rooted military-mullah alliance. </span></span></strong><br />

Withdrawal immediately turns the population against the Taliban, solving legitimacy<br />
Dorronsoro,9 <strong>-Visiting Scholar, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (January 2009, Gilles, “Focus and Exit: An Alternative Strategy for the Afghan War,” <span style="color: black;"><!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4580:http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/afghan_war-strategy.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/afghan_war-strategy.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/afghan_war-strategy.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4580 --></span>)</strong><br />
<strong>This three-zone strategy is not, <em>per se,</em> a gamechanger, and it must be accompanied by an incremental, phased withdrawal. The withdrawal would not be a consequence of “stabilization,” but rather an essential part of the process. Since the presence of foreign troops is the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">most important factor</span> in mobilizing support for the Taliban, the beginning of the withdrawal would change the political game on two levels. First, Jihad would become a motivation for fewer Afghans; instead, the conflict would be mostly seen as a civil war. Second, the pro-government population (or, more exactly, the anti-Taliban one) would rally together because of fear of a Taliban victory.</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: #002561;">Why Withdraw the Combat Troops ? Reframing the War </span></strong><br />
<strong>There is an argument against withdrawing combat troops: namely, that al-Qaeda would retain its sanctuary in Afghanistan because the Afghan state would not have control of some parts of the country, especially in the east. Though superficially compelling, this argument is weak for two reasons. First, the international coalition lacks the resources to control the periphery of the Afghan territory anyway. Second, the withdrawal of combat troops does not preclude targeted operations with the agreement of the Kabul government. So, in terms of physical security, the withdrawal of combat troops does not bring clear gains for al-Qaeda.</strong><br />
<strong>There are two important reasons for withdrawal.</strong><br />
<strong>First, the mere presence of foreign soldiers fighting a war in Afghanistan is probably the single most important factor in the resurgence of the Taliban. The convergence of nationalism and Jihad has aided the Taliban in extending its influence. It is sometimes frightening to see how similar NATO military operations are to Soviet ones in the 1980s and how the similarities could affect the perceptions of the population. The majority of Afghans are now deeply opposed to the foreign troops on their soil. The idea that one can “stabilize” Afghanistan with more troops goes against all that one should have learned from the Soviet war. The real issue is not to “stabilize” but to create a new dynamic. The Taliban have successfully framed the war as a Jihad and a liberation war against (non-Muslim) foreign armies. The concrete consequence of this moral victory is that the movement has been able to gain ground in non-Pashtun areas. The situations in Badghris Province (northwest) and in Badakhshan Province (northeast) are extremely worrisome, because the Taliban have been able to attract the support of some Pashtun tribes and fundamentalist networks. A province like Wardak, initially opposed to the Taliban in the 1990s, is now one of its strongholds. Insecurity bred by the narcotics trade and the infighting of local groups in the north also provides the Taliban opportunities to find new allies on a more practical, rather than ideological, ground. This trend is extraordinarily dangerous, since the spread of the war geographically would put Western countries in an untenable position.</strong><br />
<strong>Second, withdrawal would create a new dynamic in the country, providing two main benefits. The momentum of the Taliban would slow or stop altogether, because without a foreign occupier the Jihadist and nationalist feelings of the population would be much more difficult to mobilize. Furthermore, the Karzai regime would gain legitimacy. If Karzai (or his successor) receives enough help from the international coalition, he would be able to develop more centralized institutions in the strategic areas or at least keep local actors under control. The regime would remain corrupt but would appear more legitimate if it succeeded in bringing security to the population in the strategic zones without the help of foreign troops. The support of the urban population, which opposes the Taliban, is a critical issue. Corruption is a problem primarily if it accelerates the independence of Afghanistan’s peripheral regions.</strong><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black;">A shift to a counterterrorism based force posture maintains Afghan stability and intelligence cooperation</span><br />
Long, 10 <span style="color: black;"> - a</span><strong><span style="color: black;">ssistant professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (Austin, “Small is Beautiful: The Counterterrorism Option in Afghanistan,” Orbis, Spring 2010, Science Direct)</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">This insoluble problem is why the counterterrorism option is important. If even a costly effort in Afghanistan cannot fully achieve the goal against al Qaeda, then it is crucial to determine whether a less costly effort can achieve a similar effect by keeping Afghanistan inhospitable to al Qaeda. This would be a clear and cost-effective alignment of resources with goals, the essence of strategy. Determining the viability of the counterterrorism option requires detailing what it might look like. Most discussion of the counterterrorism option has been vague. Riedel and O’Hanlon sum it up as ‘‘a few U.S. special forces teams, modern intelligence fusion centers, cruise-missile-carrying ships and unmanned aerial vehicles. . .’’ But there has been little effort to put flesh on this skeleton in terms of numbers and locations of U.S. troops. The following section presents <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">a</span></span> possible <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">counterterrorism force posture</span></span>. Possible Counterterrorism Force Posture First, this posture <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">would require maintaining bases in Afghanistan</span></span>. Three airfields (see map below) would be sufficient: Bagram (about 50 kilometers north of Kabul), Jalalabad (in eastern Afghanistan) and Kandahar (in southern Afghanistan). <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">This would enable forces to collect intelligence and rapidly target al Qaeda in the Pashtun regions where its allies would hold sway</span></span>. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">In terms of special operations forces, this posture would rely on two squadrons of </span></span>so-called ‘‘<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Tier 1’’ operators</span></span>, one at Jalabad Air Field (JAF) and one at Kandahar Air Field (KAF). These would be drawn from classified U.S. special mission units (SMUs) attached to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), U.S. Army Special Forces’ Combatant Commanders in Extremis Forces (CIFs), and allied units such as the British Special Air Service (SAS) or Canada’s Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2).9 In addition, the posture would require a battalion equivalent of U.S. Army Rangers, U.S. Navy SEALs, U.S. Marine Special Operations Companies (MSOCs), British Special Forces Support Group, or some mix, with basically a company with each Tier 1 squadron or equivalent and one in reserve at Bagram.10 These forces would work together as task forces, with the Tier 1 operators being tasked with executing direct action missions to kill or capture al Qaeda targets while the other units would serve as security and support for these missions. According to Sean Naylor’s reporting, these direct action task forces are structured like the regional task forces in Iraq in 2006 that were tasked to hunt al Qaeda in Iraq. Naylor also reports similar units are already in place in Afghanistan.11 In addition to these ground forces, a battalion task force from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) would be used to provide helicopter transport, reconnaissance, and fire support for the task forces. The battalion would bring some mix of MH-47 heavy lift helicopters and MH60 medium lift helicopters, including the MH-60L gunship.12 The helicopters have a combat radius of at least 300 kilometers (km), giving the task forces operational reach to almost any part of the Pashtun region.13 This battalion could be supplemented with additional aviation assets from other units, such as CV-22 tilt rotor aircraft from the Air Force’s 8th Special Operations Squadron or AH-64 attack helicopters from any one of several Army aviation units.14 The JAF based task force would likely need to operate principally in the heartland of the Haqqani network (Khost, Paktia, and Paktika provinces) as this would be where al Qaeda’s principal ally in the east could best protect its members (who are not generally Pashtun). For similar reasons, the KAF based task force would principally operate against targets in Kandahar, the home of the Quetta Shura Taliban, and some of the surrounding provinces such as Helmand and Oruzgan. Both task forces would nonetheless be capable of acting against targets elsewhere in the Pashtun regions. In addition to these two task forces, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">a counterterrorism option would retain the three Army Special Forces battalions and other elements that appear to be assigned to Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan</span></span> (CJSOTF-A).15 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">This provides roughly 54 Special Forces Operational Detachment Alphas</span></span><span style="color: black;"> (ODAs), <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the basic unit of Army Special Forces</span></span>. While the task forces would focus purely on direct action, ODAs would partner with local forces to collect intelligence and secure specific areas.16 Additionally, <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">these ODAs would provide crucial support to critical Afghan allies and reassure them that the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">is not going to entirely abandon them</span></span>. CJSOTF-A should, in addition, have a dedicated helicopter battalion for its own lift. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">This reassurance and support of local allies is a crucial and underappreciated part of a counterterrorism option</span></span>, though such support to local allies could also be part of a counterinsurgency campaign. Indeed, the recently launched Community Defense Initiative (CDI) seeks to use Special Forces troops to build effective tribal militias to fight the Taliban and other militants.17 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">With 54 ODAs, the United States could potentially support local allies in roughly 50 Afghan districts</span></span><span style="color: black;">, assuming one ODA per district with a few deployed in other roles.18 Logistics might prevent this upper limit from being reached but at a minimum several dozen districts could be supported by CJSOTF-A’s ODAs. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">These local allies would in many cases be from non-Pashtun groups (Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras</span></span>), which would limit their ability to be effective in Pashtun areas but would likely include at least a few other tribes that see more benefit working with the Afghan government and the United States than against them. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The non-Pashtun groups were the critical allies of the U</span></span>nited <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">in 2001 and remain staunchly against the Taliban and other militants.</span></span> The Tajiks of the Panjshir Valley, for example, are probably even more anti-Taliban than the United States and have made the province one of the most secure in the country.19 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">With U.S. support, these groups will be able to prevent the expansion of militants outside Pashtun areas</span></span><span style="color: black;">. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Local allies in Pashtun areas will not only help contain militants but will also enable collection of intelligence to support the task force operations</span></span>. One example is the Shinwari tribe in Nangarhar province, which has never valued the Taliban. Shinwari militias are reported to be working with Special Forces in the Achin district of Nangarhar.20 The Afghan Border Police commander on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border at Spin Boldak, General Abdul Razziq, also derives substantial revenue from cross-border trade and will likely continue to fight the Taliban to maintain this revenue, making him a probable local partner.21 Another potential ally is the Alokozai tribe in the Arghandab district of Kandahar province, which has a history of resisting the Taliban.22 Supporting local allies does not mean abandoning the Afghan government any more than supporting local allies in the Awakening movement in Iraq’s Anbar province meant abandoning the Iraq government. However, it does pose risks, as local allies interests may not always align with those of the central government.23 Balancing the two will require deftness which will be discussed later. In addition to the two task forces and CJSOTF-A, a few more ‘‘enablers’’ would be required. First, this posture would need additional special operations personnel focused on intelligence collection, along with a substantial complement of intelligence community personnel to collect both human and signals intelligence.24 Second, it would require a significant complement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) including Predators, Reapers, and other specialized types along with their support personnel, equivalent to perhaps three squadrons. Third, an AC-130 gunship squadron for air support would be needed, along with combat search and rescue teams from Air Force Special Operations Command. Clearly, ‘‘small’’ is a relative term. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">This special operations posture alone would be roughly five battalions of ground forces, eight aviation squadrons/ battalions</span></span>, and a few odds and ends plus higher headquarters. This would be approximately 5,000 U.S. and Coalition troops.25 In addition, a conventional force component would be needed to serve as a quick reaction force, to provide security for the bases, and to protect convoys. A reasonable estimate for this force would be a brigade or regimental combat team, giving a battalion to each base with the higher headquarters at Bagram. This would add about another 3,500 troops.26 In addition, about 500 U.S. personnel would remain as advisers and liaisons to Afghan security forces, particularly the Afghan National Army where they would be attached at brigade and corps level. Additional air support besides the UAVs and AC-130s would also be needed. Two squadrons of fighter-bombers (F-15E, A-10, etc.) likely would be sufficient, adding another 2,000 personnel or so.27 Finally, this posture would require additional staff, logistics, and support personnel (medical for instance), some but not all of which could be contractors, adding another 2,000 military personnel.28 </span><span class="Underline"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">This would be a total force of about 13,000 military personnel </span></span><span style="color: black;">and some supporting intelligence community personnel and contractors.

 [issue are compartmentalized and presidential influence is exaggerated by the media]<br />
Dickinson, 09 – <strong>professor of political science at Middlebury College and taught previously at Harvard University where he worked under the supervision of presidential scholar Richard Neustadt (5/26/09, Matthew, Presidential Power: A NonPartisan Analysis of Presidential Politics, “Sotomayor, Obama and Presidential Power,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4581:http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/ --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4581 -->)</strong><br />
<strong>As for Sotomayor, from here the path toward almost certain confirmation goes as follows: the Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold hearings sometime this summer (this involves both written depositions and of course open hearings), which should lead to formal Senate approval before Congress adjourns for its summer recess in early August. So Sotomayor will likely take her seat in time for the start of the new Court session on October 5. (I talk briefly about the likely politics of the nomination process below).</strong><br />
<strong>What is of more interest to me, however, is what her selection reveals about the basis of presidential power. Political scientists, like baseball writers evaluating hitters, have devised numerous means of measuring a president’s influence in Congress. I will devote a separate post to discussing these, but in brief, they often center on the creation of legislative “box scores” designed to measure how many times a president’s preferred piece of legislation, or nominee to the executive branch or the courts, is approved by Congress. That is, how many pieces of legislation that the president supports actually pass Congress? How often do members of Congress vote with the president’s preferences? How often is a president’s policy position supported by roll call outcomes? These measures, however, are a misleading gauge of presidential power – they are a better indicator of congressional power. This is because how members of Congress vote on a nominee or legislative item is rarely influenced by anything a president does. Although journalists (and political scientists) often focus on the legislative “endgame” to gauge presidential influence – will the President swing enough votes to get his preferred legislation enacted? – this mistakes an outcome with actual evidence of presidential influence. Once we control for other factors – a member of Congress’ ideological and partisan leanings, the political leanings of her constituency, whether she’s up for reelection or not – we can usually predict how she will vote without needing to know much of anything about what the president wants. (I am ignoring the importance of a president’s veto power for the moment.)</strong><br />
<strong>Despite the much publicized and celebrated instances of presidential arm-twisting during the legislative endgame, then, most legislative outcomes don’t depend on presidential lobbying. But this is not to say that presidents lack influence. Instead, the primary means by which presidents influence what Congress does is through their ability to determine the alternatives from which Congress must choose. That is, presidential power is largely an exercise in agenda-setting – not arm-twisting. And we see this in the Sotomayer nomination. Barring a major scandal, she will almost certainly be confirmed to the Supreme Court whether Obama spends the confirmation hearings calling every Senator or instead spends the next few weeks ignoring the Senate debate in order to play Halo III on his Xbox. That is, how senators decide to vote on Sotomayor will have almost nothing to do with Obama’s lobbying from here on in (or lack thereof). His real influence has already occurred, in the decision to present Sotomayor as his nominee.</strong><br />
<strong>If we want to measure Obama’s “power”, then, we need to know what his real preference was and why he chose Sotomayor. My guess – and it is only a guess – is that after conferring with leading Democrats and Republicans, he recognized the overriding practical political advantages accruing from choosing an Hispanic woman, with left-leaning credentials. We cannot know if this would have been his ideal choice based on judicial philosophy alone, but presidents are never free to act on their ideal preferences. Politics is the art of the possible. Whether Sotomayer is his first choice or not, however, her nomination is a reminder that the power of the presidency often resides in the president’s ability to dictate the alternatives from which Congress (or in this case the Senate) must choose. Although Republicans will undoubtedly attack Sotomayor for her judicial “activism” (citing in particular her decisions regarding promotion and affirmative action), her comments regarding the importance of gender and ethnicity in influencing her decisions, and her views regarding whether appellate courts “make” policy, they run the risk of alienating Hispanic voters – an increasingly influential voting bloc (to the extent that one can view Hispanics as a voting bloc!) I find it very hard to believe she will not be easily confirmed. In structuring the alternative before the Senate in this manner, then, Obama reveals an important aspect of presidential power that cannot be measured through legislative boxscores.</strong><br />

<strong>With someone of their own party now in the White House, it would seem only natural that Democrats at the Capitol would be pushing for a stronger say in what has become one of the longest wars in American history. Presidents, however, usually don’t take kindly to congressional second-guessing of their war policies, even from their partisan allies. Lyndon B. Johnson was essentially impervious to — and sometimes even disdainful of — Democratic criticism or advice about Vietnam. Top to bottom: Levin, Reed and Kerry. The three Democratic senators oppose a significant troop increase in Afghanistan. But that is not the case these days. Members of both parties are reasserting their constitutional prerogative to advise the new president about military and foreign policy. And as Barack Obama struggles with one of the most important and difficult decisions facing any president — whether to commit more troops to the worsening war and, in effect, make it “his” — he is making a concerted effort to get bipartisan congressional buy-in from the outset. His approach is going far beyond the public courting of Congress — events such as last week’s meeting in the State Dining Room with more than 30 influential lawmakers — and dispatching his national security adviser for a pair of briefings at the Capitol in the past two weeks. In particular, Obama is actively seeking the counsel of three senior Senate Democrats who disagree with the current strategy: Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a West Point graduate and former Army Ranger; John Kerry of Massachusetts, a Vietnam veteran-turned-protester who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee; and Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. They are not the only Democrats who have been invited to offer advice, of course, but they appear to enjoy the most influence with the president among any members of Congress, administration officials say. These senators are quietly providing advice on some of the most important aspects of the president’s reassessment, including the fallout from Afghanistan’s apparently fraudulent national elections in August, the costs and realistic benefits of a major counterinsurgency effort, and the importance of neighboring Pakistan to U.S. interests. Most significant, they generally disagree with proposals by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal of the Army, the top military commander in Afghanistan, for a major troop increase. The general has sent the president a range of options, arguing that additional troops are critical to executing the counterinsurgency strategy for Afghanistan that Obama laid out in March. The general’s favored option is believed to be the deployment of 40,000 more servicemen, which would represent about a 60 percent increase beyond the roughly 68,000 troops slated to be in the country by the end of the year. As Obama considers McChrystal’s request, the three senators are advising the president not to escalate the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan instead. They have all suggested keeping the number of U.S. troops essentially where it is today, emphasizing the training of Afghan security forces and redirecting the focus of U.S. efforts in the region to nuclear-armed Pakistan. The Taliban is also resurgent there, and the lawmakers contend that Pakistan’s strategic importance is far greater than Afghanistan’s. Some military experts are concerned the senators may be leading Obama astray. “I worry that the group as a whole is not showing a clear alternative strategy on Afghanistan, even though all three are expressing reluctance to go along with McChrystal’s plan,” said Michael O’Hanlon, a national security expert at the Brookings Institution who supports McChrystal’s proposal. Whether the president embraces the senators’ recommendations is still an open question; he is not expected to unveil his decision for another few weeks. But at the White House meeting last week, Obama told lawmakers he would not significantly reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan or alter the mission to a targeted hunt for terrorists — a strategy recommended by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. With the three senators also opposed to drawing down existing troop levels in Afghanistan, it would appear their more or less status quo proposal is still under active consideration and may be gaining ground. Stephen Hess, an expert on congressional-White House relations at Brookings, says Obama is seeking more than advice from the trio of senators. Through his consultations with Levin, Kerry and Reed, the president is not only benefiting from their experience in military affairs and foreign policy, Hess notes, but also giving Congress a sense of involvement in perhaps the most important national security decision of Obama’s first year as commander in chief. “He wants buy-in from Congress,” Hess said. “Giving these senators an audience for their thoughts now can be worth a lot down the line.” There has been no call on Capitol Hill, even from lawmakers most interested in assertive legislative prerogative, that Obama needs any additional legislative permission from Congress; the law enacted in 2001 continues to provide him the authority he needs. But any troop increase will add billions of dollars to the defense budget, which Congress would need to approve. And beyond that, wartime presidents are infinitely more comfortable politically when their decisions are widely supported in the House and Senate. While the White House focuses on redrawing the strategy for Afghanistan, Capitol Hill is preoccupied with choosing up sides for partisan battle. Republicans are eager to portray Obama as indecisive and feckless on national security. His invitation to congressional leaders to discuss Afghanistan strategy last week does not appear to have mollified his GOP critics, who are generally pushing for a robust increase in troop strength — the closest possible replication of the “surge” that is widely seen as working to calm the violence in Iraq in the past two years. They have expressed impatience with how long the president has already been contemplating his options. Some even questioned why Obama is promising a new approach, given that he unveiled a new counterinsurgency strategy this spring and handpicked McChrystal to carry it out. Battle Lines Drawn “If, as the White House has said, withdrawal is not an option, then it is imperative that we provide our commanders and courageous troops with the direction, resources and reinforcements they need as soon as possible in order to accomplish their mission safely and effectively,” said Republican Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. Indeed, the first legislative skirmishes over Obama’s Afghanistan policy have already begun to crackle. Senate Republicans, impatient with Obama’s reluctance to embrace McChrystal’s recommendation, tried two weeks ago to add language to the annual Defense spending bill that would have required McChrystal, as well as other senior military and civilian officials, to testify before Congress on his troop request before the middle of next month — even if Obama had not yet decided what his new strategy would be. The amendment was rejected along party lines.</strong><br />

<strong>WASHINGTON, March 26 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's domestic success on healthcare reform may pay dividends abroad as the strengthened U.S. leader taps his momentum to take on international issues with allies and adversaries. More than a dozen foreign leaders have congratulated Obama on the new healthcare law in letters and phone calls, a sign of how much attention the fight for his top domestic policy priority received in capitals around the world. Analysts and administration officials were cautious about the bump Obama could get from such a win: Iran is not going to rethink its nuclear program and North Korea is not going to return to the negotiating table simply because more Americans will get health insurance in the coming years, they said. But the perception of increased clout, after a rocky first year that produced few major domestic or foreign policy victories, could generate momentum for Obama's agenda at home and in his talks on a host of issues abroad. &quot;It helps him domestically and I also think it helps him internationally that he was able to win and get through a major piece of legislation,&quot; said Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser to Republican President George W. Bush. &quot;It shows political strength, and that counts when dealing with foreign leaders.&quot; Obama's deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said the Democratic president's persistence in the long healthcare battle added credibility to his rhetoric on climate change, nuclear nonproliferation and other foreign policy goals. &quot;It sends a very important message about President Obama as a leader,&quot; Rhodes told Reuters during an interview in his West Wing office. &quot;The criticism has been: (He) sets big goals but doesn't close the deal. So, there's no more affirmative answer to that criticism than closing the biggest deal you have going.&quot;</strong><br />

Washington Times 09 <strong>(Kim R. Holmes SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES, 8/20/09, &quot;What's the Big Idea: Obama facing the tests of war in Afghanistan amid elections&quot;, lexis)</strong><br />
<strong>All this is true. But keeping his promise to win the &quot;good&quot; war in Afghanistan won't be easy. The president will face many tests along the way. Starting now. The first test is in responding to the outcome of Thursday's elections in Afghanistan. The Obama administration has not yet figured out how to integrate successfully its nation-building efforts at the central government level with the much harder work of dealing with local factions and tribes susceptible to Taliban intimidation. If the elections simply ratify the status quo in Kabul, the disconnect between central and local governance will likely continue. Corruption is undermining the legitimacy of the Afghan government, and legitimacy is critical in building up a strong Afghan army - as well as U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in the countryside. Until corruption is at least minimized, the war cannot be won. The second test is whether Mr. Obama will back his new strategy in Afghanistan with the resources needed to make it work. The administration's policy, unveiled in March, puts a high priority on protecting Afghan civilians as part of a counterinsurgency strategy. There is already pushback from some Democrats who insist the Afghan &quot;quagmire&quot; will cost too much and drain resources from domestic programs. Mr. Obama 's habit of trying to have it both ways - tacking back and forth between tough and soft statements and ultimately splitting the difference on policy - may not convince these Democrats in the long run. Mr. Obama will probably end up trying to keep his liberal critics at bay by giving Gen. Stan McChrystal fewer troops than he needs. That would produce an ever-worse dilemma down the road. Insufficient troops will minimize battlefield success, ultimately prolonging the war. The longer the war lasts, the more criticism Mr. Obama will face from his political base. Time is not on his side politically, and his antiwar position on Iraq actually puts him in a politically weaker position than former President George W. Bush was on war policies. Mr. Obama 's base is not only more hostile to some of his policies, but far less patient should he make unpopular decisions. That could lead to Mr. Obama 's third big test - one that could actually be his undoing. Whether the president knows it or not, his biggest allies on Afghanistan are pro-national security conservatives. Yet he still gives defensive speeches, as he did this week before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, attacking Sen. John McCain of Arizona and other conservatives over the war in Iraq. This makes no sense. If he is serious about winning in Afghanistan, he needs to stop this divisive rhetoric and realize that his Afghan policies face a potential challenge from the right flank as well. So far, most conservatives are holding strong behind the war effort. But there already are rumblings among some conservatives that &quot;Obama 's war&quot; may not be worth fighting. Far more threatening than traditional isolationist or libertarian antiwar arguments are so-called conservative realists who may conclude that only a minimalist effort is all that is possible - or worse, needed - in Afghanistan. Such people may come to think that the U.S. is caught in the &quot;graveyard of empires,&quot; a place where the more we try to do, the worse the problem gets. It's not that Mr. Obama will face a conservative revolt against the war in Afghanistan. But when he needs conservatives to face down the dovish left wing of his own party, he may not find them eager allies.</strong><br />

<strong>Even as President Obama contemplates how large a force of additional troops to send to Afghanistan, he reflected a growing concern last week that the war will deteriorate into a more protracted and bloody conflict. The president told reporters traveling with him on a weeklong tour of East Asia that he wants an “endgame” to the Afghanistan conflict so he won’t have to hand off the war to his successor. In doing so, Obama clearly indicated that he has his eye on a political clock that might run out in as few as three years. NOT ENOUGH TROOPS: As Marine patrols like the one above try to recapture Taliban-held areas, U.S. commanders are requesting as many as 40,000 more troops to carry out their mission. President Obama says he will give his answer soon. (Source: GETTY IMAGES / JOE RAEDLE.) On Capitol Hill, however, the Afghanistan clock is ticking much faster. With the war now in its ninth year, patience at home is wearing thin. And a growing chorus of lawmakers is now saying Obama has much less time before public support for the war — now below 50 percent — erodes to the point of collapse. The Democrats’ greatest fear is that the tipping point might occur just before the 2010 midterm elections — an awkward convergence of events that may imperil their jobs and jeopardize further congressional support for the war. So as Obama weighs a request from Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, his top commander in Afghanistan, for as many as 40,000 additional combat troops, lawmakers are focusing on their own political liabilities, which are the manifold costs of the conflict — in deaths, in dollars and in the deterioration of the military’s readiness to fight the next war. And they emphatically dismiss Obama’s multi-year time table, warning that whatever strategy he chooses must begin to show real progress by next fall at the latest. Otherwise, they warn, Democrats will abandon him. “He does not have that kind of time,” said Pennsylvania Democrat John P. Murtha, chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, noting that many fellow Democrats rode into Congress on a wave of anti-war sentiment in the last two elections. “This will affect not only his election, this will affect our election.” Already, the number of soldiers who have been killed in Afghanistan is approaching the watershed 1,000 mark, while thousands more have been horribly wounded and disfigured. Such casualty counts don’t include legions of servicemembers who suffer from debilitating psychological wounds that have resulted in catastrophic levels of anguish and suicide. With Obama expected to send over additional troops, all categories of casualties are certain to climb, further taxing public support for the war if the expected buildup doesn’t produce results quickly Lawmakers are also concerned about the financial cost of the Afghanistan fighting. Since U.S. troops invaded the country in late 2001, the war has cost U.S. taxpayers almost $227 billion. Congress is poised to provide almost $73 billion more for continuing operations this fiscal year. And for every 1,000 additional troops Obama sends to Afghanistan, the price will jump by $1 billion per year. At a time when the nation’s economy is still fragile and unemployment remains high, big increases in defense spending are virtually guaranteed to spark debate over the president’s priorities. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">And then there is the cost of depleting the military’s readiness to fight in some other corner of the world, if called upon to do so. Almost a decade of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq has worn down much of the military’s equipment and exhausted its ranks of experienced combat veterans</span></span>, and the military’s focus on counterinsurgency operations has left it ill-trained for conventional conflicts. <span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Individually, each of these rising costs would generate major concern for lawmakers. Taken together, they confront Congress like a cluster of time bombs, all potentially set to explode in the fall of 2010, or certainly by 2012 if conditions in Afghanistan don’t improve by then</span></span>. The administration is also mindful of the looming political dangers of a war with too many costs. Last week, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Kabul, where she urged President Hamid Karzai to strengthen his government’s accountability, a move that would give Congress greater confidence in U.S. military efforts there. Right now, the strongest support for the president’s plans for the war comes from Republicans, who have been urging Obama to approve McChrystal’s full troop request. War boosters argue that the 40,000 additional troops will tamp down the violence in Afghanistan and that the resulting stability will, in turn, shore up political support at home, just as George W. Bush’s 2007 surge of forces in Iraq eventually helped mollify critics of that conflict. An Increasingly Dangerous Place: Click Here to View Chart Many Democrats, however, fear the political consequences if a buildup of forces doesn’t produce results, at least before the sands in their political hourglass run out. Although most lawmakers have been supportive of the war in Afghanistan — launched with overwhelming approval by the public and Congress after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks — they cannot ignore recent opinion surveys that for the first time show that half the country feels the war is no longer worth the cost. Congress is unlikely to deny Obama the billions of dollars in appropriations for his troop buildup, which would probably be provided in a supplemental spending bill sometime next year. And experts say Congress may not deny future increases in spending either. Nonetheless, dampened voter enthusiasm suggests that an increasingly unpopular war would be difficult for the president to wage successfully without considerable political cost to himself and his party, experts say. “Many parts of the Democratic base will be sitting on their hands in the next election because they are so disenchanted,” said John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State University and an expert on public opinion in wartime. Still, history shows that Americans can withstand substantial pain if they believe the military is winning a war, said Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who worked on the National Security Council during the Clinton and Bush administrations. A corollary thought is that when Americans become dissatisfied with a war’s progress, either because of increasing violence or mounting casualties, public support erodes. In that light, Obama’s explanation of his new Afghanistan strategy and its benchmarks of progress will be as critical as his decision on additional forces, lawmakers say. “A lot depends on the case that the president makes and the expectations that he sets when he announces his troop deployment decision,” said Susan Collins of Maine, a member the Senate Armed Services Committee and one of the few Republicans who is skeptical about adding forces in Afghanistan. “If he decides to follow Gen. McChrystal’s recommendation, or comes close to it, and presents to Congress and the American people a rationale, people will give him additional time — how long exactly, I don’t know,” she said. “I would think the public would want to see improvement by next year at this time, certainly.” The real drivers of public opinion, of course, will be events in Afghanistan, not presidential speeches. If security doesn’t improve there, more and more voters may abandon a cause they once overwhelmingly supported. “If the Democrats are in trouble come September, October 2010, and it’s viewed as, to a significant extent, because of the war, then I think their constituents are going to argue for a shift,” said Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr., president of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a defense think tank, and an adviser on the Defense Policy Board, a group of outside experts that advises the Pentagon. Eroding Public Support The drop in public support for the war in Afghanistan has coincided with a sharp increase in U.S. military casualties this year. With 293 soldiers killed so far this year, 2009 is on track to become the deadliest year of the war. Indeed, of the 923 U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan since 2001, almost a third died in 2009. In addition, the 1,139 U.S. military personnel wounded in Afghanistan in just the past four months account for 26 percent of the 4,434 wounded throughout the war.</strong><br />

<strong><span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Were the worsening of U.S.-Russian relations due only to Bush’s policies, President Obama could easily fix things. But if U.S. relations with Russia worsened because of Putin’s transformation of Russia into an aggressively fascistoid state, then Obama can improve relations only at the margins—unless, of course, he’s willing to appease Moscow by sanctifying Russia’s neo-imperial hegemony over its non-Russian neighbors. Inasmuch as such a move would destabilize Russia and its neighbors—and, thus, Europe—by encouraging a hyperventilating Russian regime to engage in imperial overreach, no American President would willingly reset relations to the point of mutually assured debilitation. Putin’s Russia will have to experience its own Orange Revolution for a fundamental shift in relations to be possible. </span></span></strong><br />

<strong>While the Bush era saw the US hegemonic in the region, squeezing the defiant few like Syria and Saddam Hussein's Iraq, today's Middle East sees a power vacuum led by partial US retreat being filled by assertive regional and middle powers. Turkey and Brazil's recent <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8685846.stm" rel="nofollow">nuclear deal with Iran</a> typify this emerging new climate. Stephen Walt has highlighted that <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/05/13/the_end_of_the_world_as_we_know_it" rel="nofollow">this shift in power is global</a>, with Asia's share of GDP already outstripping that of the US or Europe. As ever, it seems the Middle East could prove a microcosm of these international changes. If the age of American uni-polarity is coming to an end, perhaps hastened by unnecessary wars and economic shortsightedness, it is much more likely that international relations in the Middle East will come to reflect the multi-polar world that will follow rather than revert to a bi-polar cold war. In such circumstances, it won't just be Russia and Turkey expanding their reach in the region, but China, India and Brazil will all bid for a role, too – presumably having fewer demands than Washington about their clients pursuing democratic reforms and peace with Israel. Saudi Arabia's <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2010/04/07/the_maturing_saudi-china_alliance_98904.html" rel="nofollow">growing relationship with China</a> might signify the shape of things to come. Not that this era is yet upon us. The US remains the superpower and could still effect serious change in the region, should it desire. However, the recent actions of Russia and Turkey in the Middle East do show a new assertiveness from regional powers to pursue their own path in defiance of US will, whether through arms deals, trade agreements or diplomatic coups. A new cold war is unlikely, but the age of unchallenged US hegemony in the Middle East could be ending.</strong><br />

<span style="color: black;">Central Asian instability risks global nuclear conflict involving the U.S. and Russia</span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Blank, 1 -</span><strong><span style="color: black;"> professor of research at the Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College, (Stephen, Central Asian Security: The New International Context, ed: Allison, p. 142-144)</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">The regional structure of political forces hardly engenders optimism about the strategic outcome. Given the uncertain domestic political outcomes among the oil and gas producers, the US ambivalence about committing forces and the dangerous regional situation of rival alliances create the potential for wider and more protracted regional conflicts which could become proxy wars for the great powers, like the Third World conflicts of the 1980s. There is a risk that polarization is being fostered along traditional lines. 61 In conjunction with its second war in Chechnya, Russia is renewing its determination to assert its Caucasian and Central Asian prerogatives together with China and against the United States.62 Russia's warnings about US efforts to gain military, political and economic leverage in the South Caucasus and Central Asia and the Russian elite's extreme sensitivity regarding the region show that Moscow too will resolutely contest the expanded US presence. This is explicitly expressed in Russian official statements under President Vladimir Putin. Russia's new draft military doctrine and security concept suggest that it will use nuclear deterrence against Western military action in the CIS region.63 The danger is that Russia and the USA could be drawn into a confrontation in an effort to rescue their allies or close partners from defeat in local conflicts. Many structural conditions for conventional war or protracted ethnic conflict where third parties intervene now exist in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Violent action by disaffected Islamic groups, drug trafficking and the unresolved ethnopolitical conflicts that dot the region, not to mention the undemocratic and unbalanced distribution of income in states with corrupt governments, provide plenty of dry timber for future fires. Recent history indicates that many Third World conflicts generated by local structural factors have had great potential for unintended escalation. Major powers often feel obliged to rescue their proxies and proteges. One or other of them may fail to grasp the nature of the stakes for the other side, since interests here are not as clearly defined as in Europe. Commitments involving the use of nuclear weapons or perhaps even conventional war to prevent the defeat of a client are not well established or clear as they are in Europe. For instance, in 1993 a suggestion by Turkey that it might intervene militarily on behalf of Azerbaijan during fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh region led to a Russian threat of nuclear retaliation against such intervention.64 There exists an 'arc of crisis' from the Balkans to China where the danger of conflicts and conflict escalation remains real. An assessment in the late 1980s by Richard Betts is still insightful, even if in the post-cold war period Russia's military resources have greatly declined. Betts observed that the greatest danger lies in areas where: (1) the potential for serious instability is high; (2) both superpowers perceive vital interests; (3) neither recognizes that the other's perceived interest or commitment is as great as its own; (4) both have the capability to inject conventional forces; and (5) neither has willing proxies capable of settling the situation.65 This analysis implies that for each side the interest or area in question is a vital one. This does not imply that conflict between the dominant powers in a region or their proxies is foreordained. Rather this analysis underlines the dangerous structural conditions in the region. Great-power rivalry does not necessarily impart stability to an already troubled region, quite the contrary. Russian and Chinese efforts at the Bishkek summit meeting of the 'Shanghai Five' group of states in 1999 to develop a new bloc with the Central Asian states and Russia's new military doctrine demonstrate that such rivalry stimulates efforts to create spheres of influence but also provides smaller states with the means to resist them by balancing competing rivals.66 </span></strong><br />

<strong>Russia, likewise, is grossly unprepared for confrontation with the United States. President Vladimir Putin is only beginning to collect the shards of Russian political, economic, and military power. Russia's population is in decline, swept by alcoholism, low birth rates and epidemics of tuberculosis and AIDS, situations compounded by an effective collapse of the Russian health care system. The Russian military is in shambles.</strong><br />
<strong>Abroad, the Putin government is only beginning to see some small successes in the campaign to reassert influence and control over the resource rich and strategically important Central Asian and Caucasus nations. Putin's new campaign to tie Russia's political and economic future to Europe, as a supplier of resources and transportation links to the Far East, has just started to take off. It would take little effort and capital at this time for the United States to bring Russia's nascent recovery to a halt, counter Moscow's initiatives and bleed the country dry.</strong><br />

 Turn—masking—focusing solely on the language used to describe something masks the problem and makes it harder to confront<br />
<span style="color: black;">Meisner,</span><strong><span style="color: black;"> professor of environmental studies at York University, </span></strong>1995 <strong>(Mark, “Resourcist Language: The Symbolic Enslavement of Nature”, Proceedings of the Conference on Communication and Our Environment, ed: David Sachsman, p. 242)</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Changing the language we use to talk about non­human nature is not a solution. As I suggested, language is not the problem. Rather, it seems more like a contagious symptom of a deeper and multi-faceted problem that has yet to be fully defined. Resourcist language is both an indicator and a carrier of the pathology of rampant ecological degradation. Further­more, language change alone can end up simply being a band-aid solution that gives the appearance of change and makes the problem all the less visible. In a recent article on feminist language reform, Susan Ehrlich and Ruth King (1994) argue that because meanings are socially constructed, attempts at introducing nonsexist language are being undermined by a culture that is still largely sexist. The words may have shifted, but the meanings and ideologies have not. The real world cure for the sick patient matters more than the treatment of a single symptom. Consequently, language change and cultural change must go together with social-moral change. It is naive to believe either that language is trivial, or that it is deterministic.</span></strong><br />
Their evidence is wrong about the etymology of the term ‘Afghanistan’—it is Persian for ‘Pashtun Place’ and has been used since the 1500s.<br />

<strong><span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The first part of the name, &quot;Afghan&quot;, is, at least since the 16th century AD, the Persian alternative name for the Pashtuns who are the founders and the largest ethnic group of the country.

Gillet and several other <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">scholars &quot;the word Afghan first appears in history in</span></span> the Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam in <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">982 AD.&quot;</span></span> Al-Biruni referred to Afghans as various tribes living on the western frontier mountains of the Indus River, which would be the Sulaiman Mountains. A Moroccan traveller, Ibn Battuta, visiting Kabul in 1333 writes: However, it is unknown whether these historical Afghans were identical with the Pashtuns. Summarizing the available information, the Encyclopædia Iranica states: It further explains: <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">By the 17th century AD, it seems that the Pashtuns themselves began using the term as an ethnonym</span></span> - a fact that is supported by traditional Pashto literature, for example, in the writings of the 17th-century Pashto poet Khushal Khan Khattak: <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The last part of the name, -stān is an ancient Iranian languages suffix for &quot;place&quot;, prominent in many languages of the region</span></span>. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The term &quot;Afghanistan&quot;, meaning the &quot;Land of Afghans&quot;, was mentioned by the 16th century Mughal Emperor Babur</span></span> in his memoirs, referring to the territories south of Kabul that were inhabited by Pashtuns called &quot;Afghans&quot; by Babur. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Until the 19th century the name was only used for the traditional lands of the Pashtuns, while the kingdom as a whole was known as the Kingdom of Kabul</span></span>, as mentioned by the British statesman and historian Mountstuart Elphinstone. Other parts of the country were at certain periods recognized as independent kingdoms, such as the Kingdom of Balkh in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">With the expansion and centralization of the country, Afghan authorities adopted and extended the name &quot;Afghanistan&quot; to the entire kingdom, after its English translation had already appeared in various treaties</span></span> between the British Raj and Qajarid Persia, referring to the lands subject to the Pashtun Barakzai Dynasty of Kabul. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">&quot;Afghanistan&quot; as the name for the entire kingdom was mentioned in 1857</span></span> by Friedrich Engels. <span class="underline0"><span style="text-decoration: none;">It became the official name when the country was recognized by the world community in 1919, after regaining full independence over its foreign affairs from the British, and was confirmed as such in the nation's 1923 constitution</span></span>.</strong><br />

A focus on representations destroys social change by ignoring political and material constraints<br />
Taft-Kaufman, 95 <strong>(Jill, professor, Department of Speech Communication And Dramatic Arts, at Central Michigan University, Southern Communication Journal, Spring, proquest)</strong><br />
<strong>The postmodern passwords of &quot;polyvocality,&quot; &quot;Otherness,&quot; and &quot;difference,&quot; unsupported by substantial analysis of the concrete contexts of subjects, creates a solipsistic quagmire. The political sympathies of the new cultural critics, with their ostensible concern for the lack of power experienced by marginalized people, aligns them with the political left. Yet, despite their adversarial posture and talk of opposition, their discourses on intertextuality and inter-referentiality isolate them from and ignore the conditions that have produced leftist politics--conflict, racism, poverty, and injustice. In short, as Clarke (1991) asserts, postmodern emphasis on new subjects conceals the old subjects, those who have limited access to good jobs, food, housing, health care, and transportation, as well as to the media that depict them. Merod (1987) decries this situation as one which leaves no vision, will, or commitment to activism. He notes that academic lip service to the oppositional is underscored by the absence of focused collective or politically active intellectual communities. Provoked by the academic manifestations of this problem Di Leonardo (1990) echoes Merod and laments: Has there ever been a historical era characterized by as little radical analysis or activism and as much radical-chic writing as ours? Maundering on about Otherness: phallocentrism or Eurocentric tropes has become a lazy academic substitute for actual engagement with the detailed histories and contemporary realities of Western racial minorities, white women, or any Third World population. (p. 530) Clarke's assessment of the postmodern elevation of language to the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of critical discussion is an even stronger indictment against the trend. Clarke examines Lyotard's (1984) The Postmodern Condition in which Lyotard maintains that virtually all social relations are linguistic, and, therefore, it is through the coercion that threatens speech that we enter the &quot;realm of terror&quot; and society falls apart. To this assertion, Clarke replies: I can think of few more striking indicators of the political and <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">intellectual impoverishment</span> of a view of society that can only recognize the discursive. If the worst terror we can envisage is the threat not to be allowed to speak, we are appallingly ignorant of terror in its elaborate contemporary forms. It may be the intellectual's conception of terror (what else do we do but speak?), but its projection onto the rest of the world would be calamitous....(pp. 2-27) The realm of the discursive is derived from the requisites for human life, which are in the physical world, rather than in a world of ideas or symbols.(4) Nutrition, shelter, and protection are basic human needs that require collective activity for their fulfillment. Postmodern emphasis on the discursive without an accompanying analysis of how the discursive emerges from material circumstances hides the complex task of envisioning and working towards concrete social goals (Merod, 1987). Although the material conditions that create the situation of marginality escape the purview of the postmodernist, the situation and its consequences are not overlooked by scholars from marginalized groups. Robinson (1990) for example, argues that &quot;the justice that working people deserve is economic, not just textual&quot; (p. 571). Lopez (1992) states that &quot;the starting point for organizing the program content of education or political action must be the present existential, concrete situation&quot; (p. 299). West (1988) asserts that borrowing French post-structuralist discourses about &quot;Otherness&quot; blinds us to realities of American difference going on in front of us (p. 170). Unlike postmodern &quot;textual radicals&quot; who Rabinow (1986) acknowledges are &quot;fuzzy about power and the realities of socioeconomic constraints&quot; (p. 255), most writers from marginalized groups are clear about how discourse interweaves with the concrete circumstances that create lived experience. People whose lives form the material for postmodern counter-hegemonic discourse do not share the optimism over the new recognition of their discursive subjectivities, because such an acknowledgment does not address sufficiently their collective historical and current struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic injustice. They do not appreciate being told they are living in a world in which there are no more real subjects. Ideas have consequences. Emphasizing the discursive self when a person is hungry and homeless represents both a cultural and humane failure. The need to look beyond texts to the perception and attainment of concrete social goals keeps writers from marginalized groups ever-mindful of the specifics of how power works through political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.</strong><br />
The impact is extinction, the refusal to engage in traditional politics is an abdication of social responsibility that makes social crises inevitable<br />

<strong><span style="color: black;">The decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century America poses a series of great dilemmas and challenges. Many ideological currents are scrutinized here – localism, metaphysics, spontaneism, post-modernism, Deep Ecology – intersect with and reinforce each other. While these currents have deep origins in popular movements of the 1960s and 1970s, they remain very much alive in the 1990s. Despite their different outlooks and trajectories, they all share one thing in common: a depoliticized expression of struggles to combat and overcome alienation. The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change. As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved – perhaps even unrecognized – only to fester more ominously in the future. And such problems (ecological crisis, poverty, urban decay, spread of infectious diseases, technological displacement of workers) cannot be understood outside the larger social and <em>global</em> context of internationalized markets, finance, and communications. Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or sidestep these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impotence. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to the increasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions. 74 In the meantime, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The unyielding truth is that, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the United States, it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies. This last point demands further elaboration. The shrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehow disappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people’s lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites – an already familiar dynamic in many lesser-developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world, not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a <em>reassertion</em> of politics in more virulent guise – or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collective interests that had vanished from civil society. 75</span></strong><br />

No net benefit and turn – Khorasan is an al Qaeda word and emboldens terrorism – the counterplan would utterly eviscerate US credibility globally by endorsing a terrorist jihad. It also doesn’t solve because it refers to Northern Afghanistan and Iran<br />

<strong>What is the significance of “Khorasan”? It’s a bit like “Jerusalem” — only yesterday I was reading that Grand Rapids, Michigan is referred to as “Jerusalem” by some folk of Dutch extraction in the Pacific Northwest. I think we’ll get the sense of the idea if we call it of “Khorasan of sacred memory and present hope”. As the UCLA scholar <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.publiceye.org/frontpage/911/Islam/rosenfeld2001-01.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jean Rosenfeld</a> puts it (personal communication): In any event, Khorasan refers to much more than a former region of the Islamic empires. It has a mythical meaning that is being taken seriously as a “once and future kingdom” in the millennial mindset of al-Qaida. The territory once called Khorasan — and the borders covered by that name shifted a great deal over the centuries — covered parts of what we now know as Iran (which still has a province named Khorasan), Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and NW Pakistan. I’m finding references that suggest the name originally meant “the place where the sun rises” — the East, the Orient. Rosenfeld suggests that Khorasan “is code in al-Qaida for the warrior sect itself” — “the army of the (future) caliphate in the mind of the International jihad” and thus, Al-Qaida in Fawaz Gerges’ broad sense. My own reading ties it in with the ahadith about the “black banners of Khorasan” and the army which will sweep down from Khorasan to Jerusalem… As I’ve noted <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://zenpundit.com/?p=3205" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">before</a> there are many variant ahadith describing the army of the Mahdi. Here is one commonly cited version: If you see the black flags coming from Khurasan, join that army, even if you have to crawl over ice, for this is the army of the Caliph, the Mahdi and no one can stop that army until it reaches Jerusalem.” Quite how we should align that with actual jihadist entities such as AQ core and or its subsidiaries or the various bodies called Taliban, however, I’m not sure. The clearest implication I can see is to the place of origin of the Mahdi’s army. It is at least as much an eschatological as a geographic claim. Since the imagery of Khorasan is closely tied to that of black flags, I would like to take a slight detour here. We have seen that the black flags signify the army of the Mahdi, but what are its origins, and how widely is it used? The Islamic Imagery Project at West Point Combating Terrorism Center lists “Black Flag” under the heading “<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ctc.usma.edu/imagery/imagery_warfare.asp#blackflag" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warfare Motifs</a>“, saying: The Black Flag (<em>al-raya</em>) traces its roots to the very beginning of Islam. It was the battle (<em>jihad</em>) flag of the Prophet Muhammad, carried into battle by many of his companions, including his nephew ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib. The flag regained prominence in the 8th century with its use by the leader of the Abbasid revolution, Abu Muslim, who led a revolt against the Umayyad clan and its Caliphate. The Umayyads, the ruling establishment of the Islamic world at the time, were seen as greedy, gluttonous, and religiously wayward leaders. The Abbasid revolution, then, was aimed at installing a new, more properly Islamic ruling house that would keep orthodox Islam at the center of its regime. Since then, the image of the black flag has been used as a symbol of religious revolt and battle (i.e. jihad). In Shiite belief, the black flag also evokes expectations about the afterlife. In the contemporary Islamist movement, the black flag is used to symbolize both offensive jihad and the proponents of reestablishing the Islamic Caliphate. The flag is frequently identified with specific jihadist groups — thus Bill Roggio, writing in Long War Journal, refers to “the al rayah, the black flag of al Qaeda” in his 2007 article, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/02/musa_qala_and_the_na.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">“Musa Qala and the NATO offensive”.</a> Likewise, the Somalian president Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed in 2006 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.somalilandtimes.net/sl/2005/248/027.shtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">is reported to have spoken </a>in 2006 of “the ‘black flag’ of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban” — and as recently as this month, Al-Shabaab <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Hizbul_Islam_has_no_issue_with_Somali_flag.shtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">“vowed to replace the Somali flag with its (al-Shabaab’s) black flag”.</a> So the Black Flags or banners represent the Prophet as warrior at one end of Islamic history and the Mahdi’s army from Khorasan at the other — and have been adopted as symbols of jihad by different groups from the Abbasids to al-Shabaab. They are indeed indicative of jihad, but it is their association with Khorasan that gives them a specifically Mahdist reference. The defeat of the Umayyads and establishment of the Abbasid caliphate, and hence also the golden age of Islamic culture, was strongly supported by forces raised in Khorasan, and David Cook in his <em>Contemporary Muslim Apocalyptic Literature</em> suggests that “the Abbasids sought to present their movement as the fulfillment of messianic expectations, and so they produced a great quantity of materials given in the form of hadith traditions to indicate that the Mahdi would come from this region.” The tale lives on. As I’ve mentioned before, Cook notes that bin Laden’s mentor, Abdullah Azzam, made fresh use of this line of messianic tradition and “popularized the position of Afghanistan as the messianic precursor to the future liberation of Palestine” in his book, <em>From Kabul to Jerusalem</em>, while bin Laden refers to finding “a safe base in Khurasan, high in the peaks of the Hindu Kush” in his 1996 Declaration of Jihad. The spiritual geography, then, is clear: Khorasan is that place in the east, somewhere in the general region including eastern Iran and northern Afghanistan, from which the Mahdi’s army will come — and it is very plausibly also a place the jihadist might need to “crawl over ice” to reach. I think Rosenfeld is right in suggesting that al-Balawi’s geographic cognomen is a significant one, as is “Abu Dujana” — the name of a particularly valiant companion of the Prophet, as I discussed in a <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://zenpundit.com/?p=3266#comment-14962" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previous post</a>. But which of the various jihadist forces currently deployed in Afghanistan and nearby might be the nucleus of the Mahdi’s forces? The army with black flags from Khorasan has been identified with the Abbasids, with the Iranian revolutionaries, and with the Taliban. Bin Laden would presumably wish for it to be with al-Qaida, and Cook also says, this time in <em>Understanding Jihad</em>: Since Afghanistan, as Khurasan, has powerful resonance with many Muslims because of the messianic expectations focused on that region, this gave the globalist radical Muslims associated with al-Qa’ida under the leadership of Bin Ladin additional moral authority to proclaim jihad and call for the purification of the present Muslim governments and elites. In Jordan via the jihadist web forums, al-Balawi signaled his identification with the victorious army of the coming Mahdi and with jihadists in Afghanistan by his choice of the cognomen “al-Khorasani” — but the name alone does not tell us which particular jihadist group he might have been thinking of, and that may not even have been an question he felt the need to resolve at that time. Once in Khorasan itself, al-Khorasani left us two “media” items, a magazine interview and a video, and we might hope that they would add to our understanding of the more literal, geographical meaning his name carried, for they clearly indicate his associations. According to Flashpoint-Intel, who provided the version of the interview I’ve seen, al-Khorasani’s interview was given to “Vanguards of Khorasan” which they describe as “a well-known Taliban propaganda magazine” and released by the Al-Fajr Media Center, which they term “the official online logistical arm of Al-Qaida”. SITE refers to “Vanguards” as “the … magazine of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan”. Others more familiar with the logistics may want to clarify the point. The video, then, seems to give the clearest indication. Al-Khorasani was taped sitting next to Hakimullah Mehsud, the head of the Terik- i-Taliban Pakistan or TPP (whose death in a drone strike is reported but unconfirmed at the time of writing), and indicated his allegiance with the words, “We will never forget the blood of our emir Baitullah Mehsud” — referring to Hakimullah’s predecessor. In general, “Khorasan” doesn’t appear to function as code for a particular jihadist organization, but as a more general symbol for victorious jihad — coming from the East, faithful to the truth, unstoppable, ushering in the Caliphate, serving the cause of the Mahdi, and thus heralding the End of Days.</strong><br />

<strong>Court’s decisions are perceived – send a strong signal.</strong><br />
<strong>Smith, 2007</strong><br />
[Joseph L., University of Alabama “Presidents, Justices, and Deference to Administrative Action”, The Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization 5/9, (23)2] <br />
The consequences of the institutional choice are more complex and potentially far-reaching. A decision endorsing the disputed agency action not only allows the agency decision to stand (with whatever policy consequences that entails) but also signals to the lower courts that agencies should be given latitude to take the disputed action. Every decision upholding a disputed agency action expands, ever so slightly perhaps, the ability of agencies to implement their agendas. Because lower courts are supposed to implement the legal doctrines articulated by the Supreme Court, the effects of this institutional choice, whether or not to defer to the agency decision, will ripple throughout the lower courts and should affect the decisions in many disputes. This article continues a line of research begun by Linda Cohen and Matt Spitzer in the 1990s. Cohen and Spitzer began with the insight that Supreme Court decisions evaluating agency actions do more than merely uphold or overturn the action being litigated. These decisions also communicate legal doctrine to the lower courts, sending signals regarding the level of deference they should show to agency decisions. Given the small number of administrative law cases the Supreme Court hears each term, they assert that <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">the signal- sending or doctrinal element </span>of these decisions will have a larger impact on policy than the direct effects on the litigants. Cohen and Spitzer argue that Supreme Court Justices can best achieve their policy-related goals if they consider their ideological relationship with the executive branch and then factor this relationship into their decisions evaluating administrative actions. Their model generally suggests that as the median member of the Court gets ideologically closer to the president, <span class="CharCharChar1">the </span>Court should become more deferential to the administrative action. <br />
C. <strong>Capital key to START ratification</strong><br />
<strong>Rogov 10</strong> (Sergey, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of the United States of America and Canada, in an Interview by Vasiliy Voropayev, Russian pundit views Obama 's first year, prospects for relations with USA, lexis, BBC Monitoring Former Soviet Union – Political, lexis)<br />
Given the existence of political will it is possible to reach agreement. Mutual benefits in the sphere of monitoring and verification - &quot;officially legitimized espionage&quot; - could be found within the framework of the entire strategic arms complex. The Americans are developing the strategic missile defence system. Although Obama has substantially limited this, it still prompts serious misgivings on Russia's part. Therefore I think we would be very interested in telemetry from American interceptor missiles as well as verification of the production of missile defence systems. That cannot be done within the framework of a START treaty. Parallel agreements are needed here, but it is very difficult to achieve these in a short space of time. The domestic political situation in the United States has now changed considerably. The ratification of the START treaty requires not a simple majority of votes in the Senate, but a qualified majority - 67 out of 100 votes. The Democrats do not have that number. In December last year all 40 Republican senators and the independent Senator Joseph Lieberman sent Obama a letter stipulating requirements for the new treaty that would make it unacceptable to us. Therefore, at the moment, any talk of how ratification must take place in Russia and the United States simultaneously seems purely theoretical. If Obama had the political capital, then of course the White House could push this agreement through. However, he has well and truly squandered that capital recently. Nevertheless, one year is not long enough to draw conclusions about a presidency. Remember the first years of John Kennedy or Ronald Reagan. They did not achieve any particular successes in that time. It is now possible to conclude that 2010 will be decisive for Obama. If he is able to seize the initiative, then the implementation of his ambitious programme both within the country and in the international arena will become a reality. Maybe the &quot;reset&quot; will change from a mere declaration into a real, mutually beneficial partnership between Russia and the United States. I am convinced that only Russian-American agreements on START and other key issues can create a basis for ensuring international security in the multipolar world. This process will become multilateral; Europe, China, India, and other centres of power will take part. That cannot happen without collaboration between Russia and the United States.<br />

But arguments from both hawks and doves have missed an urgent point: that <span class="UnderlineChar">without a new treaty, Washington will be unable to manage the risks associated with Russia’s vast nuclear arsenal, <strong>which still poses the single greatest existential threat to the United States.</strong> </span>With around 4,000 deployed nuclear warheads, a staggering 1,000 tons of weapons-grade nuclear material, hundreds of deployed ballistic missiles and thousands of experts with the knowledge to construct such systems from scratch, <span class="UnderlineChar">Russia is still potentially the world’s nuclear supermarket. Agreements governing these arsenals are essential to preventing the many national security nightmares of nuclear proliferation</span> to rogue states and terrorist groups from becoming realities. To protect America, we must agree to, and verify, limits on what the Russians have, know how they are using it, and take adequate steps to ensure that devastating weapons and dangerous materials remain safe from terrorist theft. As of Dec. 5, 2009, when the 1991 START agreement expired, we lack any enforceable, verifiable treaty to provide that level of information. We need a new treaty in force not only to plug holes left gaping by the old treaty’s expiration, but also to increase our security by imposing further limits on what new nuclear weapons the Russians can develop and deploy. A successor to START would likely lower the maximum number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads allowed to between 1,500 and 1,675 on each side — still enough to destroy the world many times over, but far below the 6,000 allowed under the old treaty. Strategic delivery vehicles — missiles, bombers and nuclear missile submarines — will be further cut from 1,600 to around 800. <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>Reducing Russia’s nuclear arsenal</strong></span> and taking missile launchers in both countries off alert <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>reduces the likelihood of accidental nuclear war</strong></span>, keeping Americans safer. <span class="UnderlineChar">Verified and permanent reductions in the Russian nuclear arsenal will dramatically reduce the number of targets for potential theft or diversion of nuclear technology to terrorists</span>. Over the past two decades, the U.S. has invested at least $10 billion to ensure security for Russian and former Soviet nuclear material, technologies, facilities, and individual experts under the auspices of the “Nunn-Lugar” Cooperative Threat Reduction and other bilateral and multilateral programs. These programs have helped to deactivate over 7,500 former Soviet nuclear warheads, destroy over 2,000 missiles, and eliminate over 1,100 missile launchers. But without a comprehensive U.S.-Russian arms control agreement in place, steps like these could be totally nullified by production of new nuclear materials, weapons and launchers without any U.S. or international monitoring. Even after a new treaty enters into force, the U.S. and Russia will possess the world’s largest nuclear arsenals by a wide margin. And as long as nuclear weapons exist, leaders across the political spectrum concur, the U.S. must maintain the world’s strongest, safest and most reliable arsenal. Yet in addition to reducing the size of the threat itself, <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>a new agreement would be beneficial for increasing regular engagement between the U.S. and Russia on strategic issues, which will help build mutual understanding, and avert needless suspicion and conflict.</strong> </span>Two decades after the end of the Cold War, Americans and Russians are increasingly intertwined in global financial and energy markets, and we share immediate and vital national security interests in preventing terrorism, state failure and drug trafficking throughout the Eurasian region. Yet <span class="UnderlineChar">our communication on security issues has been in dangerous decline for the past decade</span>. In a sense, this should come as no surprise, since the most recent comprehensive U.S.-Russian security treaty was actually signed by the United States and the Soviet Union, which no longer exists. <span class="UnderlineChar">Any “reset” that puts U.S.-Russian relations on a more productive footing <strong>will depend first and foremost on forging a durable bilateral agreement to replace START</strong></span>. <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>Arms control</strong></span> is not in itself a solution to U.S.-Russian tensions, or a guarantee of security from the nuclear terror threat, but if history is any guide, it is <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>where we must begin.</strong></span><br />

<strong>E. The impact is extinction</strong><br />

<span class="UnderlineChar">The first manmade existential risk was the inaugural detonation of an atomic bomb</span>. At the time, there was some concern that the explosion might start a runaway chain-reaction by “igniting” the atmosphere. Although we now know that such an outcome was physically impossible, it qualifies as an existential risk that was present at the time. For there to be a risk, given the knowledge and understanding available, it suffices that there is some subjective probability of an adverse outcome, even if it later turns out that objectively there was no chance of something bad happening. If we don’t know whether something is objectively risky or not, then it is risky in the subjective sense. The subjective sense is of course what we must base our decisions on.[2] At any given time we must use our best current subjective estimate of what the objective risk factors are.[3] <span class="UnderlineChar">A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR</span>. <span class="UnderlineChar">An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal</span>. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a <span class="UnderlineChar"><strong>nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization</strong></span>.[4] <span class="UnderlineChar">Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately</span>. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently. Such a war might however be a local terminal risk for the cities most likely to be targeted. Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.<br />

<br />
<strong>B. Violation – the aff doesn’t reduce the physical deployment of forces – they change particular military combat tactics by stopping the use of one type of force. Presence is only the military means – not the particular mission it’s used for</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Kugler, 98</strong> – senior consultant at the Center for Technology and National Security Policy (CTNSP) of the National Defense University, he previously was a Distinguished Research Professor there (Richard, “Future Directions for the U.S. Overseas Military Presence”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4668:http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR956/MR956.2.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR956/MR956.2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR956/MR956.2.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4668 -->)<br />
Overseas presence is a policy instrument: a means to an end, not an end in itself. The United States deploys military forces abroad for specific purposes, and the posture, ideally, should reflect these purposes. One purpose is to perform the important but narrow mission of waging war and otherwise carrying out combat operations on short notice. An equally important purpose, however, is political and strategic. Overseas-presence forces are intended to work with the forces of friendly and allied countries, as well as with U.S. forces based in CONUS, to influence the behavior of many countries and therefore to help shape the international environment. Both purposes must be kept in mind when judging the performance of the current posture and future requirements.<br />
<span class="Underline">A </span>legitimate question can be raised about whether the term overseas presence is the best name for this endeavor. During the Cold War, the relevant term was forward defense. This term was discarded when the Cold War ended, and it was replaced first by forward presence, then by overseas presence. One effect has been to strip away provocative connotations; an additional effect has been to create a term that seems devoid of purpose or activity. The term overseas presence merely states that U.S. forces are deployed overseas, but it says nothing about their ends and means. Perhaps a better term might be overseas security engagement or overseas security commitments, terms that convey a sense of strategic purpose, rather than presence for its own sake.<br />
For convenience I use overseas presence. However, I provide a comprehensive definition of this term because it includes so many things:<br />
Overseas presence is the set of U.S. military assets and activities abroad that, as a complement to power projection from CONUS, engages in purposeful security commitments and management efforts on behalf of a broad spectrum of national objectives that are “strategic”—that is, political, economic, and military in nature.<br />
<br />
<strong>C. Voting issue –</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1. Limits – defining presence as a mission is unlimited – it refers to any or every political goal or tactic the US has</strong><br />
<strong>Dismukes, 94</strong> – representative of the Center for Naval Analyses to the London staff of the Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces Europe. (Bradford, “National Security Strategy and Forward Presence: Implications<br />
for Acquisition and Use of Forces,” March, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4669:http://cna.org/sites/default/files/research/2793019200.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cna.org/sites/default/files/research/2793019200.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://cna.org/sites/default/files/research/2793019200.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4669 -->)<br />
Beyond the direct defense of the United States, U.S. conventional forces fulfill three strategic functions: overseas presence, immediate crisis response, and sustained, large-scale combat. The definitions of the three provide the framework for decision on forces. Basically, forces needed for other tasks—for example, peace-keeping and peace enforcement—are lesser cases of these three. (The Bush Administration grouped the latter two together under the label &quot;Crisis Response.&quot; The Bottom-Up Review does not address crisis response except by implication as part of phase 1, before large-scale combat in a &quot;major regional contingency.&quot; Mr. Aspin tends to put the label presence on all forward forces whether they are forces for presence (as will be specified) or whether they are engaged in the tasks of crisis response.)<br />
A basic problem with overseas presence is that the term describes both a military posture (military means) and a military mission (military means and political objectives). In the case of presence as a mission, the objective is influence on behalf of a variety of U.S. political goals. This ambiguity is made worse by the fact that the term has been in use since at least the 1960s, but it has never been defined in the JCS dictionary of military terms. <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">As a strategic task</span> of the armed forces, overseas presence is here defined as the routine operation of forces forward (the means) to influence what foreign governments,113 both adversary and friend, think and do (the ends) without combat.114<br />
Overseas presence does not constitute a strategy, though it or a similar term may in time become the shorthand name for the national strategy. The national strategy is one of engagement of U.S. power in the key regions to promote their stability and democratic development. As described in the body of this paper, a national strategy would integrate the components of U.S. power to achieve stability in the short term and build cooperative relations in the long term. The latter would address the dangers inherent in the international system, outlined in table 1, on page 23.<br />

The United States has determined that the detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, do not qualify as &quot;prisoners of war&quot; under the Geneva Conventions. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:190:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r422&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r422&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r422"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:190 --> Detainees who were members of the terrorist <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:191:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@PAGE_745_8151&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: PAGE_745_8151&quot;/&gt; --><a name="PAGE_745_8151"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:191 --> [*745] organization known as al Qaeda do not qualify as POWs because the Geneva Conventions are only applicable to &quot;armed conflicts&quot; - a term that does not include conflicts with terrorists. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:192:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r423&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r423&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r423"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:192 --> While the Geneva Conventions were applicable to the armed conflict with Afghanistan, Taliban detainees have not been afforded POW status because they fail to meet certain requirements set out in Article 4 of Geneva III. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:193:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r424&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r424&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r424"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:193 --> Because they have not been conferred POW status, both al Qaeda and Taliban detainees are ineligible to receive the important protections that the Geneva Conventions provide. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:194:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r425&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r425&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r425"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:194 --><br />

Congressional breach poses more complicated problems for the judiciary. Unlike with respect to the States, the Supremacy Clause does not clearly command courts to prevent Congressional breach of treaties. Instead, the judiciary shares the job of treaty enforcement with Congress (and also with the President, as discussed below). In addition, Congress has the power, accepted since at least 1798, to terminate, or repudiate, treaty obligations altogether.<br />
When Congress acts inconsistently with a U.S. treaty obligation, the rule of deference has been clear: the judiciary refuses to enforce the treaty <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">independently</span>. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:212:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r45&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r45&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r45"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:212 --> Arguably, in the realm of treaty enforcement, Congress is an alternative, and perhaps <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">predominant</span>, enforcement agency for American treaties. That is not to say that Congress enforces treaties in the usual legal sense of the term but rather that Congress enforces them through implementation. By passing implementing legislation, Congress can decide how it wants a particular treaty to be enforced in the United States. The judiciary, in turn, <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">looks for signs that Congress has taken charge of treaty enforcement</span> in a given area. That can be evidenced most clearly by the passage of implementing legislation, but sometimes the passage of prior legislation in a field can demonstrate that <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:213:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@PAGE_588_8460&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: PAGE_588_8460&quot;/&gt; --><a name="PAGE_588_8460"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:213 --> [*588] Congress has exerted its control over an area of treaty enforcement. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:214:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r46&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r46&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r46"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:214 --> In either case (more obviously the former), potential inconsistency with the treaty represents a Congressional choice.<br />
Independent judicial interpretation of international law undermines Congressional treaty power<br />
<strong>Neuman, 04</strong> (Gerald, professor of jurisprudence at Columbia University, 98 A.J.I.L. 82, “THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND INTERNATIONAL LAW: The Uses of International Law in Constitutional Interpretation”, January, lexis)<br />
Normative reasoning borrowed from international human rights sources will not necessarily prevail in the process of constitutional interpretation. Other normative considerations omitted there may be relevant, and consensual and institutional factors may also come into play. The Court may conclude that the normatively compelling interpretation of a right cannot be adopted at the constitutional level but, rather, should await political implementation. I emphasize again that the international human rights regime does not call for implementation at the constitutional level, only compliance. Thus, the Supreme Court has reason to examine international human rights norms and decisions interpreting them for the normative and functional insights that they may provide on analogous issues of constitutional right. They certainly cannot control constitutional interpretation, but they may inform it.<br />
The use of human rights treaties as an aid in construing constitutional rights might seem superficially in tension with the Supreme Court's reassurance in Reid v. Covert that the treaty power cannot be employed to violate constitutional rights. 31 That appearance should dissolve on closer examination. The treaty makers cannot override constitutional norms, and they cannot order the Supreme Court to alter its interpretation of a constitutional provision. 32 But treaties, like legislation, can contribute to a shift in the factual, institutional, and normative environment within which the Court carries on its task of constitutional interpretation. The resulting doctrinal evolution is unavoidable in any candid account of U.S. constitutional history. Nothing in Reid v. Covert and its progeny precludes this indirect influence of treaty making on constitutional law. Treaties and the case law arising under them thus become data available for the Court's consideration in elaborating the contemporary meaning of constitutional norms. The political branches can neither require the Court to follow international or foreign law in interpreting the Constitution nor prohibit the Court from considering international or foreign law. Under current circumstances, the Supreme Court correctly does not engage in the practice, pursued by some other constitutional courts, of construing constitutional rights for the purpose of judicially implementing the positive international obligations of the nation under human rights treaties. The positive effect of treaty norms differs from the moral or functional insight that they may provide. Human rights treaties do not require implementation at the constitutional level, and in the U.S. legal system Congress retains ultimate control over the means of implementing--or breaching--a treaty. Entrenching positive human rights standards as [*89] constitutional interpretation, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the treaty as such, would deprive the political branches of their authority to choose methods of treaty implementation, and would not be consistent with current constitutional understandings. 33<br />
This utterly destroys hegemony<br />
<strong>Wilkinson, 04</strong> (J. Harvie, Circuit Judge for the 4th Circuit, 27 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 423, “DEBATE: THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN JUDICIAL DECISIONS”, lexis)<br />
So of course international law should play a part in American judicial reasoning. It would be odd if it did not. In some areas, foreign and international law is made relevant by our Constitution, by statute or treaty, by the well-developed principles of common law, by overwhelming considerations of comity, or simply by private commercial agreement of the parties. But when judges, on their own motion and without any direction by Congress or the Constitution decide to make such precedents relevant, we are dealing with an entirely different question.<br />
So judges must not wade, <strong>sua sponte</strong>, into international law's deep blue sea. Rather, we ought to ask: How does American law make foreign or international standards relevant? Why should we ask this threshold question? Because it is important that the United States speak with one, not multiple, voices in foreign affairs. The Constitution is explicit on this: Article I, Section 10 says that &quot;no State shall enter into any Treaty [or] Alliance&quot; with a foreign power. 9 The Constitution leaves the conduct of foreign and military affairs largely to the political branches -- not the courts. The diplomatic credibility of the United States would plummet if the actions and pronouncements of the executive and legislative branches in foreign and military matters were later repudiated and contradicted by judicial decree.<br />

Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because <span class="underline0">a world in which the U</span>nited <span class="underline0">S</span>tates <span class="underline0">exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages</span>. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, <span class="underline0">such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with</span> the world's major problems, such as <span class="underline0">nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts</span>. Finally<span class="underline0">, U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling</span> the United States and <span class="underline0">the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and </span>all <span class="underline0">the attendant dangers, including</span> a <span class="underline0">global nuclear exchange</span>. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.<br />

The basic spectrum of possible approaches to reservations contrary to the object and purpose of the treaty could thus be summarized as follows: (1) the &quot;gotcha&quot; approach, whereby invalid reservations are stripped and the state is held to the treaty's full terms; <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:215:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r232&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r232&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r232"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:215 --> (2) the &quot;one-size fits all&quot; approach, whereby each treaty would be accompanied by a &quot;guide to reservations practice&quot; stipulating acceptable reservations practice; <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:216:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r233&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r233&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r233"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:216 --> (3) the &quot;custom tailoring&quot; approach, whereby reservations objected to by States Parties are respected and the relevant articles simply cease to operate vis-a-vis the reserving and objecting states; <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:217:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r234&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r234&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r234"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:217 --> and (4) the &quot;boot&quot; approach, whereby a party's membership in a treaty is revoked.<br />
The &quot;gotcha&quot; approach contradicts the principles of treaty law as understood by the United States. The Supreme Court in Foster and Percheman, affirmed that the mutual intent of the parties determines whether a given provision of a treaty is self-executing. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:218:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r235&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r235&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r235"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:218 --> Similarly, such an approach is at odds with one of the two most basic principles of treaty law - consent to be bound. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:219:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r236&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r236&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r236"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:219 --> If clearly expressed, the negotiated conditions that define the voluntary obligations a country assumes, are understood to be a precondition to the continued existence of said obligations. Since the U.S.' intent is clearly expressed and on the record (a precondition to ratification), a reviewing court would not have to examine the treaty's text. Other states could not have intended the treaty to be self-executing as it applies to the United States if they were apprised of the clear impossibility of the <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:220:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@PAGE_467_8543&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: PAGE_467_8543&quot;/&gt; --><a name="PAGE_467_8543"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:220 --> [*467] same. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:221:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r237&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r237&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r237"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:221 --><br />
Advocates of the &quot;gotcha&quot; approach must bear in mind the unintended consequences of enforcing upon a state obligations to which it did not consent, or could not reasonably be construed as having consented. For example, the United States might <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">cease to advocate for human rights treaties and fail to join future treaties</span>. This latter implication, however, seems increasingly irrelevant as U.S. &quot;exceptionalism&quot; grows. 238 Nevertheless, even strong human rights proponents, such as Professor Louis Henkin, maintain that in a multilateral treaty, a reservation or understanding embodies the intent of the party and this intent is used to interpret what obligations that party undertook. 239 <br />
The &quot;gotcha&quot; approach seeks to steamroll over the disjuncture between the Senate power as understood by the Senate and, presumably, the Supreme Court, and the official interpretation of applicable rights and duties under international law. The approach is only useful, insofar as its execution constitutes judicial notice of a problem in need of resolution and reminds the political branches that the Constitution [*468] makes international law &quot;our law.&quot; 240<br />

 Roe v. Wade hypothetical proves – international law is so diverse that international law could justify two opposite conclusions, the indeterminate nature of judicial interpretation means they can’t solve<br />
<strong>Sanchez, 05</strong> (Ernesto, JD at the University of Pennsylvania, 38 Conn. L. Rev. 185, “A Case Against Judicial Internationalism”, December, lexis)<br />
Assume, for the sake of argument, that the Court once again faces the same issue it faced in Roe v. Wade -- whether the scope of the concept of personal liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause <span style="font-size: 8pt;">guarantees a woman's right to abort a pregnancy in the first trimester of pregnancy. 198 The Court could have faced this same matter again when Norma McCorvey, the original &quot;Jane Roe&quot; who has become a prominent pro-life activist, filed a Rule 60 motion 199 to overturn the initial ruling two years ago. 200 A Houston federal district court dismissed the motion last year and held that Roe &quot;was certainly final in this litigation&quot; and that it was &quot;simply too late now, thirty years after the fact, for McCorvey to revisit that judgment.&quot; 201 The Fifth Circuit refused to hear oral arguments in the case on February 23, 2004 and considered the appeal based on McCorvey's brief alone, a document that included more than 1,000 pages of affidavits by women who claimed that their abortions had emotionally harmed them in a manner that the original ruling did not consider possible. 202 On September 14, 2004, the court dismissed the appeal -- because Texas had repealed the statutes declared unconstitutional in Roe, McCorvey's motion was moot. 203 The Supreme Court subsequently denied certiorari. 204 But how could the Court have reviewed this decision had it chosen to [*224] disregard the Fifth Circuit's conclusion on the mootness issue? Setting aside the issue of whether McCorvey filed her motion in a &quot;reasonable time,&quot; the case stemmed from two very convincing, yet diametrically opposite, perspectives. On one end,</span> in addition to repeating the original legal reasoning underlying Roe, the Court could have simply defended the decision on stare decisis grounds 205 since so much of its reproductive rights jurisprudence over the past thirty-two years has simply stemmed from the assumption that the Constitution protects first trimester abortion rights. 206 But the Court might also have followed the same line of reasoning it applied in Lawrence to outline the case for overturning Roe<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the Lawrence opinion, the Court held that stare decisis did not constitute an &quot;inexorable command,&quot; but a &quot;principle of policy&quot; that did not mandate the use of a &quot;mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.&quot; 207 So the discovery of compelling reasons to overrule a precedent certainly justified doing so, namely in the form of concluding that world opinion helped show how bans on sodomy &quot;demeaned&quot; the lives of homosexual persons. 208 Perhaps thirty-two years of new evidence, then, could have highlighted how abortion emotionally harmed women. </span> How could the Court have used foreign legal perspectives to choose either side of the question of whether it should overrule Roe? In Lawrence, the Court cited the ECHR opinion to show that a growing international consensus against bans on homosexual sodomy had developed and that this overwhelming world opinion on the subject helped demonstrate that such laws demeaned the lives of homosexual persons, thereby providing a compelling interest to overturn Bowers. 209 Likewise, the Court could have referred to how the fact that 141 out of the world's 201 independent countries, in another estimate, still outlaw abortion on demand strengthens the contention that abortion harms women. 210 After all, 141 countries out of 201 certainly would have illustrated a broad international consensus in favor of outlawing abortion. 211 In contrast, the Court could have simply referred to how most countries in western Europe have legalized abortion<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 212 in order to claim that the evidence McCorvey presented was not convincing enough on account of how &quot;developed&quot; countries, or countries with whom the United States shares a common cultural heritage, have come to favor abortion rights. [*225] </span>Each of the results pertaining to the Roe scenario is completely opposed to the other. And yet, had the Court reviewed the case, either one would have been possible given the subjective nature of the reasoning the Court could pursue in deciding that foreign legal sources bear relevance to the issue at hand. The Court has no rule or writing by the Founding Fathers to document what sources to utilize and how extensively to utilize them. 213 This lack of guidance, deliberate or not, basically gives the Court license to assume whatever perspective it pleases without saying why. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">And the fact that two completely different outcomes could have resulted, thereby blatantly sidelining an opposite side that nevertheless stemmed from a strong constitutional perspective, should make both sides of the abortion controversy wonder whether foreign legal sources should even be used at all in this matter. The use of foreign legal sources in cases with no foreign implications can, therefore, never be consistent. And because of the lack of neutral legal guidance on this issue, how else may judges refer to foreign legal sources but on the basis of some principle that satisfied a subjective whim of whatever political or legal philosophy they prefer? Lawrence, Roper, and the rest of the internationalist decisions, then, carved new and unprecedented ground by creating a Pandora's box of confusing questions. A court can use foreign legal sources to aid in the process of constitutional interpretation, but a rhyme or reason to the sources it does use need not exist.</span> This situation simply allows too much of an opportunity for all judges, Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, originalist or pragmatic, to abuse their discretion under a very nebulous guideline that allows the use of foreign legal sources in domestic matters without further specifications.<br />
No methodology exists for the judicial application of international law – it makes judicial cherry picking inevitable – crushes separation of powers<br />
<strong>Ragwen, 07</strong> – JD, Loyola Law School (Janella, 40 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 1407, “THE PROPRIETY OF INDEPENDENTLY REFERENCING INTERNATIONAL LAW,” Summer, lexis)<br />
The backlash from the Supreme Court's recent international law references has been swift and vocal. n174 In 2004, Representative Tom Feeney resubmitted a non-binding resolution to the House of Representatives, which stated that &quot;judicial determinations regarding the meaning of the laws of the United States should not be based on judgments, laws, or pronouncements of foreign institutions.&quot; n175 Representative Feeney expressed the concerns of many others who believe that the Court's independent references to international law threaten the independence and sovereignty of the United States. n176<br />
Various scholars have also reacted strongly to the Court's actions. One of the biggest problems for Nationalists is that the Court has not developed a methodology for determining the appropriate sources of international law to use when resolving domestic disputes. n177 With no methodology, a domestic court (including the Supreme Court) may not inquire into all applicable material before resolving a dispute and, as a result, may base its decisions on incomplete or partisan information. n178 For example, in [*1431] Lawrence, &quot;it was the mere fact that other nations ... had accepted the right the petitioners sought that the Court deemed important,&quot; but the Court did not look at the reasoning behind international law to understand why the world community did or did not support sexual privacy rights. n179 Consequently, a party may exert considerable influence over a court's decision by selectively referencing only the international law that is most favorable to that party's position. n180<br />
Moreover, without a methodology for sifting through the available sources, a domestic court is unlikely to have the tools necessary to evaluate whether a particular international law reference is appropriate. Therefore, the court may be relying on inappropriate or irrelevant information. n181 Not only could this lead to erroneous conclusions, it could create inconsistencies between decisions. n182 If there is no defined method of identifying the pertinent law from the appropriate source(s), then each court may develop its own methods based on its own historical approach, which would in turn cause varied results. n183 These varied results could encourage forum shopping as claimants realize that they could receive different results on the same claim in different courts. n184<br />
Another problem that stems from not having an established methodology is that judges gain too much discretion. n185 Without [*1432] appropriate constraints, judges are essentially able to &quot;cherry-pick&quot; n186 laws that comport with their personal beliefs and incorporate these personal preferences into their decisions. n187 Thus, judges are essentially able to create the &quot;content to the domestic Constitution&quot; according to their own beliefs. n188 For example, the Court in Roe v. Wade n189 chose not to reference international law to resolve reproductive rights, but the Court chose to reference international law to recognize a right to sexual privacy. n190 Selective, unprincipled use of international law will impact the Court's legitimacy. n191<br />
When judges selectively pick issues based on their personal beliefs that certain rights are more worthy of protection than others, judges cross into law-making and violate the separation of powers doctrine. n192 When a court resolves a dispute, its resolution and the reasoning behind it become precedent for future courts. n193 Therefore, when a court uses international law to resolve a dispute, it is creating [*1433] law that future courts are bound to follow. n194 However, &quot;the United States is a country of limited, defined, and enumerated powers with elected branches that create laws and a judiciary that is limited to interpreting [those laws].&quot; n195 By using international law, the Court and other domestic courts are circumventing the legislative branch, the branch designated by the Constitution to make law; n196 they are essentially deciding what the law should be and not what the law is. n197<br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 3pt 0in;"><strong>Legal indeterminancy means judges will apply the precedent arbitrarily</strong></span><br />
<strong>Larson, 04</strong> (Joan, professor of law at the University of Michigan, 65 Ohio St. L.J. 1283, “Importing Constitutional Norms from a &quot;Wider Civilization&quot;: Lawrence and the Rehnquist Court's Use of Foreign and International Law in Domestic Constitutional Interpretation”, lexis)<br />
<br />
The indeterminacy of customary international human rights law presents serious problems for the objectivity theory as a foil to subjective constitutional interpretation. Scholars who worry about judicial subjectivity in constitutional interpretation are not worried about judicial discretion as an abstract proposition. [*1308] Rather, the concern with subjectivity as it relates to constitutional interpretation is grounded primarily in two concerns. The first may be described as a &quot;rule of law&quot; concern, which worries about the arbitrary or unequal application of legal rules. Yet, given the indeterminacy of customary international human rights law, and the great difficulty judges and scholars seem to have agreeing on its content, reliance on such norms seems to exacerbate, not diminish, this problem. But, even if international human rights norms were perfectly determinate, the objectivity theory would still fall short of providing the requisite grounding for the moral fact-finding approach. That is because the objectivity theory fails to appreciate the other central reason why constitutional scholars are concerned about judicial subjectivity: countermajoritarianism. 110 As the well-known story goes, legitimate government in America must be premised on the consent of the governed. 111 Ordinarily, that consent is reflected through enactments of legislatures composed of elected representatives of the people. Judicial review of legislative decision-making sets the judgment of unaccountable courts against the judgment of accountable legislatures, and is, thus, inherently &quot;countermajoritarian.&quot; 112 This &quot;countermajoritarian difficulty&quot; is [*1309] alleviated, of course, when the Constitution clearly commands a particular result; then judges are simply enforcing against current majorities the value judgments previously made by a supermajority of the people. 113 But constitutional interpretation that invites judicial discretion threatens self-governance because it allows the unaccountable judiciary to substitute its own policy preferences for those of the representatives of the people. Relying on even perfectly determinate pronouncements of foreign governments and international bodies cannot solve the countermajoritarian difficulty, for it merely replaces one domestically unaccountable decision-maker (the judiciary) with another (foreign governments, foreign or international courts, or the international community, as the case may be). Indeed, reliance on foreign and international law, &quot;over which the American people have no control--either directly through the power of election or even indirectly through the process of judicial appointment,&quot; may actually exacerbate the countermajoritarian problem. 114 One cannot purport to solve the countermajoritarian difficulty by substituting a new form of countermajoritarianism. It is this fact that deprives the &quot;objectivity theory&quot; of its legitimating force.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 3pt 0in;"><strong>Customary international law norms are unenforceable judicially – nations are too diverse</strong></span><br />
<strong>McGinnis and Somin, 04</strong> (John, professor of law at Northwestern, and Ilya, professor of law at George Mason, “Against International Law a Part of Our law“,<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4670:http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/int-law/mcginnis-somin.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/int-law/mcginnis-somin.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/int-law/mcginnis-somin.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4670 -->)<br />
But customary international law is not even likely to generate efficient norms from the perspective of states that participate. Efficient norms are most likely to occur when the groups generating the norms are small in number, homogeneous in size and when the interact often in a reciprocal manner (i.e. they take turns playing the relevant roles in the practices which the norms seek to regulate.) But as Eugene Kontorovich has shown, these conditions are rarely satisfied for international custom. There are now approaching over 180 nation states. Far from homogenous, nations have different interests defined by geographic position, level of development and religious identification. Many never interact in substantial ways. And nation tend to not to act in reciprocal ways, often because they are so heterogeneous. Many nations, for instance, are not in a position to engage in war with more powerful nations. Kontorovich rightly concludes that even with respect nations states, efficient customary rules of international scope are few and far between. Nor can customary international law be easily be defended as efficient by analogy to the common law. Again we have the problem that states, not people, are the actors in the international regime. Thus even a common law process that is efficient for them will not necessarily be efficient for citizens. Moreover, the process by which the common law tends toward efficient rule is not likely to be replicated by customary international law.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Proponents of the internationalist approach to constitutional interpretation that such cases as Lawrence and Roper illustrated would do well to consider whether this prospect is truly consistent with the concept of a sovereign nation</span>. Judges who choose to use their power to pick and choose foreign legal principles to impose on the American people <strong>may face a well-deserved backlash from at least some segments of the general population.</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">These sorts of crises are not unprecedented. One recent news article noted that </span>many representatives and senators regard recent Supreme Court decisions as unconstitutional and unwarranted usurpations of power that only legislators may rightfully exercise. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">259 And what members of a certain generation of attorneys can forget the popular movement, which some congressmen and senators supported, to impeach Earl Warren and William O.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">We implicitly appeal to our citizens to put up with court rulings they find objectionable in the interest of maintaining a common constitutional framework. [Accordingly</span>,] <strong>it is a big leap</strong> beyond this understanding to ask Americans to put up with a ruling because it is what foreigners happen to approve. 260<br />
The backlash is empirically true in a more limited context – it creates Congressional legislation that turns any future productive international law effects – the plan is net worse for international law and judicial independence<br />
<strong>Margulies, 09</strong> – professor of law at Roger Williams University (Peter, 57 Buffalo L. Rev. 347, “<span class="verdana">The Detainees' Dilemma: The Virtues and Vices of Advocacy Strategies in the War on Terror”, April, lexis)</span><br />
Crossover advocacy involving international or foreign forums can also spark mobilization for opposing forces with greater power. Advocacy fails if addressing one problem creates an even more formidable obstacle. Unfortunately, here, as elsewhere, the temporal discounting deficit plays a substantial role, encouraging advocates to overweigh immediate success and underestimate the consequences of backlash.<br />
To illustrate how a predictable response by the political branches can make matters worse for those similarly situated to clients, consider the 1990s Haitian HIV litigation involving Guantanamo. In part because the lawsuit brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and the Yale Human Rights Clinic raised the profile of Haitian refugees and immigrants with HIV, the political branches took two momentous steps. First, Congress expressly wrote into the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) an exclusion for people with HIV. n255 Second, the executive branch expanded its policy of interdicting vessels carrying Haitians on the high seas, and summarily returning passengers to Haiti. n256 Although precursors to these policies had been in place at the beginning of the lawsuit, action by Congress and the president made the policies far more pervasive. n257 The publicity generated by [*419] the lawyers in the case helped to free the detainees, but also galvanized an adverse political response with significant long-term adverse effects for prospective immigrants <span style="font-size: 6pt;">with HIV and refugees. Unfortunately, the self-serving bias impeded advocates' ability to appreciate that their own well-intentioned efforts had contributed to these adverse consequences. As another example, consider recent efforts by CCR to initiate legal proceedings against former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and others through the invocation of universal jurisdiction in France and Germany. n258 The argument for such efforts is that they create accountability for senior officials who made decisions that violated rights and hurt America's reputation. The downside of such efforts, however, is that they have a counter-productive effect on mobilization domestically. An effective transition from the monolithic approach of the post-9/11 period requires a consensus between different political factions. Recourse to universal jurisdiction will not further a consensus of this kind. Indeed, recourse to universal jurisdiction and international forums too often discounts the importance of domestic political participation. Federalism, for example, is a powerful political force domestically that also carries weight in the American legal system, but receives far less recognition in </span>international forums<span style="font-size: 6pt;">. n259 [*420] Using these forums to try Americans</span> will not encourage political participation aimed at a progressive consensus; indeed, such measures will encourage a domestic political backlash. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Asserting universal jurisdiction in foreign tribunals will often set up an &quot;us versus them&quot; dialectic that will discredit forces for change at home. n260 It may also encourage officials to stay in power, rather than retire gracefully, thus making for more volatile legal and political processes and rockier transitions. n261</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Finally, crossover advocates seeking accountability for United States officials from another sovereign's tribunals may underestimate the ability and inclination of Congress to reject international obligations. n262 Congress has this power under the last-in-time rule. n263 Legislative measures would create grave obstacles to adjudication in foreign tribunals. n264 </span>Even more seriously, a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">political backlash could target international law remedies</span> currently available in American courts. n265 Unfortunately, even the most able [*421] crossover advocates sometimes fail to appreciate that mobilization is a two-way street: advocates who sharpen their mobilization game inspire adversaries to do the same. n266<br />

 Judicial incorporation of international law destroys US support for international law<br />
<span class="Heading2Char1">Rosen 04</span> (Jeffrey, Prof of Law @ George Washington + legal affairs editor, The New Republic, 11/8, lexis)<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The willingness of liberal justices to consult international norms in constitutional cases has become a rallying cry for social conservatives: Bork's most recent book is called Coercing Virtue: The Worldwide Rule of Judges. But, although Bork's book is a slapdash polemic, other, more thoughtful conservative scholars, such as Jack Goldsmith of Harvard Law School, have argued persuasively that too much attention to international law could thwart U.S. constitutional traditions and reignite a domestic culture war. There are, after all, dramatic legal and cultural differences between European and American views about free expression, privacy, and due process. This means tha</span>t, <strong>if judges become too willing to look to Europe, they may impose values on U.S. legislatures that the American public will be moved to resist</strong>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Moreover, there is nothing inherently progressive about European views on these contested issues: If U.S. courts looked to Europe in abortion cases, for example, they would allow more restrictions than Americans now tolerate.</span><br />
Breyer and Ginsburg have been appropriately cautious in invoking international norms, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">citing them only as additional evidence of a consensus in cases where a clear majority of states have also rejected a controversial practice, such as sodomy laws or the juvenile death penalty. But</span> it's possible that younger justices of a more internationalist bent might be more aggressive about invoking a purported international consensus to strike down practices that a majority of the American public continues to support--<span style="font-size: 8pt;">such as the death penalty for adults. For example, Dean Harold Koh of Yale Law School, mentioned as a possible Kerry Supreme Court nominee, has supported the idea that U.S. courts should expansively apply international legal precedents without the authorization of the president and Congress. And some justices have begun to invoke international law in areas where there is intense social disagreement, such as affirmative action</span>. <strong>If anything could reignite the culture wars, it would be a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart deeply felt currents in American public opinion in the name of the international community</strong>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Given Kerry's emphasis on international opinion in his campaign, there's no reason to expect him to be attuned to this danger.</span><br />

 Congressional passage of implementing legislation will substantially boost compliance with international law<br />
<strong>Strossen, 92</strong> – professor of law at New York Law School (Nadine, “UNITED STATES RATIFICATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL BILL OF RIGHTS: A FITTING CELEBRATION OF THE BICENTENNIAL OF THE U.S. BILL OF RIGHTS”, 24 U. Tol. L. Rev. 203, lexis)<br />
Of overriding importance, the U.S. ratification was subject to a declaration that the ICCPR provisions are not &quot;self-executing,&quot; which <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:222:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@PAGE_204_8358&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: PAGE_204_8358&quot;/&gt; --><a name="PAGE_204_8358"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:222 --> [*204] means that they are not legally enforceable against federal or state governments in the U.S. in any American courts; they will be binding in domestic courts only if Congress passes implementing legislation. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:223:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r5&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r5&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r5"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:223 --> Moreover, the U.S. ratification makes exceptions for all ICCPR provisions that set more protective human rights standards than those currently recognized under U.S. law. Therefore, even assuming that the U.S. has satisfied the international standards for ratification of the ICCPR in a technical sense, that ratification is not meaningful in terms of extending the human rights of people in the U.S.<br />
In order to bridge the gap between the exception-ridden ratification of the U.S. and the human rights standards in the ICCPR, Congress should pass corrective legislation. For example, the proposed International Human Rights Conformity Act of 1992, although not correcting every respect in which U.S. law fails to conform with international human rights standards, would achieve substantial U.S. compliance with the ICCPR. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:224:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r6&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r6&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r6"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:224 --><br />
The central point of this article is that meaningful U.S. ratification <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:225:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r7&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r7&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r7"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:225 --> of the rights-enhancing provisions of the covenants would be a significant step in fostering human rights in the U.S. That conclusion follows from the fact that, in certain important respects, international human rights norms are more rights-protective than the corresponding domestic law standards. As the Rehnquist Court continues to construe domestic human rights norms in an increasingly narrow fashion, the situations in which international standards afford more protection will increase. Therefore, it behooves U.S. human rights activists to seek the incorporation of international human rights norms into domestic law. Even if the U.S. does not ratify the covenants, U.S. human rights lawyers should urge U.S. courts to rely on more rights-protective international human rights standards through the doctrine of unwritten or &quot;customary&quot; international law. To the extent that international standards are less protective of human rights than their domestic counterparts, the U.S. should not incorporate them into U.S. law; international human rights precepts should be invoked only to expand, and not to curtail, Americans' human rights. <!-- ws:start:WikiTextAnchorRule:226:&lt;img src=&quot;/i/anchor.gif&quot; class=&quot;WikiAnchor&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor&quot; id=&quot;wikitext@@anchor@@r8&quot; title=&quot;Anchor: r8&quot;/&gt; --><a name="r8"></a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextAnchorRule:226 --><br />

<strong>Fuerth 5/20/04</strong> (Leon, research professor of international affairs at the George Washington University, Financial Times)<br />
<span style="text-align: left;"> </span><span style="display: block; text-align: left;">The extreme abuses of prisoners in Iraq were no mere anomaly. They were the predictable consequence of the unchecked exercise of power, beginning not with military prison guards or intelligence contractors but at the highest levels of the US government.<br />
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, the administration created a space where neither the law of the land nor the law of nations operates. This is a region where only the will of the president holds sway, as elaborated by the attorney-general. It is a domain where the power of the executive is not subject to effective monitoring or to legal intervention. Under this system, the good name of US soldiers and of the nation has been entrusted to people who can invent the rules as they go along. That is one reason why legitimate questions are being posed about whether the practices used in Iraq's prisons were based on the earlier treatment of detainees in Afghanistan or at Guantanamo Bay.<br />
It is a basic principle of leadership that responsibility must be linked inseparably to authority. Even if those at the bottom of the chain of command acted entirely on their own, responsibility for their actions does not end with them, but extends upwards to their superiors. If it turns out that their superiors let it be known, by word or gesture, that they sanctioned this behaviour, then they, too, are complicit. Moreover, accountability cannot stop even with the military leadership or the intelligence managers. It continues on, inexorably, to those at much higher levels who are responsible for establishing the framework within which these events occurred, even if they were totally unaware of them until recently.<br />
What has happened in Iraq took place according to principles that are toxic for democracies. The doctrines of executive authority propounded by the Bush administration endanger not only the human rights of foreigners, but also the civil liberties of Americans. Remember that if the Supreme Court rules in favour of the administration in the case of Jose Padilla, detained on suspicion of plotting with al-Qaeda, it will mean that American citizens as well as foreigners can be locked away beyond the reach of US justice.<br />
The executive branch is operating at or beyond its constitutional limits, without effective counteraction by either of the other two branches of government. Our federal judiciary is increasingly beholden to the conservative philosophy of successive Republican administrations. Congress, in fact, is potentially more effective than the courts because it has far more flexible powers for engaging the administration in point-by-point oversight. But Congress is much weakened as the result of a long series of retreats.<br />
Members of Congress who decry the loss of their exclusive constitutional power to declare war must remember that it is Congress that let this power slide away. Members of Congress who believe that the institution is being railroaded into hasty action, as it was in the case of the Patriot Act, must acknowledge that they agreed to the voting procedures that allowed this to happen. Members of Congress who deplore flaws in the US national intelligence system need to recognise that they had the authority to investigate before rather than after the nation suffered the consequences. And members of Congress of both parties, who are now angry that they were the last to know what was going on in Iraq, must realise that this negligent treatment by the executive is just the latest episode in an abusive relationship that Congress itself has helped enable.<br />
Repairing that relationship is something only Congress can do. It must effectively use the power of the purse as a choke-chain. It must demand timely and adequate information from the executive, so as to make possible vigorous oversight. It must not allow the executive to create regions in which its use of public resources cannot be challenged by those who appropriate them. Only Congress is in a position to fill the constitutional void that has been created by an administration eager to expand its powers, and a judiciary unwilling to challenge them. Congress must use the bipartisan anger its members now feel as the starting point for urgently needed bipartisan action to restore the balance of forces in our government.<br />

 Relying on international law destroys the Court’s legitimacy and public support for the legal system – turns judicial independence. Only the counterplan solves by using the elected branches act first.<br />
<strong>Wilkinson, 04</strong> (J. Harvie, Circuit Judge for the 4th Circuit, 27 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 423, “DEBATE: THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN JUDICIAL DECISIONS”, lexis)<br />
Where courts go too far, in my view, is where they rely upon international (and mostly European) precedents when resolving important and contentious social issues. This &quot;internationalization&quot; of the Constitution on domestic social issues raises three types of problems.<br />
The first is that an over-reliance on foreign precedents may serve to compromise judicial decisions in the eyes of the American public. Judges serve as unelected stewards of the Constitution whose power rests in part on their ability to persuade. While majorities may simmer [*426] when judges vindicate the rights of minorities, in the long run judges can promote respect for their decisions by appealing to principles that Americans can relate to as part of an American constitutional tradition. The counter-majoritarian difficulty is thus alleviated when judges draw upon common principles and ideas that form our shared American heritage.<br />
But when judges rely on foreign sources, especially for difficult constitutional questions concerning domestic social issues, they move the bases for judicial decision-making even farther from the realm of both democratic accountability and popular acceptance. They aggravate the risks already inherent in having unelected officials overrule popular enactments by creating the perception that foreign sentiment shapes domestic law. To be sure, examples from other countries may be illuminating. But the Court's legitimacy must ultimately rest on reliance and reference to the American Constitution and to American democratic; outcomes, from which their judicial authority springs. By relying on foreign laws and rulings over which the American people have no control -- either directly through the power of election or even indirectly through the process of judicial appointment -- judges risk estranging and disempowering the public. I fear that the internationalization of our constitutional values may thus undermine public acceptance of our judicial system.<br />
A closely related danger is that reliance on foreign precedents may stimulate popular perceptions that judges are out of touch with American culture. The risks of a common perception of judicial distance and removal should not be underestimated. The detachment and insulation which an independent judiciary properly enjoys should not be endangered by pronouncements that appear targeted at foreign and domestic elites rather than the American public at large. The power of persuasion which sustains judicial authority must not neglect those very people whose acceptance of judicial decree is most essential. Americans treasure their diversity and their identity. The great Willa Cather novels, My Antonia and O Pioneers!, still play a prevalent role in the American psyche, and the distance from American to European modes of thought remains in some vital particulars more psychological than physical. The distinguished Harvard historian, Bernard Bailyn, has noted that the power of the American Constitution derived from the fact that its framers were proud and stubborn provincials, that they did not accept all the received wisdom of the Continent, and that, for example, the [*427] animating constitutional idea of dual and concurrent sovereignties actually rejected the contrary notions of the French theorist Montesquieu. 10<br />

Related to the countermajoritarian difficulty is the argument that <strong>usage of foreign precedent threatens the Court's institutional legitimacy</strong>. 321 Because of the fundamental conflict between democratic government and judicial review, the Court is most legitimate when it &quot;persuades, and not merely declares.&quot; 322 Nationalist scholars argue that the Court's rulings are most persuasive when they invoke &quot;common principles and ideas that form our shared American heritage.&quot; 323 In contrast, when the Court draws on foreign laws, it dilutes &quot;democratic accountability and popular acceptance,&quot; 324 <strong>thus appearing tyrannical and diminishing its legitimacy.</strong> <strong>Moreover, &quot;reliance on foreign precedents may stimulate popular perceptions that judges are out of touch with American cultur</strong>e&quot; 325 or, at least, segments of American culture.<br />

 <strong>1ac threat framing is based on misplaced cultural discourse, fixating dangerously inaccurate Cold War logic</strong><br />
<strong>Grondin 2004</strong> – PhD, Professor of Political Science at the University of Ottawa (David, “(Re)Writing the National Security State”, paper presented at the annual International Studies Association Convention in Ottawa, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4671:http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/chairerd/site/uploads/files/publications/etudes_raoul_dandurand/rewrinting_the_national_security_state.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/chairerd/site/uploads/files/publications/etudes_raoul_dandurand/rewrinting_the_national_security_state.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/chairerd/site/uploads/files/publications/etudes_raoul_dandurand/rewrinting_the_national_security_state.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4671 -->)<br />
I disagree with this essentialist view of the state identity of the United States. The United States does not need to be a national security state. If it was and is still constructed as such by many realist discourses, it is because these discourses serve some political purpose. Moreover, in keeping with my poststructuralist inclinations, I maintain that identity need not be, and indeed never is, fixed. In a scheme in which “to say is to do”, that is, from a perspective that accepts the performativity of language, culture becomes a relational site where identity politics happens rather than being a substantive phenomenon. In this sense, culture is not simply a social context framing foreign policy decisionmaking. Culture is “a signifying part of the conditions of possibility for social being, […] the way in which culturalist arguments themselves secure the identity of subjects in whose name they speak” (Campbell, 1998: 221). The Cold War national security culture represented in realist discourses was constitutive of the American national security state. There was certainly a conflation of theory and policy in the Cold War military-intellectual complex, which “were observers of, and active participants in, defining the meaning of the Cold War. They contributed to portray the enemy that both reflected and fueled predominant ideological strains within the American body politic. As scholarly partners in the national security state, they were instrumental in defining and disseminating a Cold War culture” (Rubin, 2001: 15). This national security culture was “a complex space where various representations and representatives of the national security state compete to draw the boundaries and dominate the murkier margins of international relations” (Der Derian, 1992: 41). The same Cold War security culture has been maintained by political practice (on the part of realist analysts and political leaders) through realist discourses in the post-9/11 era and once again reproduces the idea of a national security state. This (implicit) state identification is neither accidental nor inconsequential. From a poststructuralist vantage point, the identification process of the state and the nation is always a negative process for it is achieved by exclusion, violence, and marginalization. Thus, a deconstruction of practices that constitute and consolidate state identity is necessary: the writing of the state must be revealed through the analysis of the discourses that constitute it. The state and the discourses that (re)constitute it thus frame its very identity and impose a fictitious “national unity” on society; it is from this fictive and arbitrary creation of the modernist dichotomous discourses of inside/outside that the discourses (re)constructing the state emerge. It is in the creation of a Self and an Other in which the state uses it monopolistic power of legitimate violence – a power socially constructed, following Max Weber’s work on the ethic of responsibility – to construct a threatening Other differentiated from the “unified” Self, the national society (the nation).16 It is through this very practice of normative statecraft, which produces threatening Others, that the international sphere comes into being. David Campbell adds that it is by constantly articulating danger through foreign policy that the state’s very conditions of existence are generated. <br />
<strong>This feeds an endless cycle of enemy creation and identity formation</strong><br />
<strong>Wendt 1992</strong> – the Ralph D. Mershon Professor of International Security at Ohio State, also professor at Yale, Dartmouth, and University of Chicago (Alexander, “Social theory of international politics”, pages 261-266, Google Books, WEA)<br />
Enemy images have a long pedigree, and some states continue to position each other in such terms today. The Greeks represented the Persians as &quot;barbarians&quot;; the Crusaders perceived the 'links as “infidels&quot;; medieval Europeans feared their defeat at Liegnitz at the hands of the Mongols heralded Armageddon; later Europeans treated the peoples of the Americas as savages; conservatives thought civilization was threatened by the French Revolution; and, in our own century we have the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, the early Cold War, Northern Ireland, Pol Pot, Palestinian and Israeli fundamentalists, the Bosnian Civil War, Hutus and Tutsis - all based on representations of the Other as intent on destroying or enslaving the Self.<br />
It is important to emphasize that this concept implies nothing about whether enemy images are justified. Some enemies are &quot;real,&quot; in that the Other really does existentially threaten the Self, as the Nazis did the Jews, and others are &quot;chimeras,&quot; as the Jews were to the Nazis.43 This difference may affect the dynamics of enmity and whether it can be overcome, but it does not affect the reality of Hobbesian cultures. <strong>Real or imagined, if actors think enemies are real then they are real in their consequences.”</strong><br />
Representing the Other as an enemy tends to have at least four implications for a state's foreign policy posture and behavior, which in turn generate a particular logic of interaction.<br />
First, states will tend to respond to enemies by acting like deep revisionists themselves, i.e., they will try to destroy or conquer them. This does not necessarily mean their interests will be revisionist; a state might actually have status quo interests, but the threat of the enemy forces it to behave &quot;as if&quot; it were a deep revisionist, on the principle of &quot;kill or be killed.&quot; Second, decision-making will tend to heavily discount the future and be oriented toward the worst-case. (Negative) possibilities rather than probabilities will dominate, which reduces the likelihood of reciprocating any cooperative moves made by the enemy. One might say that prospect theory rather than expected-utility theory will be the basis of &quot;rational&quot; behavior.” Third, relative military capabilities will be seen as crucial.” Since the enemy's revisionist intentions are &quot;known,&quot; the state can use the enemy's capabilities to predict his behavior, on the assumption that he will attack as soon as he can win. Power becomes the key to survival, and as such even status quo states will vigorously arm themselves on the principle of &quot;if you want peace, prepare for war.&quot; Enmity, in short, gives capabilities a particular meaning, which derives neither from their intrinsic properties nor from anarchy as such, but from the structure of the role relationship. Finally if it comes to actual war, states will tight on the enemy’s (perceived) terms. This means observing no limits on their own violence, since that would create a competitive disadvantage, unless it is clear that self-limitation is safe. And if war has not yet broken out but clearly will soon, states must also be prepared to preempt, especially if offensive technology is dominant, lest the enemy get a fatal advantage from a first strike.<br />
What states facing a enemy must do, in sum, is engage in no-holds-barred power politics. It has become common practice in recent IR scholarship to refer to such behavior as “Realist.” If Realism is taken to be merely a description of power politics then this practice is harmless, but taken as an explanation it invites confusion, since it suggests that the existence of power politics is somehow evidence for Realist theory. This cannot be the case, at least on any non-tautological definition of Realism; conflict is no more evidence for Realism than cooperation is for non-Realism. It all depends on what explains it. The account developed here explains power politics by reference to perceptions of Self and Other, and as such sees it as fundamentally social in the Weberian sense. I take Realism to be a theory that explains power politics ultimately by reference to material forces, whether biological or technological, and as such its view is not fundamentally social. In order to keep alive the possibility of meaningful theoretical disagreement, therefore, it seems better to follow Iain Johnston's practice of calling power political behavior &quot;realpolitik&quot; rather than &quot;Realism.&quot;7 The Realist tradition contains much descriptive wisdom about realpolitik, but this does not entail the truth of its explanation for realpolitik.<br />
What Realism-as-description shows is that when the Other is an enemy the Self is forced to mirror back the representations it has attributed to the Other. Thus, unlike most roles in social life, which are constituted by functionally differentiated &quot;counter&quot;-roles (teacher-student, master-slave, patron-client), the role of enemy is symmetric, constituted by actors being in the same position simultaneously Self mirrors Other, becomes its enemy in order to survive. This of course will confirm whatever hostile intentions the Other had attributed to the Self, forcing it to engage in realpolitik of its own, which will in turn reinforce the Self's perception of the Other, and so on. Realpolitik, in short, is a self-fulfilling prophecy: its beliefs generate actions that confirm those beliefs.” This is not to say that realpolitik is the sole cause of conflict, such that in its absence states would be friends, since if states really do want to conquer each other then realpolitik is as much effect as cause. The point is that whether or not states really are existential threats to each other is in one sense not relevant, since once a logic of enmity gets started states will behave in ways that make them existential threats, and thus the behavior itself becomes part of the problem. This gives enemy images a homeostatic quality that sustains the logic of Hobbesian anarchies.<br />
The logic of Hobbesian anarchy<br />
Unlike foreign policy role theorists, who treat roles as qualities that states attribute to themselves and thus as properties of agents (what I would call role-identities), I have focused on the role attributed to the Other, and thus on role as a position in or property of a social structure. Like role theorists, however, I have so far treated enmity as an interaction- or micro-level phenomenon, as based on subjective images or perceptions. I did so partly for presentational reasons, but also because macro-level structures only exist in virtue of instantiations at the micro-level, which means that whatever logics the former have depend on actors acting in certain ways.<br />
In most cases, however, micro-level role relationships are embedded in macro-level, collective representations. Collective representations have a life and logic of their own that cannot be reduced to actors' perceptions or behavior (chapter 4, pp. 150-165). As more and more members of a system represent each other as enemies, eventually a “tipping point” is reached at which these representations take over the logic of the system. At this point actors start to think of enmity as a property of the system rather than just of individual actors, and so feel compelled to represent all Others as enemies simply because they are parts of the system. In this way the particular Other becomes Mead’s &quot;generalized Other,&quot;50 a structure of collective beliefs and expectations that persists through time even as individual actors come and go, and into the logic of which new actors are socialized. (The concepts of “discourse” and “hegemony” I take it have a similar, macro-level orientation.) It is in terms of positions within this structure that actors make attributions about Self and Other, rather than in terms of their actual qualities. The result is a logic of interaction based more on what actors know about their roles than on what they know about each other, enabling them to predict each other's behavior without knowing each other’s &quot;minds.&quot; This in turn generates emergent patterns of behavior at the macro-level. Collective representations are “frequency-dependent&quot;51 in that they depend for their existence on a sufficient number of representations and/or behaviors at the micro-level - the representation known as &quot;Canada&quot; only exists if enough people sustain it - but as long as that number remains above the tipping point collective representations will be relatively autonomous from or supervene on ideas in the heads of individuals. The logic and tendencies of the Hobbesian anarchy emerge at this macro-level of analysis. <br />
The logic of the Hobbesian anarchy is well known: the “war of all against all” in which actors operate on the principle of sauve qui peut and kill or be killed. This is the true &quot;self-help” system (by which I mean to suggest that the anarchy described by Waltz is not that; see below), where actors cannot count on each other for help or even to observe basic self-restraint. Survival depends solely on military power, which means that increases in the security of A necessarily reduce that of B, who can never be sure that A's capabilities are defensive. Security is a deeply competitive, zero-sum affair, and security dilemmas are particularly acute not because of the nature of weapons - the offense-defense balance - but because of intentions attributed to others.52 Even if what states really want is security rather than power their collective beliefs force them to act as if they are power-seeking. This structure generates four &quot;tendencies,&quot; macro-level patterns that will get realized unless they are blocked by countervailing forces.53<br />
The first is endemic and unlimited warfare. This does not mean that states will constantly be at war, since material considerations may suppress the manifestation of this tendency for a time, but as long as states collectively represent each other in Hobbesian terms, war may quite literally &quot;at any moment occur.&quot;54 A second is the elimination of &quot;unfit&quot; actors: those not adapted for warfare, and those too weak militarily to compete. This means, on the one hand, as Waltz argues, that we should see a tendency toward functional isomorphism, with all political entities becoming &quot;like units&quot; (states) with similar warfighting capabilities.55 On the other hand, however - something Waltz does not predict - we should also see a high death rate among weak states. Since their territories will be conquered by the strong, this will generate a corresponding tendency toward empire-building and reduction in the overall number of political units - toward a concentration of power.56 Partly counteracting this tendency is a third: states powerful enough to avoid elimination will balance each other's power.57 However, in contrast to Waltz's view of balancing as the fundamental tendency of anarchy in general, the lack of inhibition and self-restraint in Hobbesian cultures suggests that balances of power there will be difficult to sustain, with the tendency toward consolidation being dominant in the long run. Finally, a Hobbesian system will tend to suck all of its members into the fray, making nonalignment or neutrality very difficult.58 The principal exception will be states that are able to &quot;hide&quot; because of the material condition of geography (Switzerland in World War II), although geography’s significance is itself subject to material changes in technology (nuclear weapons).<br />

This realignment of debate also would contribute to a more engaged IR scholarship if it led scholars to recognize that they themselves act as agents in such communicative interactions. They might then become more inclined to acknowledge concerns, not only regarding explanation and research design, but also for policy relevance and constitutional design. Deliberate reflection on constitutional design—confronting and acknowledging the inevitable implications of any scholarly arguments for policy practices—is necessary because every theoretical and empirical argument offers a normative or policy lesson. For example, economists have recognized that classical theories ‘‘teach’’ students to behave in accord with their precepts. Robert Frank and his colleagues (1993) have argued that exposure to contemporary economic theory itself constitutes agents to act more selfishly; indeed, they found students enrolled in economics courses come to behave in an increasingly ‘‘self-help’’ manner. In the IR context, Wendt (1999:377) himself argues ‘‘that problem-solving theory has the practical effect in the real world of helping to reproduce the status quo’’ and suggests that ‘‘realism, despite its claim of objectivity’’ is best seen in this light as ‘‘a normative as well as scientific theory.’’ In recent decades, the ‘‘research design’’-style structuring of questions and cases has come at the expense of such constitutional concerns. Certainly, scholarly efforts should not be evaluated exclusively in terms of the ‘‘correctness’’ of their policy views. Academia would not ‘‘work’’ if subjective political differences became legitimate grounds for dismissing arguments. However, scholars need to acknowledge that their views inevitably possess normative and policy implications rather than pretending that such implications do not exist. Consider again that despite their numerous differences, the constitutive lessons inherent in the analyses of Waltz, Cox, Ashley, and Campbell are quite similar: that state and societal agents must define their interests in competitive—as opposed to collective—fashion. One suspects that this is not the ‘‘moral’’ that Ashley or Campbell sought to advocate. Unfortunately, the absence of a broader focus on such constitutive ‘‘lessons,’’ a neglect rooted in the structure of IR debate itself, limited their attention to such issues. In contrast, by more persistently asking questions about the constitutive effects of theoretical or empirical claims, <strong>scholars may enable a more relevant study of international relations.</strong> They might reclaim the public space to act as not simply ‘‘academics’’ in the narrow sense of the term—within elite epistemic communities or as participant-advisors in the policy process—but rather they might aid one another in functioning as public intellectuals, focusing larger public debates in a more constructive, pragmatic manner. What are the potential benefits of such shifts? The resulting academic contribution to public policy learning might enable not simply materialist-rationalist styled Bayesian probability updating (Iverson 1984), but rather could promote a kind of ‘‘social learning.’’ Such learning, as Albert Bandura (1962, viii) has argued ‘‘neither casts people into the role of powerless objects controlled by environmental forces nor free agents who can become whatever they choose,’’ but rather recognizes that ‘‘both people and their environments are reciprocal determinants of each other.’’ Such social learning requires an ability to ‘‘make sense’’ of intersubjective contexts through a broader dialogue among the public, scholars, and policy agents. International structures, from this vantage, offer no unambiguous lessons. Contrary to Kissinger’s (1979:54–55) view (noted earlier) that ‘‘the convictions that leaders have formed before reaching high office are the intellectual capital they will consume as long as they continue in office,’’ possibilities for intersubjective variation require a constant monitoring of the prevailing intersubjective ‘‘mood.’’ Just as balance of power rules are learned in a social context, they can be unlearned if states come to expect cooperation instead of conflict. Kissinger-like claims regarding the irrelevance of ongoing reflection to policymaking seem misguided, as does the application of ‘‘balance of power’’ lessons in an inappropriate social context <strong>that may</strong>, in turn, <strong>contribute to new policy errors.</strong> Put simply, lessons that are applicable in one setting (for example, Europe in 1914) may be counterproductive in another (for example, Europe in 1992). Such variation might, perhaps, be more readily recognized by scholars engaged in a more pragmatic, ongoing social learning. Conclusion <strong>Theory constitutes social reality. This</strong> realization <strong>highlights the need for a pragmatist-constructivist approach to IR theory</strong>, one <strong>that involves</strong> an ongoing involvement in both scholarly and public <strong>debates</strong>. Unfortunately, the development of such a perspective in IR scholarship has often been impeded by the distinction between ‘‘long-term’’ critical theory and ‘‘short-run’’ problem-solving theory. The present essay has called this distinction into question by describing the ways in which John Dewey and John Kenneth Galbraith engaged in theoretical debates while also pursuing policy agendas. Both Dewey and Galbraith highlighted the importance of socially constructed understandings in the issue areas of education and economic policy. More broadly, their work itself provided a better sense of what it means to act as a public intellectual in both guiding and being immersed in public debates. In addressing the implications for IR scholarship, this essay has, therefore, urged a more explicit stress on both the role of agency in advancing change and a recognition of the constitutive effects of theory on social reality. In keeping with the tradition of pragmatist scholarship, let us conclude that distinctions between critical theory and problem-solving theory need to be relaxed considerably to highlight the potential roles of theory as a factor as well as of theorists themselves as actors in international politics (Edwards 1990).<br />

<strong>The events of 9-11 are the quintessential example of the high-cost, low probability event. But the images from that day have clouded the ability of Americans to calmly weigh the risks of terrorism</strong>, according to a study reported by The Washington Times [1].<br />
The study from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) [2], based at the University of Maryland and primarily funded by the Department of Homeland Security, analyzed over 80,000 attacks from 1970 to 2007. Of those attacks, only 1,350 attacks, or 1.6 percent, hit American targets—mostly overseas.<br />
That small percentage plummets to 0.08 percent when attacks on domestic targets are calculated. The Times has more:<br />
Regardless of public perceptions, the START researchers deal only with hard numbers, and they found that there have been 25 terrorist attacks against American religious figures or institutions and 38 terrorist attacks against military targets in the United States since 1970.<br />
The analysis also found that of 53 foreign terrorist groups judged to be &quot;the most dangerous to the U.S.,&quot; 97 percent of their attacks were not on American soil.<br />
&quot;Unlike 9/11, most terrorist attacks in the U.S. and elsewhere are from domestic groups, not international ones,&quot; Mr. LaFree said. &quot;Unlike 9/11, most terrorist attacks include few if any fatalities. Unlike 9/11, most attacks do not involve in-depth planning or sophisticated weaponry. Unlike al Qaeda, most terrorist groups are not long-lasting.&quot;<br />
Gary LaFree, director of START, told the Times that 9-11 created a conceptual problem for the United States because one very big, audacious, and deadly terrorist attack has become synonymous with all terrorist attacks.<br />
&quot;[I]f we consider [9-11] to be typical of terrorist attacks, we will have a very misleading view of terrorism,&quot; he said.<br />

<br />
The argument about terrorist motivation is also important. Terrorists generally have not killed as many as they have been capable of killing. This restraint seems to derive from an understanding of mass casualty attacks as both unnecessary and counterproductive. They are unnecessary because terrorists, by and large, have succeeded by conventional means. Also, they are counterproductive because they might alienate key constituencies, whether among the public, state sponsors, or the terrorist leadership group. In Brian Jenkins’ famous words, terrorists want a lot of people watching, not a lot of people dead. Others have argued that the lack of mass casualty terrorism and effective exploitation of BW has been more a matter of accident and good fortune than capability or intent. Adherents of this view, including former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, argue that “it’s not a matter of if but when.”<br />
The attacks of September 11 would seem to settle the debate about whether terrorists have both the motivation and sophistication to exploit weapons of mass destruction for their full lethal effect. After all, those were terrorist attacks of unprecedented sophistication that seemed clearly aimed at achieving mass casualties— had the World Trade Center towers collapsed as the 1993 bombers had intended, perhaps as many as 150,000 would have died. Moreover, Osama bin Laden’s constituency would appear to be not the “Arab street” or some other political entity but his god. And terrorists answerable only to their deity have proven historically to be among the most lethal. <br />
But this debate cannot be considered settled. Bin Laden and his followers could have killed many more on September 11 if killing as many as possible had been their primary objective. They now face the core dilemma of asymmetric warfare: how to escalate without creating new interests for the stronger power and thus the incentive to exploit its power potential more fully. Asymmetric adversaries want their stronger enemies fearful, not fully engaged—militarily or otherwise. They seek to win by preventing the stronger partner from exploiting its full potential. To kill millions in America with biological or other weapons would only commit the United States—and much of the rest of the international community—to the annihilation of the perpetrators. <br />

A recent post on nuclear deterrence on American Future drew several comments on another blog. The blogger at American Future, Marc Schulman, outlines the responses in this post. In summary the responses were that a nuclear response to a nuclear terrorist attack was itself terrorism, a nuclear retaliation would inevitably draw other state actors to escalate the exchange, a nuclear retaliation would be collective punishment, and attacking Muslim holy sites would be counterproductive. I agree with this last point but I want to deal with each of the other points in some detail. * A nuclear response to a nuclear terrorist attack is terrorism.There’s no generally accepted definition of terrorism so before tackling this point I’ll propose one. Ignoring the issue of state actors vs. non-state actors I think that a terrorist attack is an attack on civilians or civilian assets whose purpose is to provoke terror. It has no other tactical or strategic significance. Any nuclear response by the United States would be against military or governmental facilities, sites involved in military production, or command and control. The objective would be to eliminate the possibility of future attacks or the support for those who would engage in future attacks. That such a response would inevitably result in massive civilian casualties is sad. But such a response would not, by definition, be terrorism * A nuclear retaliation Iran in response to a terrorist nuclear attack would inevitably draw France, Russia, and China to enter the conflict.To believe this you must believe that France, Russia, and China will act irrationally. There is absolutely no reason to believe that this is the case. All three nations know that their intervention against the U. S. would result in total annihilation. There are other issues as well and let’s examine the two distinct cases: Russia on the one hand and France and China on the other. As a major non-Gulf producer of oil Russia would be in a position to benefit enormously in case of a disruption of Gulf oil production or shipment. That being the case they would publicly deplore a retaliation against Iran but privately rejoice. Both France and China are in an extremely delicate position. A nuclear response by either would result in total annihilation and, equally importantly, wouldn’t keep the oil flowing. Lack of a blue water navy means that both nations are completely at the mercy of the United States’s (or more specifically the U. S. Navy’s) willingness to keep shipments of oil moving out of the Gulf. China is particularly vulnerable since it has only about two weeks’ worth of strategic oil reserves. Neither France nor China has any real ability to project military force other than nuclear force beyond their borders. They’d be upset. But they’re in no position to do anything about it.<br />
<strong>-- Terrorists won’t target agriculture</strong><br />
<strong>Chalk 4</strong> (Peter, Senior Policy Analyst – RAND Corporation, Hitting America’s Soft Underbelly: The Potential Threat of Deliberate Biological Attacks Against the US Agricultural and Food Industries, RAND, p. 28)<br />
Despite the ease with which an act of agroterrorism could be carried out and the serious impact of a successful assault (especially the economic and political fallout), <strong>it is unlikely to constitute a primary form of terrorist aggression</strong>. Indeed, agroterrorism would probably be viewed as being too “mundane” in comparison with traditional terrorist tactics (which focus on more-spectacular, human-directed atrocities) because it does not produce immediate, visible effects. The impact of bio-assaults on livestock and the food chain, although significant, is delayed and lacks a single focal point for media attention. More specifically, there is no drama of the sort that results from a suicide bombing or a September 11–style attack, which is absolutely essential to creating the hostility and panic that such acts are designed to elicit.18<br />
In this light, it is perhaps understandable why biological attacks against agriculture have not been more of a problem. In fact, since 1912 there have been only 12 documented cases involving the substate use of pathogenic agents to infect livestock or contaminate food produce. Of those 12 incidents, only two could in any way be termed terrorist in nature: the 1984 Rajneeshee salmonella food poisoning in Oregon and the 1952 Mau Mau plant toxin incident in Kenya (see Table 3.2).<br />
<strong>Any ag attack would be small and we have response mechanisms</strong><br />

Tonnes of spinach has been destroyed in the U.S. after an E. coli outbreak spread through the country, affecting more than 170 people and unsettling shoppers already treading a minefield of genetically modified, irradiated and chemically-tainted food.<br />
Health experts tackling the crisis believe the source was nothing more sinister than an accidental contamination, but conspiracy theorists toyed with, then played down, more alarmist possibilities.<br />
&quot;I don't think this is terror related,&quot; said one posting on www.abovetopsecret.com, a Web site that usually chews over the traditional topics of alien invasions, JFK's death and 9/11.<br />
&quot;If extremists were to target our food supply, I doubt that spinach would be high on their list. Americans much rather eat junk food than spinach.&quot;<br />
However, the spinach scare has raised serious concerns about the vulnerability of our food supply to attack.<br />
And the threat is high on the menu this week in Kansas City, where academics and experts in security and agriculture are gathering to discuss what they term &quot;agroterrorism&quot; -- strikes aimed at halting or contaminating food supplies.<br />
The specter of agroterrorism first raised its head in 1984 when a member of a cult led by the Baghwan Shri Rajneesh deliberately contaminated salad bars with salmonella in 10 restaurants in the town of Dalles, Oregon.<br />
Though it left 750 people ill, 45 hospitalized, and remains the largest bio-terrorist attack of the 20th century in the United States, the Dalles incident pales beside the kind of disaster scenarios envisioned by authorities in the wake of the September 11, 2001 al Qaeda strikes on America.<br />
It was certainly food for thought for former U.S. health and human services secretary Tommy Thompson, who confessed nightly panics about the threat to the food supply until he resigned in 2004.<br />
&quot;I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do,&quot; he said at the time of his exit.<br />
Thompson clearly wasn't alone.<br />
In February 2004, President George W. Bush ordered new measures to protect his country's food supply from terrorist strikes, ordering that: &quot;We should provide the best protection possible against a successful attack ... which could have catastrophic health and economic effects.&quot;<br />
The plan outlined the stockpiling of animal pharmaceuticals to ward against livestock disease and the development of a response mechanism in case crops were devastated by fungal infections.<br />
Not everyone is convinced of the risk. Dr. Jean Weese, a professor of food science at the University of Tennessee, says that while the food chain is certainly vulnerable to attack, agricultural targets lack the deadly appeal of the World Trade Center or the Pentagon.<br />
&quot;Even if you contaminate all of the spinach in a field, although it sounds terrible to say, only one or two people die,&quot; she says. &quot; It is not going to reach the same level of devastation as flying a plane into a building.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not that it couldn't be done. It could be and it could cause terror in terms of the alarm it would spread, but I don't think it would get the results the terrorists would want, which is killing a lot of people.&quot;<br />

For others, international legal regimes can influence state behavior in important ways: regimes facilitate cooperation among sovereign states by providing coordination and commitment mechanisms that identify state obligations and provide a means of enforcement. Nevertheless<span class="HeaderChar">, states join and comply with regimes only when it is in their rational self-interest to do so</span> (Keohane 1984; Downs et al. 1996). Thus<span class="HeaderChar">, although the international human rights regime may encourage state cooperation </span>and circumscribe government repression of human rights, the<span class="HeaderChar"> pool of states that commit to these institutions should be rather limited in the first place, and compliance will heavily depend on the design of the regime.</span><br />
Grounding decisions in international law makes it less stable – causes rollback<br />
<strong>Sanchez, 05</strong> (Ernesto, JD at the University of Pennsylvania, 38 Conn. L. Rev. 185, “A Case Against Judicial Internationalism”, December, lexis)<br />
Criticizing the Court's apparent &quot;Eurocentrism&quot; 195 has absolutely nothing to do with whether one agrees that the Constitution bans states from forbidding homosexual conduct or not. In fact, in a theoretical sense, the Court may have made overturning Lawrence easier for its successors. The Court referred to how Bowers wrongly concluded that bans on homosexuality were consistent with Western civilization's norms by citing the ECHR decision and Britain's legalization of homosexuality. 196 What if the Court's makeup should change in the next few years to include a majority of justices who personally find homosexuality to be morally abhorrent? Just as the Court selectively referred to nations that had legalized homosexuality, 1 197 a future Court could redo the analysis, adjust its criteria, and come to the opposite conclusion. Because the Court has offered no guidelines [*223] as to how to use foreign law in cases not involving international law or external interests, this remains a possibility. At least, the Court would be able to go back on its claims of a definitive world consensus in favor of legalizing homosexual activity, for its analysis would only depend upon what the Court viewed as proof of any such consensus. The reference to foreign law in Lawrence, Roper, and their internationalist predecessors may not have provided crucial support to the basic legal analyses that brought about their respective outcomes. But because the Court has established the precedent that the United States should approach a legal issue in a certain manner because other nations have done so, there consequently exists the prospect that this line of reasoning could definitively affect a future case's outcome when two equally convincing American legal perspectives exist. Abortion rights may exemplify such an instance.<br />
<strong>Other countries solve the impact—US not key</strong><br />
<strong>Benvenisti, 08</strong>—Professor of Law, Tel Aviv University (Eval, RECLAIMING DEMOCRACY: THE STRATEGIC USES OF FOREIGN AND INTERNATIONAL LAW BY NATIONAL COURTS, 102 A.J.I.L. 241. AD)<br />
In recent years, courts in several democracies have begun to engage seriously in the interpretation and application of international law and to heed the constitutional jurisprudence of other national courts. Most recently, this new tendency has been demonstrated by the judicial responses to the global counterterrorism effort since the events of September 11, 2001: national courts have been challenging executive unilateralism in what could perhaps be a globally coordinated move. In this article I describe and explain this shift, arguing that the chief motivation of the national courts is not to promote global justice, for they continue to regard themselves first and foremost as national agents. Rather, the new jurisprudence is part of a reaction to the forces of globalization, which are placing increasing pressure on the different domestic branches of government to conform to global standards. This reaction seeks to expand the space for domestic deliberation, to strengthen the ability of national governments to withstand the pressure brought to bear by interest groups and powerful foreign governments, and to insulate the national courts from intergovernmental pressures. For this strategy to succeed, courts need to forge a united judicial front, which entails coordinating their policies with equally positioned courts in other countries by developing common communication tools consisting of international law and comparative constitutional law. The analysis also explains why the U.S. Supreme Court, which does not need to protect the domestic political or judicial processes from external pressure, has still not joined this collective effort.3 On the basis of this insight into the driving force behind reliance on foreign law, the article proposes another outlook for assessing the legitimacy of national courts’ resort to foreign and international legal sources. It asserts that recourse to these sources is perfectly legitimate from a democratic theory perspective, as it aims at reclaiming democracy from the debilitating grip of globalization.
