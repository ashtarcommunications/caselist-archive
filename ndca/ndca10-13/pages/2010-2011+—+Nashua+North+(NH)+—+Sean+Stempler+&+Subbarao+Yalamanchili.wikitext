However, when the weekend ended and the war machine plugged along with business as usual, the masses stood silent: they didn’t know what came next. And so they disbanded – the resistance disappeared, and a month later Operation Iraqi Freedom began. Everyone just went back to work, and acted like the rallies never happened. It appears Rorty, Walt, and Shively have failed us - simply knowing about government policies has proven to be wholly ineffective to challenge the political. When the peace movement was at its strongest, protesting a war built on a bed of lies, it was also at its weakest. The people are missing – the protesting masses have become a silent majority. Instead of remaining trapped in this traditional framework, prefer a molecular politics of experimentation.** **This is Gilbert et. al in 2008** (February 2008, Jeremy Gilbert, organizer and chair of the roundtable, “Deleuzian politics?

**The Stop the War protest movement didn’t just disappear, rather, it was reclaimed by the State; captured within the channels of acceptance. This co-opted resistance not only makes any form of meaningful political engagement impossible in the status quo, but actively seeks to deter other expressions of politics.** **This is Ward Churchill in 2007** (Ward Churchill, American-Indian activist with AIM, former professor for University of Colorado at Boulder, “Pacifism as Pathology: reflections of the role of armed struggle in North America”, pgs. 48-62, [CL]) __<span style="background: aqua;">The question central...</span>__mother country radicals.” **This subordination of desire to fear in the face of police lines and threats from the outside world has transformed the State into a war machine. Liberalism asks us to surrender and be safe – war is permeating throughout all of society. In this way, war is an immanent thing, dispersed everywhere and nowhere at the same time, a ghost war on all of society. The war machine has placed us in a constant state of emergency by its own doing: fear has turned us all into cannibals, desiring our own domination and servitude. Don’t live life in a bomb shelter – death isn’t the worst that can happen. You should challenge the politics of fear and endless war-mongering with a contraption of your own.** **This is Daniel Bell in 2007** (Daniel M., Associate Professor of Theological Ethics, Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory, JCRT 8.2 SPRING 2007 55,d<span style="color: blue;">[[http://www.jcrt.org/archives/08.2/]]</span>) Like Hobbes and Foucault, Deleuze holds that life is constituted by motion; specifically by the active power that is desire. Moreover, this desire in a “state of nature” if you will, is not reactive; it is not fearful. Rather, it is anarchic, creative, harmonic. This active, playful power that is desire only becomes reactive, fearful, or in Deleuze’s terms, paranoid, as it is acted upon, as it is captured or seduced by reactive and fearful forces, which is precisely what the state-form attempts to do. </span>

**Observation Two: Framework** **Our interpretation of framework is that the affirmative should defend the passage of a topical plan by the resolutional actor.** **We will always defend the consequences of removing troops, but it is important to note the political climate and ideologies that would have to exist for that to happen. We will never say the plan won’t happen, only describe the context in which its passage is pragmatic.** </span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; text-align: justify;">

For example: in America the two dominant political groups are republicans and democrats. Each has a particular group interest, something that is objectively good for it (for instance, winning elections). However, realizing the interests of your group is not the same as liberation as such because there are microphysical investments of desire that are still fascistic (for instance, the party line). Our argument is that the masses aren't duped; their desire is invested in a particular form of collective existence that is itself fascistic. Taking political change without recognizing internal desires ends in nothing but failure.</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;"> **Deleuze and Guattari 1972**, Anti-Oedipus, 347-8</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; text-align: justify;">
