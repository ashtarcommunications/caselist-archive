<span style="font-size: 6pt;">For a world dependent on fossil fuels, carbon capture and storage (</span>CCS) could be a key to controlling greenhouse gas emissions.But the technology meant to scrub carbon dioxide pollution from the air is experiencing stiff headwinds<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> .</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">...</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> "</span>This is a period when it should be exploding, so thisdoesn't signal<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> significant </span>growth of<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the </span>CCS<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> industry </span>in the near future<span style="font-size: 6pt;">."</span>



==The United States federal government should facilitate regulated pipeline transportation of captured carbon in the United States.==

<span class="TitleChar">Siting regulations affect companies' ability to build where pipelines are needed, or wanted</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration - Lowering Emissions While Still Utilizing the United States' Coal Resources CCS is a multistep process that involves separating CO<2> from the exhaust of a power plant, transporting the CO<2> via pipeline to an underground storage reservoir, and storing the CO<2> underground so that it is not released into the atmosphere. 48 </span><span style="font-size: 16pt;">…</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">As discussed below</span><span class="TitleChar">, </span>the //<span style="font-size: 10pt;">absence</span>// of //<span style="font-size: 10pt;">federal regulation</span>// of CO<2> pipelines creates<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the very </span>//<span style="font-size: 10pt;">uncertainty</span>// that would //<span style="font-size: 10pt;">limit</span>// private investment<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 88</span>

In order to mitigate the most drastic effects of climate change while continuing to utilize coal resources in the United States, CCS projects must be implemented //<span style="font-size: 10pt;">immediately</span>//<span style="font-size: 16pt;">…</span><span class="TitleChar">In so doing, Congress would encourage the development of a technology that fully takes advantage of the United States' natural resources while protecting against the environmental harms caused by climate change</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span>

====Having coal as a utility option is key – any alternative drastically increases consumer energy costs====
