==T Investment== 
===1NC Capital Spending Shell=== 
Investment in transportation infrastructure is capital spending
Musick 9 – Microeconomic and Financial studies division at the Congressional Budget Office (Nathan, “Subsidizing Infrastructure Investment with Tax-Preferred Bonds”, CBO, October 26 of 2009, http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/106xx/doc10667/10-26-taxpreferredbonds.pdf)//AW
In this analysis, investment in infrastructure is defined as capital spending on transportation,
AND
which is formed by spending on educational programs or on research and development.

===2NC Land Grants Violation=== 
Land grants are free gifts – no capital is involved
US Legal 6 – US Legal Dictionary (US Legal, “Land Grant Law & Legal Definition”, US Legal Dictionary, March 18 of 2006, http://definitions.uslegal.com/l/land-grant/)//AW
The term 'land grant' is used to refer to a government grant or gift of a public land to a person, group of people, or an institution. For example, to railway or college. A land-grant university or college is entitled to support from the federal government under the provisions of the Morrill Acts.

===1NC Finance Shell=== 
Interpretation – infrastructure investment requires the building or maintenance of physical assets
Chan, et al, ’09 [March 2009, Chris Chan, Danny, Forwood, Heather Roper, Chris Sayers, “Public Infrastructure Financing: An International Perspective”, http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/86930/public-infrastructure-financing.pdf]
Investment can be regarded as an act of forgoing current consumption by allocating economic resources
AND
realised sooner than otherwise possible (or which might not otherwise have occurred).

Violation—The affirmative is financing not investment—they raise capital for the purpose of investment but don’t invest –
Chan, et al, ’09 [March 2009, Chris Chan, Danny, Forwood, Heather Roper, Chris Sayers, “Public Infrastructure Financing: An International Perspective”, http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/86930/public-infrastructure-financing.pdf]
The study is concerned with financing public infrastructure — the vehicles employed by governments to
AND
no way guarantees that the project itself satisfies the criteria of allocative efficiency.

===2NC NIB Violation=== 
Infrastructure bank is financing not investment
Chan, et al, ’09 [March 2009, Chris Chan, Danny, Forwood, Heather Roper, Chris Sayers, “Public Infrastructure In many OECD countries,
the financial and other activities undertaken by GTEs are not recognised in their owner-

Prefer our evidence – Department of Transportation agrees – Transportation infrastructure investment requires the actual purchasing or construction of transportation facilities and structures
US Department of Transportation ’03 (U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Figure 109 - Gross Government Investments in Transportation Infrastructure by Level of Government: 1990–2000, February, http://www.bts.gov/publications/transportation_statistics_annual_report/2003/html/chapter_02/figure_109.html)

NOTES: Investment in transportation infrastructure includes the purchase or construction value of transportation facilities
AND

===1NC Maintenance Shell=== 
Interpretation - Infrastructure investment is distinct from maintenance
Lemer 11 - worked at The National Academies and studied at Harvard University (Andrew, “How Much Infrastructure Spending Is “Enough?’”, http://www.andrewlemer.com/2011/02/26/how-much-infrastructure-spending-is-%E2%80%9Cenough%E2%80%9D/)
What has been neglected in all of the analyses that I have seen is an
AND
public works agencies suggest that maintenance budgets are often squeezed, forcing neglect.



==T In== 
===1NC Shell=== 
“In” means inclusion within ---the aff has to build or maintain physical assets within the United States
Random House 12 (Unabridged Dictionary, “in”, http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/in?s=t)

in   [in] Show IPA preposition, adverb, adjective, noun, verb, inned, in·ning.
preposition
1. (used to indicate inclusion within space, a place, or limits): walking in the park.
2. (used to indicate inclusion within something abstract or immaterial): in politics; in the autumn.

4. (used to indicate limitation or qualification, as of situation, condition, relation, manner, action, etc.): to speak in a whisper; to be similar in appearance.
5. (used to indicate means): sketched in ink; spoken in French.

==T Transportation Infrastructure== 
===1NC Not Communications Shell=== 
Interpretation - Transportation infrastructure includes roads, air and waterway infrastructure pipeline terminals, intermodal facilities and warehouse delivery systems specifically for transporting hazardous materials.
Church et. Al ‘03 [December 2003, Rick Church, UC Santa Barbara Bruce Ralston, University of Tennessee Jeff Western, Director of Infrastructure Security, Wisconsin DOT Benjamin Zhan, Texas State University-San Marcos- all part of a committee at the National Consortium on Remote Sensing in Transportation,“Critical Transportation Infrastructure”, http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/ncrst/meetings/20031201SBA-CTI2003/first.html]
There are many classes of infrastructure — a background page on CIP enumerates these.
AND
provisions to serve needs of critical hazardous/non-hazardous materials in transit

ITS is not transportation – how the tech is deployed proves there is a clear distinction – prefer our most qualified evidence.
Pincus ‘11 [September 2011, Marcia Pincus is from the ITS Joint Program Office Research and Innovative Technology Administration U.S. Department of Transportation Department of Transportation, Final Report, “Intelligent Transportation Systems Benefits, Costs, Deployment, and Lessons Learned Desk Reference: 2011 Update” http://www.benefitcost.its.dot.gov/its/benecost.nsf/files/BCLLDepl2011Update/$File/Ben_Cost_Less_Depl_2011%20Update.pdf]
A wide variety of infrastructure-based ITS applications improve the safety and mobility of

without relying on the presence of dynamic message signs at the appropriate location.
===1NC Military Shell=== 
Transportation infrastructure excludes spending on the military and law enforcement
Musick ‘10 [2010, Nathan, CBO’s Microeconomic Studies Division, “Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure,”
http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/119xx/doc11940/11-17-infrastructure.pdf]
Although different definitions of “infrastructure” exist, this report focuses on two types
AND
those conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers following Hurricane Katrina in 2005).

===1NC Vehicles Shell=== 

Interpretation- Vehicles are part of our transportation system, not our transportation infrastructure
Amosweb ‘12 [2012, “Taking A Ride On TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE” A pedestrian’s guide to the economy, http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=pdg&c=dsp&k=47]
We usually think about transportation in terms of vehicles -- like cars, trucks, trains, airplanes, and boats. Vehicles, however, are only part of any transportation system. You usually need depots, roadbeds, and other such capital goods that we refer to as infrastructure. Cars need streets and highways, trains need tracks, airplanes need airports, and boats need docks and ports.

===1NC Physical Assets Shell=== 

Infrastrucutre Investment is the building or maintenance of physical assets
Chan, et al, ’09 [March 2009, Chris Chan, Danny, Forwood, Heather Roper, Chris Sayers, “Public Infrastructure Financing: An International Perspective”, http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/86930/public-infrastructure-financing.pdf]
Investment can be regarded as an act of forgoing current consumption by allocating economic resources
AND
time — even for projects that have the potential for full cost recovery.
Financing and refinancing — that is, raising and allocating cash flows to meet resource costs — play a crucial role in overcoming inter-temporal funding constraints. This enables productive infrastructure investment to be realised sooner than otherwise possible (or which might not otherwise have occurred).

The affirmative creates a bad limit on the practices of the community
First is our Resolutional Basis – The word Resolved means to declare by a formal vote
Webster’s Revised Unabridged Dictionary, 1998 (dictionary.com)
Resolved:
5. To express, as an opinion or determination, by resolution and vote; to declare or decide by a formal vote; -- followed by a clause; as, the house resolved (or, it was resolved by the house) that no money should be apropriated (or, to appropriate no money).

The power to imagine public advocacy that actually makes a difference is one of the

Their articulation of fiat and the use of the Federal Government serves a disservice to the education of Black People through debate.

To deny a discussion of political workings through the role play of federal government in the name of race is almost BACKWARDS and serves the exclusionary historical practices of white supremacy.

Debate cannot be limited to discussions of racial exclusionary practices. The topic provides opportunity for Black debaters to learn about modern day politics and gain important training to become active and meaningful participants in modern day democratic decisionmaking. To avoid discussion of the topic seems to revert back to historical discriminatory educational practices utilized to disempower and subject blacks to inferior positions within society.
