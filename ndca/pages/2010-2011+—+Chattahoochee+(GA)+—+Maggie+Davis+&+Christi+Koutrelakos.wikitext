The German insistence on ISAF being a stabilisation […] Both the absence of an integrated use of civilian and military means and a defensive operational posture had been shaping parameters of German operational conduct in the Balkans in the 1990s.

Despite these early successes, the operation ultimately failed to launch a civilian led long-term reconstruction […] By early 2010, the situation in Faryab and Badghis provinces had deteriorated signiﬁcantly. 3
