<span style="font-size: 4pt;">“I am the Executive Director of NRDC. The position is my second at NRDC. Beginning in 1994, I led the Clean Water Program for five years, before leaving in 1999 to serve as the head of the Environmental Protection Bureau for the Attorney General of the State of New York. My first experience with NRDC dates back to 1980, when I worked on environmental issues in Washington, DC. President Reagan had just been elected and environmentalists needed to strengthen their efforts. After law school, I worked for the New York City Law Department. NRDC was working hard to protect the city's drinking water supply, so I joined forces with NRDC and, on behalf of the city, sued polluters. I also joined with NRDC in suing President Reagan's Department of Transportation for rolling back fuel economy standards. This was the very first lawsuit brought on the grounds of global warming. I knew then that NRDC was thinking big, and committed to solving complex problems over the long haul. Cases like this underscore why I became an environmental lawyer in the first place: if you are right on the law, you can make tremendous progress. NRDC has distinguished itself by a history of groundbreaking environmental work. Through our lawyers, lobbyists, scientists and media experts, we're able not only to find solutions, but to do the hard work of putting them into place. This is part of why NRDC is, in my opinion, the leading environmental organization in the nation. And it's why I'm honored to be back. Before I gained any of this professional experience, my dedication to protecting the environment began as I suspect it does for many people -- by spending a lot of time in the outdoors. I spent most of my youth mucking around in the woods near where I grew up, and then as I grew older I spent a lot of time hiking and climbing and canoeing and kayaking. I still try to get out every weekend and, when I do, I'm reminded of how quickly the planet is changing, and how much it needs our protection.</span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">Explanation:</span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">I emailed our solvency advocate about our aff - the full email is provided below as we read it in debates - any questions to us our emails are above</span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">Initial Email:</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Jon Sussman on November 5th:¶ Hello Dr. Furness,¶ My name is Jon Sussman and I am a High School policy debater from New Trier High School in Winnetka Illinois.¶ This year we are debating about whether or not to affirm a resolution about Transportation Infrastructure Investment.¶ The wording of the resolution is "Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States"¶ When my partner and I affirm the resolution, we defend that it is a good idea for the federal government to increase bike lane investment.¶ I have read your "Put the Fun Between Your Legs" partial dissertation and enjoyed it quite a bit. In fact we cite the paper in our affirmative argument.¶ Our argument is based around the idea that because the federal government focuses on highway investment and pretty much disregards bicycle lane investment, that it re-entrenches an auto-mobile dependent culture.¶ An argument that is frequently ran against us is that the State governments, rather than the federal government should be the ones investing in the bicycle lanes.¶ We normally make the argument that it is a federal responsibility to invest in the lanes, as well as that it is not any longer a radical critique of the relationship between the government and the oil companies if the state governments were to invest. Our argument in the end comes down to the assertion that federal investment is more indicative of a national priority to enable the cycling counter-culture than state investment.¶ I was wondering if you had any thoughts that you would be willing to share on the issue of federal vs. state investment, and if you would mind if I used your response as quoted evidence in a debate round?</span>
<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">His Answer:</span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">Hey Jon!</span>
<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">Great to hear from you. It's funny because another debater from Texas got in touch with me recently to talk about bikes too...I love the random encounters that bring people together over ideas. </span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">Well, first off, I'm flattered by you reading my diss but my book is dramatically better, if I do say do myself. I express my thoughts about some of what I think needs to happen with respect to prioritizing transportation and I'll send you a PDF of my book in a few minutes. But the short and sweet is that, historically speaking, leaving spending decisions to states--usually in the name of 'state's rights'--has often been a way for politicians and their parties to avoid implementing measures that are seen as 'liberal', particularly anything having to do with the environment. While some states like California, Oregon, Minnesota etc tend to take the lead over the fed on a lot of bike trans policy issues, they are the exception to the rule....and even in those cases they aren't doing anything to really undermine auto development & planning, rather, they simply make use of funds that are supposed to be utilized for non-automotive transportation. My point is that states already have way too much flexibility in terms of what they are allowed to do with trans planning which is why most states not only routinely redirect fed allotted $ for bicycling/pedestrian infrastructure into auto-based trans projects, they also tend to literally let money go to waste that is designated for bike-ped projects. More to the point, most states have never even taken the first steps to comply with ISTEA (legislation), which is to conduct studies to determine how, where or whether specific kinds of bike-ped projects should be carried out (I quote someone on this in Chap 3 of One Less Car, I think). Put simply, conservative politicians have been highly successful in making non auto-based development seem like its an envirofascist/hippie/liberal plot to force people out of their cars and onto bicycles and horses-and-buggies (see the first paragraph in my conclusion). While the fed tends to botch tons of important things, there's really no hope for a sustainable transportation future (ie a mix of public transit, rail, and pedal-powered trans technologies) unless the fed not only forces states into compliance with existing bike-ped-transit laws (which are insanely benign, and favored by most people in the US, regardless of political persuasion) but also initiates an unprecedented shift in priorities that would put such an agenda at the center of American policy debates (which, unfortunately, will never happen cuz of oil corporations are the wealthiest institutions in the history of history and they have bought both political parties). The only discretion states should have, IMHO, is 1) to work with their constituencies and the fed to decide where projects should be built, and 2) to have the flexibility to go above and beyond what the fed recommends as far as committing resources to sustainable trans (this would seem like a no-brainer given the habitual 'states' rights' discourse, but the courts also ruled, for ex, that CA didn't have the right to raise efficiency standards on cars a number of years ago...and the states' rights/energy independence repubs applauded without irony cuz in actuality all they really care about is appeasing the 1%, even if it means promoting policies that habitually make both state govts and economies less stable, less efficient, and ever more dependent on both 'foreign oil' and 'Washington'). Do you really think, for example, that Illinois would intentionally devote $ to transit or cycling unless the fed kicked down money? Maybe in Chicago because there's always been support for mass trans and bicycling....but the latter was only nurtured because old man Daly happen to like bikes and made the city build some infrastructure several decades ago (which his son continued). But aside from that, I doubt anything would happen in Illinois, or Indiana, or most other states if all decisions about trans spending were made by state govts. We can't wish for the occasional bike-friendly politician to act as savior, and we can't rely on states to decide whether or *if* they will commit to the kinds of trans systems increasingly found in every other advanced country.</span>
<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">Besides, states are almost all broke right now so it's literally a moot point to suggest that states are even capable of doing their own thing on trans policy. </span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">And if the fed didn't spend millions of dollars a minute (or more) on war, prisons, and corporate bail outs, there would never have to be debates over where trans $ got allocated because there would be enough to go around (and building all that infrastructure would also create those 'jobs' that I always hear politicians yammering about....weird how that works, huh?)</span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">I hope all is well on your end. Best of luck with the debate season.</span>

<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 12pt;">Cheers,</span>

====2NC Root Cause==== 
**Anthropocentrism is the root cause of all violence – the human/non-human divide is patterned in violence – the alt solves**
**Kochi 09**<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">(Tarik, Sussex law school, Species war: Law, Violence and Animals, Law Culture and Humanities Oct 5.3)//RSW</span>
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">This reflection need not be ...</span>__<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> war is thus a critic of war’s normalization.</span>__


====2NC AT: Perm==== 
**The perm will not “overcome” the link. REASONS come first and precede policy – The perm links because it includes anthropocentric justifications that deny the intrinsic dignity of the nonhuman.**
**Callicott 02** – <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">(J. Baird, Professor of Philosphy at UNT, 2002 [//Environmental Ethics// p. 548-550])</span>
<span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Bryan Norton, another environmental an­tiphilosopher, ... regarded as equally uncon­scionable.</span>

===Consumption=== 
====1NC Shell==== 
**Expansion of transportation infrastructure is grounded in a production-oriented economic imaginary – movement of goods and people assumes and generates expanding consumer demand, creating a society that relentlessly strives for greater levels of growth**
Princen et al 02 <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">(Thomas, Professor at the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan, Ken Conca, Associate Professor of Government and Politics and Director of the Harrison Program on the Future Global Agenda at the University of Maryland, Michael Maniates, Professor of Environmental Science and Political Science Allegheny College, __Confronting Consumption__, pgs. 4-8)</span>
How might ordinary people living …territory of consumer sovereignty.

**The judge should vote negative to embrace an aesthetics of voluntary simplicity**

**It’s try-or-die for the alternative – current consumption practices make extinction inevitable – shifting the subject position of the economic imaginary away from producers and towards consumers creates a shift towards creative strategies for simplicity and de-growth**
Alexander 12 <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">Samuel, lecturer at the Office for Environmental Programs, University of Melbourne, Australia, “DEGROWTH IMPLIES VOLUNTARY SIMPLICITY: OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION”, Simplicity Institute Report 12b, 2012)</span>
The global economy is exceeding …barriers to sustainable consumption can be overcome.

====2NC Framework==== 
**Their framework causes error replication – all transit planning is backgrounded by discursive assumptions about the perspective of the actors involved – failure to engage questions of knowledge production locks down dominant approaches and causes serial policy failure**
**Gunder & Hillier 09** – <span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">(Michael, Senior planning lecturer in the School of </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture|Architecture]]</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning|Planning]]</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;"> at the </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 10.6667px; text-decoration: none;">[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Auckland|University of Auckland]]</span><span style="font-size: 10.6667px;">, Jean, Professor of Town and Country Planning at School of Architecture, Newcastle University, __Planning in Ten Words or Less: A Lacanian Entanglement with Spatial Planning__, pgs. 111-112)</span>
The hegemonic network, or bloc… and desires of everyone is an impossibility (Gunder 2003a, 2003b).

====2NC AT: Perm==== 
**Cascade Effect DA – initial expansion of consumption cascades into exponentially greater future consumption without corresponding increases in quality of life – only displacing disposable culture from the beginning can stop runaway consumption**
