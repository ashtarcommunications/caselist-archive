<span class="Underline">All current programs will fail – changing the tracking system is key</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Gast 8- David, NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA THESIS, “Lidar Design for Space Situational Awareness” September 2008 </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Space Situational Awareness (SSA)is vital to the United States of America. More than any other country, the U.S. utilizes space for military command and control, military and civilian navigation, communications, intelligence, and a host of other applications (Rumsfeld 9). Knowing what is orbiting our planet and the orbits in which those objects are located is essential to maintaining those capabilities. To date, most efforts in detecting, tracking and cataloging objects in orbit have been carried out by earthborn means. Radar emplacements like The Fence track every object of sufficient size that passes overhead, then update the catalogues in a more or less automated fashion. Other radar and optical sites can track orbiting objects as they pass within their fields of view, and some can even locate objects as far out as the GEO belt. Unfortunately, each of these methods requires the object to be tracked to pass overhead. Any object in an orbit that does not do so cannot be tracked. For instance, The Fence cannot track anything in an inclination low enough not to cross it. Furthermore, most of these methods require a tracked object to be correlated to a launch in order to identify the object. Any significant maneuver while out of sight of a ground station could easily generate an uncorrelated track. The limitations of earthborn sensors grow out of three facts. First, any such sensor must be, by definition, on the ground. The highest piece of ground is only 8.85 km above sea level, and is hardly an ideal location for building anything. Most satellites, on the other hand, have a perigee at or above 600 km, due to atmospheric drag considerations. Thus, to be useful, any such sensor must be able to detect objects at least that far away. Second, the range of orbits visible to any given site is constrained by its physical location. Furthermore, many such sensors require multiple passes before a solid track is developed, and all require periodic revisits to maintain their tracks. Mobile sensors can help to alleviate the first problem, but not the second, since moving them to cover different orbits would cause them to lose track on those objects spotted previously. There 2 are also practical and political issues with the placement of such systems. A given location may be ideally situated to observe a particular range or orbits, but it may present a challenging environment for constructing and operating such a system. Other locations may be ideal both positionally and environmentally, but may be controlled by someone who would prefer not to have a space observation sensor located there. Third, and of particular concern for optical systems, though not inconsequential to radars, is the fact that any earthborn system must look up through the atmosphere. The atmosphere distorts, disperses, reflects and absorbs various electromagnetic wavelengths to different degrees.</span><br />

Robert Ryals is a BSEE, JD, and MA and a Force Space Command as a contractor in space control and as an instructor for the past five years at the Space Innovation and Development Center’s Advanced Space Operations School, “The New National Space Policy: More is Needed” February 2011, High Frontier Volume 7, No. 2, pg online </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Interest in international space cooperation is not new. International cooperation has been an important and long-standing hallmark of the US national space policies. International cooperation and associated multinational operations have been important components of an effective global engagement strategy to assure access to space capabilities for the US, its allies, and partners. The US engages in a wide range of such activities, notbecause of their benign nature but rather they are in its best national interests to do so. US collaborative efforts have been part of the space age since its beginning. Cooperation allows space-faring states to combine resources and reduce risk; improve efficiency; expand diplomatic engagement; and enhance prestige of engaged states, improve political sustainability of space projects, and provide workforce stability. With the end of the Cold War, space and Earth science research and space exploration activities are no longer con by an overarching competition between superpowers. The George H. W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and now Obama administrations have each attempted to capitalize on the post Cold War opportunities and leverage the expertise of other nations. The US scientific community has entered into a new multi-polar world, creating diverse international space alliances and partnerships. The Obama administration supports this trend by reaching out to growing global space powers like India and China, both emerging economic and engineering powerhouses. It hopes such engagement will shape their future space, engineering and political activities in positive ways. The US has also reached out to old friends. For example, Secretaries of State and Defense, Clinton and Robert M. Gates, have announced the Australians will be more fully integrated into US space situational awareness activities. 7 The sentiments to support international cooperation and collaboration are growing and evolving, much more so than in past policy declarations. Participants expect international projects will generate a calculus that one plus one will equal three— that diverse resources, skills, and technologies of the partners will provide synergy, adding up to more than the sum of their parts. 8</span><br />
<span class="Underline">NASA, commercial, and European space activities have already achieved considerable success with their cooperative endeavors. 9 Fans of the new policy may think that the number of times “international cooperation” or “cooperation” is mentioned is very important. Yes, the new policy does contain numerous references to “cooperation.” Grand pronouncements and simplistic interpretation of the number of references relating to cooperation are not enough. The old and current reality is that cooperative programs are expensive, difficult at times to resource, and many times very hard to manage. Shrewd partners know that the direction to engage in cooperation is not worth much unless tied to real money and programs.Potential and even current partners arethus taking a judicious wait and see attitude to the new policy. They have been closely watching the US space politics for well over 50 years and will not act rashly. Changing their business plans to respond to fickle US executive and legislative international cooperative initiatives could be considered too much risk to assume.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Successful international cooperation is not easily achieved. Considering the space debris, SSA, collision avoidance, and TCBM foundational pointsidentified above, the new policy provides no thought guideposts on how to proceed. The new policy cries out for a strategy to obtain these goals.Knowledgeable diplomats and policy analysts understand that US government agencies do not always support policy directives. This creates uncertainty and unpredictability for potential partners who are considering cooperative ventures with the US. For example, one need only look to the fight over acquiring space imaging via the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) broad area space-based imagery collection (BASIC) satellite system against using a commercial remote sensing solution. The Office of the Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics objected to the proposed BASIC acquisition suggesting the NRO was not following US Commer-37 High Frontier cial Remote Sensing Policy which provided the US would first look to the commercial community to satisfy its remote sensing needs.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">10 The NRO position to acquire the system despite the policy eventually prevailed within the interagency. 11 Then Congress interceded, pointing again to the Commercial Remote Sensing Policy. It refused to fund the system. 12 A new space strategy must anticipate comparable bureaucratic foot-dragging to cooperation initiatives and associated reforms. The implementing strategy must advocate changes in laws and regulations to better enable international cooperation. The Arms Export Control Act and its associated International Traffic in Arms Regulations still stymie US and international interests in cooperation. The strategy must also anticipate that many in the US security community will not see cooperation as a benefit. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The new policy does not adequately confront the point that many US space professionals still have difficulty spelling “international cooperation.” They have a historical bias to first look to integrate international capabilities on a US platform, rather than comprehensively plan and employ an integrated approach. A strategy needs to enable the US space community to internalize an appreciation of the opportunities that international cooperative programs offer. One of the authors participated in a recent conference panel presentation on the “role of international cooperation” with senior NASA and industry officials where it was difficult to get the other speakers to discuss or mention any international component to their program activities. These officials, while very earnest and capable, felt much more comfortable just talking to the US components of their program portfolios. In due time, a winning international cooperation effort will require the entire US space community to fully embrace the concept</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The framework to strengthen SSA, said General Helms, is found in the new National Space Policy, released by President Barack Obama last summer. A key element to the policy is international cooperation. &quot;We must partner with other nations and enterprises to achieve mutually beneficial goals and at the top of our priorities is the development of comprehensive SSA,&quot; she said. &quot;The National Space Policy encourages international cooperation and in pursuit of this goal we will surely break new ground.&quot; Among the reasons why this is important, explained General Helms, is that better SSA allows those who operate in space to make more fully informed and therefore safer decisions, while also removing the mistrust and misperceptions that can lead to mishaps and misunderstandings. The National Space Policy acknowledges that no single nation has the resources or geography to precisely track every object in space. &quot;It directs us to collaborate with other nations, the private sector and intergovernmental organizations to improve our space situational awareness - specifically to enhance our shared ability to rapidly detect, warn of, characterize and attribute natural and man-made disturbances to space systems,&quot; said General Helms. &quot;There are many technical and operational details that have to be worked out before we at JFCC-Space could begin incorporating data from allies and partners, but we are definitely moving in that direction.&quot; JFCC-Space currently has 19 formal standing SSA sharing agreements with private industry to provide advanced tailored SSA services in support of safe space flight operations. As a result of the JSpOC's vigilance, satellite owners maneuvered their satellites 126 times last year to avoid collisions with other satellites or on-orbit debris. &quot;The United States is committed to safe, responsible and peaceful uses of space. Public provision of space situational awareness data through the SSA Sharing Program is evidence of the U.S. government's commitment to provide SSA data to the world, free of charge, in order to enhance safe and responsible space operations and promote transparency,&quot; said General Helms. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Thank you for your kind introduction. It is a pleasure to participate in this UNIDIR space security conference and this panel on “Ongoing Processes &amp; Proposals, Next Steps.” My hope today is that our discussion will help inform much of the work we are pursuing to strengthen security and stability in space, and so I’m here to learn as much as I am here to offer remarks. My colleague, Ambassador Laura Kennedy, spoke at last year’s conference and gave a prelude to our new National Space Policy which at that time had not yet been released. The new policy was released in June 2010. Consistent with the President’s guidance in the policy, we are pursuing measures to strengthen security and stability in space. That is what I would like to discuss with you today, and more precisely, how we can strengthen security and stability through shared space situational awareness, called “SSA” for short, and through transparency and confidence building measures, or TCBMs. Why is SSA important to space security? A long-standing principle of U.S. national space policy is that all nations have the right to explore and use space for peaceful purposes, and for the benefit of all humanity, in accordance with international law. Strengthening stability in space fundamentally depends on having awareness and understanding as to who is using the space environment, for what purposes, and under what environmental conditions. The U.S. National Space Policy directs us to collaborate with other nations, the private sector, and intergovernmental organizations to improve our SSA – in other words, to improve our shared ability to rapidly detect, warn of, characterize, and attribute natural and man-made disturbances to space systems. Having this information as early as possible and as accurately as possible is critical for a number of reasons. First, it is critical to NASA, our International Space Station partners, and all spacefaring nations, where human spaceflight safety is of the utmost importance. Second, it is critical for U.S. and allied security – indeed, everyone’s security – to enable us to detect, identify, and attribute actions in space that are contrary to responsible and peaceful use. And third, given the growing dependence we all have on space-derived information, it is critical to our global economies. Cooperation to Prevent Collisions Having information enables us to achieve SSA. However, “awareness” alone is insufficient. We also need to know what to actually do with that vital information – how do we make it “actionable” information? The challenges of increasing congestion in space – over 60 nations with varying interests now operate in space; we are tracking over 22,000 objects, there are 1,100 active systems, and hundreds of thousands of smaller objects we can’t see – and the growing complexities of operating there safely and responsibly, lead to the challenge of collision avoidance. One way that international cooperation enhances SSA is the information exchange between satellite owners and operators to prevent collisions. The United States provides notifications to other governments and commercial satellite operators of potentially hazardous conjunctions between orbiting objects. The State Department also plays a crucial role in this activity because international cooperation is necessary to ensure that we have robust situational awareness of the space environment – no one nation has the resources to be able to do this alone. The State Department continues to be extremely supportive of U.S. Strategic Command’s efforts to establish SSA sharing agreements with foreign satellite operators and to facilitate rapid notifications of potential space hazards. The United States is constantly seeking to improve its ability to share information with other spacefaring nations as well as with our commercial sector partners. For example, at State we are currently reaching out to all spacefaring nations to ensure that the Joint Space Operations Center, or JSpOC, has current contact information for both government and private sector satellite operations centers. Those efforts include ongoing discussions with Russia on measures to enhance safety for robotic space missions as well as for human spaceflight. SSA Cooperation Across the United States Government, we are supporting numerous multilateral and bilateral engagements in SSA. For example, the United States is collaborating with our friends and allies in Europe as they consider developing their own SSA system. We are collaborating with the Department of Defense to engage in technical exchanges with experts from the European Space Agency, the European Union, and individual ESA and EU Member States to ensure our existing and planned SSA systems contribute to a more comprehensive situational awareness picture to ensure the safety, stability, and security of the space domain. In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense has signed bilateral SSA statements of principles with Canada, France, and Australia. Looking ahead, the United States also sees opportunities for cooperation on SSA with other nations around the globe. SSA benefits all responsible spacefaring nations. International “Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities” Another challenge we all face is promoting responsible and peaceful behavior in space. Meeting this challenge depends not only on taking positive steps, both unilaterally and multilaterally, to enhance the sustainability of space activities, but also conducting those activities in an open and transparent manner. Upon their implementation, some TCBMs also have the potential of enhancing our knowledge of the space environment, thereby strengthening security and stability in space. For instance, the United States is continuing to consult with the European Union on its initiative to develop a comprehensive set of multilateral TCBMs, also known as the international &quot;Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities.&quot; We hope to make a decision in the near term as to whether the United States can sign on to this Code, including what, if any, modifications would be necessary. An example where a Code of Conduct could contribute to our shared SSA is its political commitment to provide notifications in a timely manner of malfunctions that might place space objects at risk, as well as any accidents or collisions that might have taken place. The United States is already following such practices – as we did when we promptly notified Russia through diplomatic channels when we detected the collision of a commercial Iridium satellite with an inoperable Russian military spacecraft in February 2009. This experience is contributing to our ongoing dialogue with Russia on developing additional concrete and pragmatic bilateral TCBMs that will enhance spaceflight safety. Non-legally binding measures such as the proposed Code could build on our existing practices as well as U.S. and allied SSA capabilities by mitigating the risk of mishaps, misperceptions, and mistrust. Cooperation on “Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities” Another initiative is the multi-year study of “long-term sustainability of space activities” within the Scientific and Technical Sub-Committee of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). This effort will be forming an experts group to address SSA and space operations. In addition, a separate experts group will examine space weather, which is also an important aspect of SSA. We are hopeful that this effort will lead to the formation of voluntary “best practice guidelines,” which will help reduce operational risks to all space systems. In addition to drawing on the expertise of government experts, this working group also will draw upon the background, experience and best practices that have been developed by commercial satellite operators. Conclusion SSA is essential to strengthen security and stability in space and sustainability of our space activities. To this end, the United States is striving to improve our ability to monitor, track, and provide notifications regarding space objects. However, everyone’s picture of the space environment is greatly enhanced through international cooperation and shared SSA. Furthermore, strengthening security and stability in space is in everyone’s interests. It can be achieved through pursuing TCBMs that promote responsible behavior and the peaceful use of space. Examples of this cooperation include initiatives such as the EU’s proposal for an international Code of Conduct and the COPUOS Agenda Item on Long-Term Sustainability. Such cooperation with established and emerging members of the spacefaring community and with the private sector will help to preserve the space environment for the benefit of all nations and future generations. Thank you. I look forward to your questions and our discussion.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Policy-makers will want answers to a series of questions in order to help comprehend the situation and authorize responses to an attack on a US space asset. Military commanders and defense planners should expect, among other things, to be asked: Who committed the hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent? What is the nature of the attack? What are the consequences? When will we recover disrupted or lost capability? Where did the attack originate? How conclusive is the evidence of an attack? Why did the attack happen—what is the purpose of the attack? The ability to make a determination of hostile act or intent and answer such questions, of course, will depend upon US intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for space situational awareness (SSA). The transition from space surveillance to a more capable SSA should lead the intelligence community and force providers to deliver enhanced capabilities for indications and warning (I&amp;W), attack reporting, ISR and targeting support for space operations, and space environmental monitoring. Improved ISR is, of course, fundamental to strengthening our SSA capabilities, enhancing I&amp;W, and being able to attribute the source of an attack. The lack of improved SSA for characterization and attribution will constrain policy and operational responses. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">The second sensor necessary for the collection of space ISR data relies on Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). This sensor provides reconnaissance and surveillance data. Using a LIDAR concept allows measurements of the distance, speed, rotation, and chemical 13 AU/ACSC/1464/AY07 composition of an illuminated object.53 For example, the distance from the SSA satellite to a space object provides the object’s current position. Using LIDAR also provides considerable information about an object in space, especially if the laser wavelength is in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This part of the spectrum allows for the direct measurement of optical characteristics of the object.54 This sensor combination captures data for space ISR. The data provided by the conceptual SSA system supports the diagnosis and attribution of space events. The passive optical sensor records the object’s orientation, which provides clues to a satellite’s current mission. Similarly, the satellite’s rotation and chemical composition, provided by the LIDAR sensor, provides space ISR. The rotation information could indicate either the satellite’s mission or its current tasking, and the chemical composition of the object may provide indications of the satellite’s mission or, if the object is space debris, could help identify a way to eliminate it. This information could diagnose and attribute a space event to a space debris collision or a satellite action taken by its owner.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Control of the space segment will be vital for the conceptual SSA system because near real-time tasking is necessary for diagnosing and attributing anomalies in space. Control enables the satellite to look at a particular object to collect additional SSA information. This tasking must be available in near real-time to respond to the potentially dynamic threats of 2030. If a U.S. satellite experiences an anomaly, this constellation must rapidly collect dataon space objects to diagnose the situation. Based on this data, the AF can attribute the anomaly to the appropriate cause; if caused by another satellite, the U.S. can then use the appropriate IOPs to remedy the situation. The ability to make this diagnosis and attribution relies on control. The ground station’s command and control must be responsive to the changing space situation and be able to attribute the cause of an anomaly. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Knowledge, more than ever before, is power. The one country that can best lead the information revolution will be more powerful than any other. For the foreseeable future, that country is the United States. America has apparent strength in military power and economic production. Yet its more subtle comparative advantage is its ability to collect, process, act upon, and disseminate information, an edge that will almost certainly grow over the next decade. This advantage stems from Cold War investments and America's open society, thanks to which it dominates important communications and information processing technologies--space-based surveillance, direct broadcasting, high-speed computers--and has an unparalleled ability to integrate complex information systems. This information advantage can help deter or defeat traditional military threats at relatively low cost. In a world in which the meaning of containment, the nuclear umbrella, and conventional deterrence have changed, the information advantage can strengthen the intellectual link between U.S. foreign policy and military power and offer new ways of maintaining leadership in alliances and ad hoc coalitions. The information edge is equally important as a force multiplier of American diplomacy, including &quot;soft power&quot;--the attraction of American democracy and free markets. The United States can use its information resources to engage China, Russia, and other powerful states in security dialogues to prevent them from becoming hostile. At the same time, its information edge can help prevent states like Iran and Iraq, already hostile, from becoming powerful. Moreover, it can bolster new democracies and communicate directly with those living under undemocratic regimes. This advantage is also important in efforts to prevent and resolve regional conflicts and deal with prominent post--Cold War dangers, including international crime, terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and damage to the global environment. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">ISR and SSA sharing key to soft power coalition building – that means global cooperation </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Owens and Nye 1996 William A. and Joseph S., America’s Information Age, Foreign Affairs Vol. 75 Issue 2, p20-36 Joe Nye is a professor at Harvard</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The core of these capabilities--dominant situational knowledge--is fungible and divisible. The United States can share all or part of its knowledge with whomever it chooses. Sharing would empower recipients to make better decisions in a less-than-benign world, and should they decide to fight, they could achieve the same kind of military dominance as the United States. These capabilities point to what might be called an information umbrella. Like extended nuclear deterrence, they could form the foundation for a mutually beneficial relationship. The United States would provide situational awareness, particularly regarding military matters of interest to other nations. Other nations, because they could share this information about an event or crisis, would be more inclined to work with the United States. The beginnings of such a relationship already exist. They were born in the Falklands conflict and are being developed today in the Balkans. At present, the United States provides the bulk of the situational awareness available to the Implementation Force, the U.N. Protection Force, NATO members, and other nations involved in or concerned with the conflict there. It is possible to envision a similar central information role for the United States in other crises or potential military confrontations, from clarifying developments in the Spratly Islands to cutting through the ambiguity and confusion surrounding humanitarian operations in Cambodia and Rwanda. Accurate, real-time, situational awareness is the key to reaching agreement within coalitions on what to do and is essential to the effective use of military forces, whatever their roles and missions. As its capacity to provide this kind of information increases, America will increasingly be viewed as the natural coalition leader, not just because it happens to be the strongest but because it can provide the most important input for good decisions and effective action for other coalition members. Just as nuclear dominance was the key to coalition leadership in the old era, information dominance will be the key in the information age. All this implies selectively sharing U.S. dominant battlespace knowledge, advanced C4I, and precision force. Old-era thinking might recoil from such a prospect, and it would have to overcome long-established prejudices against being open and generous with what might broadly be called intelligence. In the past, two presumptions supported this reluctance: first, that providing too much of the best information risked disclosing and perhaps even losing the sources and methods used in obtaining it, and second, that sharing information would disclose what the United States did not know and reduce its status as a superpower. These assumptions are now even more questionable than before. The United States is no longer in a zero-sum game that makes any disclosure of capabilities a potential loss for itself and a gain for an implacable opponent. The character of this growing prowess is different. For one thing, the disparity between the United States and other nations is quite marked. U.S. investment in ISR--particularly the high-leverage space-based aspects of this set of systems exceeds that of all other nations combined, and America leads by a considerable margin in C4I and precision force as well. It has already begun, systematically, to assemble the new system of systems and is well down the revolutionary path, while most nations have not yet even realized a revolution in military affairs is under way. Some other nations could match what the United States will achieve, albeit not as early. The revolution is driven by technologies available worldwide. Digitization, computer processing, precise global positioning, and systems integration the technological bases on which the rest of the new capabilities depend are available to any nation with the money and the will to use them systematically to improve military capabilities. Exploiting these technologies can be expensive. But more important, there is no particular incentive for those nations to seek the system of systems the United States is building--so long as they believe they are not threatened by it. This is the emerging symbiosis among nations, for whether another nation decides to make a race out of the information revolution depends on how the United States uses its lead. If America does not share its knowledge, it will add incentives to match it. Selectively sharing these abilities is therefore not only the route of coalition leadership but the key to maintaining U.S. military superiority. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Soft power cooperation is necessary to deal with every global threat</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Jervis 09 professor of international politics at Columbia University. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">(Robert, Unipolarity: A Structural Perspective, World Politics Volume 61, Number 1, January 2009</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">To say that the system is unipolar is not to argue that the unipole can get everything it wants or that it has no need for others. American power is very great, but it is still subject to two familiar limitations: it is harder to build than to destroy, and success usually depends on others’ decisions. This is particularly true of the current system because of what the U.S. wants. If Hitler had won World War II, he might have been able to maintain his system for some period of time with little cooperation from others because “all” he wanted was to establish the supremacy of the Aryan race. The U.S. wants not only to prevent the rise of a peer competitor but also to stamp out terrorism, an open international economic system, spread democracy throughout the world, and establish a high degree of cooperation among countries that remain juridically equal. Even in the military arena, the U.S. cannot act completely alone. Bases and overflight rights are always needed, and support from allies, especially Great Britain, is important to validate military action in the eyes of the American public. When one matches American forces, not against those of an adversary but against the tasks at hand, they often fall short.54 Against terrorism, force is ineffective without excellent intelligence. Given the international nature of the threat and the difficulties of gaining information about it, international cooperation is the only route to success. The maintenance of international prosperity also requires joint efforts, even leaving aside the danger that other countries could trigger a run on the dollar by cashing in their holdings. Despite its lack of political unity, Europe is in many respects an economic unit, and one with a greater gdp than that of the U.S. Especially because of the growing Chinese economy, economic power is spread around the world much more equally than is military power, and the open economic system [End Page 210] could easily disintegrate despite continued unipolarity. In parallel, on a whole host of problems such as aids, poverty, and international crime (even leaving aside climate change), the unipole can lead and exert pressure but cannot dictate. Joint actions may be necessary to apply sanctions to various unpleasant and recalcitrant regimes; proliferation can be stopped only if all the major states (and many minor ones) work to this end; unipolarity did not automatically enable the U.S. to maintain the coalition against Iraq after the first Gulf War; close ties within the West are needed to reduce the ability of China, Russia, and other states to play one Western country off against the others. But in comparison with the cold war era, there are fewer incentives today for allies to cooperate with the U.S. During the earlier period unity and close coordination not only permitted military efficiencies but, more importantly, gave credibility to the American nuclear umbrella that protected the allies. Serious splits were dangerous because they entailed the risk that the Soviet Union would be emboldened. This reason for avoiding squabbles disappeared along with the USSR, and the point is likely to generalize to other unipolar systems if they involve a decrease of threats that call for maintaining good relations with the superpower. This does not mean that even in this particular unipolar system the superpower is like Gulliver tied down by the Lilliputians. In some areas opposition can be self-defeating. Thus for any country to undermine American leadership of the international economy would be to put its own economy at risk, even if the U.S. did not retaliate, and for a country to sell a large proportion of its dollar holding would be to depress the value of the dollar, thereby diminishing the worth of the country’s remaining stock of this currency. Furthermore, cooperation often follows strong and essentially unilateral action. Without the war in Iraq it is not likely that we would have seen the degree of cooperation that the U.S. obtained from Europe in combating the Iranian nuclear program and from Japan and the PRC in containing North Korea. Nevertheless, many of the American goals depend on persuading others, not coercing them. Although incentives and even force are not irrelevant to spreading democracy and the free market, at bottom this requires people to embrace a set of institutions and values. Building the world that the U.S. seeks is a political, social, and even psychological task for which unilateral measures are likely to be unsuited and for which American military and economic strength can at best play a supporting role. Success requires that others share the American vision and believe that its leadership is benign. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Much of Nye’s analysis is intended to make a relatively simple point: That the United States is indefinitely unchallengeable in terms of its “hard power”; but “soft power” is growing steadily more important in a networked world, and is the more frangible of American sources of power. There will be a natural process that somewhat vitiates the impact of American soft power in any event as other information economies mature. For example, by 2010, Nye argues, there will be more Chinese Internet users than American ones.8 While American sites will remain very attractive, because of the fact that English has become the world’s second language, China too sits at the center of a linguistic empire that not only embraces the worldwide Diaspora of Chinese people, but has also in the past embraced much of East Asia including Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and other nations. .05. A Dichotomy or a Transition? (Return to Index) Nye’s position intersects at several points with the analysis of Manuel Castells, sociologist and the author of the encyclopedic multi-volume work, The Information Age: Economy, Society, and Culture.9 Nye’s argument follows in time upon that of Castells in that Castells wrote in 1996, Nye after September 11, 2002. But Nye’s position is ultimately grounded in an earlier tradition of “realist” definitions of power: Power used to be in the hands of princes, oligarchies, and ruling elites; it was defined as the capacity to impose one’s will on others. Modifying their behavior. This image of power does not fit with our reality any longer10… Castells spends far more time than does Nye considering the “Information Age.” In doing so, he perhaps has the advantage in contextualizing American power. His argument is also far more dynamic. To Castells, the Information Age is an ongoing process, which he considers from a number of perspectives. Nye believes that there are two dichotomous kinds of power: “hard” and “soft”. For Castells, there are not two kinds of power, but a still incomplete transition from one kind of power to another. For Castells, power is being permanently transformed; Nye’s hard power is eroding: states, even the most powerful one, the United States, now live in an environment marked by a decentralized net of “local terror equilibria.” 11 In the past, during the Cold War, several major states and their allies established an equilibrium based upon mutual assured destruction; this prevented any one power from dominating the global political or economic system, but it also protected each of the major states from the others. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union the United States then enjoyed a brief period of near absolute dominance. .06. American Power Following 9-11(Return to Index) But global processes had already distributed a variety of weapons of mass destruction among major and minor powers, and more importantly, among non-state actors as well. September 11, 2002, revealed the vulnerabilities of even the greatest of powers to non-state actors. The devastating effect of the low-cost and relatively simple improvised weapons that were used then suddenly illuminated a terrible new world. The use of a bacteriological weapon, Anthrax, then followed quickly upon the trauma of 9-11---so quickly that historians may well treat the two events as one. This attack revealed an additional and, to many, even more terrifying vulnerability and again showed the new power of non-state actors. Castells refers to these sorts of weapons, including chemical and biological ones, as well as the feared low-yield “dirty” nuclear devices sometimes referred to as “suitcase bombs” as “veto technologies” and presumes that this new decentralized web of great and small states and non-state actors will require constant small interventions by many different powers to maintain a relative peace. This seems to be an apt description of events since September 11 as a variety of alliances, states, and international organizations have joined the campaign against terrorism. There are, then, many indications that Castells is, to a considerable degree at least, correct in his analysis of state power in the Information Age, and Nye wrong. State power is evolving toward a decentralized fabric, like all else in the Information Age. .07. The Limitations of the Networked International System (Return to Index) There are also many indications that some in the American policy-making institutions understand the implications of a world like that described by Castells. Recently (March, 2002), the Pentagon report “The Nuclear Posture Review” discussed conditions under which the United States might use nuclear weapons. This analysis immediately attracted a great deal of attention because it suggested the first-strike employment of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear powers. Since the end of World War II such use has been presumed to be outside the parameters of civilized warfare, and particularly outside American nuclear doctrine. But times have changed. As stated by one reporter, Michael Gordon, “Another theme in the report is the possible use of nuclear weapons to destroy enemy stocks of biological weapons, chemical arms and other arms of mass destruction.” 12 These are, of course, precisely the “veto technologies” listed by Castells.13 The limitation in the current international system is probably most critically, from an American point of view, that it tends to restrain unilateral American action. As a result, great attention necessarily must be paid to alliances and coalition building. But if anything terrifies the international community it is the specter of nuclear war, or the possibility of a return to a Cold War system with its attendant enormous expenses and the inherent threat of destruction. .08. The Nuclear Posture Review (Return to Index) The “Nuclear Posture Review” represents the Bush administration’s attempt to break the bonds that presently restrains American power: first-strike use of nuclear weapons effectively removes the need to consult allies. It amounts to an attempt to restore the brief period of absolute domination (and absolute security) enjoyed by the U.S. following the fall of the Soviet Union, before we had become aware of the terrible new forces that could be employed by “rogue states” and criminal organizations such as Al Quaeda. If the United States were to be successful in putting the terrorist genie back in the bottle by threatening nuclear strikes on states that both harbor terrorists and possess weapons of mass destruction, including most especially chemical and bacteriological ones, then Nye is, perhaps, correct: There are two sorts of power and the United States can continue to enjoy a near monopoly of classical “hard” power. But Nye, like Castells, recognizes that “under the influence of the information revolution and globalization, world politics is changing in a way that means Americans cannot achieve all of their international goals acting alone.”14 The uproar, both domestic and international over the implications of the “Nuclear Policy Review” is evidence of the essential accuracy of Castell’s analysis.15 Once again, the United States has discovered the limits of state autonomy in a networked </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Among scholars, practitioners, and political leaders with any sort of cosmopolitan perspective it is conventional to speak of a gap between the institutions of global governance and the transnational challenges of the twenty-first century. Though this is one way of framing the challenge,1 a useful alternative is to see gaps as one of the bad outcomes currently produced by global governance as we have defined it. Whether seen as causal or consequential, there is certainly a gap today between the dramatic new challenges flaring up in the early years of the century and the international system of institutions, norms, processes, and actors that has haltingly evolved to meet them. Even a mild optimist looking far down the avenue of the twenty-first century can envision a world fraught with widening and deepening poverty, episodic pandemics, frequent eruptions of furious internal conflicts, proliferation of small arms and weapons of mass destruction, the spread of organized criminal and terrorist enterprises, and devastating environmental, economic, and social effects of climate change. Although the global future is not necessarily a neo-Malthusian catastrophe, we fear it will be unless global governance evolves in ways that enable key actors collectively to address these unparalleled international challenges. If norms, institutions, processes, and actors’ perceptions of identity and interest were beyond the reach of collective human will, then no doubt there would be clear and present dangers to the very survival of the human project in a recognizable and morally tolerable form. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">This example shows the importance of SSA to the military instrument of power (IOP), but the United States (U.S.) relies on SSA to support all IOPs. According to the current U.S. National Space Policy, countries that “effectively utilize space will enjoy added prosperity and security and will hold a substantial advantage to those who do not.” 5 Space-based communications allow one country to affect another country’s economy because of information passed through space. This same communication path allows a country to influence how another country’s populace view their own government. These space-dependent communications link the space domain to both the Economic and Information IOPs. The U.S. derives its Diplomatic power from the other IOPs. Consequently, space, and therefore SSA, is fundamental to the U.S. IOPs. President George W. Bush entrusts the DOD with maintaining SSA for the U.S. Government. 6 While maintaining the joint aspect of SSA, the Department of Defense identified the AF “as Executive Agent for Space.” 7 Based on this policy, the entire U.S. Government depends on the AF to provide SSA to support all of the U.S. IOPs. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Space is a hostile environment. The phenomena resulting from solar emissions can negatively impact the operation of any space system. However, the space environment is better understood today than ever before, but the sun’s activity is continuous and always producing phenomena that will put the operational mission of any space system at risk. This makes space weather monitoring and forecasting a critical mission in regards to space assets. Without the ability to monitor and forecast space weather phenomena, our satellites would become vulnerable which ultimately puts our national security at risk. The discussion that follows provides a discussion of space weather phenomena and impacts, space weather monitoring and forecasting user needs, capability gaps resulting from the dismantled NPOESS program, and the potential solutions offered by small satellites. “The primary force in our corner of the universe is our sun. The sun is constantly radiating enormous amounts of energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum containing x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, and radio waves. The sun also radiates a steady stream of charged particles – primarily protons, electrons, and neutrons – known as the solar wind. [18]” When the energy and charged particles impact the Earth’s atmosphere they interact with spacecraft. The effect of these interactions can negatively impede the operation of the spacecraft. “Space weather effects have the most impact on communications, Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). [4]” For example, solar energetic particles accelerated by a coronal mass ejection (CME) or solar flare can damage electronics onboard spacecraft through induced electric currents, as well as threaten the life of astronauts. Also, changing geomagnetic conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in Low Earth orbit. The space weather effects will always present a threat to the operational mission of those systems. The forces that protect our country’s national security and interests rely on those systems. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that information on the space environment is of paramount interest to the war fighter [18]. The impacts resulting from the three main categories of solar emissions are summarized in Table 5. Since space weather can produce negative effects on spacecraft, there is clearly a need to understand, monitor, and forecast space weather. The military, commercial, and civil sectors have spacecraft performing missions ranging from data collection supporting the national security of the United States to providing GPS directions to millions of travelers across the country. In June 1999 the “Space Weather Architecture Study” was completed to evaluate the ability of the projected baseline support system to mitigate space weather impacts [4]. The study identified and assessed the operational impacts that would be caused by space weather effects. Today the report still serves as a starting point when developing a space architecture that directly studies space weather or uses the data collected to provide support to other space systems. The significance of these impacts is best illustrated by our reliance on space systems. The role of satellite operations has expanded to include an active role in addition to a support role [4]. For example, “In the future, terrestrial weapons will be directly targeted using space” [4]. The Space Weather Architecture Study stated “future National Security operations will require improved capability to accurately locate targets, provide precision navigation, and provide reliable mobile communications in a more time-constrained environment” [4]. Today, over ten years later, our dependence on space systems remains at a critical level providing evidence that it is equally critical to not only monitor and forecast space weather but also to better design satellites to resist these impacts. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The AF has some SSA capabilities, but complete SSA is difficult to obtain. The Milstar example highlights AF SSA on its own systems, but complete SSA requires considerably more information. To achieve complete SSA, the AF needs knowledge of much more than its own systems or even that of the sister services. Beyond the status of U.S. space systems, SSA includes space intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) data as well as analysis of the space environment.8 Given today’s strategic environment, SSA must help diagnose problems when surprise is the norm and the threats are less predictable.9 In this reality, the AF requires additional SSA capabilities to gain knowledge of adversary systems and intent as well as the space environment to diagnose future problems. From a resource and capability perspective, obtaining adequate SSA of all space objects is difficult. For example, the increasingly diminutive nature of future satellites complicates the space ISR problem. Taken in total, obtaining SSA for the U.S. Government is a daunting task for the AF. Additional SSA capabilities are also necessary to remedy future space events because not all of them will be easy to diagnose or remedy. In the Milstar example, the diagnosis was a misaligned spot beam; the solution was to move the spot beam back in place.10 This was relatively simple problem to diagnose and remedy; unfortunately, harder problems exist. Consider the recent Chinese test of an Anti-satellite (ASAT) system.11 For the ASAT test, U.S. detected a missile launch from China and found a debris cloud in the location of a satellite.12 Since China’s ASAT weapon was ground launched, the diagnosis attributes China as the originator of the test. This problem has two solutions. First, preventing future ASAT tests, and second, avoiding the resulting debris cloud. The first solution for future Chinese ASAT tests is 2 AU/ACSC/1464/AY07 much more difficult; it will require all of the U.S. IOPs. For the second solution, the U.S. will rely on SSA to characterize the debris cloud to minimize space object collisions with this cloud. This ASAT event would have been even more difficult to diagnose and remedy if it originated from another satellite. In the 2030 timeframe, satellites may attack other satellites.13 How will the AF diagnose and attribute future space events so the U.S. can remedy the situation? What if the diagnosis shows the attack occurred from a region in space? How will the U.S. be able to attribute the attack to facilitate the use of its IOPs against the perpetrator? The U.S. can only answer these questions with complete SSA. In particular, the U.S. needs knowledge of small objects and the ability to enhance satellite intelligence collection. This leads to a capability question. How will the U.S. increase small object awareness and enhance object satellite intelligence collection to improve SSA in the 2030 timeframe to support all U.S. IOPs? One way the AF can increase space debris and satellite awareness to diagnose and attribute a satellite-to-satellite attack is placing a fleet of active sensor systems in to orbit. Using lasers as the active source, these systems can locate smaller objects and enhance SSA.Developing fluoride fiber lasers as the active source for these systems will significantly reduce the size and the weight of the laser while allowing multi-spectral imagery of the space object. This paper recommends the AF investigate infrared and visible fluoride fiber lasers as the active source for a fleet of small satellites to increase SSA by tracking and imaging objects as small as 0.1 centimeter (cm). </span><br />

<span class="Underline">CHINA ASAT I took the news of the recent Chinese anti-satellite test with great alarm, but not surprise. For some time now I have been concerned that China and others are developing capabilities that pose a serious threat to U.S. space assets and our ability to use space. I spoke at a conference in Omaha this past October and emphasized that protecting our capabilities and interests in space is more important than ever, given the threats I saw on the horizon combine with our ever-increasing dependence on space. On January 11th, the Chinese launched a medium range ballistic missile into space. It targeted an aging Chinese weather satellite orbiting 500 miles above the planet. The kill vehicle rammed into the target satellite sending out thousands of pieces of debris into orbit of varying sizes, and speeds, up to 1,400 miles per hour, according to Air Force Space Command. This debris is significant and has the potential to stay in orbit for years to come. The U.S., with its space surveillance network, will bear the long-term responsibility for warning others of potential collisions, including foreign and commercial operators, and ironically, the Chinese. I remember seeing a picture of the Space Shuttle window after a paint chip collided with it at over 17,000 miles per hour. Particles a few centimeters in length are large enough to cause major damage. I don't want to imagine what a collision would look like between one of our satellites and a piece of the destroyed Chinese weather satellite. A more likely result is that the Shuttle, International Space Station, and our satellites will need to expend precious fuel to maneuver around debris. At some point, our satellite operators will do the math and determine the loss of &quot;mission life&quot; due to this extra fuel use and maneuvering. This could be a sizeable impact when we're talking about multi-billion dollar satellites and no &quot;hot spares.&quot; While some have said that we should not be overly worried about this event, I believe this is a clear wake-up call for the Administration, Congress, and the American people. I have asked the Administration to devote more attention and resources to the protection of our space-based assets. The United States has more satellites in orbit than any other nation and, as such, we are more dependent upon their reliable presence to provide us with everything from A-T-M card transactions to battlefield intelligence. This is a significant, and reckless, act by the Chinese. While the Chinese have firmly denied any mal intent in their recent test, I can only look to their other activities and remain highly skeptical. Apparently, this single test is part of a series of direct-ascent ASAT tests, which is part of a broader effort to develop counter-space capabilities. This is consistent with their larger military modernization and advanced technology efforts. A similar observation was made in the recent report by the bi-partisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. China has been a student of U.S. space operations dating back to Operation Desert Storm. China knows all too well the advantage space offers the U.S., as well as the vulnerabilities that exist in that area. China's military planners have advocated the use of technology that would deny us access to our space assets; a tactic which would be consistent with what many consider China's unofficial doctrine of asymmetric warfare. This begs the strategic question, why did they conduct the A-SAT test, and what do they hope to achieve? We have not seen an ASAT test in over 20 years. At the height of the Cold War, both the U.S. and the Soviets had ASAT capabilities, but we both understood that a satellite attack could mean nuclear war. Today, the implications of an attack that persisted in the Cold War seem to have diminished. In the past few years, we've seen a handful of GPS and satellite communications jamming incidents with few repercussions for the perpetrators. What is most troubling is that these attacks are coming in a period of widespread use of GPS, satellite communications and space-based imagery. Today's environment has changed. This group knows all too well how important satellites are to our armed forces, policy-makers, environment, and the economy. Frankly, many of you have been helpful in educating members of Congress and the public on this. Last June, as chairman of the Strategic Forces subcommittee, I held a hearing to better understand our military and economic dependence on space. General Kehler, vice-commander of STRATCOM, provided several examples of how space capabilities are integral to the daily execution of virtually every military campaign, operation, and exercise involving U.S. forces today. On the commercial side, the director of the Satellite Industries Association estimated that space contributes 90 billion dollars annually to the global economy. Not only has space become essential to modern warfare, it has established itself as a permanent utility in our global commerce. The much talked about Chinese A-SAT test is but one of a range of potential threats looming on the horizon, including jamming, laser &quot;dazzling,&quot; micro-satellites, direct ascent A-SATs, cyber attacks, physical attacks to ground stations, and possibly even a nuclear explosion. Our satellites are also vulnerable to less malicious threats including space debris, which I mentioned earlier, close approaches, solar flares, and severe weather damaging ground stations. As a national security space community, and as a nation, we have a vested stake in protecting our interests in space. This includes both the need to protect our space systems and preserve our assured use of space. The Chinese A-SAT is but one striking example of why I believe this issue requires urgent attention. Based on my discussions with senior military leaders, I do not believe we have the necessary resources to address these threats, contrary to what some have argued. First and foremost, we need to continue to develop space situational awareness capabilities. As we learned on 9-11, seemingly benign systems can have severe hidden offensive capabilities. An object that appears to be orbital debris or a research satellite may, in fact, be an A-SAT targeted at U.S. or friendly assets. Likewise, noise in a data link may be accidental interference or intentional jamming. We are limited in what we can do in space without knowing what is going on up there, and being able to attribute a hostile event to the right actor. We also need to examine various options to increase the survivability of our space capabilities. This includes rapid replenishment, redundancy, hardening, distributed architectures, alternatives such as U-A-Vs, active and passive measures, reversible and non-reversible means, and non-material solutions. I have hope for one solution in particular. The 2007 defense bill authorized the Operationally Responsive Space program office. O-R-S offers promise not only as a way to supplement a battlefield commander's capabilities, but also to quickly replace damaged or destroyed satellites to meet the immediate needs of the warfighter. In addition, O-R-S might also serve as a deterrent to nations pursuing programs to threaten our satellites. If we have numerous O-R-S systems in space along with more traditional military and intelligence satellites, then we can rapidly reconstitute our space assets. This makes it a lot harder for an adversary to effectively deny us our space-based capability. Here is where I ask for help from the space architecture experts here today. S-S-A and options for protecting our space assets must be looked in total and weighed as part of a space protection strategy. These include: How threat assessments are incorporated into the requirements process and, in turn, acquisition programs; What is the right mix of S-S-A and protection capabilities and how do these capabilities fit together; and Recognizing we will not be able to protect, nor can we afford to protect, all systems to the same level, how should we prioritize what to protect. Lastly, what implications does this incident have on our future space architecture? Specifically, what will we buy, how will we buy, and where will we fly? The Chinese A-SAT test also rekindles a larger policy discussion on how we use space and how we protect our interests in space. I understand there are differences of opinion here. Some have argued for arms control measures which ban &quot;space weapons.&quot; I'll be frank with this group. I do not normally support arms control measures. In the space arena where satellites can have offensive capabilities, I find it would extremely difficult to verify and enforce any arms control measures. More to the point, we don't have a clear definition of &quot;space weapons,&quot; that we can all agree on which makes it difficult to engage in meaningful debate. Here is my definition. A space weapon could be a kinetic or directed energy source going from ground-to-space, air-to-space, or space-to-space and vice-versa. It could also include an attack against a ground station, which I would argue is equally effective on satellite operations as threats in space. If you use this definition, then space is already &quot;weaponized.&quot; I look forward to this debate. We've spent the last few years setting the stage. I believe in leaving all options on the table and discussing their merits. I want to avoid seeing us limit our options in space. These threats and our vulnerabilities are real. I've said it before. I believe we should defend our space assets and use of space by any means necessary. Space is too important to our national security and economy not to.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The United States maintains a catalog for space objects that are larger than about 10 cm in diameter, and this catalog currently contains about 20,000 objects, of which debris constitutes a majority (Kehler, 2010; Space Track, undated). In addition, NASA estimates that there are an additional 500,000 objects between 1 and 10 cm, and that there are likely tens of millions of particles smaller than a centimeter (Orbital Debris Program Office, undated). These smaller objects pose some of the greatest risk to orbiting payloads. As Johnson notes, “[T]he principal threat to space operations is driven by the smaller and much more numerous uncatalogued debris” (Johnson, 2010). In LEO, objects have velocities of 7 or 8 km/s with respect to the ground, which means that even small particles can impart a tremendous amount of energy if they collide with another object. This threat is especially sobering because most small particles are uncataloged.2 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent stales. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level. Pollins (20081 advances Modclski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous shocks such as economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power (see also Gilpin. 19SJ) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the risk of miscalculation (Fcaron. 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately. Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level. Copeland's (1996. 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that 'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. He argues that interdependent states arc likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, if the expectations of future trade decline, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Mom berg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write. The linkage, between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict lends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other (Hlomhen? &amp; Hess. 2(102. p. X9&gt; Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blombcrg. Hess. &amp; Wee ra pan a, 2004). which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. &quot;Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect. Wang (1996), DcRoucn (1995), and Blombcrg. Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force arc at least indirecti) correlated. Gelpi (1997). Miller (1999). and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that Ihe tendency towards diversionary tactics arc greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked lo an increase in the use of force. In summary, rcccni economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict al systemic, dyadic and national levels.' This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The scale of social needs, including the need for expanded productive activity, has grown so large that it cannot be shut off at all, and certainly not abruptly. It cannot even be ratcheted down in any significant fashion without producing serious harms to human societies and hundreds of millions of people. Even if it were possible to shift back to systems of local self-sufficiency, the consequences of the transition process would be catastrophic for many people and even deadly to the point of continual conflict, resource wars, increased poverty, and strife. What are needed are concrete, workable, and pragmatic strategies that produce effective and intelligently designed economic activity in specific contexts and, while seeking efficiency and conservation, place economic and social justice high on a list of priorities.60 The imperative of economic growth applies not only to the needs and expectations of people in economically developed societies but also to people living in nations that are currently economically underdeveloped. Opportunities must be created, jobs must be generated in huge numbers, and economic resources expanded to address the tragedies of poverty and inequality. Unfortunately, natural systems must be exploited to achieve this; we cannot return to Eden. The question is not how to achieve a static state but how to achieve what is needed to advance social justice while avoiding and mitigating the most destructive consequences of our behavior. Many developing country groups involved in efforts to protect the environment and resist the impacts of free trade on their communities have been concerned with the harmful effects of economic change. Part of the concern is the increased scale of economic activity. Some concerns relate to who benefits and who loses in the changing context imposed by globalization. These concerns are legitimate and understandable. So are the other deep currents running beneath their political positions, including those of resistance to change of any kind and a rejection of the market approach to economic activities. In the system described inaccurately as free market capitalism, economic activity not only breaks down existing systems, it creates new systems and-as Joseph Schumpeter observed-continually repeats the process through cycles of &quot;creative destruction.&quot;61 This pattern of creative destruction unfolds as necessarily and relentlessly as does the birth-maturation-death-rebirth cycle of the natural environment. This occurs even in a self-sufficient or autarkic market system capable of managing all variables within its closed dominion. But when the system breaks out of its closed environment, the ability of a single national actor to control the system's dynamics erodes and ultimately disappears in the face of differential conditions, needs, priorities, and agendas. Globalization's ability to produce wealth for a particular group simultaneously produces harms to different people and interests and generates unfair resource redistribution within existing cultures. This is an unavoidable consequence of globalization.62 The problem is that globalization has altered the rules of operation of political, economic, and social activities, and in doing so multiplied greatly our ability to create benefit and harm.63 While some understandably want the unsettling and often chaotic effects of globalization to go away, it can only be dealt with, not reversed. The system in which we live and work is no longer closed. There are few contexts not connected to the dynamics of some aspect of the extended economic and social systems resulting from globalization. This means the wide ranging and incompatible variables of a global economic, human rights, and social fairness system are resulting in conflicts and unanticipated interpenetrations that no one fully understands, anticipates, or controls.64 Local self-sufficiency is the loser in this process. It can remain a nostalgic dream but rarely a reality. Except for isolated cultures and niche activities, there is very little chance that anyone will be unaffected by this transformational process. Change is the constant, and it will take several generations before we return to a period of relative stasis. Even then it will only be a respite before the pattern once again intensifies.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Those that operate satellite systems and are familiar with space operations know the difficulties in determining the exact cause of many satellite malfunctions or “anomalies.” It is oftentimes difficult if not impossible to determine if satellite failures or problems are due to an everyday system anomaly, a natural event caused by the harsh space environment, the result of unintentional interference, or due to a malicious attack. If the US fields weapons that can interfere with spacecraft, failures on adversary spacecraft may be attributed as a us attack even when no such attack occurred. This would obviously heighten tensions which could escalate into larger conflict, and be quite destabilizing. Moreover, this is already beginning to occur. According to a GAO report, in 1997 “Indonesia intentionally interfered with and denied the services of a commercial satellite belonging to the south pacific island kingdom of Tonga because of a satellite orbital slot dispute.” Attribution of this attack was easy because Indonesia admitted to the attack, but is not likely to be so easy for most cases. Accurate attribution may, however, be irrelevant in future cases where country A merely perceives that a satellite failure or denial is the result of an attack by rival country B. Whether or not an attack actually occurred, the result will be the same as if it had. Increased tensions between the two countries will result, and country A is likely to act/respond, causing a counter reaction by country B and so on. In the end, there will be no proof that the failure was simply a system anomaly, an actual attack by country B, or possibly even an attack by a third party, country C, to instigate a conflict between A and B for their own purposes. Once measures are employed against these spacecraft, it also sets an international precedent for the use of such systems as an accepted, legal form of warfare. One can only expect proliferation of these systems and their use to become more common, as seen in the Indonesian case and others that have occurred since that time. Most importantly, the mere development and deployment of these systems starts the US down the slippery slope of offensive space strategy that may have serious, negative, unintended consequences that make it harder for the us to protect its own systems and access to space. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The answer is, none. The next question is whether a space-based asset is worth the cost. At nearly $1 billion, Wright and Lewis question whether SBSS is worth the cost. Tracking objects from space can be done by radar or visibly, by looking for their reflected light from the sun. The reflected light method works but is restricted by cloud cover and requires darkness. Radar works well for objects in low-Earth orbit but its pulses cannot detect objects in geostationary orbits. So each has its drawbacks, although as the UCS writers note, the biggest threats to human space activity from debris are in LEO, not GEO. Claiming that SBSS will “revolutionize” the Air Force’s ability to track objects in space, as an Air Force official has, “sounds a bit exaggerated,” they say. Similarly, they dispute a Boeing fact sheet that “the SBSS system will revolutionize the nation’s Space Situational Awareness by [be] detecting and monitoring dimmer, most distant objects than ever before.” But they have a broader objection concerning the limits of space-based sensors. “Sensors that are small enough to launch into space are much smaller than ground-based sensors, so that ground-based sensors are more sensitive and are able to detect and track much dimmer objects,” they say. “As a result, SBSS will not give the U.S. the capability to detect and track any objects that it can’t see already.&quot;</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Current and near-term SSA capability is not effective for the small space object[s] threat in 2030. The SSN, comprised of radar and telescopes, cannot detect space objects as small as 25 AU/ACSC/1464/AY07 0.1 cm. Basing a telescope in space, like MSX or SBSS, can overcome environmental limitations, but these systems do not meet the 2030 technological requirements. While radar does not have any environmental limitations, the technology of radar limits small object detection. These limitations create a technological imperative for change. Laser technology does not have the limitation of radar; lasers can track and collect information about objects smaller than 0.75 cm. A laser placed in space eliminates the shortcomings imposed by the atmosphere. With a fluoride fiber laser, laser design and alignment are simpler in a smaller, more lightweight package. Having more military utility than chemical or bulk solid-state lasers, fluoride fiber lasers are also capable of producing multiple wavelengths from a single device making them the best laser source to enhance SSA capability A conceptual SSA system using a fluoride fiber laser would provide near real-time ISR data about small space objects. By using a passive optical sensor and a LIDAR sensor, the conceptual SSA system provides data to diagnose and attribute situations in space. However, effective use of this system requires near real-time control for immediate tasking. This system has merits in all three future scenarios generated by a multi-national organization. All scenarios require the ability to locate and track small objects to reduce collisions with space debris and small satellites, only the motivation for and use of small satellites changes in the scenarios. By enabling detailed SOI and near real-time ISR collection, the conceptual SSA system supports the creation of another county’s space order of battle. The system enables the U.S. to diagnose, defend, and attribute a space event to another country’s satellite and triggers either an offensive counterspace response or the application of other IOPs to remedy the situation. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The shortcomings of radar have to do with the technology itself. Even though radar has excellent capabilities to track objects in space regardless of atmospheric weather and the time of day, the amount of power used and the wavelength of radar limit its ability to see small objects in space. 26 This limit occurs because objects smaller than the wavelength do not affect the returned signal. As a result, radar can only see objects about 0.75 cm or larger. 27 This technological shortcoming holds regardless of whether the radar is looking for space objects from the ground, from the air, or from space. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">Given the importance of a responsive space infrastructure to space assurance, arguments in favor of such capabilities must be improved and refocused to show they also satisfy strategic and long-term needs, and serve as good economic investment. Cost-effective access can best be achieved by deploying resilient, more populous, and less-complex satellite constellations. Leveraging such architecture, individual spacecraft components could be designed and developed to be less capable, and reliable, than systems dependent on a single or small number of satellites. Reliability would be gained through redundancy. Mission and cost savings advantages could be gained through shortened development cycles that allow for spirally-developed block versions of each platform, its payload(s) and other parts of the system. Increasing the numbers of satellites on-orbit would give the economies of scale needed to support spacelift innovation and encourage investment by the commercial sector. Architectures developed for responsive small satellite systems should be able to effectively use rapidly evolving technology and process innovations. Miniaturization of components in small satellites now offers sophisticated capabilities useful for a wide variety of operational and science and technology missions, and can give the needed flexibility for designing large constellation mission architectures. LEO, multi-plane Walker constellations, insertion of multiple satellites on each launch, selection of mature technology readiness level (TRL) sensor or communication payloads and buses, block acquisition approaches, simplified platforms and busses, and common mission control and ground systems can all be employed. Constellations of simple multi-mission, combined communication-sensor satellites can be developed and deployed to achieve cost-efficient acquisition goals. Commercial and international communities are already deploying smaller, shorter-life, yet capable satellites with streamlined mission control architectures; these approaches are already cost-effectively satisfying mission needs. Acquirers must seize upon the best approaches. National security missions are amenable to LEO and small satellite systems—communications, reconnaissance, missile warning and defense, and weather. As we have seen with GPS, OrbComm, and Iridium systems, large constellations of small satellites can be effectively managed and perform vital missions; they employ well-designed Walker Constellations to provide ubiquitous 24/7 coverage of much of the globe. By operating under a concept of employment that envisions regular, not infrequent or as-needed, replenishment of space systems, decisions makers would potentially have sufficient numbers of systems on hand, or in storage, to sustain rapid reconstitution or augmentation of capabilities in response to an attempted space ‘‘Pearl Harbor’’ or other national emergency. LEO could be selected, so that on mission completion systems are de-orbited in a relatively short period of time compared to present systems in higher orbits, reducing space debris problems. Other secondary benefits could be secured with such a sustainment strategy—the U.S. aerospace industrial base, which has been suffering lately, could be re-energized with acquisition strategies that require continuous engineering improvements and innovations to large constellation space systems. This could ensure that the United States Government, and industrial and commercial base, is adequately capitalized and led, to be able to ‘‘develop and accelerate programs for rapid launch of satellites, to reconstitute lost systems, or bolster constellations in times of crisis.’’88 Costs for responsive space will be difficult to contain, while the underlying industrial base struggles to sustain, re-define, and improve itself.89 Employing large constellation acquisition, operations, and sustainment approach could provide the cost imperatives, effectiveness, resiliency, and opportunity to reconstitute that base. Thus, a responsive infrastructure would also serve as a vital part of a space assurance strategy.</span><br />

Since most antisatellite programs are classified, they are likely to continue in some form or another with or without norms (e.g., there will be a strong temptation to “cheat”), but this is not a new problem in arms control.

<span class="Underline">Verification and governance are crucial to the success of any space security treaty. A violation of its provisions could undermine the purposes of the agreement. In the context of outer space, there are two types of verification: adequate and effective. Although the differences between the two are not spelled out, it is generally understood that effective verification entails stricter requirements and more rigorous inspections.35 Adequate, however, is a verification standard consistent with the standard needed to wage war in outer space.36 Essentially, in order to conduct physical conflict in space, one would need to be able to discern between military and civilian targets (as required by the Geneva Conventions).37 Moreover, in the absence of a ban on space weapons, militaries would be required to have robust space situational awareness in order to maintain a targeting list of possible threats. This ability to discriminate between military and civilian targets, or to establish an order of priority for targets based on their ability to harm other objects, can also be used as a verification standard for ensuring that space-based weapons are never deployed. The first step toward a robust verification and governance system is a collection of robust SSA systems. As discussed above, it is important to know what functions objects perform in outer space, who is in control of them, what orbits they occupy and how they behave in these orbits. This knowledge will not only act as a deterrent to the weaponization of space, but also reduce the risk of accidental collisions or interference.38 The independent SSA systems of China, the Russian Federation and the United States could become the basis for Regional Space Operation Centres (RSpOCs) that would each maintain extensive knowledge of what activities are taking place in outer space on a real-time basis. These RSpOCs could serve as a form of clearing house, in which sufficient space information would be made available to other states in a format that is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of these three major space powers. As every state will have a significant relationship with at least one of these powers, every spacefaring state could gain access to the necessary and sufficient information for its safe and sustainable use of outer space. This would be particularly true were both China and the Russian Federation to make similar data available to third parties as the United States currently does under its Commercial and Foreign Entities project.39 Looking forward, these RSpOCs, enhanced by Joint Data Exchange Centres established among them, could serve as the foundation for the multilateral verification of a space security treaty.40 The second step toward a robust verification and governance system for space security is an executive council established under a space security treaty designed to report to the UN Security Council on compliance matters relating to the treaty. This executive council could serve as a basis for consultations concerning both compliance and whether or not a given satellite qualifies as a weapon based on its design and behaviour. This sort of governance system would be much more mutually beneficial and adhere to the spirit of Article IX of the OST, in contrast to a system of deterrence and tit-for-tat reprisals which may, in turn, lead to an arms race in outer space. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Introduction The purpose of verification is to increase confidence in the implementation of a treaty. An effective verification system reliably detects non-compliance and allows abiding states to credibly demonstrate their compliance. It can also deter non-compliance, depending also on the strength of enforcement measures within the treaty. Verification is necessary for an effective treaty in that it provides an objective trigger for enforcement measures and legitimizes those measures when they are implemented. In the context of space security, official multilateral treaty verification is necessary for three further reasons. The first is the hazardous nature of the space environment. There are natural and man-made threats to satellites and spacecraft that can cause temporary or permanent damage, including solar radiation and orbital debris. Without a verification system it is difficult to credibly distinguish between natural causes of satellite failure and the effects of weapons use. The second emerges from dual use problems of space verification technology: unilateral monitoring activities by individual states may be interpreted as offensive in nature and potentially provoke a protection-negation arms race. For example, a close-proximity flyby to inspect a satellite could easily be interpreted as an interception attempt or surveillance for military advantage. The only way to engage in such sensitive activities in a non-provocative manner is to do so multilaterally. Third, there are many dozens of state and commercial actors with space assets, yet current capabilities for knowing what is happening in space are limited to only a handful of states. This means that verification of any allegations of illicit space weapon deployment or use is at the moment dependent upon the national technical means (NTM) of a select few. Verification of a space weapons ban is technically possible. It may also not be as expensive as some analysts have suggested if it can leverage existing and emerging technologies and exploit synergies between verification methods. The primary determining factors for the design of a verification system are: the scope of the treaty being negotiated; the level of confidence deemed necessary to assure compliance (e.g. guaranteed 100% detection vs. 60% certainty); and the level of intrusiveness politically palatable to negotiators (e.g. limited vs. anytime, anywhere on-site inspections). The last two factors are subjective and dependent on the larger international political environment, and therefore each country must determine for itself what level of confidence and intrusiveness it desires and how such levels will influence the effectiveness of its desired treaty design. Answers to these questions will then help determine the acceptable level of cost. Verification has been left out of some proposals for space weapons treaties due to its perceived complexity and divergent views about its effectiveness. To assist in negotiation and decision-making, however, verification measures related to proposed treaty elements can and should be described ahead of time. This paper attempts to outline an encompassing framework, to be strengthened with further research, which can be flexibly applied to varying treaty requirements. For each potential treaty design there can be multiple layers of verification, allowing negotiators to balance cost, intrusiveness and 2 effectiveness to provide the optimum level of confidence possible within the current context. The framework also highlights potential synergies between verification methods to increase confidence and cost-effectiveness.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Space Situational Awareness (SSA)is vital to the United States of America. More than any other country, the U.S. utilizes space for military command and control, military and civilian navigation, communications, intelligence, and a host of other applications (Rumsfeld 9). Knowing what is orbiting our planet and the orbits in which those objects are located is essential to maintaining those capabilities. To date, most efforts in detecting, tracking and cataloging objects in orbit have been carried out by earthborn means. Radar emplacements like The Fence track every object of sufficient size that passes overhead, then update the catalogues in a more or less automated fashion. Other radar and optical sites can track orbiting objects as they pass within their fields of view, and some can even locate objects as far out as the GEO belt. Unfortunately, each of these methods requires the object to be tracked to pass overhead. Any object in an orbit that does not do so cannot be tracked. For instance, The Fence cannot track anything in an inclination low enough not to cross it. Furthermore, most of these methods require a tracked object to be correlated to a launch in order to identify the object. Any significant maneuver while out of sight of a ground station could easily generate an uncorrelated track. The limitations of earthborn sensors grow out of three facts. First, any such sensor must be, by definition, on the ground. The highest piece of ground is only 8.85 km above sea level, and is hardly an ideal location for building anything. Most satellites, on the other hand, have a perigee at or above 600 km, due to atmospheric drag considerations. Thus, to be useful, any such sensor must be able to detect objects at least that far away. Second, the range of orbits visible to any given site is constrained by its physical location. Furthermore, many such sensors require multiple passes before a solid track is developed, and all require periodic revisits to maintain their tracks. Mobile sensors can help to alleviate the first problem, but not the second, since moving them to cover different orbits would cause them to lose track on those objects spotted previously. There 2 are also practical and political issues with the placement of such systems. A given location may be ideally situated to observe a particular range or orbits, but it may present a challenging environment for constructing and operating such a system. Other locations may be ideal both positionally and environmentally, but may be controlled by someone who would prefer not to have a space observation sensor located there. Third, and of particular concern for optical systems, though not inconsequential to radars, is the fact that any earthborn system must look up through the atmosphere. The atmosphere distorts, disperses, reflects and absorbs various electromagnetic wavelengths to different degrees.</span><br />

<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 12pt;"> Interest in international space cooperation is not new. International cooperation has been an important and long-standing hallmark of the US national space policies. International cooperation and associated multinational operations have been important components of an effective global engagement strategy to assure access to space capabilities for the US, its allies, and partners. The US engages in a wide range of such activities, notbecause of their benign nature but rather they are in its best national interests to do so. US collaborative efforts have been part of the space age since its beginning. Cooperation allows space-faring states to combine resources and reduce risk; improve efficiency; expand diplomatic engagement; and enhance prestige of engaged states, improve political sustainability of space projects, and provide workforce stability. With the end of the Cold War, space and Earth science research and space exploration activities are no longer con by an overarching competition between superpowers. The George H. W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and now Obama administrations have each attempted to capitalize on the post Cold War opportunities and leverage the expertise of other nations. The US scientific community has entered into a new multi-polar world, creating diverse international space alliances and partnerships. The Obama administration supports this trend by reaching out to growing global space powers like India and China, both emerging economic and engineering powerhouses. It hopes such engagement will shape their future space, engineering and political activities in positive ways. The US has also reached out to old friends. For example, Secretaries of State and Defense, Clinton and Robert M. Gates, have announced the Australians will be more fully integrated into US space situational awareness activities. 7 The sentiments to support international cooperation and collaboration are growing and evolving, much more so than in past policy declarations. Participants expect international projects will generate a calculus that one plus one will equal three— that diverse resources, skills, and technologies of the partners will provide synergy, adding up to more than the sum of their parts. 8</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 12pt;"> NASA, commercial, and European space activities have already achieved considerable success with their cooperative endeavors. 9 Fans of the new policy may think that the number of times “international cooperation” or “cooperation” is mentioned is very important. Yes, the new policy does contain numerous references to “cooperation.” Grand pronouncements and simplistic interpretation of the number of references relating to cooperation are not enough. The old and current reality is that cooperative programs are expensive, difficult at times to resource, and many times very hard to manage. Shrewd partners know that the direction to engage in cooperation is not worth much unless tied to real money and programs.Potential and even current partners arethus taking a judicious wait and see attitude to the new policy. They have been closely watching the US space politics for well over 50 years and will not act rashly. Changing their business plans to respond to fickle US executive and legislative international cooperative initiatives could be considered too much risk to assume.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 12pt;"> Successful international cooperation is not easily achieved. Considering the space debris, SSA, collision avoidance, and TCBM foundational pointsidentified above, the new policy provides no thought guideposts on how to proceed. The new policy cries out for a strategy to obtain these goals.Knowledgeable diplomats and policy analysts understand that US government agencies do not always support policy directives. This creates uncertainty and unpredictability for potential partners who are considering cooperative ventures with the US. For example, one need only look to the fight over acquiring space imaging via the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) broad area space-based imagery collection (BASIC) satellite system against using a commercial remote sensing solution. The Office of the Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics objected to the proposed BASIC acquisition suggesting the NRO was not following US Commer-37 High Frontier cial Remote Sensing Policy which provided the US would first look to the commercial community to satisfy its remote sensing needs.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 12pt;"> 10 The NRO position to acquire the system despite the policy eventually prevailed within the interagency. 11 Then Congress interceded, pointing again to the Commercial Remote Sensing Policy. It refused to fund the system. 12 A new space strategy must anticipate comparable bureaucratic foot-dragging to cooperation initiatives and associated reforms. The implementing strategy must advocate changes in laws and regulations to better enable international cooperation. The Arms Export Control Act and its associated International Traffic in Arms Regulations still stymie US and international interests in cooperation. The strategy must also anticipate that many in the US security community will not see cooperation as a benefit.</span><br />

<span style="background-color: white; font-size: 12pt;"> The new policy does not adequately confront the point that many US space professionals still have difficulty spelling “international cooperation.” They have a historical bias to first look to integrate international capabilities on a US platform, rather than comprehensively plan and employ an integrated approach. A strategy needs to enable the US space community to internalize an appreciation of the opportunities that international cooperative programs offer. One of the authors participated in a recent conference panel presentation on the “role of international cooperation” with senior NASA and industry officials where it was difficult to get the other speakers to discuss or mention any international component to their program activities. These officials, while very earnest and capable, felt much more comfortable just talking to the US components of their program portfolios. In due time, a winning international cooperation effort will require the entire US space community to fully embrace the concept</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The framework to strengthen SSA, said General Helms, is found in the new National Space Policy, released by President Barack Obama last summer. A key element to the policy is international cooperation. &quot;We must partner with other nations and enterprises to achieve mutually beneficial goals and at the top of our priorities is the development of comprehensive SSA,&quot; she said. &quot;The National Space Policy encourages international cooperation and in pursuit of this goal we will surely break new ground.&quot; Among the reasons why this is important, explained General Helms, is that better SSA allows those who operate in space to make more fully informed and therefore safer decisions, while also removing the mistrust and misperceptions that can lead to mishaps and misunderstandings. The National Space Policy acknowledges that no single nation has the resources or geography to precisely track every object in space. &quot;It directs us to collaborate with other nations, the private sector and intergovernmental organizations to improve our space situational awareness - specifically to enhance our shared ability to rapidly detect, warn of, characterize and attribute natural and man-made disturbances to space systems,&quot; said General Helms. &quot;There are many technical and operational details that have to be worked out before we at JFCC-Space could begin incorporating data from allies and partners, but we are definitely moving in that direction.&quot; JFCC-Space currently has 19 formal standing SSA sharing agreements with private industry to provide advanced tailored SSA services in support of safe space flight operations. As a result of the JSpOC's vigilance, satellite owners maneuvered their satellites 126 times last year to avoid collisions with other satellites or on-orbit debris. &quot;The United States is committed to safe, responsible and peaceful uses of space. Public provision of space situational awareness data through the SSA Sharing Program is evidence of the U.S. government's commitment to provide SSA data to the world, free of charge, in order to enhance safe and responsible space operations and promote transparency,&quot; said General Helms. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thank you for your kind introduction. It is a pleasure to participate in this UNIDIR space security conference and this panel on “Ongoing Processes &amp; Proposals, Next Steps.” My hope today is that our discussion will help inform much of the work we are pursuing to strengthen security and stability in space, and so I’m here to learn as much as I am here to offer remarks. My colleague, Ambassador Laura Kennedy, spoke at last year’s conference and gave a prelude to our new National Space Policy which at that time had not yet been released. The new policy was released in June 2010. Consistent with the President’s guidance in the policy, we are pursuing measures to strengthen security and stability in space. That is what I would like to discuss with you today, and more precisely, how we can strengthen security and stability through shared space situational awareness, called “SSA” for short, and through transparency and confidence building measures, or TCBMs. Why is SSA important to space security? A long-standing principle of U.S. national space policy is that all nations have the right to explore and use space for peaceful purposes, and for the benefit of all humanity, in accordance with international law. Strengthening stability in space fundamentally depends on having awareness and understanding as to who is using the space environment, for what purposes, and under what environmental conditions. The U.S. National Space Policy directs us to collaborate with other nations, the private sector, and intergovernmental organizations to improve our SSA – in other words, to improve our shared ability to rapidly detect, warn of, characterize, and attribute natural and man-made disturbances to space systems. Having this information as early as possible and as accurately as possible is critical for a number of reasons. First, it is critical to NASA, our International Space Station partners, and all spacefaring nations, where human spaceflight safety is of the utmost importance. Second, it is critical for U.S. and allied security – indeed, everyone’s security – to enable us to detect, identify, and attribute actions in space that are contrary to responsible and peaceful use. And third, given the growing dependence we all have on space-derived information, it is critical to our global economies. Cooperation to Prevent Collisions Having information enables us to achieve SSA. However, “awareness” alone is insufficient. We also need to know what to actually do with that vital information – how do we make it “actionable” information? The challenges of increasing congestion in space – over 60 nations with varying interests now operate in space; we are tracking over 22,000 objects, there are 1,100 active systems, and hundreds of thousands of smaller objects we can’t see – and the growing complexities of operating there safely and responsibly, lead to the challenge of collision avoidance. One way that international cooperation enhances SSA is the information exchange between satellite owners and operators to prevent collisions. The United States provides notifications to other governments and commercial satellite operators of potentially hazardous conjunctions between orbiting objects. The State Department also plays a crucial role in this activity because international cooperation is necessary to ensure that we have robust situational awareness of the space environment – no one nation has the resources to be able to do this alone. The State Department continues to be extremely supportive of U.S. Strategic Command’s efforts to establish SSA sharing agreements with foreign satellite operators and to facilitate rapid notifications of potential space hazards. The United States is constantly seeking to improve its ability to share information with other spacefaring nations as well as with our commercial sector partners. For example, at State we are currently reaching out to all spacefaring nations to ensure that the Joint Space Operations Center, or JSpOC, has current contact information for both government and private sector satellite operations centers. Those efforts include ongoing discussions with Russia on measures to enhance safety for robotic space missions as well as for human spaceflight. SSA Cooperation Across the United States Government, we are supporting numerous multilateral and bilateral engagements in SSA. For example, the United States is collaborating with our friends and allies in Europe as they consider developing their own SSA system. We are collaborating with the Department of Defense to engage in technical exchanges with experts from the European Space Agency, the European Union, and individual ESA and EU Member States to ensure our existing and planned SSA systems contribute to a more comprehensive situational awareness picture to ensure the safety, stability, and security of the space domain. In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense has signed bilateral SSA statements of principles with Canada, France, and Australia. Looking ahead, the United States also sees opportunities for cooperation on SSA with other nations around the globe. SSA benefits all responsible spacefaring nations. International “Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities” Another challenge we all face is promoting responsible and peaceful behavior in space. Meeting this challenge depends not only on taking positive steps, both unilaterally and multilaterally, to enhance the sustainability of space activities, but also conducting those activities in an open and transparent manner. Upon their implementation, some TCBMs also have the potential of enhancing our knowledge of the space environment, thereby strengthening security and stability in space. For instance, the United States is continuing to consult with the European Union on its initiative to develop a comprehensive set of multilateral TCBMs, also known as the international &quot;Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities.&quot; We hope to make a decision in the near term as to whether the United States can sign on to this Code, including what, if any, modifications would be necessary. An example where a Code of Conduct could contribute to our shared SSA is its political commitment to provide notifications in a timely manner of malfunctions that might place space objects at risk, as well as any accidents or collisions that might have taken place. The United States is already following such practices – as we did when we promptly notified Russia through diplomatic channels when we detected the collision of a commercial Iridium satellite with an inoperable Russian military spacecraft in February 2009. This experience is contributing to our ongoing dialogue with Russia on developing additional concrete and pragmatic bilateral TCBMs that will enhance spaceflight safety. Non-legally binding measures such as the proposed Code could build on our existing practices as well as U.S. and allied SSA capabilities by mitigating the risk of mishaps, misperceptions, and mistrust. Cooperation on “Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities” Another initiative is the multi-year study of “long-term sustainability of space activities” within the Scientific and Technical Sub-Committee of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). This effort will be forming an experts group to address SSA and space operations. In addition, a separate experts group will examine space weather, which is also an important aspect of SSA. We are hopeful that this effort will lead to the formation of voluntary “best practice guidelines,” which will help reduce operational risks to all space systems. In addition to drawing on the expertise of government experts, this working group also will draw upon the background, experience and best practices that have been developed by commercial satellite operators. Conclusion SSA is essential to strengthen security and stability in space and sustainability of our space activities. To this end, the United States is striving to improve our ability to monitor, track, and provide notifications regarding space objects. However, everyone’s picture of the space environment is greatly enhanced through international cooperation and shared SSA. Furthermore, strengthening security and stability in space is in everyone’s interests. It can be achieved through pursuing TCBMs that promote responsible behavior and the peaceful use of space. Examples of this cooperation include initiatives such as the EU’s proposal for an international Code of Conduct and the COPUOS Agenda Item on Long-Term Sustainability. Such cooperation with established and emerging members of the spacefaring community and with the private sector will help to preserve the space environment for the benefit of all nations and future generations. Thank you. I look forward to your questions and our discussion.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Independently, SSA key to information and ISR</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Berkowitz ’07 – Former Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Space Policy (Marc J, “Protecting America’s Freedom of Action in Space,” March, The High Frontier Journal, Vol. 3, Num. 2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070322-103.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070322-103.pdf</a>)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Policy-makers will want answers to a series of questions in order to help comprehend the situation and authorize responses to an attack on a US space asset. Military commanders and defense planners should expect, among other things, to be asked: Who committed the hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent? What is the nature of the attack? What are the consequences? When will we recover disrupted or lost capability? Where did the attack originate? How conclusive is the evidence of an attack? Why did the attack happen—what is the purpose of the attack? The ability to make a determination of hostile act or intent and answer such questions, of course, will depend upon US intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities for space situational awareness (SSA). The transition from space surveillance to a more capable SSA should lead the intelligence community and force providers to deliver enhanced capabilities for indications and warning (I&amp;W), attack reporting, ISR and targeting support for space operations, and space environmental monitoring. Improved ISR is, of course, fundamental to strengthening our SSA capabilities, enhancing I&amp;W, and being able to attribute the source of an attack. The lack of improved SSA for characterization and attribution will constrain policy and operational responses. </span><br />

<strong><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Specifically, LIDAR technology key – best measurements and information</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The second sensor necessary for the collection of space ISR data relies on Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). This sensor provides reconnaissance and surveillance data. Using a LIDAR concept allows measurements of the distance, speed, rotation, and chemical 13 AU/ACSC/1464/AY07 composition of an illuminated object.53 For example, the distance from the SSA satellite to a space object provides the object’s current position. Using LIDAR also provides considerable information about an object in space, especially if the laser wavelength is in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This part of the spectrum allows for the direct measurement of optical characteristics of the object.54 This sensor combination captures data for space ISR. The data provided by the conceptual SSA system supports the diagnosis and attribution of space events. The passive optical sensor records the object’s orientation, which provides clues to a satellite’s current mission. Similarly, the satellite’s rotation and chemical composition, provided by the LIDAR sensor, provides space ISR. The rotation information could indicate either the satellite’s mission or its current tasking, and the chemical composition of the object may provide indications of the satellite’s mission or, if the object is space debris, could help identify a way to eliminate it. This information could diagnose and attribute a space event to a space debris collision or a satellite action taken by its owner.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Control of the space segment will be vital for the conceptual SSA system because near real-time tasking is necessary for diagnosing and attributing anomalies in space. Control enables the satellite to look at a particular object to collect additional SSA information. This tasking must be available in near real-time to respond to the potentially dynamic threats of 2030. If a U.S. satellite experiences an anomaly, this constellation must rapidly collect dataon space objects to diagnose the situation. Based on this data, the AF can attribute the anomaly to the appropriate cause; if caused by another satellite, the U.S. can then use the appropriate IOPs to remedy the situation. The ability to make this diagnosis and attribution relies on control. The ground station’s command and control must be responsive to the changing space situation and be able to attribute the cause of an anomaly.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Intel key to soft power diplomacy – that leads to cooperation with Russia and China</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nye 1996 (“America’s Information Edge” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foriegnaffairs.com/articles/51840/joesph-s-nye-jr-and-william-a-owens/americas-information-edge" rel="nofollow">http://www.foriegnaffairs.com/articles/51840/joesph-s-nye-jr-and-william-a-owens/americas-information-edge</a>)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Knowledge, more than ever before, is power. The one country that can best lead the information revolution will be more powerful than any other. For the foreseeable future, that country is the United States. America has apparent strength in military power and economic production. Yet its more subtle comparative advantage is its ability to collect, process, act upon, and disseminate information, an edge that will almost certainly grow over the next decade. This advantage stems from Cold War investments and America's open society, thanks to which it dominates important communications and information processing technologies--space-based surveillance, direct broadcasting, high-speed computers--and has an unparalleled ability to integrate complex information systems. This information advantage can help deter or defeat traditional military threats at relatively low cost. In a world in which the meaning of containment, the nuclear umbrella, and conventional deterrence have changed, the information advantage can strengthen the intellectual link between U.S. foreign policy and military power and offer new ways of maintaining leadership in alliances and ad hoc coalitions. The information edge is equally important as a force multiplier of American diplomacy, including &quot;soft power&quot;--the attraction of American democracy and free markets. The United States can use its information resources to engage China, Russia, and other powerful states in security dialogues to prevent them from becoming hostile. At the same time, its information edge can help prevent states like Iran and Iraq, already hostile, from becoming powerful. Moreover, it can bolster new democracies and communicate directly with those living under undemocratic regimes. This advantage is also important in efforts to prevent and resolve regional conflicts and deal with prominent post--Cold War dangers, including international crime, terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and damage to the global environment. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">ISR and SSA sharing key to soft power coalition building – that means global cooperation </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Owens and Nye 1996 William A. and Joseph S., America’s Information Age, Foreign Affairs Vol. 75 Issue 2, p20-36 Joe Nye is a professor at Harvard</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The core of these capabilities--dominant situational knowledge--is fungible and divisible. The United States can share all or part of its knowledge with whomever it chooses. Sharing would empower recipients to make better decisions in a less-than-benign world, and should they decide to fight, they could achieve the same kind of military dominance as the United States. These capabilities point to what might be called an information umbrella. Like extended nuclear deterrence, they could form the foundation for a mutually beneficial relationship. The United States would provide situational awareness, particularly regarding military matters of interest to other nations. Other nations, because they could share this information about an event or crisis, would be more inclined to work with the United States. The beginnings of such a relationship already exist. They were born in the Falklands conflict and are being developed today in the Balkans. At present, the United States provides the bulk of the situational awareness available to the Implementation Force, the U.N. Protection Force, NATO members, and other nations involved in or concerned with the conflict there. It is possible to envision a similar central information role for the United States in other crises or potential military confrontations, from clarifying developments in the Spratly Islands to cutting through the ambiguity and confusion surrounding humanitarian operations in Cambodia and Rwanda. Accurate, real-time, situational awareness is the key to reaching agreement within coalitions on what to do and is essential to the effective use of military forces, whatever their roles and missions. As its capacity to provide this kind of information increases, America will increasingly be viewed as the natural coalition leader, not just because it happens to be the strongest but because it can provide the most important input for good decisions and effective action for other coalition members. Just as nuclear dominance was the key to coalition leadership in the old era, information dominance will be the key in the information age. All this implies selectively sharing U.S. dominant battlespace knowledge, advanced C4I, and precision force. Old-era thinking might recoil from such a prospect, and it would have to overcome long-established prejudices against being open and generous with what might broadly be called intelligence. In the past, two presumptions supported this reluctance: first, that providing too much of the best information risked disclosing and perhaps even losing the sources and methods used in obtaining it, and second, that sharing information would disclose what the United States did not know and reduce its status as a superpower. These assumptions are now even more questionable than before. The United States is no longer in a zero-sum game that makes any disclosure of capabilities a potential loss for itself and a gain for an implacable opponent. The character of this growing prowess is different. For one thing, the disparity between the United States and other nations is quite marked. U.S. investment in ISR--particularly the high-leverage space-based aspects of this set of systems exceeds that of all other nations combined, and America leads by a considerable margin in C4I and precision force as well. It has already begun, systematically, to assemble the new system of systems and is well down the revolutionary path, while most nations have not yet even realized a revolution in military affairs is under way. Some other nations could match what the United States will achieve, albeit not as early. The revolution is driven by technologies available worldwide. Digitization, computer processing, precise global positioning, and systems integration the technological bases on which the rest of the new capabilities depend are available to any nation with the money and the will to use them systematically to improve military capabilities. Exploiting these technologies can be expensive. But more important, there is no particular incentive for those nations to seek the system of systems the United States is building--so long as they believe they are not threatened by it. This is the emerging symbiosis among nations, for whether another nation decides to make a race out of the information revolution depends on how the United States uses its lead. If America does not share its knowledge, it will add incentives to match it. Selectively sharing these abilities is therefore not only the route of coalition leadership but the key to maintaining U.S. military superiority. </span><br />

But in comparison with the cold war era, there are fewer incentives today for allies to cooperate with the U.S. During the earlier period unity and close coordination not only permitted military efficiencies but, more importantly, gave credibility to the American nuclear umbrella that protected the allies. Serious splits were dangerous because they entailed the risk that the Soviet Union would be emboldened. This reason for avoiding squabbles disappeared along with the USSR, and the point is likely to generalize to other unipolar systems if they involve a decrease of threats that call for maintaining good relations with the superpower. This does not mean that even in this particular unipolar system the superpower is like Gulliver tied down by the Lilliputians. In some areas opposition can be self-defeating. Thus for any country to undermine American leadership of the international economy would be to put its own economy at risk, even if the U.S. did not retaliate, and for a country to sell a large proportion of its dollar holding would be to depress the value of the dollar, thereby diminishing the worth of the country’s remaining stock of this currency. Furthermore, cooperation often follows strong and essentially unilateral action. Without the war in Iraq it is not likely that we would have seen the degree of cooperation that the U.S. obtained from Europe in combating the Iranian nuclear program and from Japan and the PRC in containing North Korea. Nevertheless, many of the</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">American goals depend on persuading others, not coercing them</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Although incentives and even force are not irrelevant to spreading democracy and the free market, at bottom this requires people to embrace a set of institutions and values. Building the world that the U.S. seeks is a political, social, and even psychological task for which unilateral measures are likely to be unsuited and for which American military and economic strength can at best play a supporting role. Success requires that others share the American vision and believe that its leadership is benign. </span><br />

There will be a natural process that somewhat vitiates the impact of American soft power in any event as other information economies mature. For example, by 2010, Nye argues, there will be more Chinese Internet users than American ones.8 While American sites will remain very attractive, because of the fact that English has become the world’s second language, China too sits at the center of a linguistic empire that not only embraces the worldwide Diaspora of Chinese people, but has also in the past embraced much of East Asia including Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and other nations. .05. A Dichotomy or a Transition? (Return to Index) Nye’s position intersects at several points with the analysis of Manuel Castells, sociologist and the author of the encyclopedic multi-volume work, The Information Age: Economy, Society, and Culture.9 Nye’s argument follows in time upon that of Castells in that Castells wrote in 1996, Nye after September 11, 2002. But Nye’s position is ultimately grounded in an earlier tradition of “realist” definitions of power: Power used to be in the hands of princes, oligarchies, and ruling elites; it was defined as the capacity to impose one’s will on others. Modifying their behavior. This image of power does not fit with our reality any longer10… Castells spends far more time than does Nye considering the “Information Age.” In doing so, he perhaps has the advantage in contextualizing American power. His argument is also far more dynamic. To Castells, the Information Age is an ongoing process, which he considers from a number of perspectives. Nye believes that there are two dichotomous kinds of power: “hard” and “soft”. For Castells, there are not two kinds of power, but a still incomplete transition from one kind of power to another. For Castells, power is being permanently transformed; Nye’s hard power is eroding: states, even the most powerful one, the United States, now live in an environment marked by a decentralized net of “local terror equilibria.” 11 In the past, during the Cold War, several major states and their allies established an equilibrium based upon mutual assured destruction; this prevented any one power from dominating the global political or economic system, but it also protected each of the major states from the others. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Following the collapse of the Soviet Union the United States</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"> then </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">enjoyed a brief period of near absolute dominance</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">. .06. American Power Following 9-11(Return to Index) </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">But global processes had already distributed a variety of weapons of mass destruction among major and minor powers, and more importantly, among non-state actors </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">as well. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">September 11, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">2002,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> revealed the vulnerabilities of even the greatest of powers to non-state actors. The devastating effect of the low-cost and relatively simple improvised weapons that were used then suddenly illuminated a terrible new world.

Castells refers to these sorts of</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;"> weapons, including chemical and biological ones</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">, </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">as well as </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">the feared </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">low-yield </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">“dirty” </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">nuclear devices </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">sometimes referred to as “suitcase bombs” as “veto technologies” and presumes that this new decentralized web of great and small states and non-state actors </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">will require constant small interventions by many different powers to maintain a relative peace. This seems to be an apt description of events since September 11 as a variety of alliance</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">s, states, and international organizations </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">have joined the campaign against terrorism</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">. There are, then, many indications that Castells is, to a considerable degree at least, correct in his analysis of state power in the Information Age, and Nye wrong. State power is evolving toward a decentralized fabric, like all else in the Information Age. .07. The Limitations of the Networked International System (Return to Index) There are also many indications that some in the American policy-making institutions understand the implications of a world like that described by Castells. Recently (March, 2002), the Pentagon report “The Nuclear Posture Review” discussed conditions under which the United States might use nuclear weapons. This analysis immediately attracted a great deal of attention because it suggested the first-strike employment of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear powers. Since the end of World War II such use has been presumed to be outside the parameters of civilized warfare, and particularly outside American nuclear doctrine. But times have changed. As stated by one reporter, Michael Gordon, “Another theme in the report is the possible use of nuclear weapons to destroy enemy stocks of biological weapons, chemical arms and other arms of mass destruction.” 12 These are, of course, precisely the “veto technologies” listed by Castells.13 </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">The limitation in the current international system</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"> is probably </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">most critically, from an American point of view, that it tends to restrain unilateral American action. As a result, great attention necessarily must be paid to alliances and coalition building. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">But </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">if anything terrifies the international community it is the specter of nuclear war, or the possibility of a return to a Cold War system with its attendant enormous expenses and the inherent threat of destruction.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;"> .08. The Nuclear Posture Review (Return to Index) The “Nuclear Posture Review” represents the Bush administration’s attempt to break the bonds that presently restrains American power: first-strike use of nuclear weapons effectively removes the need to consult allies. It amounts to an attempt to restore the brief period of absolute domination (and absolute security) enjoyed by the U.S. following the fall of the Soviet Union, before we had become aware of the terrible new forces that could be employed by “rogue states” and criminal organizations such as Al Quaeda. If the United States were to be successful in putting the terrorist genie back in the bottle by threatening nuclear strikes on states that both harbor terrorists and possess weapons of mass destruction, including most especially chemical and bacteriological ones, then Nye is, perhaps, correct: There are two sorts of power and the United States can continue to enjoy a near monopoly of classical “hard” power. But Nye, like Castells, recognizes that “</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">under the influence of the information revolution and globalization, world politics is changing in a way that means Americans cannot achieve all of their international goals acting alone</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 12pt;">.”14 The uproar, both domestic and international over the implications of the “Nuclear Policy Review” is evidence of the essential accuracy of Castell’s analysis.15 Once again, the United States has discovered the limits of state autonomy in a networked </span></span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Among scholars, practitioners, and political leaders with any sort of cosmopolitan perspective it is conventional to speak of a gap between the institutions of global governance and the transnational challenges of the twenty-first century. Though this is one way of framing the challenge,1 a useful alternative is to see gaps as one of the bad outcomes currently produced by global governance as we have defined it. Whether seen as causal or consequential, there is certainly a gap today between the dramatic new challenges flaring up in the early years of the century and the international system of institutions, norms, processes, and actors that has haltingly evolved to meet them. Even a mild optimist looking far down the avenue of the twenty-first century can envision a world fraught with widening and deepening poverty, episodic pandemics, frequent eruptions of furious internal conflicts, proliferation of small arms and weapons of mass destruction, the spread of organized criminal and terrorist enterprises, and devastating environmental, economic, and social effects of climate change. Although the global future is not necessarily a neo-Malthusian catastrophe, we fear it will be unless global governance evolves in ways that enable key actors collectively to address these unparalleled international challenges. If norms, institutions, processes, and actors’ perceptions of identity and interest were beyond the reach of collective human will, then no doubt there would be clear and present dangers to the very survival of the human project in a recognizable and morally tolerable form. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This example shows the importance of SSA to the military instrument of power (IOP), but the United States (U.S.) relies on SSA to support all IOPs. According to the current U.S. National Space Policy, countries that “effectively utilize space will enjoy added prosperity and security and will hold a substantial advantage to those who do not.” 5 Space-based communications allow one country to affect another country’s economy because of information passed through space. This same communication path allows a country to influence how another country’s populace view their own government. These space-dependent communications link the space domain to both the Economic and Information IOPs. The U.S. derives its Diplomatic power from the other IOPs. Consequently, space, and therefore SSA, is fundamental to the U.S. IOPs. President George W. Bush entrusts the DOD with maintaining SSA for the U.S. Government. 6 While maintaining the joint aspect of SSA, the Department of Defense identified the AF “as Executive Agent for Space.” 7 Based on this policy, the entire U.S. Government depends on the AF to provide SSA to support all of the U.S. IOPs. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Space is a hostile environment. The phenomena resulting from solar emissions can negatively impact the operation of any space system. However, the space environment is better understood today than ever before, but the sun’s activity is continuous and always producing phenomena that will put the operational mission of any space system at risk. This makes space weather monitoring and forecasting a critical mission in regards to space assets. Without the ability to monitor and forecast space weather phenomena, our satellites would become vulnerable which ultimately puts our national security at risk. The discussion that follows provides a discussion of space weather phenomena and impacts, space weather monitoring and forecasting user needs, capability gaps resulting from the dismantled NPOESS program, and the potential solutions offered by small satellites. “The primary force in our corner of the universe is our sun. The sun is constantly radiating enormous amounts of energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum containing x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, and radio waves. The sun also radiates a steady stream of charged particles – primarily protons, electrons, and neutrons – known as the solar wind. [18]” When the energy and charged particles impact the Earth’s atmosphere they interact with spacecraft. The effect of these interactions can negatively impede the operation of the spacecraft. “Space weather effects have the most impact on communications, Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). [4]” For example, solar energetic particles accelerated by a coronal mass ejection (CME) or solar flare can damage electronics onboard spacecraft through induced electric currents, as well as threaten the life of astronauts. Also, changing geomagnetic conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in Low Earth orbit. The space weather effects will always present a threat to the operational mission of those systems. The forces that protect our country’s national security and interests rely on those systems. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that information on the space environment is of paramount interest to the war fighter [18]. The impacts resulting from the three main categories of solar emissions are summarized in Table 5. Since space weather can produce negative effects on spacecraft, there is clearly a need to understand, monitor, and forecast space weather. The military, commercial, and civil sectors have spacecraft performing missions ranging from data collection supporting the national security of the United States to providing GPS directions to millions of travelers across the country. In June 1999 the “Space Weather Architecture Study” was completed to evaluate the ability of the projected baseline support system to mitigate space weather impacts [4]. The study identified and assessed the operational impacts that would be caused by space weather effects. Today the report still serves as a starting point when developing a space architecture that directly studies space weather or uses the data collected to provide support to other space systems. The significance of these impacts is best illustrated by our reliance on space systems. The role of satellite operations has expanded to include an active role in addition to a support role [4]. For example, “In the future, terrestrial weapons will be directly targeted using space” [4]. The Space Weather Architecture Study stated “future National Security operations will require improved capability to accurately locate targets, provide precision navigation, and provide reliable mobile communications in a more time-constrained environment” [4]. Today, over ten years later, our dependence on space systems remains at a critical level providing evidence that it is equally critical to not only monitor and forecast space weather but also to better design satellites to resist these impacts. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The AF has some SSA capabilities, but complete SSA is difficult to obtain. The Milstar example highlights AF SSA on its own systems, but complete SSA requires considerably more information. To achieve complete SSA, the AF needs knowledge of much more than its own systems or even that of the sister services. Beyond the status of U.S. space systems, SSA includes space intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) data as well as analysis of the space environment.8 Given today’s strategic environment, SSA must help diagnose problems when surprise is the norm and the threats are less predictable.9 In this reality, the AF requires additional SSA capabilities to gain knowledge of adversary systems and intent as well as the space environment to diagnose future problems. From a resource and capability perspective, obtaining adequate SSA of all space objects is difficult. For example, the increasingly diminutive nature of future satellites complicates the space ISR problem. Taken in total, obtaining SSA for the U.S. Government is a daunting task for the AF. Additional SSA capabilities are also necessary to remedy future space events because not all of them will be easy to diagnose or remedy. In the Milstar example, the diagnosis was a misaligned spot beam; the solution was to move the spot beam back in place.10 This was relatively simple problem to diagnose and remedy; unfortunately, harder problems exist. Consider the recent Chinese test of an Anti-satellite (ASAT) system.11 For the ASAT test, U.S. detected a missile launch from China and found a debris cloud in the location of a satellite.12 Since China’s ASAT weapon was ground launched, the diagnosis attributes China as the originator of the test. This problem has two solutions. First, preventing future ASAT tests, and second, avoiding the resulting debris cloud. The first solution for future Chinese ASAT tests is 2 AU/ACSC/1464/AY07 much more difficult; it will require all of the U.S. IOPs. For the second solution, the U.S. will rely on SSA to characterize the debris cloud to minimize space object collisions with this cloud. This ASAT event would have been even more difficult to diagnose and remedy if it originated from another satellite. In the 2030 timeframe, satellites may attack other satellites.13 How will the AF diagnose and attribute future space events so the U.S. can remedy the situation? What if the diagnosis shows the attack occurred from a region in space? How will the U.S. be able to attribute the attack to facilitate the use of its IOPs against the perpetrator? The U.S. can only answer these questions with complete SSA. In particular, the U.S. needs knowledge of small objects and the ability to enhance satellite intelligence collection. This leads to a capability question. How will the U.S. increase small object awareness and enhance object satellite intelligence collection to improve SSA in the 2030 timeframe to support all U.S. IOPs? One way the AF can increase space debris and satellite awareness to diagnose and attribute a satellite-to-satellite attack is placing a fleet of active sensor systems in to orbit. Using lasers as the active source, these systems can locate smaller objects and enhance SSA.Developing fluoride fiber lasers as the active source for these systems will significantly reduce the size and the weight of the laser while allowing multi-spectral imagery of the space object. This paper recommends the AF investigate infrared and visible fluoride fiber lasers as the active source for a fleet of small satellites to increase SSA by tracking and imaging objects as small as 0.1 centimeter (cm).</span><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Space traffic control begins with a space surveillance capability and a variety of dedicated, contributing, and collateral radar and optical systems surveil outer space. These sensors, along with an associated command and control system, form a space surveillance network. Today there are over 21,000 space objects (that is, satellites, manned systems, and debris) being tracked. Space situational awareness (SSA) uses space surveillance information (which is largely concerned with observing what’s in space) to create a more useful understanding and awareness of what’s going on in space. Under the auspices of the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Sharing Program, first begun in 2004 as a pilot program to help ensure safe operations in space, U.S. Strategic Command provides SSA information to commercial and foreign nation “partners” within a limited set of conditions. This SSA information includes basic orbital parameters (called two-line element sets), as well as launch support and conjunction assessments based on a “High Accuracy Catalog.” Could the SSA Sharing Program evolve into in something more complex, like a space traffic control system? A space traffic control system would exceed SSA in cost, ambition, and benefit. If mature, it would provide a way to actively monitor, direct, and redirect space objects in order to help prevent them from running into one another. Such a space traffic control system would help mitigate the risk of collisions in space and while mitigating risk is a good thing (all other things being equal, which they never are) the cost of such mitigation much be balanced against the risks.</span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The growing number of satellite collisions and the danger posed by collision-debris to nuclear-powered satellites will increase the likelihood of a nuclear accident in space. The chief of Russia's Mission Control said in mid-February 2009 that debris from the Iridium 33-Cosmos 2251 satellite collision (in February 2009) will 'threaten numerous satellites.' Cold-War era satellites, although they 'were designed so that their nuclear fuel would survive a launch pad explosion relatively intact, all are vulnerable to breakup if involved in a sufficiently high-energy collision.' (</span></em>Orbital Debris - A Technical Assessment, <em>National Research Council</em>, 1995). <em>There is disagreement over what will happen to the orbits of the debris resulting from a collision with these satellites. Scientists quoted by the mainstream press say that the radioactive materials would not fall to Earth. One over-quoted Russian space expert said in February 2009 that in the event of such an accident 'radioactive fallout would pose no threat to Earth.' The National Academy Press's book titled</em> Orbital Debris - A Technical Assessment//, however, noted that 'Radioactive fragments...might re-enter the atmosphere sooner than they would have if the spacecraft had remained intact. These small fragments would burn up in the atmosphere, potentially resulting in a slight increase in the background health risk.' (p.91) This is what happened with Transit-5BN-3, for example, which added to the world burden of plutonium (all isotopes of radioactive plutonium) from atmospheric nuclear testing by a staggering four percent. The potential of a nuclear-satellite catastrophe was succinctly summarized in the February 2009 <span style="color: #0000f5;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://spacefellowship.com/News/?p=8204" rel="nofollow">article</a></span> 'The Problem of Space Junk' by RIA Novosti: 'The lurking threat of both Russian and American nuclear satellites is that, should they fall apart upon collision with space debris, vast expanses of near-Earth space would be contaminated. Additionally, if some of the fragments had a velocity after collision and destruction that was below orbital speed, they would fall out of orbit and pollute some parts of the Earth's surface. In the worst-case scenario, the atmosphere could be heavily contaminated.'<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Ironically, even as space has moved away from the center of American culture, it has become ever more integrated with the international system. Global space spending in 2009 reached approximately $262 billion, or 7 percent more than in 2008, despite the global recession. The largest share of that spending, at nearly $91 billion, was for commercial satellite services (communications, remote sensing, satellite positioning), followed by commercial infrastructure (at $84 billion), and spending by the United States government (at $64 billion).Direct spending, however, does not tell the whole story. Space systems lie at the heart of the global infrastructure for moving information, whether that data is collected from remote-sensing systems (such as weather satellites) and high-resolution remote-sensing systems (think Google Earth), or transmitted over communications satellites. Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites transmit precise timing signals, which are used to locate one's position on Earth, aid navigation, and time global financial transactions. A range of spacecraft are studying the planet and its functions, peering into deep space at the origins of the universe, and visiting other planets. Space systems and their applications contribute to efforts and advances in agriculture, development, resource allocation, disaster relief, education, and medicine. Even cable television programming is distributed by satellite.Increasingly, if one digs deeply enough into any economic activity in the 21st century, a space element will be involved. And as the world's most developed space power, the United States has led the way in integrating space into its economic foundations.</span><br />

Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215]</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent stales. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level. Pollins (20081 advances Modclski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous shocks such as economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power (see also Gilpin. 19SJ) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the risk of miscalculation (Fcaron. 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately. Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level. Copeland's (1996. 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that 'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. He argues that interdependent states arc likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, if the expectations of future trade decline, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Mom berg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write. The linkage, between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict lends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other (Hlomhen? &amp; Hess. 2(102. p. X9&gt; Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blombcrg. Hess. &amp; Wee ra pan a, 2004). which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. &quot;Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect. Wang (1996), DcRoucn (1995), and Blombcrg. Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force arc at least indirecti) correlated. Gelpi (1997). Miller (1999). and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that Ihe tendency towards diversionary tactics arc greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked lo an increase in the use of force. In summary, rcccni economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict al systemic, dyadic and national levels.' This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The scale of social needs, including the need for expanded productive activity, has grown so large that it cannot be shut off at all, and certainly not abruptly. It cannot even be ratcheted down in any significant fashion without producing serious harms to human societies and hundreds of millions of people. Even if it were possible to shift back to systems of local self-sufficiency, the consequences of the transition process would be catastrophic for many people and even deadly to the point of continual conflict, resource wars, increased poverty, and strife. What are needed are concrete, workable, and pragmatic strategies that produce effective and intelligently designed economic activity in specific contexts and, while seeking efficiency and conservation, place economic and social justice high on a list of priorities.60 The imperative of economic growth applies not only to the needs and expectations of people in economically developed societies but also to people living in nations that are currently economically underdeveloped. Opportunities must be created, jobs must be generated in huge numbers, and economic resources expanded to address the tragedies of poverty and inequality. Unfortunately, natural systems must be exploited to achieve this; we cannot return to Eden. The question is not how to achieve a static state but how to achieve what is needed to advance social justice while avoiding and mitigating the most destructive consequences of our behavior. Many developing country groups involved in efforts to protect the environment and resist the impacts of free trade on their communities have been concerned with the harmful effects of economic change. Part of the concern is the increased scale of economic activity. Some concerns relate to who benefits and who loses in the changing context imposed by globalization. These concerns are legitimate and understandable. So are the other deep currents running beneath their political positions, including those of resistance to change of any kind and a rejection of the market approach to economic activities. In the system described inaccurately as free market capitalism, economic activity not only breaks down existing systems, it creates new systems and-as Joseph Schumpeter observed-continually repeats the process through cycles of &quot;creative destruction.&quot;61 This pattern of creative destruction unfolds as necessarily and relentlessly as does the birth-maturation-death-rebirth cycle of the natural environment. This occurs even in a self-sufficient or autarkic market system capable of managing all variables within its closed dominion. But when the system breaks out of its closed environment, the ability of a single national actor to control the system's dynamics erodes and ultimately disappears in the face of differential conditions, needs, priorities, and agendas. Globalization's ability to produce wealth for a particular group simultaneously produces harms to different people and interests and generates unfair resource redistribution within existing cultures. This is an unavoidable consequence of globalization.62 The problem is that globalization has altered the rules of operation of political, economic, and social activities, and in doing so multiplied greatly our ability to create benefit and harm.63 While some understandably want the unsettling and often chaotic effects of globalization to go away, it can only be dealt with, not reversed. The system in which we live and work is no longer closed. There are few contexts not connected to the dynamics of some aspect of the extended economic and social systems resulting from globalization. This means the wide ranging and incompatible variables of a global economic, human rights, and social fairness system are resulting in conflicts and unanticipated interpenetrations that no one fully understands, anticipates, or controls.64 Local self-sufficiency is the loser in this process. It can remain a nostalgic dream but rarely a reality. Except for isolated cultures and niche activities, there is very little chance that anyone will be unaffected by this transformational process. Change is the constant, and it will take several generations before we return to a period of relative stasis. Even then it will only be a respite before the pattern once again intensifies.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is the second of two scenarios that consider how U.S. space weapons might create incentives for America’s opponents to behave in dangerous ways. The previous scenario looked at the systemic risk of accidents that could arise from keeping nuclear weapons on high alert to guard against a space weapons attack. This section focuses on the risk that a single accident in space, such as a piece of space debris striking a Russian early-warning satellite, might be the catalyst for an accidental nuclear war. As we have noted in an earlier section, the United States canceled its own ASAT program in the 1980s over concerns that the deployment of these weapons might be deeply destabiliz- ing. For all the talk about a “new relationship” between the United States and Russia, both sides retain thousands of nuclear forces on alert and con•gured to •ght a nuclear war. When briefed about the size and status of U.S. nuclear forces, President George W. Bush reportedly asked “What do we need all these weapons for?”43 The answer, as it was during the Cold War, is that the forces remain on alert to conduct a number of possible contingencies, including a nuclear strike against Russia. This fact, of course, is not lost on the Rus- sian leadership, which has been increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons to compensate for the country’s declining military might. In the mid-1990s, Russia dropped its pledge to refrain from the “•rst use” of nuclear weapons and conducted a series of exercises in which Russian nuclear forces prepared to use nuclear weapons to repel a NATO invasion. In October 2003, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov reiter- ated that Moscow might use nuclear weapons “preemptively” in any number of contingencies, including a NATO attack.44 So, it remains business as usual with U.S. and Russian nuclear forces. And business as usual includes the occasional false alarm of a nuclear attack. There have been several of these incidents over the years. In September 1983, as a relatively new Soviet early-warning satellite moved into position to monitor U.S. missile •elds in North Dakota, the sun lined up in just such a way as to fool the Russian satellite into reporting that half a dozen U.S. missiles had been launched at the Soviet Union. Perhaps mindful that a brand new satel- lite might malfunction, the of•cer in charge of the command center that monitored data from the early-warning satellites refused to pass the alert to his superiors. He reportedly explained his caution by saying: “When people start a war, they don’t start it with only •ve missiles. You can do little damage with just •ve missiles.”45 In January 1995, Norwegian scientists launched a sounding rocket on a trajectory similar to one that a U.S. Trident missile might take if it were launched to blind Russian radars with a high altitude nuclear detonation. The incident was apparently serious enough that, the next day, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated that he had activated his “nuclear football” – a device that allows the Russian president to communicate with his military advisors and review his options for launching his arsenal. In this case, the Russian early-warning satellites could clearly see that no attack was under way and the crisis passed without incident.46 In both cases, Russian observers were con•-dent that what appeared to be a “small” attack was not a fragmentary picture of a much larger one. In the case of the Norwegian sounding rocket, space-based sensors played a crucial role in assuring the Russian leadership that it was not under attack. The Russian command sys-tem, however, is no longer able to provide such reliable, early warning. The dissolution of the Soviet Union cost Moscow several radar stations in newly independent states, creating “attack cor-ridors” through which Moscow could not see an attack launched by U.S. nuclear submarines.47 Further, Russia’s constellation of early-warn-ing satellites has been allowed to decline – only one or two of the six satellites remain operational, leaving Russia with early warning for only six hours a day. Russia is attempting to reconstitute its constellation of early-warning satellites, with several launches planned in the next few years. But Russia will still have limited warning and will depend heavily on its space-based systems to provide warning of an American attack.48 As the previous section explained, the Penta- gon is contemplating military missions in space that will improve U.S. ability to cripple Russian nuclear forces in a crisis before they can execute an attack on the United States. Anti-satellite weapons, in this scenario, would blind Russian reconnaissance and warning satellites and knock out communications satellites. Such strikes might be the prelude to a full-scale attack, or a limited ef- fort, as attempted in a war game at Schriever Air Force Base, to conduct “early deterrence strikes” to signal U.S. resolve and control escalation.49 By 2010, the United States may, in fact, have an arsenal of ASATs (perhaps even on orbit 24/7) ready to conduct these kinds of missions – to coerce opponents and, if necessary, support preemptive attacks. Moscow would certainly have to worry that these ASATs could be used in conjunction with other space-enabled systems – for example, long-range strike systems that could attack targets in less than 90 minutes – to disable Russia’s nuclear deterrent before the Rus- sian leadership understood what was going on. What would happen if a piece of space debris were to disable a Russian early-warning satel-lite under these conditions? Could the Russian military distinguish between an accident in space and the •rst phase of a U.S. attack? Most Russian early-warning satellites are in elliptical Molniya orbits (a few are in GEO) and thus dif•cult to attack from the ground or air. At a minimum, Moscow would probably have some tactical warn-ing of such a suspicious launch, but given the sorry state of Russia’s warning, optical imaging and signals intelligence satellites there is reason to ask the question. Further, the advent of U.S. on-orbit ASATs, as now envisioned50 could make both the more dif•cult orbital plane and any warning systems moot. The unpleasant truth is that the Russians likely would have to make a judgment call. No state has the ability to de•nitively deter-mine the cause of the satellite’s failure. Even the United States does not maintain (nor is it likely to have in place by 2010) a sophisticated space surveillance system that would allow it to distinguish between a satellite malfunction, a debris strike or a deliberate attack – and Russian space surveillance capabilities are much more limited by comparison. Even the risk assessments for col-lision with debris are speculative, particularly for the unique orbits in which Russian early-warning satellites operate. During peacetime, it is easy to imagine that the Russians would conclude that the loss of a satellite was either a malfunction or a debris strike. But how con•dent could U.S. planners be that the Russians would be so calm if the accident in space occurred in tandem with a second false alarm, or occurred during the middle of a crisis? What might happen if the debris strike oc-curred shortly after a false alarm showing a mis-sile launch? False alarms are appallingly common – according to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) experienced 1,172 “moderately seri-ous” false alarms between 1977 and 1983 – an average of almost three false alarms per week. Comparable information is not available about the Russian system, but there is no reason to believe that it is any more reliable.51 Assessing the likelihood of these sorts of co- incidences is dif•cult because Russia has never provided data about the frequency or duration of false alarms; nor indicated how seriously early- warning data is taken by Russian leaders. More- over, there is no reliable estimate of the debris risk for Russian satellites in highly elliptical orbits.52 The important point, however, is that such a coincidence would only appear suspicious if the United States were in the business of disabling satellites – in other words, there is much less risk if Washington does not develop ASATs. The loss of an early-warning satellite could look rather ominous if it occurred during a period of major tension in the relationship. While NATO no longer sees Russia as much of a threat, the same cannot be said of the converse. Despite the warm talk, Russian leaders remain wary of NATO expansion, particularly the effect expan- sion may have on the Baltic port of Kaliningrad. Although part of Russia, Kaliningrad is separated from the rest of Russia by Lithuania and Poland. Russia has already complained about its decreas- ing lack of access to the port, particularly the uncooperative attitude of the Lithuanian govern- ment.53 News reports suggest that an edgy Russia may have moved tactical nuclear weapons into the enclave.54 If the Lithuanian government were to close access to Kaliningrad in a •t of pique, this would trigger a major crisis between NATO and Russia. Under these circumstances, the loss of an early-warning satellite would be extremely suspi-cious. It is any military’s nature during a crisis to interpret events in their worst-case light. For ex- ample, consider the coincidences that occurred in early September 1956, during the extraordinarily tense period in international relations marked by the Suez Crisis and Hungarian uprising.55 On one evening the White House received messages indicating: 1. the Turkish Air Force had gone on alert in response to unidenti•ed aircraft penetrat- ing its airspace; 2. one hundred Soviet MiG-15s were •ying over Syria; 3. a British Canberra bomber had been shot down over Syria, most likely by a MiG; and 4. The Russian •eet was moving through the Dardanelles. Gen. Andrew Goodpaster was reported to have worried that the con•uence of events “might trigger off … the NATO operations plan” that called for a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. Yet, all of these reports were false. The “jets” over Turkey were a •ock of swans; the Soviet MiGs over Syria were a smaller, routine escort returning the president from a state visit to Mos- cow; the bomber crashed due to mechanical dif•culties; and the Soviet •eet was beginning long-scheduled exercises. In an important sense, these were not “coincidences” but rather different manifestations of a common failure – human er- ror resulting from extreme tension of an interna- tional crisis. As one author noted, “The detection and misinterpretation of these events, against the context of world tensions from Hungary and Suez, was the •rst major example of how the size and complexity of worldwide electronic warning systems could, at certain critical times, create momentum of its own.” Perhaps most worrisome, the United States might be blithely unaware of the degree to which the Russians were concerned about its actions and inadvertently escalate a crisis. During the early 1980s, the Soviet Union suffered a major “war scare” during which time its leadership concluded that bilateral relations were rapidly declining. This war scare was driven in part by the rhetoric of the Reagan administration, forti•ed by the selective reading of intelligence. During this period, NATO conducted a major command post exercise, Able Archer, that caused some elements of the Soviet military to raise their alert status. American of•cials were stunned to learn, after the fact, that the Kremlin had been acutely nervous about an American •rst strike during this period.56 All of these incidents have a common theme – that confidence is often the difference between war and peace. In times of crisis, false alarms can have a momentum of their own. As in the second scenario in this monograph, the lesson is that commanders rely on the steady •ow of reli-able information. When that information flow is disrupted – whether by a deliberate attack or an accident – confidence collapses and the re- sult is panic and escalation. Introducing ASAT weapons into this mix is all the more dangerous, because such weapons target the elements of the command system that keep leaders aware, informed and in control. As a result, the mere presence of such weapons is corrosive to the con•dence that allows national nuclear forces to operate safely. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The answer is, none. The next question is whether a space-based asset is worth the cost. At nearly $1 billion, Wright and Lewis question whether SBSS is worth the cost. Tracking objects from space can be done by radar or visibly, by looking for their reflected light from the sun. The reflected light method works but is restricted by cloud cover and requires darkness. Radar works well for objects in low-Earth orbit but its pulses cannot detect objects in geostationary orbits. So each has its drawbacks, although as the UCS writers note, the biggest threats to human space activity from debris are in LEO, not GEO.Claiming that SBSS will “revolutionize” the Air Force’s ability to track objects in space, as an Air Force official has, “sounds a bit exaggerated,” they say. Similarly, they dispute a Boeing fact sheet that “the SBSS system will revolutionize the nation’s Space Situational Awareness by [be] detecting and monitoring dimmer, most distant objects than ever before.” But they have a broader objection concerning the limits of space-based sensors. “Sensors that are small enough to launch into space are much smaller than ground-based sensors, so that ground-based sensors are more sensitive and are able to detect and track much dimmer objects,” they say. “As a result, SBSS will not give the U.S. the capability to detect and track any objects that it can’t see already.&quot;</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Current and near-term SSA capability is not effective for the small space object[s] threat in 2030. The SSN, comprised of radar and telescopes, cannot detect space objects as small as 25 AU/ACSC/1464/AY07 0.1 cm. Basing a telescope in space, like MSX or SBSS, can overcome environmental limitations, but these systems do not meet the 2030 technological requirements. While radar does not have any environmental limitations, the technology of radar limits small object detection. These limitations create a technological imperative for change. Laser technology does not have the limitation of radar; lasers can track and collect information about objects smaller than 0.75 cm. A laser placed in space eliminates the shortcomings imposed by the atmosphere. With a fluoride fiber laser, laser design and alignment are simpler in a smaller, more lightweight package. Having more military utility than chemical or bulk solid-state lasers, fluoride fiber lasers are also capable of producing multiple wavelengths from a single device making them the best laser source to enhance SSA capability A conceptual SSA system using a fluoride fiber laser would provide near real-time ISR data about small space objects. By using a passive optical sensor and a LIDAR sensor, the conceptual SSA system provides data to diagnose and attribute situations in space. However, effective use of this system requires near real-time control for immediate tasking. This system has merits in all three future scenarios generated by a multi-national organization. All scenarios require the ability to locate and track small objects to reduce collisions with space debris and small satellites, only the motivation for and use of small satellites changes in the scenarios. By enabling detailed SOI and near real-time ISR collection, the conceptual SSA system supports the creation of another county’s space order of battle. The system enables the U.S. to diagnose, defend, and attribute a space event to another country’s satellite and triggers either an offensive counterspace response or the application of other IOPs to remedy the situation. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Increased space situational awareness will be an important component of being able to verify (to some degree) compliance with any norms or codes of conduct. Since most antisatellite programs are classified, they are likely to continue in some form or another with or without norms (e.g., there will be a strong temptation to “cheat”), but this is not a new problem in arms control. The current policy that anti-satellite research is allowable, but testing is not, may be the best starting point for any effort to constrain opponents, and situational awareness, by increasing the chances that a test would be detected, could reinforce norms. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Verification and governance are crucial to the success of any space security treaty. A violation of its provisions could undermine the purposes of the agreement. In the context of outer space, there are two types of verification: adequate and effective. Although the differences between the two are not spelled out, it is generally understood that effective verification entails stricter requirements and more rigorous inspections.35 Adequate, however, is a verification standard consistent with the standard needed to wage war in outer space.36 Essentially, in order to conduct physical conflict in space, one would need to be able to discern between military and civilian targets (as required by the Geneva Conventions).37 Moreover, in the absence of a ban on space weapons, militaries would be required to have robust space situational awareness in order to maintain a targeting list of possible threats. This ability to discriminate between military and civilian targets, or to establish an order of priority for targets based on their ability to harm other objects, can also be used as a verification standard for ensuring that space-based weapons are never deployed. The first step toward a robust verification and governance system is a collection of robust SSA systems. As discussed above, it is important to know what functions objects perform in outer space, who is in control of them, what orbits they occupy and how they behave in these orbits. This knowledge will not only act as a deterrent to the weaponization of space, but also reduce the risk of accidental collisions or interference.38 The independent SSA systems of China, the Russian Federation and the United States could become the basis for Regional Space Operation Centres (RSpOCs) that would each maintain extensive knowledge of what activities are taking place in outer space on a real-time basis. These RSpOCs could serve as a form of clearing house, in which sufficient space information would be made available to other states in a format that is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of these three major space powers. As every state will have a significant relationship with at least one of these powers, every spacefaring state could gain access to the necessary and sufficient information for its safe and sustainable use of outer space. This would be particularly true were both China and the Russian Federation to make similar data available to third parties as the United States currently does under its Commercial and Foreign Entities project.39 Looking forward, these RSpOCs, enhanced by Joint Data Exchange Centres established among them, could serve as the foundation for the multilateral verification of a space security treaty.40 The second step toward a robust verification and governance system for space security is an executive council established under a space security treaty designed to report to the UN Security Council on compliance matters relating to the treaty. This executive council could serve as a basis for consultations concerning both compliance and whether or not a given satellite qualifies as a weapon based on its design and behaviour. This sort of governance system would be much more mutually beneficial and adhere to the spirit of Article IX of the OST, in contrast to a system of deterrence and tit-for-tat reprisals which may, in turn, lead to an arms race in outer space. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Introduction The purpose of verification is to increase confidence in the implementation of a treaty. An effective verification system reliably detects non-compliance and allows abiding states to credibly demonstrate their compliance. It can also deter non-compliance, depending also on the strength of enforcement measures within the treaty. Verification is necessary for an effective treaty in that it provides an objective trigger for enforcement measures and legitimizes those measures when they are implemented. In the context of space security, official multilateral treaty verification is necessary for three further reasons. The first is the hazardous nature of the space environment. There are natural and man-made threats to satellites and spacecraft that can cause temporary or permanent damage, including solar radiation and orbital debris. Without a verification system it is difficult to credibly distinguish between natural causes of satellite failure and the effects of weapons use. The second emerges from dual use problems of space verification technology: unilateral monitoring activities by individual states may be interpreted as offensive in nature and potentially provoke a protection-negation arms race. For example, a close-proximity flyby to inspect a satellite could easily be interpreted as an interception attempt or surveillance for military advantage. The only way to engage in such sensitive activities in a non-provocative manner is to do so multilaterally. Third, there are many dozens of state and commercial actors with space assets, yet current capabilities for knowing what is happening in space are limited to only a handful of states. This means that verification of any allegations of illicit space weapon deployment or use is at the moment dependent upon the national technical means (NTM) of a select few. Verification of a space weapons ban is technically possible. It may also not be as expensive as some analysts have suggested if it can leverage existing and emerging technologies and exploit synergies between verification methods. The primary determining factors for the design of a verification system are: the scope of the treaty being negotiated; the level of confidence deemed necessary to assure compliance (e.g. guaranteed 100% detection vs. 60% certainty); and the level of intrusiveness politically palatable to negotiators (e.g. limited vs. anytime, anywhere on-site inspections). The last two factors are subjective and dependent on the larger international political environment, and therefore each country must determine for itself what level of confidence and intrusiveness it desires and how such levels will influence the effectiveness of its desired treaty design. Answers to these questions will then help determine the acceptable level of cost. Verification has been left out of some proposals for space weapons treaties due to its perceived complexity and divergent views about its effectiveness. To assist in negotiation and decision-making, however, verification measures related to proposed treaty elements can and should be described ahead of time. This paper attempts to outline an encompassing framework, to be strengthened with further research, which can be flexibly applied to varying treaty requirements. For each potential treaty design there can be multiple layers of verification, allowing negotiators to balance cost, intrusiveness and 2 effectiveness to provide the optimum level of confidence possible within the current context. The framework also highlights potential synergies between verification methods to increase confidence and cost-effectiveness.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The shortcomings of radar have to do with the technology itself. Even though radar has excellent capabilities to track objects in space regardless of atmospheric weather and the time of day, the amount of power used and the wavelength of radar limit its ability to see small objects in space. 26 This limit occurs because objects smaller than the wavelength do not affect the returned signal. As a result, radar can only see objects about 0.75 cm or larger. 27 This technological shortcoming holds regardless of whether the radar is looking for space objects from the ground, from the air, or from space</span><br />

In every women’s studies class I’ve taught here at PCC, and in many guest lectures about feminism I’ve given elsewhere, I use the “penetrate” versus “engulf” image to illustrate a basic point about the way in which our language constructs and maintains male aggression and female passivity. Even those who haven’t had heterosexual intercourse can, with only a small degree of imagination required, see how “envelop” might be just as accurate as “enter”. “A woman’s vagina engulfs a man’s penis during intercourse” captures reality as well as “A man’s penis penetrates a woman’s vagina.” Of course, most het folks who have intercourse are well aware that power is fluid; each partner can temporarily assert a more active role (frequently by being on top) — as a result, the language used to describe what’s actually happening could shift.Except, of course, in our sex ed textbooks and elsewhere, that shift never happens. If the goal of sex education is to provide accurate information to young people before they become sexually active, we do a tremendous disservice to both boys and girls through our refusal to use language that honors the reality of women’s sexual agency. We set young women up to be afraid; we set young men up to think of women’s bodies as passive receptacles. While changing our language isn’t a panacea for the problem of sexual violence (and joyless, obligatory intercourse), it’s certainly a promising start. As another part of my introductory lecture on language, I talk about “fuck”. I first dispell the urban legends that it’s an acronym (I’m amazed at how persistent the belief is that the word stands for “for unlawful carnal knowledge” or “fornication under the consent of the king”; I have students every damn year who are convinced the word is derived from one of those two sources.) I then ask at what age young people in English-speaking culture first encounter the word. Most of my students had heard the word by age five or six; many had started using it not long thereafter. I then ask how old they were when they realized that “fuck” has multiple meanings, and that its two most common uses are to describe intercourse and to express rage. There’s a pause at this point. Here’s the problem: long before most kids in our culture become sexually active, the most common slang word in the American idiom has knit together two things in their consciousness: sex and rage. If “fucking” is the most common slang term for intercourse, and “fuck you” or “fuck off” the most common terms to express contempt or rage, what’s the end result? A culture that has difficulty distinguishing sex from violence. In a world where a heartbreakingly high percentage of women will be victims of rape, it’s not implausible to suggest that at least in part, the language itself normalizes sexual violence. I challenge my students. I don’t ask them to give up all the satisfactions of profanity; rather I challenge them to think about words like “fuck” or “screw” and then make a commitment to confine the use of those words to either a description of sex (“We fucked last night”) or to express anger or extreme exasperation (“I’m so fucking furious with you right now!”) but not, not, not, both. Rage and lust are both normal human experiences; we will get angry and we will be sexual (or want to be) over and over again over the course of our lives. But we have a responsibility, I think, to make a clear and bright line between the language of sexual desire and the language of contempt and indignation. Pick one arena of human experience where that most flexible term in the English vernacular will be used, and confine it there. Words matter, I tell my students. We’re told over and over again that “a picture is worth a thousand words” — but we forget that words have the power to paint pictures in our minds of how the world is and how it ought to be. The language we use for sexuality, the words we use for rage and longing — these words construct images in our heads, in our culture, and in our lives. We have an obligation to rethink how we speak as part of building a more pleasurable, safe, just and egalitarian world.<br />

 The plan makes global cosmopolitanism – solves war<br />
Stuart 2009 [Jill, Dr . Jill Stuart is LSE Fellow in Global Politics in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics and Political Science, “Unbundling Sovereignty, Territory, and the State in Outer Space”, from Securing Outer Space, edited by Bormann and Sheehan]<br />
Regime theory provides a manner of analysing sovereignty as de-linked from territory. The next section addresses cosmopolitan sovereignty, focusing on the writings of David Held, which presents a normative approach that assumes teleological progress towards sovereignty as de-linked from the state. As such, this approach also provides a manner of unbundling Westphalian sovereignty, in a time of globalization and outer space exploration. The approach also considers how traditional conceptions of sovereignty not only apply to outer space, but how those conceptions may also be affecting the way political space and community (and thus sovereignty) is conceived in world politics . According to this approach, and in accordance with wider cosmopolitanism, individual human beings are the primary political agents in the system. Cosmopolitanism can be taken as the moral and political outlook that offers the best prospects for overcoming the problems and limits of classic and liberal sovereignty. It builds upon some of the strengths of the liberal international order, particularly its commitment to human rights, and democratic values that apply, in principle, to each and all. (Held 2002: 24) Exploring cosmopolitan sovereignty starts with the shift from classical (Westphalian) sovereignty to liberal sovereignty. For Held, the liberal sovereignty model represents an attempt to delimit political power and extend the liberal concern with limited government in the international sphere (2002: 1). One achievement of liberal sovereignty has been the effort to distribute resources not according to statehood, but rather based on the rights of individuals (2002: 15). The &quot;common heritage of mankind&quot; principle that developed for the high seas, and was later applied for treaties on Antarctica and outer space, is in part an embodiment of that effort. Common heritage approaches represent the exclusion of a right of appropriation; the duty to use resources in the interest of the whole of humanity; and the duty to explore and exploit resources for peaceful purposes (Held 2002: 15). Transnational issues that challenge the state's ability to rule within its own borders further inspire the movement away from classical sovereignty (Held 2002: 20). As international law codifies common heritage principles, and transnational issue areas undermine the state, the moral significance of the state itself is challenged, and states and societies are opened up to judgement by general, if not universal, standards (Held 2002: 20). It is this moral shift as well as the increased focus on humanity as a whole that represents movement from liberal to cosmopolitan sovereignty. However the need to govern areas such as outer space is not simply a practical, but also a philosophical issue, in not only practically reconsidering governance of transterritorial areas, but also considering their implications for community, identity and the organization of political space. Cosmopolitan sovereignty and outer space politics In relation to outer space, this approach to sovereignty opens up two areas for consideration. First, it warrants a discussion on the aspects of present outer space politics that can be understood as part of the shift to liberal and cosmopolitan sovereignty; and second it opens up the consideration of how outer space politics themselves may in fact be reinforcing through a feedback loop the sense of cosmopolitanism in wider world society,9 A liberal and cosmopolitan discourse exists in the wording of ourer space law, with the aforementioned clauses that outer space is &quot;the common province of mankind&quot; and &quot;for peaceful purposes&quot; (Outer Space Treaty, Article IV); based in the accepted principle that outer space is neutral territory; in suggesting that asuonauts are the &quot;envoys of all mankind&quot; (Search and Rescue Agreement, Article V), and that &quot;The exploration and use of the moon shall be the province of all mankind and shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development&quot; (Moon Treaty, Article 4). These laws can be seen as part of the movement rowards &quot;forms of regulation and law-making that creates powers, rights, and constraints that transcend the claims of nation-states and have far-reaching consequences in principle&quot; (Held 2002: 23-24). However the degree to which behaviour has followed these moral dictums, and will continue do so in the future, is not entirely clear. It is indicative that attempts to violate these laws are normally undertaken with justifications worded in the context of those laws. For example, attempts by eight equatorial states to claim sovereignty over portions of geosynchronous orbit were justified by asserting that the Ourer Space Treaty did not apply to that region (Bogota Declaration 1976). Weaponization in space has occurred based on the justification that &quot;peaceful purposes&quot; does not imply de-militarization, but only the absence of war. If) China has said it plans to mine the Moon, but, vaguely, for the benefit of all humanity&quot;. II Cases such as these could be interpreted as a weakness in the argument that cosmopolitanism sovereignty is nascent in outer space politics, in that states continue to undermine the principles underlying the wording of the laws. Or indeed it could be interpreted as validation of the treaties, in that actors feel that going beyond those rules must be justified in the context of the laws themselves. The second point raised by cosmopolitan sovereignty regards how outer space itself may be contributing to wider cognitive and societal shifts that generate a stronger sense of global community and common humanity (and hence cosmopolitanism), which is causing a shift away from Westphalian sovereignty. The concept of the Overview Effect (White 1987) suggests that outer space is playing a role in forcing into our collective social epistemes a greater sense of our common destiny and humanity. Cosmologist Carl Sagan described this as an awakening from our &quot;slumbering planetary consciousness&quot; (Sagan 1994: 215), which is forcing a reconsideration of our relationship to ourselves, and to the universe. The budding field of astrosociology further studies the ways in astrosocial phenomena (such as space exploration and space science) and society are related (Pass 2004) and mutually constitutive. The potential influence of outer space on collective mentalities is said to be achieved in various ways: through images of the Earth from space, which impact upon humans the ecological unity of our planet, and the arbitrariness of political boundaries; through the meta-experiences of astronauts which impact upon us the reality that humans can now go into space; through the role of satellites in connecting us through telecommunications; and shrinking time through real-time images (\XThite 1987) (a la rhe CNN effect). From this perspective, not only does outer space law embody liberal principles, but outer space activity itself may be contributing to a cosmopolitan shift that emphasizes the commonality of the human condition [our &quot;overlapping communities of fate&quot; (Held 2002: 35)}, and the arbitrariness of state-centered approaches to sovereignty. The need to cooperate on big science projects, combined with the planetary and cosmological perspectives that space exploration provides, powerfully demonstrate global interdependence, and thus potentially make the prospect of a code of universal moral conduct seem both required and justified. It can be pointed out that the root of &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot; and &quot;cosmology&quot; are the same &quot;cosmos&quot;, meaning &quot;order&quot; and &quot;universe&quot; .<br />

LIDAR key – solves climate models and leadership – U.S. needs to take the lead now<br />
Gast 8- David, NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA THESIS, “Lidar Design for Space Situational Awareness” September 2008<br />
In response to the National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Study Request for Information (RFI), we would like to propose a space-based Doppler winds LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) demonstration mission with a targeted launch date of 2011-2012. The mission will address our vital national needs for high-resolution global tropospheric wind observation, which will lead to improved long-range weather forecasting, more accurate hurricane landfall prediction,improved climate models, better battlefield environmental predictions for military operations, more accurate upper-tropospheric/lower-stratospheric winds for Air Force operations, and potential chemical-biological release trajectory prediction for homeland security operations.The launch of a space-based winds LIDAR demonstration mission in the 2011-2012 time frame is critical to enable operational winds LIDAR on the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite Systems (NPOESS) inthe 2015-2016 time frame. Global tropospheric wind profiles are the #1 unmet Environmental Data Record (EDR) of NPOESS. This is especially urgent since the US, as a world leader in space technology and Earth observation, is falling behind Europe and Japan inspace-based winds LIDAR development and deployment. As a result of strong government and private industry investment in the last 5-10 years, all key technologies for spacebased direct-detection Doppler winds LIDAR have reached Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 5-7.The cost of such a mission, estimated at about $200M, is clearly well justified based on its very strong national needs and significant societal benefits. There is a strong consensus in the operational agencies and user communities that space-based winds LIDAR mission should be considered as a top priority forfuture space missions. Mission planning and phase A/B study must commence immediately to enable a launch in 2011-2012.<br />

In today’s security setting, the United States must deter multiple actors who may not adhere to traditional, Cold-War concepts of deterrence, underscoring the need to deploy multi-layered missile defense capabilities to maintain a robust and credible deterrent. Together with the other portions of the New Triad, missile defenses provide U.S. policy makers with an expanded set of tools and options that can be tailored to deter specific adversaries. President Bush took the necessary steps to make possible the unrestricted development, testing, and deployment of all types of missile defenses when he announced U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2001 . This was followed by the construction of a limited national missile defense (the Ground-based Missile Defense system) with sites in Alaska and California. Moreover, existing U.S. space assets are a vital element of our deterrence forces utilized for intelligence, early warning, surveillance/reconnaissance, command and control, navigation/precision strike, and the integration of our missile defense systems. Consequently, given their growing vulnerability to asymmetric attack, the United States must convince adversaries that we are committed to the protection of our space-based infrastructure and that offensive actions against these assets will not undermine the endurance/resiliency of our deterrent capabilities. The growing vulnerability of U.S. space assets is an issue that successive administrations increasingly confronted over the past five decades as Soviet capabilities (and now those of several additional nations/actors) to destroy/disrupt elements of our space infrastructure developed and matured and as U.S. space capabilities assumed increasing importance for U.S. military operations. This was underscored by their escalating utilization in successive operations beginning in 1991 during Desert Storm, described as the first “space war,” the Kosovo bombing campaign in 1999, and in Afghanistan and Iraq more recently.<br />

 Embracing queerness as the death drive is not an effective means of challenging futurity; in fact the drive depends on the deferral of futurity, locking their resistance into a repetitive cycle of symbolic opposition.<br />
Snediker 2006 (Michael Snediker, Visiting Assistant Professor of American Literature at Mount Holyoke College, 2006, Postmodern Culture, Vol. 16, No. 3)<br />
The thrill of the death drive, thus instantiated, is less in knowing one's relation to a funnel of semen than in not knowing. The death drive, for all its externally imposed Tarantino-esque luridness, depends on the contingencies of knowing, themselves dependent on a horizon in which contingencies might themselves come to fruition (or to recall Edelman's reading of The Birds, come to roost). The death drive, then, doesn't oppose futurity so much as depend on the deferral of futurity so as to extend as long as possible the Jamesian project of waiting. The death drive, even in its cathexis to deferring, is futurally organized. The death drive may be impulsive (the manner of drives), but maximization of its concomitant pleasures requires patience, in requiring and being ravished by the tick of minutes, hours, days, in between the fever-dream of possibility and its coming or not coming (as it were) to pass.<br />

Perm: do the plan and interrogate the gendered nature of IR. It solves, adding women as a category of analysis better reveals androcentrism’s relationship with the world<br />
Peterson 05 [V Spike, Department of Political Science, University of Arizona, Tucson; “How (The Meaning of) Gender Matters in Political Economy,” New Political Economy 10.4 Dec]<br />
Across disciplines, feminist interventions have typically begun by exposing the omission of actual women and their activities, while also documenting how women and feminised activities are represented as inferior to male-as-norm (androcentric) criteria. In economics and political economy, feminists have exposed how men dominate the practice of and knowledge production about (what men define as) ‘economics’; how women’s domestic, reproductive and caring labour is deemed marginal to (male-defined) production and analyses of it; how orthodox models and methods presuppose male-dominated activities (paid work, the formal economy) and masculinised characteristics (autonomous, objective, rational, instrumental, competitive). As a corollary, ‘women’s work’ and feminised qualities – in whatever sphere – are devalued: deemed ‘economi- cally’ irrelevant, characterised as subjective, ‘natural’ and ‘unskilled’, and typi- cally unpaid. For most economists, social reproduction through heterosexual families and non-conflictual intra-household dynamics are simply taken for granted; alternative household forms and the rising percentage of female-headed and otherwise ‘unconventional’ households are rendered deviant or invisible.7 Mounting evidence of systematic exclusions prompts a new strategy: correcting androcentric bias by adding women and their experiences to existing analytical frameworks. New questions emerge regarding what counts as relevant data (marriage patterns, family budgets), appropriate sources (church records, personal diaries) and germane topics (caring labour, shopping, food preparation, sex work). From this expanded inquiry we learn more about women and everyday life, but also more about men and conventional topics. That is, rather than a masculinist focus exclusively on ‘the main story’ of men’s activities, we attend as well to the ‘background’ story that is rarely visible but which underpins and enables men’s activities. Not only do women’s lives become more visible, but the inter-dependence of both stories is illuminated, which also improves our understanding of the featured story and its primarily male protagonists. Hence, this ‘project’ not only adds women, but expands into investigating relationships among women’s and men’s identities, activities and inequalities of power.<br />

If the alt can overcome realism’s hegemony it solves the link to a marginal increase via the plan<br />
<br />
And, the perm doesn’t cede the political – abdication of public space causes reactionary fill-in – turns the K<br />
Boggs ‘97 (Carl, National University, Los Angeles, Theory and Society, “The great retreat: Decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century America”, December, Volume 26, Number 6, springerlink.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/content/m7254768m63h16r0/fulltext.pdf)<br />
The decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century America poses a series of great dilemmas and challenges. Many ideological currents scrutinized here – localism, metaphysics, spontaneism, post-modernism, Deep Ecology – intersect with and reinforce each other. While these currents have deep origins in popular movements of the 1960s and 1970s, they remain very much alive in the 1990s. Despite their different outlooks and trajectories, they all share one thing in common: a depoliticized expression of struggles to combat and overcome alienation. The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change. As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved – perhaps even unrecognized – only to fester more ominously in the future. And such problems (ecological crisis, poverty, urban decay, spread of infectious diseases, technological displacement of workers) cannot be understood outside the larger social and global context of internationalized markets, finance, and communications. Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or sidestep these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impotence. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to the increasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions. 74 In the meantime, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The unyielding truth is that, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the United States, it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies. This last point demands further elaboration. The shrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehow disappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people’s lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites – an already familiar dynamic in many lesser-developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world, not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a reassertion of politics in more virulent guise – or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collective interests that had vanished from civil society. 75<br />

Alt fails alone – status quo approaches means realism is inevitable<br />
Guzzini 98 [senior research fellow at the Copenhagen Peace Research Institute, 1998, Stefano, Realism in International Relations and International Political Economy, p. 234-235]<br />
Consequently, taking realism seriously as a still widely shared device for constructing knowledge, helps in raising the awareness of the way in which often very contestable historical analogies influence our understanding, and can predispose to action. Such a conceptual analysis is hence not an idle thought, but a prerequisite to seeing a larger variety of policy options and to facing possible self-fulfilling prophecies. CONCLUSION This chapter made three arguments about the present development of realism in International Relations and International Political Economy. First, it showed that the unity between diplomatic discourse and the disci¬pline of International Relations, so self-evident in the times of Morgenthau, can no longer be upheld. Both worlds of international politics and of diplo¬macy have changed. Second, it showed a similar failure when realists tried to save the overlap of realism with the central explanatory theory of International Relations, that is, to save realism as the discipline's identity defining theory or para¬digm. This was illustrated by a critique of the Logic of Anarchy, the most elaborate revision of Waltz's theory which aims at responding to the critics of realism and neorealism alike. This work can neither provide a meta¬theoretically coherent realism, nor a version which would be acceptable to the present academic criteria of an empirical theory. As a rcsult of this double failure, realism is at a crossroads. Either it fol¬lows thc scicntific road, and then pursues its fragmentation within and out¬sidc thc narrowed discipline. Or it goes back to its normative and historical roots but, then, it can no longer cover the research agenda of International Relations, nor claim the scientific core position that it has been used to taking since 1945. In the past, realists have resisted this dilemma. This resistance, played out in both ways, has given cadence to realism's evolution, and until now, also the evolution of International Relations as a discipline. This has been the double story of this book. As long as this resistance continues, the story will continue. Third, this last chapter has argued that although the evolution of realism has been mainly a disappointment as a general causal theory, we have to deal with it. On the one hand, realist assumptions and insights are used and merged in nearly all frameworks of analysis offered in International Relations or International Political Economy. One of the book's purposes was to show realism as a varied and variably rich theory, so heterogeneous that it would be better to refer to it only in plural terms. On the other hand, to dispose of realism because some of its versions have been proven empiri¬cally wrong, ahistorical, or logically incoherent, does not necessarily touch its role in the shared understandings of observers and practitioners of inter¬national affairs. Realist theories have a persisting power for constructing our understanding of the present. Their assumptions, both as theoretical constructs, and as particular lessons of the past translated from one genera¬tion of decision-makers to another, help mobilizing certain understandIngs and dispositions to action. They also provide them with legitimacy. Despite realism's several deaths as a general causal theory, it can still powerfully enframe action. It exists in the minds, and is hence reflected in the actions, of many practitioners. Whether or not the world realism depicts is out there, realism is. Realism is not a causal theory that explains International RelatIons, but, as long as realism continues to be a powerful mind-set, we need to understand realism to make sense of International Relations. In other words, realism is a still necessary hermeneutical bridge to the understanding of world politics. Getting rid of realism without having a deep understanding of it, not only risks unwarranted dismsssal of some valuable theoretical insights that I have tried to gather in this book; it would also futile. Indeed, it might be the best way to tacitly uncritically reproduce it.<br />

 <span class="Underline">Prioritizing aesthetics justifies mass murder and makes truth impossible </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Jay 92 (Martin, History @ UC Berkeley ’92 “&quot;The Aesthetic Ideology&quot; as Ideology; Or, What Does It Mean to Aestheticize Politics?” Cultural Critique 21 Spring p. 43-44)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">Any discussion of the aestheticization of politics must begin by identifying the normative notion of the aesthetic it presup- poses. For unless we specify what is meant by this notoriously ambiguous term, it is impossible to understand why its extension to the realm of the political is seen as problematic. Although a thorough review of the different uses in the literature cited above is beyond the scope of this essay, certain significant alternatives can be singled out for scrutiny. As Benjamin's own remarks demonstrate, one salient use de- rives from the l'art pour l'art tradition of differentiating a realm called art from those of other human pursuits, cognitive, reli- gious, ethical, economic, or whatever. Here the content of that realm apart-often, but not always, identified with something known as beauty-is less important than its claim to absolute au- tonomous and autotelic self-referentiality. For the obverse of this claim is the exclusion of ethical, instrumental, religious, etc. con- siderations from the realm of art. A politics aestheticized in this sense will be equally indiffer- ent to such extra-artistic claims, having as its only criterion of value aesthetic worth. Moreover, the definition of that worth im- plied by such a rigid differentiation usually suppresses those as- pects of the aesthetic, such as sensuous enjoyment and bodily pleasure, which link art and mundane existence; instead, formal considerations outweigh &quot;sentimental&quot; ones. On a visit to Paris in 1891, Oscar Wilde was reported to have said: &quot;When Benvenuto Cellini crucified a living man to study the play of muscles in his death agony, a pope was right to grant him absolution. What is the death of a vague individual if it enables an immortal word to blossom and to create, in Keats' words, an eternal source of ec- stasy?&quot; (Raynaud 397). Another classical expression of this atti- tude appeared in the notorious response of the Symbolist poet Laurent Tailhade to a deadly anarchist bomb thrown into the French Chamber of Deputies in 1893: &quot;What do the victims mat- ter if the gesture is beautiful?&quot;8 Not long after, F. T. Marinetti's Futurist Manifesto echoed the same sentiments in glorifying, along with militarism, anarchistic destruction, and contempt for women, &quot;the beautiful ideas which kill&quot; (182). Moving beyond the Futurists' flatulent rhetoric, Mussolini's son-in-law and foreign minister Ciano would confirm the practical results of its imple- mentation when he famously compared the bombs exploding among fleeing Ethiopians in 1936 to flowers bursting into bloom. The aestheticization of politics in these cases repels not merely because of the grotesque impropriety of applying criteria of beauty to the deaths of human beings, but also because of the chilling way in which nonaesthetic criteria are deliberately and provocatively excluded from consideration. When restricted to a rigorously differentiated realm of art, such antiaffective, formal- ist coldness may have its justifications; indeed, a great deal of modern art would be hard to appreciate without it. But when then extended to politics through a gesture of imperial dedifferentia- tion, the results are highly problematic. For the disinterestedness that is normally associated with the aesthetic seems precisely what is so radically inappropriate in the case of that most basic of hu- man interests, the preservation of life. Benjamin's bitter observa- tion that mankind's &quot;self-alienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order&quot; (&quot;Work of Art&quot; 244) vividly expresses the dis- gust aroused by this callous apotheosis of art over life. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The US Pentagon is debating how to continue SST missions in the light of the $1 billion (730,000 million euro) cost for the first Space Based Surveillance Satellite (SBSS). The US Air Force (USAF) has not requested additional funding for a follow-on satellite in the upcoming budget. Space systems are almost always more expensive than ground-based systems. Not just because you have to build it and then get it into orbit, but also because the manpower required to run the system is specialised and therefore calls for a premium. The advantages to a space-based SST system are many: unlimited observation time, no atmospheric attenuation, no weather effects. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The upshot of the Secure World Foundation's (SWF's) panel discussion yesterday on the status of the Obama National Space Policy (NSP) one year after its release was that the policy itself is just words on paper. What counts is implementation, and in many respects it is too early to judge how well that is going. Peter Marquez, who spearheaded development of the NSP when he was on the staff of the White House's National Security Council (NSC), compared space policy to light - it is both a point and a wave. The NSP document is a point, he said, while implementation is a wave - a continuous process where various aspects are reinterpreted and reargued despite the intense labor that was devoted to choosing each word so carefully that no doubt was left as to its intent. Or so the authors thought. Overall, though, he gave good marks on the progress of implementing many of the NSP's provisions. He praised the cadre of government specialists who are diligently working on follow up activities, including his successor at the NSC, Chirag Parikh. Parikh not only is leading implementation of the NSP, but is working with Damon Wells at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on updating the more focused space transportation policy according to Marquez. He was critical of implementation in some areas, however, especially space situational awareness (SSA). He accused the Department of Defense (DOD) of hypocrisy because while it says that SSA is a top priority, the funding is not there. &quot;An unfunded requirement isn't a requirement,&quot; he chided. Andrew Palowitch, Director of the Air Force/National Reconnaissance Office Space Protection Program, was less enthusiastic, arguing that nothing that has happened in the past year or anything that will happen in the next year is due to the NSP. Pointing out that space activities take years to plan, he believes it will be 18-24 months before the NSP will have much effect. He also stressed that policy is much more than a single document emanating from the White House. It is a combination of White House policy documents, presidential pronouncements, legislation (including funding), and international agreements such as treaties that are adopted by the United States. Inaction is also a part of policy, he added.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">I am suggesting that current verification means and methods do not enable us to overcome determined efforts to obscure capabilities and intent. Fair questions, then, would be: what are these means and methods and how well can they detect noncompliance, and are there other means and methods that can solve the verification problems? And, are there other means and methods that can solve the verification challenge? Let me begin by noting that virtually all space arms control proposals call for verification, but none has identified specific tools envisioned for the “verification toolbox” that could be used for this purpose. This, to me, suggests that no one has been able yet to identify tools that could do the job effectively. Given the definitional challenges and questions of intent, this is reasonable. So, unfortunately, even with all of these tools, undetected and undetectable cheating remains quite possible. Neither National Means and Methods of Verification (NMM) – which include but go beyond NTM -- nor negotiated cooperative measures (including declarations and on-site inspection of satellites and their payloads prior to their launch) would enable verifiers to determine with confidence whether an activity circumvented or exploited loopholes in the definition of banned activities, or could be rapidly converted for prohibited uses. For example, the rendezvous and docking opera-tions conducted by an automated cargo transfer vehicle could be used to conceal the development of a co-orbital ASAT guidance, navigation, and control subsystem. Similarly, a test to confirm the ability to hit a target in space could be concealed in a launch that resulted in a close fly-by of a target satellite or a point in space. Moreover, neither NMM nor negotiated cooperative measures (including declarations and on-site inspection of satellites and their payloads prior to use) would enable verifiers to determine with confidence whether observed changes in orbiting satellites or payloads were due to malfunctions, or deliberate actions as a result of either covert modifications or inherent capabilities. Even the most intrusive of on-site measures prior to launch – measures whose acceptability, for commercial or national security reasons, to any nation is highly doubtful – could do no more than indicate the maneuvering capability of a given system and the degree of sophistication of that capability. Additionally, maneuvering capabilities are the norm for satellites, so neither NMM nor negotiated cooperative measures would enable verifiers to determine with more than low-to-very low confidence whether the intent of that capability extended beyond normal operating and safety requirements. Even then, it would be highly possible for a state to hide its true intent or change it quickly, and to take the necessary actions to exploit a latent or covert capability. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Delivering a speech at the Sixth Annual Ilan Ramon International Space Conference, held at the Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies, General Helms emphasized the need for partnerships that improve space situational-awareness capabilities. The conference brought the space community together to discuss technologies, programs and strategies with representatives from around the world. As the commander of JFCC-Space, General Helms is responsible for executing continuous, integrated space operations to deliver theater and global effects in support of national and combatant commander objectives. A segment of SSA is tracking, cataloging and screening objects in space, which helps prevent collisions or debris-caused damage. However, with more than 60 nations operating in space, it has become a congested, contested and competitive domain, according to JFCC-Space officials. The Joint Space Operations Center, located here, is one of JFCC-Space's operations centers. The JSpOC provides operational employment of worldwide joint space forces and enables the JFCC-Space commander to integrate space power into global military operations. On a daily basis, it also performs satellite screenings on approximately 1,100 active satellites to mitigate the danger of these satellites colliding with the more than 22,000 trackable objects orbiting in space. The framework to strengthen SSA, said General Helms, is found in the new National Space Policy, released by President Barack Obama last summer. A key element to the policy is international cooperation. &quot;We must partner with other nations and enterprises to achieve mutually beneficial goals, and at the top of our priorities is the development of comprehensive SSA,&quot; she said. &quot;The National Space Policy encourages international cooperation, and in pursuit of this goal we will surely break new ground.&quot; Among the reasons why this is important, explained General Helms, is that better SSA allows those who operate in space to make more fully informed and therefore safer decisions, while also removing the mistrust and misperceptions that can lead to mishaps and misunderstandings. National Space Policy wording acknowledges that no single nation has the resources or geography to precisely track every object in space. &quot;It directs us to collaborate with other nations, the private-sector and intergovernmental organizations to improve our space situational awareness -- specifically to enhance our shared ability to rapidly detect, warn of, characterize and attribute natural and man-made disturbances to space systems,&quot; said General Helms. &quot;There are many technical and operational details that have to be worked out before we at JFCC-Space could begin incorporating data from allies and partners, but we are definitely moving in that direction.&quot; JFCC-Space currently has 19 formal standing SSA sharing agreements with private industry to provide advanced tailored SSA services in support of safe space-flight operations. As a result of the JSpOC's vigilance, satellite owners maneuvered their satellites 126 times last year to avoid collisions with other satellites or on-orbit debris, JSpOC officials said. &quot;The United States is committed to safe, responsible and peaceful uses of space,&quot; General Helms said. &quot;Public provision of space situational awareness data through the SSA Sharing Program is evidence of the U.S. government's commitment to provide SSA data to the world, free of charge, in order to enhance safe and responsible space operations and promote transparency.&quot; The general also paid tribute to the memory of Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, a crew member aboard the fatal Space Shuttle Columbia mission Feb. 1, 2003. Their paths crossed briefly while General Helms was preparing to return to her Air Force career from her assignment as an astronaut with NASA, and he was preparing for the Columbia mission. &quot;Ilan's ultimate contributions actually now extend beyond what he likely imagined,&quot; General Helms said. &quot;Who would have thought that as a result of tragedy, there is now this very forum, where people such as me come to reach out in the interest of common goals of cooperation in space operations? It is truly an enduring legacy of which the nation of Israel can be proud.&quot;</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Bruce MacDonald, who served as Senior Director of the Congressional Commission on Strategic Posture of the United States, agreed that SSA is a viable area of cooperation. MacDonald, who lauded the inclusion of arms control in the National Space Policy as a &quot;good change,&quot; linked SSA with deterrence, which is, in his view, the appropriate goal of the United States in space: &quot;the more countries know they are [being] observed, the more cautious they'll be.&quot; Plunkett added that the accountability derived from attribution for anti-satellite (ASAT) attacks or other debris-causing behavior &quot;may impact what people do in space.&quot; Dean Cheng, Research Fellow at the Asian Studies Center of the Heritage Foundation, described that assumption as &quot;interesting,&quot; and cautioned that increased SSA or cooperation in that area may not be so easy with actors like China and may not aid deterrence. What were the lessons for China after the 2007 ASAT test, he asked rhetorically. Instead of suffering from this incident, Cheng explained, China learned that there are no consequences to conducting such tests. When considering China, which he described as &quot;a genuine space power&quot;, he asked if knowing more about the behavior of other actors in space would be deterrence or, considering the &quot;asymmetry of interests&quot; between China and the United States, might serve the opposite role. With major challenges in U.S.-China relations, space cooperation with China - which was not ruled out as a possibility in the new policy - still may be some time off. When asked about cooperating with China in human spaceflight missions, the Deputy Administrator of NASA, Lori Garver, who delivered the afternoon's keynote speech, joked &quot;I'm so sorry, that's all the time we have.&quot; She could only add that just like the inclusion of Russia in the International Space Station, &quot;human spaceflight cooperation will not be a NASA decision.&quot; Her response echoed Cheng's earlier comments that &quot;whether we can cooperate in space [with China] depends on whether we can cooperate on the ground&quot; and that &quot;cooperation needs to start with baby steps.&quot; The first challenge may prove to be the United States' own understanding of Chinese activities and motivations, what Cheng described as its &quot;opacity.&quot; Looking to &quot;problems on the horizon,&quot; MacDonald agreed with this description and said that &quot;China is our biggest concern in space...that China will continue to be opaque.&quot; The hope is, he argued, that by showing China that such a stance is counterproductive, it will become &quot;less opaque, more transparent...at least translucent.&quot;</span><br />

<span class="Underline">In the first few days of the new Barack Obama administration, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that the US needs &quot;a comprehensive dialogue with China&quot; and space-related matters will certainly be part of this dialogue. Transparency will certainly be one of the most important issues to be addressed. China has kept the world almost completely in the dark about many of its space activities for far too long. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Two years after China conducted its anti-satellite (ASAT) test, fragments of the target, an old Chinese weather satellite, are still out there drifting in space. What is also out there is a lot of lingering doubt and uncertainty about China's intentions in space. Establishing the rules of the roads regarding space launches is one thing, and, maintaining safety measures for existing satellites and space vehicles while providing greater certainty in the commercial space realm is vital. But the search for transparency in this case propels the US onto stormy seas at a time when greater global cooperation is widely seen as a necessity given the adverse economic climate. &quot;[This] cuts straight to the heart of the Obama administration's plans to seek negotiated weapons bans in space, or 'rules based' arms control of any variety. We have been down this road with the former Soviet Union. China will be even tougher, and even more committed to using any arms control measure to disarm its adversaries,&quot; said Richard Fisher, senior fellow at the Washington DC-based International Assessment and Strategy Center, and the author of a new book, China's Military Modernization, Building for Regional and Global Reach. Lesser degrees of transparency will not suffice. Avoiding the guessing, and suspicions that can fuel talk of worst case scenarios requires openness which the Chinese have resisted with much success. &quot;The US is interested in understanding the organizational and funding structure of China's space program. The assumption is that the People's Liberation Army [PLA] controls the space program,&quot; said Dr Jing-dong Yuan, director of the East Asia Non-proliferation Program at the California-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. &quot;In terms of launch organization, such as Shenzhou - China's manned space flights - the military provides the security, logistics and the overall command of the launch portion of the program [including] the taikonauts who are PLA personnel. The research and development, production, and pre-launch activities are pretty much civilian.&quot; Of course, China and the US are as different as night and day in terms of their political systems and the organizational structures of government agencies, so discussions of transparency are never easy nor relaxed. &quot;[In the US], there is a clear path of decision making that includes official policy positions along with doctrine and strategy,&quot; said Brian Weeden, technical consultant at the Colorado-based Secure World Foundation. &quot;In contrast, by these same standards, the Chinese government is very opaque. Little is known about who makes which decisions and what the official policy of the Chinese government is in different situations.&quot; &quot;The risk is that each nation will assume the worst in its neighbors. That could lead to wild speculation about what each is exactly doing. At best, it could lead to runaway military spending,&quot; adds Weeden. &quot;At worst, it could mean that an incident in space, hostile or not, could be misinterpreted by one party and become a flashpoint for armed conflict on the ground.&quot; </span><br />

<span class="Underline">There is no reason to think that China would rely solely on its demonstrated direct ascent ASAT as the only weapon in its counterspace arsenal. Indeed, it is only logical that China would employ a full spectrum of capabilities – and it has shown hints at what some of those are. The same concept of jamming for GPS can be applied to communication satellites as demonstrated by the jamming of a Thuraya satellite in 2006 and the (likely) unintentional recent jamming of satellite TV over Lebanon. 12 Lasing satellites to either blind optics or overload the satellite’s thermal control system are also feasible. There is also the alleged 2006 dazzling of a U.S. spy satellite by China. 15 But the real doomsday weapon in counterspace warfare is the electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) – a side effect of certain nuclear detonations. The effects of EMP were first widely noticed following the STARFISH PRIME high-altitude nuclear detonation (NUDET) over a Pacific island. 16 Simply put, a nuclear detonation can generate a pulse which can damage, and in some cases destroy, sensitive satellite electronics. While these electronic components can be hardened against EMP, it requires significant additional costs and added weight. If China really wanted to remove the U.S. communication ability in a conflict over Taiwan, a relatively small nuclear weapon lofted into geosynchronous orbit, maneuvered to position over Asia and then detonated would have devastating consequences. The only known geosynchronous communications satellites designed with survivability in a nuclear environment are the U.S. Milstar satellites. Theoretically, they could withstand such a blast but would be of little benefit. Six Milstar satellites were designed and built but one failed to achieve orbit. 17 As they are intended to provide global secure satellite coverage, it can be assumed that the five remaining satellites are spread out along the equator, meaning that at most only two or three are positioned in the area of Asia. With maximum data rates of 2,400 bps (satellites 1 and 2) or 4.8 kbps (satellites 4 thru 6) there is no way for these to possibly handle the gigabits of bandwidth needed. The concept of “winning” in the above hypothetical scenario should be understood only in the most Pyrrhic sense. We have already seen the damage done by the destruction of just one SSO satellite (Chinese test). If that were repeated a half dozen times or more over a short period the effects would be disastrous, to say nothing of what the space environment would look like if a NUDET were to occur in populated orbits. This counterproductive maxim holds true for any destructive counterspace activity by any nation, including the United States. It is a fact of physics that the permanent disabling of a satellite’s ability to maneuver, or the ability of controllers on the ground to command maneuvers, by any means, transforms that satellite into a piece of debris and increases its chances of a collision in space. Collisions generate more pieces of debris, which in turn increases the probability of additional collisions, creating a feedback loop that we currently do not know how to stop. While it is true that space power is an important foundation of overall U.S. military power, it is also true that U.S. prowess in power is closely linked to America’s economic power and, in turn, the world’s economy as a whole. Any permanent degradation or damage to critical space systems, such as GPS or commercial communications satellites, would have a devastating impact on the American economy, the global economy, and thus the economy of the very nation that brought conflict to outer space. China does possess the ability to significantly affect U.S. space power. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Another diplomatic tack contemplated by those opposed to “weaponizing space” is the adoption of multilateral codes of conduct. To a certain extent, such norms will develop organically on their own, as the growing interdependence between economic and security interests forces government and commercial satellite operators to cooperate, and as Washington increasingly coordinates its space activities with military and civil space authorities in allied and friendly nations. Over time, new norms for shared space situational awareness, debris mitigation, and orbital traffic management may emerge among responsible space-faring nations. But such norms make no sense if the parties have not first built up trust. And if such norms are externally imposed, they will be nothing more than unverifiable arms control agreements in camouflage. Absent the ability to ascertain or enforce compliance, a code-of-conduct rule regime will be weak and, more likely than not, ineffectual. A rules system for space between potential adversaries that relies on voluntary compliance and lacks viable punitive measures will be a hollow one. (Nor, for that matter, would an international treaty “banning” anti-satellite testing be enforceable or verifiable; the ignominious record of enforcing and verifying treaties prohibiting activities on Earth should be proof enough of that.)</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Verification and governance are crucial to the success of any space security treaty. A violation of its provisions could undermine the purposes of the agreement. In the context of outer space, there are two types of verification: adequate and effective. Although the differences between the two are not spelled out, it is generally understood that effective verification entails stricter requirements and more rigorous inspections.35 Adequate, however, is a verification standard consistent with the standard needed to wage war in outer space.36 Essentially, in order to conduct physical conflict in space, one would need to be able to discern between military and civilian targets (as required by the Geneva Conventions).37 Moreover, in the absence of a ban on space weapons, militaries would be required to have robust space situational awareness in order to maintain a targeting list of possible threats. This ability to discriminate between military and civilian targets, or to establish an order of priority for targets based on their ability to harm other objects, can also be used as a verification standard for ensuring that space-based weapons are never deployed. The first step toward a robust verification and governance system is a collection of robust SSA systems. As discussed above, it is important to know what functions objects perform in outer space, who is in control of them, what orbits they occupy and how they behave in these orbits. This knowledge will not only act as a deterrent to the weaponization of space, but also reduce the risk of accidental collisions or interference.38 The independent SSA systems of China, the Russian Federation and the United States could become the basis for Regional Space Operation Centres (RSpOCs) that would each maintain extensive knowledge of what activities are taking place in outer space on a real-time basis. These RSpOCs could serve as a form of clearing house, in which sufficient space information would be made available to other states in a format that is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of these three major space powers. As every state will have a significant relationship with at least one of these powers, every spacefaring state could gain access to the necessary and sufficient information for its safe and sustainable use of outer space. This would be particularly true were both China and the Russian Federation to make similar data available to third parties as the United States currently does under its Commercial and Foreign Entities project.39 Looking forward, these RSpOCs, enhanced by Joint Data Exchange Centres established among them, could serve as the foundation for the multilateral verification of a space security treaty.40 The second step toward a robust verification and governance system for space security is an executive council established under a space security treaty designed to report to the UN Security Council on compliance matters relating to the treaty. This executive council could serve as a basis for consultations concerning both compliance and whether or not a given satellite qualifies as a weapon based on its design and behaviour. This sort of governance system would be much more mutually beneficial and adhere to the spirit of Article IX of the OST, in contrast to a system of deterrence and tit-for-tat reprisals which may, in turn, lead to an arms race in outer space. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Increased space situational awareness will be an important component of being able to verify (to some degree) compliance with any norms or codes of conduct. Since most antisatellite programs are classified, they are likely to continue in some form or another with or without norms (e.g., there will be a strong temptation to “cheat”), but this is not a new problem in arms control. The current policy that anti-satellite research is allowable, but testing is not, may be the best starting point for any effort to constrain opponents, and situational awareness, by increasing the chances that a test would be detected, could reinforce norms.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">So, in looking forward, we need to figure out how to protect these space assets. And to do that, we must recognize that the space environment has changed dramatically since the Soviets launched a 2-foot-wide metal ball back in October 1957. First, space is now multinational. For decades, the United States and Soviet Union dominated space, but today more than 50 countries own satellites or a share in one, and nine countries have successfully launched satellites. People in nearly every corner of the globe now depend on the services satellites provide. As a result, space is getting crowded. Over the last five decades, the number of objects in space has increased dramatically. Today, more than 850 operating satellites and nearly 700,000 pieces of debris larger than a marble orbit the Earth. A collision with such a piece of debris could damage or destroy a satellite. Laws and &quot;rules of the road&quot; to guide operations in space, and controls on the production of space debris are increasingly necessary. Meanwhile, some resources are at a premium: Slots in the highly sought-after &quot;geostationary band,&quot; the part of space where satellites can remain over a given point on Earth, are assigned by the International Telecommunications Union on a first-come, first-served basis. Many developing countries are concerned that slots won't be available when they are ready to use one. Second, space is in danger of becoming weaponized. While space has long supported military forces through reconnaissance, navigation, and communication satellites, there currently are no weapons based in space. The Bush administration, however, has been pushing to develop weapons to deny other countries the use of space; these include space-based interceptors, which could be used to attack satellites. Meanwhile, China's successful test of an antisatellite weapon last January dramatically demonstrated that satellites are already at risk. Left unchecked, the fear that controlling space may afford a decisive military advantage threatens to trigger a space arms race. That would divert economic and political resources from other pressing issues, and hinder international cooperation necessary to make progress on such problems as nuclear nonproliferation and terrorism. In addition, increasing reliance on satellites for crucial military functions could cause instability in a crisis. Military war games suggest that the loss of important satellites, such as reconnaissance satellites, could spark a quick escalation in a conflict. Increased congestion and the threat of weaponization pose an important challenge: How do we continue to reap the benefits of space and avoid conflict? That requires a new model for space. Long over are the &quot;Wild West&quot; days when most viewed space as sparsely populated with little need for laws and rules, and so vast that no one was worried about degrading the environment. This new model must reflect our modern, interconnected world. It requires a legal framework to regulate space traffic, allocate limited resources equitably, and provide ways to resolve disputes. Particularly important are limits on potentially harmful or destabilizing technologies, such as a ban on testing and use of weapons that destroy satellites, and verification measures to instill confidence in and strengthen adherence to the regime. Forty years ago this month, the Outer Space Treaty entered into force. The treaty bans stationing weapons of mass destruction in space and extends the UN Charter to cover space operations. It lays out the fundamental principles for governing space, which should be used to create a legal framework that addresses today's issues and technologies. To do this, international negotiations are urgently needed. Some steps have been taken, but much more work is needed, especially on military issues. Since 1994, a handful of countries, including the United States, has blocked efforts to begin international negotiations on space arms control. Given its long history in space, the United States, which owns more than half of the active satellites orbiting today, instead should be promoting negotiations to protect our future in space as well as security on Earth.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Operators continuously and accurately track the locations of their own satellites and rely on in-house close-approach monitoring systems to ensure the safety of their fleets. Most operators also incorporate information from the U.S. Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) when analyzing potential close approaches between satellites or between satellites and trackable debris. The basic information (referred to as Two-Line Element [TLE] data) used in this process is available to authorized users of the U.S. Government’s “Spacetrack.org” website. Operators routinely screen satellites using TLE data, and also exchange data with other operators with near or adjacent satellites during special activities such as satellite relocations and transfer orbit missions. The data exchange usually consists of the latest location information, near-term maneuver plans, transmission frequencies, and contact information for further discussion. There are drawbacks to the current close-approach monitoring process. In addition to a lack of standards for TLE modeling, TLE data does not have the required accuracy for credible collision detection. An operator that relies on TLE data must increase the calculated collision margin to avoid potential close approaches, therefore increasing the number of maneuvers. Maneuvers based on inaccurate data can waste fuel, shorten the life of satellites, and in some cases can introduce uncertainties that decrease the safety of space operations. In most cases, threats identified using basic TLE data are downgraded after coordination with other operators or further evaluation with more precise orbital data. TLE data also lacks reliable planned maneuver information, which limits the usefulness of data for longer-term predictions since future maneuver information is necessary to properly predict the orbital location of active satellites. Today, operators relying on chemical propulsion systems maneuver about once every two weeks to maintain their orbital position. Accurately predicting the orbital location of a satellite will become more challenging with satellites that employ ionic propulsion systems40 and are in essence constantly maneuvering. Adding complexity to this problem is the fact that there is no single standard for representing the position of an object in space. Operators characterize the orbital position of their satellites differently depending on the software used for flight operations. In addition, there is no single agreed-upon protocol for sharing information, and coordinating operators must be prepared to accommodate the practices of other operators. To do this, operators must maintain redundant file transfer protocols and tools to convert and reformat information so that it is consistent with other software systems for computing close approaches. Some operators write their own software tools for monitoring and predicting the close approach of other spacecraft while others contract with third parties for this service. Therefore, separate tools for each operator are necessary to exchange data. The magnitude of the effort to maintain space situational awareness grows quickly as the number of coordinating operators increases. Further, not all satellite companies participate in close-approach monitoring due to lack of financial resources or appropriately skilled technicians.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Deterrence depends upon accurate information, especially in discriminating between intentional and unintentional/natural interference, in assessing the operation of rules of the road, in verification of any future arms control agreements, and in enhanced warning – all elements of an effective deterrence posture. Aside from its role in deterrence, improved SSA is necessary to allow more efficient use of orbital space, for space traffic management and for tracking and mitigation of space debris. The U.S. recognized the importance of SSA by assigning responsibility for this issue to Strategic Command in the Unified Command Plan. This will promote a joint approach to the issue, with the Air Force and sister services providing the capabilities required. Beyond this, however, the United States should: • Invest in better sensors, more satellites, and improved ground equipment, and communication/synergize existing data to create a more effective database and make better use of the information we have. • Undertake a thoroughgoing review of data in the public domain to determine the scope of information that can be exchanged with other spacefaring states without compromising security interests. • Reach agreements with commercial operators to upgrade future satellites to include SSA sensors, either integral to satellite design or as hosted payloads. • Seek agreement with coalition of allies and other spacefaring states on the scope of information exchange with commercial operators. • Establish a clearing house for exchange of SSA information in the form of a limited access “blog” or website on which both governments and private operators can post whatever information they choose; as confidence in such a system builds, better and more complete information will appear, inaccurate information can be identified/isolated, and a broader database will be created. • Encourage rather than discourage likeminded spacefaring states to improve their SSA capabilities. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Their assessment of the strategic imbalance rests on fairly solid empirical data on the characteristics of the Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals, particularly their numbers, explosive yields, and ranges. But high confidence in their estimates of U.S. missile accuracy is unwarranted. Such estimates of missile inaccuracy (circular error probable) found in the public domain vary widely (by 30 percent or more), and their estimates lie on the optimistic end of the spectrum. (The real data are classified and so it is next to impossible to validate any model’s estimates.) Actual accuracy achieved in wartime may also diverge from accuracy demonstrated in peacetime missile tests. The professors assume that accuracy could decline by as much as 20 percent in wartime, but what if their un-degraded peacetime estimate was too optimistic and the 20 percent wartime degradation came on top of it, resulting in a cumulative deviation of, say 40-50 percent from their baseline accuracy figure? The professors’ sensitivity analysis of the effects of degraded accuracy on target destruction is thus too circumscribed, and they do not adequately inform the reader that the probabilities of destroying Russian hard targets such as missile silos would plummet if U.S. missiles missed their targets by a considerably greater distance than assumed by their model </span><br />

<span class="Underline">In sum, aircraft have several distinct advantages over spacecraft in regard to theater ISR collection, but space-derived surveillance and reconnaissance information is critical to diplomatic and military operations because it provides a &quot;first look&quot; into denied areas and at the battlespace and assists planners in finding and coarsely geolocating many targets before terrestrial forces move into the region. As a rule of thumb, today's space-derived surveillance and reconnaissance is useful in finding 80 percent of the targets and is able to determine their location to roughly 80 percent of the accuracy required to conduct precision strikes. In some cases, space systems do better than 80 percent in finding and fixing targets, and in other cases, they do worse. What is important is the tremendous advantage space systems provide politicians and commanders by giving them a highquality first look into the situation they face. With this information, they are able to make decisions about how to employ their limited terrestrial surveillance and reconnaissance assets (aircraft, ships, submarines, reconnaissance ground forces, etc.) more efficiently to refine the surveillance and reconnaissance picture to the quality they desire for the operations they are considering. In some cases, the first look from space may suffice, but usually terrestrial surveillance and reconnaissance assets are required. During combat operations, space-based surveillance and reconnaissance sensors continue to provide data, filling gaps in coverage by theater assets. Space-based surveillance and reconnaissance sensors also frequently cue terrestrially based sensors, as was the case during the Gulf War with missile warning satellites cueing Patriot batteries to intercept Iraq's inbound Scud missiles. Perhaps most important of all, day in and day out, during war and peace, spacepower provides the 80 percent first look on a global scale. It allows analysts to watch the world and report tip-offs, warnings, and indications that give political and military leaders the freedom to employ their terrestrial forces more expeditiously and with greater confidence that another threat is not more pressing. Spacepower literally watches the backs of terrestrial forces to make sure no threat is sneaking up behind them. This allows greater concentration of terrestrial forces in theaters of combat operations because space-based surveillance and reconnaissance assets are sufficient to act as a kind of global sentry. This sort of mission is ideally suited to space systems because they have unimpeded access around the globe and relatively few assets are required to sustain surveillance and reconnaissance missions on a global scale. Much more is possible. By increasing the number of low Earth orbiting sensors, continuously improving the quality of the sensors, and developing the means to service and repair them (either on orbit or by recovery and relaunch), the 80 percent rule of thumb will creep closer toward the 100 percent solution, despite the warfighter's demand for ever-increasing precision. As space systems becomes more capable, is it likely that they will replace terrestrial forms of surveillance and reconnaissance collection? No. Aerial reconnaissance did not eliminate the need for land and sea forces to conduct reconnaissance of their own. There is no reason to believe that space-based reconnaissance will replace any other form of reconnaissance either. Spacepower does not usurp missions from other forces. Spacepower assets give a state new core competencies for its military order of battle. The ability to do anything continuously on a global scale is a new contribution to warfare made possible by spacepower. The various C4ISR capabilities, including weather observation, missile warning, and navigation and timing broadcasts, give space-enabled forces a distinct asymmetric advantage over adversaries in the opening days of the 21st century. This advantage will evaporate over time as other actors on the world stage develop, lease, or borrow similar capabilities. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Space-based surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities were first developed during the Cold War to provide access to areas of the Soviet Union that otherwise would have been totally inaccessible to U.S. intelligence. Although manned missions using aircraft such as the U-2 provided valuable intelligence on Soviet military forces, these missions became increasingly dangerous as Soviet air defense capabilities were upgraded. In response, the United States realized the need for advanced, space-based systems capable of identifying small objects from space.26 Unlike manned platforms, space-based assets offered the benefit of global coverage, near invulnerability, and sustained operations over a continuous period of time. Beginning with deployments in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the U.S. has pioneered increas¬ingly sophisticated space-based surveillance and reconnaissance systems for over fifty years. As satellite capabilities have evolved, so too has the role of these advanced systems. In addition to monitoring foreign military forces, such satellites have played a crucial role in verifying arms control agreements. Since the Cold War, the role of satellites in verifying treaties has expanded to include supporting nuclear nonpro¬liferation efforts. With the arrival of precision-guided munitions, reconnaissance satellites have become “the key to post-Cold War defense tactics that rely on highly selective targeting to destroy selected targets with minimal collateral damage.”27 Despite the shroud of secrecy, some general facts are known about the broad elements of U.S. surveillance and reconnaissance satellites. In particular, the systems function primarily in support of two types of missions: imagery intelligence (IMINT) and other, non-visual intelligence information, including signals intelligence (SIGINT), electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT). Within the realm of IMINT, two types of systems are employed: (1) those that collect images using visible and thermal (infrared) light; and (2) those that use radar to image the Earth’s surface. Regarding non-visual intelligence, numerous configurations are utilized to intercept valuable information including enemy voice communications and data transmissions. Within these broad mission areas, the U.S. currently deploys a number of advanced systems. For IMINT collection, the Keyhole series KH-12 (commonly referred to as the Improved Crystal or Advanced KH-11) is the latest and most sophisticated iteration in a series of satellites that have provided imagery for a number of years. Building on technologies contained in the KH-11 used during the 1990-91 Gulf War, the KH-12 is much heavier—weighing nearly 30,000lbs and costing in excess of $1 billion excluding launch costs. Other U.S. surveillance capabilities are summarized in Table 1. The growing number of missions assigned to space-based surveillance and reconnaissance satellites has led the United States to develop a new generation of capabilities. Dubbed BASIC for Broad Area Space-based Imagery Collector, the new system would be launched by 2011 at an estimated cost of $2-4 billion. Although the program is currently in its very early stages, development options include an entirely new photo imagery satellite or a derivative of a commercial imagery satellite, buying a commercial satellite or leasing existing commercial satellite capacity.29</span><br />

<span class="Underline">First-strike instability is made worse by limitations in space situational awareness (SSA). While the United States enjoys better SSA than any other spacefaring nation, it is still dangerously limited. Not all satellites are monitored constantly, and only limited diagnostic and environmental monitoring capabilities exist even for those that are, making it difficult to diagnose causes of sudden satellite failure. Knowing this, adversaries might be tempted to attack satellites covertly, believing that uncertainty regarding the causes of failure would impede retribution, or perhaps even that attacks would be misdiagnosed as naturally occurring failures. Alternatively, a natural failure that occurs during a confrontation or conflict could lead operators or policymakers to assume that the satellite was attacked, prompting unjustified retribution and subsequent escalation of the crisis. This dangerous combination of continued vulnerability, growing dependence, and limited SSA indicate that first-strike stability in space has diminished, and further indications suggest that the rate of erosion is accelerating. While the difficulty of attacking orbital assets remains a stabilizing factor, that factor is shrinking as an increasing number of states acquire capabilities to interrupt space services. Several states are now attempting to develop directed-energy weapons. One of them, Russia, also retains the co-orbital ASAT capability that the Soviet Union developed during the Cold War and has since sold GPS jammers to anyone with the funds to purchase them. As has been the case since the dawn of the space age, any state with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons has the basic components to field a crude but highly destructive ASAT weapon. 16 The proliferation of such threats is troubling, and anxieties have become more acute now that China has begun experimenting with directed-energy weapons and has demonstrated a capability to destroy satellites in low earth orbit (LEO) with a direct-ascent kinetic ASAT weapon. 17 Unfortunately, the infrastructure, policies, and attitudes that both enable and constrain U.S. space operations in the current environment are, in many ways, unchanged from when they were developed during the MAD-induced stability of the Cold War. This leaves the United States exposed to the risk of a surprise attack in space unless a deterrence regime can be developed to restore first-strike stability in that domain. 18</span><br />

<span class="Underline">While many options exist for punishing space aggressors and reducing the benefits of their attacks, nearly all of them depend to some degree on improvements in SSA. Poor SSA undermines the credibility of threats of punishment in some scenarios, as the attacker may expect to have a reasonable chance of striking anonymously. Conversely, good SSA has intrinsic deterrent value, because any prospective aggressor, knowing that culpability for an attack might be quickly determined and exposed to the world, would have to weigh the long-term costs of angering the United States and international community, even if no immediate capability existed to inflict punishment. All active defenses require better SSA than what current capabilities provide, and many passive defenses could also be improved with better SSA. Lack of effective SSA could both inhibit the United States from taking reprisals against covert space aggressors and create risks that unjustified reprisals may be taken in response to natural satellite failures occurring during a crisis. Better SSA will improve diagnostic capabilities, helping operators to distinguish satellite malfunction from attack more quickly and reliably, thereby enhancing first-strike stability in space. Improving SSA should be one of the United States’ top priorities in its efforts to develop the capabilities needed for an effective space deterrence regime. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">3 scenarios for extinction:</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">1st is EMP and 2nd is biological warfare</span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">According to the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review, the United States must maintain a “robust nuclear deterrent, which remains a keystone of U.S. national power.”98 The reason should be self evident—without a nuclear deterrent the United States could be destroyed as an industrial civilization and our conventional forces could be defeated by a state with grossly inferior conventional capability but powerful WMD. We cannot afford to ignore existing and growing threats to the very existence of the United States as a national entity. Missile defenses and conventional strike capabilities, while critically important elements of deterrence and national power, simply can't substitute for nuclear deterrence. In light of the emerging “strategic partnership” between Russia and China and their emphasis on nuclear weapons it would be foolish indeed to size U.S. strategic nuclear forces as if the only threat we face is that of rogue states and discard the requirement that the U.S. nuclear deterrent be “second to none.” Ignoring the PRC nuclear threat because of Chinese “no first use” propaganda is just as irresponsible. Absent a nuclear deterrent to their WMD use, rogue states could defeat our forces by the combination of few nuclear EMP weapons and large chemical and biological attacks. The situation would be much worse if they build a more extensive nuclear strike capability as has been reported. Freezing U.S. nuclear forces at the technical level of the Reagan administration will assure that, within two decades, Russia, China, India, and probably others will be technically superior and U.S. deterrence ability against CBW attack will be reduced. United States nuclear forces must be modernized and tailored to enhance deterrence and damage limitation against the rogue WMD threat. WMD capabilities have given otherwise inconsequential states the ability to kill millions of people. The right combination of missile defense and conventional and nuclear strike capabilities provide the best deterrent and damage limiting capability against the rogue state threat. We must not ignore the requirement to provide extended deterrence to our allies. British and French nuclear forces are not large enough, and these nations are not perceived as tough enough, to provide a deterrent for NATO Europe against Russia. In the Far East, there is literally no nuclear deterrent capability against China other than that provided by the United States. Failure to provide a credible deterrent will result in a wave of nuclear proliferation with serious national security implications. When dealing with the rogue states, the issue is not the size of the U.S. nuclear deterrent but the credibility of its use in response to chemical or biological weapons use and its ability to conduct low collateral damage nuclear attacks against WMD capabilities and delivery systems including very hard underground facilities for purposes of damage limitation. We must also have the capability to respond promptly. The United States nuclear guarantee is a major deterrent to proliferation. If we do not honor that guarantee, or devalue it, many more nations will obtain nuclear weapons. If arms control really becomes a substitute for nuclear deterrence and defense, it may very well precipitate the most destructive war in history. Effective verification is essentially impossible, and verification is not a substitute for compliance. Today, arms control has become part of the problem rather than a solution to the problem. The abolition of the in-kind deterrent to CBW use—which deterred CBW use in World War II—is making the world more unsafe almost on a daily basis. The START and Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaties prevent or inhibit the development of conventional strike capabilities with enhanced ability to counter WMD. The demise of the ABM Treaty, while very useful, does not completely address the problem of legacy arms control and its constraints upon U.S. conventional capabilities.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Lastly, the United States should take steps to reduce the vulnerability of the nation and the military to attacks with weapons designed to produce elec- tromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects. We make this recommendation although the Commission is divided over how imminent a threat this is. Some com- missioners believe it to be a high priority threat, given foreign activities and terrorist intentions. Others see it as a serious potential threat, given the high level of vulnerability. Those vulnerabilities are of many kinds. U.S. power projection forces might be subjected to an EMP attack by an enemy calculat- ing—mistakenly—that such an attack would not involve risks of U.S. nuclear retaliation. The homeland might be attacked by terrorists or even state actors with an eye to crippling the U.S. economy and American society. From a technical perspective, it is possible that such attacks could have catastrophic consequences. For example, successful attacks could shut down the electrical system, disable the internet and computers and the economic activity on which they depend, incapacitate transportation systems (and thus the deliv- ery of food and other goods), etc. </span><br />

Russia's new militancy and China's seemingly relentless rise also give cause for concern. If America now tries to pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power vacuum. The stabilizing effects of our presence in Asia, our continuing commitment to Europe, and our position as defender of last resort for Middle East energy sources and supply lines could all be placed at risk. In such a scenario there are shades of the 1930s, when global trade and finance ground nearly to a halt, the peaceful democracies failed to cooperate, and aggressive powers led by the remorseless fanatics who rose up on the crest of economic disaster exploited their divisions. Today we run the risk that rogue states may choose to become ever more reckless with their nuclear toys, just at our moment of maximum vulnerability. The aftershocks of the financial crisis will almost certainly rock our principal strategic competitors even harder than they will rock us. The dramatic free fall of the Russian stock market has demonstrated the fragility of a state whose economic performance hinges on high oil prices, now driven down by the global slowdown. China is perhaps even more fragile, its economic growth depending heavily on foreign investment and access to foreign markets. Both will now be constricted, inflicting economic pain and perhaps even sparking unrest in a country where political legitimacy rests on progress in the long march to prosperity. None of this is good news if the authoritarian leaders of these countries seek to divert attention from internal travails with external adventures.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE.</span><br />

Complex Deterrence: Strategy In the Global Age, p. 9-11.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Among the great powers (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council), nuclear weapons are largely seen as a hedge against the emergence of great-power conflict in the future. The great-power relationships in the post-cold war era are characterized by “recessed general deterrence,” or dissuasion, in which states do not expect immediate militarized conflict, but weapons are kept in the background as insurance given the inherent uncertainties of world politics. The end of the cold war witnessed substantial changes in the deterrence dynamics involving great powers, and, as a result, general deterrence and dissuasion became operational concepts. Although they do maintain large arsenals, neither the United States nor Russia is presumed to hold automatic launch-on-warming attack plans, anymore, although some elements of the previous era are continuing. In addition, they have reduced the number of weapons they possess, although the numbers still exceed a minimum nuclear deterrence posture. The three other old nuclear powers—China, the United Kingdom, and France—also have been maintaining their smaller arsenals, but this might change as Chinese nuclear force modernization plans come to fruition in the coming decades. The logic behind the maintenance of nuclear capabilities is that the great powers want to be prepared in case their relations deteriorate in the future. Nuclear capability can also be construed as an assurance against the expansionist pathologies of great powers as described in perspectives such as offensive realism. Moreover, uncertainties in Russia and China give pause to Western nuclear powers, while, for Moscow, the fear of American influence in its former spheres in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is the cardinal source of anxiety. For the rising power, China, nuclear weapons offer a major insurance against direct assault on its strategic sphere, allowing it to rise peacefully. Nuclear weapons also offer a limited but crucial deterrent against potential conflict escalation between the United States and China involving Taiwan. The great-power deterrence calculations are thus based on “recessed general deterrence” as well as “existential deterrence”: no immediate expectations of war exist among them. However, as Patrick Morgan states, “if serious conflicts emerge again, then deterrence will be in vogue—if not, at least for a lengthy period, then deterrence will operate offstage, held in reserve, and will not be the cornerstone of security management for the system.” This does not mean that the relations in the U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China dyads would remain the same in the long run. Power transition has invariably been turbulent in the international system, and herein lies the role that nuclear weapons may play in deterring a transition war. U.S.-Russia relations could deteriorate, and deterrence could become more relevant if tensions build up over the establishment of missile defenses in Eastern Europe and over Russian efforts to repudiate major arms-control agreements in its effort to regain its lost superpower status. As discussed in Morgan and Paul’s chapter in this volume, nuclear deterrent in this context has offered the major powers greater maneuverability. It has allowed the major power states to sustain their credentials as system managers and has prevented the emergence of active security dilemmas among them that can be caused by conventional arms races and technological breakthroughs. Absent the fear of existential wars, the potentially rival states have engaged in greater economic interactions. The increasing trade relations between the United States and China and China and India, an emerging power, suggest that general nuclear deterrence may offer economic spin-off benefits. To some extent, the stability in relations among the great powers, with no war in sight between them, points to the pacifying role that nuclear weapons may be playing, although other causes are present as well. In that sense, nuclear weapons may act as crucial factors in preventing a power-transition war akin to those that the world experienced in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For Russia, the superpower that declined, nuclear deterrence offers an opportunity not to be excessively alarmed by the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Let me then state my most important conclusion directly: I believe nuclear weapons must have an abiding place in the international scene for the foreseeable future. I believe that the world, in fact, would become more dangerous, not less dangerous, were U.S. nuclear weapons to be absent. The most important role for our nuclear weapons is to serve as a “sobering force,” one that can cap the level of destruction of military conflicts and thus force all sides to come to their senses. This is the enduring purpose of U.S. nuclear weapons in the post-Cold War world. I regret that we have not yet captured such thinking in our public statements as to why the U.S. will retain nuclear deterrence as a cornerstone of our defense policy, and urge that we do so in the upcoming Nuclear Posture Review. Nuclear deterrence becomes in my view a “countervailing” force and, in fact, a potent antidote to military aggression on the part of nations. But to succeed in harnessing this power, effective nuclear weapons strategies and policies are necessary ingredients to help shape and maintain a stable and peaceful world.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">WASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force’s first Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) satellite launched Sept. 25 and is transmitting signals that indicate it is functioning normally and ready to begin orbital maneuvers, prime contractor Boeing Space &amp; Intelligence Systems announced Sept. 26. The long-delayed SBSS spacecraft is designed to use a gimbaled optical telescope to keep tabs on objects in geostationary orbit from its vantage point in low Earth orbit. The satellite was built by Seal Beach, Calif.-based Boeing and Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp. of Boulder, Colo. The SBSS satellite was carried to orbit by an Orbital Sciences Corp.-assembled Minotaur 4 rocket that launched out of Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Boeing operators at Schriever Air Force Base, Colo., received the first signals from the spacecraft indicating it is healthy and ready to begin a two-week checkout phase, a company press release said. After that, payload testing will begin, and Boeing plans to hand the satellite over to the Air Force within 60 days. This was the first orbital launch of the Minotaur 4, which uses refurbished U.S. strategic missile hardware for its first three stages with a commercial fourth-stage motor. The Minotaur 4 was supposed to make its debut a year ago until the Air Force discovered a problem with the rocket’s third-stage motor. A gas generator continued to run after the motor shut off, creating residual thrust that is a problem for a rocket designed to put a satellite into a very precise orbit. New hardware had to be designed and built to correct the problem. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">&quot;SBSS will help make our space assets safer and more secure, keeping America at the forefront of space,&quot; says Col. J.R. Jordan, SBSS mission director. &quot;This satellite is going to revolutionize the way we track objects in space by not being constrained by weather, the atmosphere or the time of day. This capability will be essential to our space situational awareness architecture for the near future and beyond.&quot; Equipped with an 11.8-inch telescope and 2.4 megapixel focal plane, the craft will use its optical eyes to image the sky and provide analysts the data they need to keep better tabs on space debris and guard against accidental collisions. What's more, the reconnaissance provided by SBSS will watch for potential risks posed to the military's communications, navigation, weather and spy satellites by enemy interference. &quot;Every day, threats to our nation's valuable satellites and space platforms are growing,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;SBSS will revolutionize our ability to find and monitor objects that could harm the space assets we depend on for security, communications, weather forecasting and many other essential services.&quot; Accidental smashups, such as last year's crash between an Iridium telephone bird and a defunct Russian craft, or the earlier Chinese anti-satellite test that destroyed a spacecraft illustrate how Earth orbit has become a contested environment. Enhancing situational awareness in space has become a major objective for the military. Putting a satellite into orbit to scan the sky will narrow gaps in ground-based space tracking that is limited by geographic locations, nighttime viewing and clouds. &quot;Space situational awareness is an essential component to maintaining space superiority. The benefits that SBSS brings is that by operating solely in space the SBSS satellite will circumvent the current terrestrial restrictions and limitations of weather, Earth line-of-sight and nighttime-only operations. This capability that SBSS will deliver will triple the probability of event detection, double the sensitivity and increase capacity by 10 times,&quot; said Lt. Col. Robert Erickson, SBSS Space Situational Awareness Squadron commander. The Boeing Co. leads the SBSS project and Ball Aerospace built the satellite based on the BCP-2000 bus. A pair of solar wings feed the craft's electricity needs, a two-axis gimbal enables rapid pointing of the optics and the onboard computer can be reprogrammed with updates. &quot;The big advantage from a design perspective of SBSS is by having the camera on a two-axis gimbal we can very rapidly point and take pictures of the sky where we like. That agility is very important,&quot; said Todd Citron, Boeing's director of advanced space and intelligence systems. &quot;The onboard computer that Boeing supplies we can upload new algorithms over time and continue to improve the performance on-orbit.&quot; Early on-orbit testing and commissioning activities for SBSS will last several months. Also, maneuvers are planned to raise the orbit by more than 50 miles to the intended operational perch. Acceptance of the satellite into full service is slated to occur by next spring. So how exactly does the SBSS observing process work? &quot;The system receives tasking from the Joint Space Operations Center. It takes that tasking and converts it into commands that go up to the spacecraft. This satellite has a digital camera that's on a two-axis gimbal. So the commands sent up to the satellite basically tell the satellite where to point the camera and to take a picture. That data then is downlinked to a ground site,&quot; Citron said. &quot;That information could either be what's referred to as metric data -- basically positional information on the objects we're viewing that would allow one to compute orbits, or also it could be what's called space object identification, or SOI, information which one could use to perhaps get a sense of what kind of object one is looking at.&quot; However, officials won't say exactly what size objects SBSS can see. &quot;We will say there are a lot of objects up there that we've lost track on and there are a lot of objects that we think we'll be able to observe that we haven't been able to observe previously. We're going to improve that database and actual tracking on a daily basis,&quot; Jordan said. Many thousands of objects are routinely tracked by the military today using ground-based radars and telescopes. But there's vastly more bits and pieces of space junk circling the planet not being watched that could damage spacecraft that are woven into daily life, such as commercial television satellites. &quot;I think it's clear that our country is very dependent on space,&quot; Citron said. &quot;To the person on the street this is a critical element of ensuring that things essential to our economy and our health as a nation continue.&quot; And even the military's Global Positioning System constellation of satellites has become an intergal part of everyday civilian life. &quot;Just about everything you do is synchronized to GPS time, from your banking transactions or point-of-sale purchases with your credit card and so forth. If that capability went away, it would have a tremendous impact on the economy,&quot; Citron said. &quot;So our economy and our military are very dependent on space, which makes it a potential target for adversaries. Understanding what's going on in space is very important...That's the motivation for space situational awareness.&quot; The SBSS has a seven-year design life, and additional surveillance satellites could be envisioned to further improve the observing capacity. &quot;The Air Force, in general, is pursuing what the longterm architecture should be for space situational awareness. We've been doing our own studies of architectures and when you look at various tradeoffs in terms of the constellation we certainly see advantages to having more than one satellite up there,&quot; Citron said. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">In September, the United States Air Force launched the first satellite capable of monitoring outer space. Currently, the USAF watches objects in Earth orbit through a ground-based system of radar and optical sensors scattered around the globe. Though this Space Surveillance Network is the best in the world, it is insufficient to ensure the security of the hundreds of satellites that are integral to modern life. When the new Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) satellite is operational in about six months, it will be a dramatic improvement. We all depend on satellites, whether or not we know it. From civilian uses such as TV, Internet, banking, GPS, agriculture, and weather forecasting, to military functions such as guiding munitions, operating Predator drones, gathering intelligence, enforcing arms control agreements, and monitoring missile launches, the value of satellites is incalculable. Unfortunately, as Earth orbit becomes crowded and actors proliferate, security threats increase. The anarchy and volatility of outer space are reduced only insofar as we know what is happening there -- a concept known as space situational awareness (SSA). Laws and norms protecting against aggression and harmful negligence are essentially worthless if actions cannot be reliably attributed to guilty parties. Without accurate information, punishment is nearly impossible and its deterrent effect is minimal. Imagine trying to arrest a robber based solely on the description provided by a blind person. Imagine further that all would-be robbers knew beforehand that the only likely witness would be blind. The SBSS satellite gives us eyes. It has a mounted sensor that is capable of pivoting, allowing the camera to focus on different areas of outer space without having to reposition the satellite itself. This enables ground controllers to quickly and frequently shift the area under observation, giving them broad monitoring capabilities without wasting the satellite's valuable fuel. The satellite will be able to track launches, debris, satellites, and other objects without being &quot;encumbered by terrestrial limitations of weather, day-and-night restrictions,&quot; said Lt. Col. Robert Erickson, SBSS Space Situational Awareness Squadron commander. &quot;It enables the (Joint Space Operations Center) to collect data when they need it, not when a ground asset may be able to see the target.&quot; Simply put, it will give us more and better information. This greater awareness of outer space activity can be used to enhance the effectiveness of international laws and norms, or to provide a deterrent to nefarious activity through the credible threat of retaliation. Both avenues will likely be pursued by international actors. Imagine that an American satellite is destroyed by colliding with another object. In debating how to respond, it would be essential to know whether that object was a &quot;space mine&quot; intentionally placed in the path of the satellite's orbit, or if the object was merely a piece of errant debris, perhaps a spent rocket casing left over from an old Apollo mission. If it could be accurately determined that the object was, in fact, a space mine deployed by a specific country, the United States could publicly denounce the guilty party and seek restitution through appropriate international legal channels, maybe taking the case to the UN Security Council. Alternatively, the United States could retaliate against that party in a way deemed proportionate to the offense committed. Though the latter option is more risky, both would enhance space security in the long run by making known the ever-increasing possibility of being caught and by simultaneously providing assured, predictable punishments for transgressions. Although the United States has the best space-monitoring capabilities, places like China, Europe, and India will inevitably catch up. As their SSA improves, so will outer space security due to more accurate information and more observing parties. Mutual monitoring has been highly effective at enforcing arms control agreements and avoiding nuclear exchanges since the Cold War. At the height of U.S.-Soviet tensions, early-warning systems allowed both sides to detect potential missile launches with enough advanced notice to retaliate, thereby eliminating the incentive to strike first, and reconnaissance satellites enabled each country to verify that the other was meeting its arms control obligations. In general, transparency of capabilities and intent are widely acknowledged to reduce misunderstanding and conflict. Though monitoring outer space presents a greater technical challenge than monitoring Earth, this wisdom still applies. Thus, making space safe and secure for both satellites and space travel will depend largely on enhancing space situational awareness. Ground-based monitoring will continue to play an important role, but space-based surveillance is the way of the future. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The framework to strengthen SSA, said General Helms, is found in the new National Space Policy, released by President Barack Obama last summer. A key element to the policy is international cooperation. &quot;We must partner with other nations and enterprises to achieve mutually beneficial goals and at the top of our priorities is the development of comprehensive SSA,&quot; she said. &quot;The National Space Policy encourages international cooperation and in pursuit of this goal we will surely break new ground.&quot; Among the reasons why this is important, explained General Helms, is that better SSA allows those who operate in space to make more fully informed and therefore safer decisions, while also removing the mistrust and misperceptions that can lead to mishaps and misunderstandings. The National Space Policy acknowledges that no single nation has the resources or geography to precisely track every object in space. &quot;It directs us to collaborate with other nations, the private sector and intergovernmental organizations to improve our space situational awareness - specifically to enhance our shared ability to rapidly detect, warn of, characterize and attribute natural and man-made disturbances to space systems,&quot; said General Helms. &quot;There are many technical and operational details that have to be worked out before we at JFCC-Space could begin incorporating data from allies and partners, but we are definitely moving in that direction.&quot; JFCC-Space currently has 19 formal standing SSA sharing agreements with private industry to provide advanced tailored SSA services in support of safe space flight operations. As a result of the JSpOC's vigilance, satellite owners maneuvered their satellites 126 times last year to avoid collisions with other satellites or on-orbit debris. &quot;The United States is committed to safe, responsible and peaceful uses of space. Public provision of space situational awareness data through the SSA Sharing Program is evidence of the U.S. government's commitment to provide SSA data to the world, free of charge, in order to enhance safe and responsible space operations and promote transparency,&quot; said General Helms. </span><br />

The US Air Force (USAF) has not requested additional funding for a follow-on satellite in the upcoming budget. Space systems are almost always more expensive than ground-based systems. Not just because you have to build it and then get it into orbit, but also because the manpower required to run the system is specialised and therefore calls for a premium. The advantages to a space-based SST system are many: unlimited observation time, no atmospheric attenuation, no weather effects.<br />

A clone of the Space-Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) satellite made by a Boeing/Ball Aerospace team and launched last year is not necessary to continue the mission of tracking objects in space from space, says Gen. William Shelton, the new Air Force Space Command chief. Debate is ongoing in the Pentagon about how to continue conducting this mission as the number of objects in space — all of which represent threats to operating satellites — grows substantially. The price tag of the first SBSS satellite, with a two-axis visible light sensor, was suppose to be just more than $800 million, but it eventually crept to about $1 billion. Shelton says that like other senior leaders in the Air Force, this has prompted a case of “sticker shock.” The Air Force did not request funding for a follow-on satellite in the fiscal 2012 budget request; time is needed instead to sort out options.<br />

A new U.S. Air Force satellite will provide the first full-time, space-based surveillance of hundreds of satellites and thousands of pieces of debris that could crash into American and allied assets circling the Earth. If all goes as planned, the Space-Based Space Surveillance satellite, scheduled for a July 8 launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., will have an unobstructed, around-the-clock view of the increasingly heavy traffic in Earth orbit -- something the Air Force doesn't have now. Currently, the Air Force relies on a ground-based network of radar and optical telescopes around the globe to monitor about 1,000 active satellites and 20,000 pieces of debris. The telescopes can be used only on clear nights, and not all radar stations are powerful enough to detect satellites in deep space orbit, about 22,000 miles from Earth. From its orbit about 390 miles above the Earth, the new satellite will have a clear view of deep space. &quot;It really has tremendous capabilities,&quot; said Todd Citron, director of advanced space and intelligence systems for Boeing Co., prime contractor for the satellite, known as SBSS. Citron said SBSS will revolutionize &quot;space situational awareness,&quot; the military term for knowing not only where the objects are, but where they're headed and what might be in their path.<br />

The upshot of the Secure World Foundation's (SWF's) panel discussion yesterday on the status of the Obama National Space Policy (NSP) one year after its release was that the policy itself is just words on paper. What counts is implementation, and in many respects it is too early to judge how well that is going. Peter Marquez, who spearheaded development of the NSP when he was on the staff of the White House's National Security Council (NSC), compared space policy to light - it is both a point and a wave. The NSP document is a point, he said, while implementation is a wave - a continuous process where various aspects are reinterpreted and reargued despite the intense labor that was devoted to choosing each word so carefully that no doubt was left as to its intent. Or so the authors thought. Overall, though, he gave good marks on the progress of implementing many of the NSP's provisions. He praised the cadre of government specialists who are diligently working on follow up activities, including his successor at the NSC, Chirag Parikh. Parikh not only is leading implementation of the NSP, but is working with Damon Wells at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on updating the more focused space transportation policy according to Marquez. He was critical of implementation in some areas, however, especially space situational awareness (SSA). He accused the Department of Defense (DOD) of hypocrisy because while it says that SSA is a top priority, the funding is not there. &quot;An unfunded requirement isn't a requirement,&quot; he chided. Andrew Palowitch, Director of the Air Force/National Reconnaissance Office Space Protection Program, was less enthusiastic, arguing that nothing that has happened in the past year or anything that will happen in the next year is due to the NSP. Pointing out that space activities take years to plan, he believes it will be 18-24 months before the NSP will have much effect. He also stressed that policy is much more than a single document emanating from the White House. It is a combination of White House policy documents, presidential pronouncements, legislation (including funding), and international agreements such as treaties that are adopted by the United States. Inaction is also a part of policy, he added.<br />

I am suggesting that current verification means and methods do not enable us to overcome determined efforts to obscure capabilities and intent. Fair questions, then, would be: what are these means and methods and how well can they detect noncompliance, and are there other means and methods that can solve the verification problems? And, are there other means and methods that can solve the verification challenge? Let me begin by noting that virtually all space arms control proposals call for verification, but none has identified specific tools envisioned for the “verification toolbox” that could be used for this purpose. This, to me, suggests that no one has been able yet to identify tools that could do the job effectively. Given the definitional challenges and questions of intent, this is reasonable. So, unfortunately, even with all of these tools, undetected and undetectable cheating remains quite possible. Neither National Means and Methods of Verification (NMM) – which include but go beyond NTM -- nor negotiated cooperative measures (including declarations and on-site inspection of satellites and their payloads prior to their launch) would enable verifiers to determine with confidence whether an activity circumvented or exploited loopholes in the definition of banned activities, or could be rapidly converted for prohibited uses. For example, the rendezvous and docking opera-tions conducted by an automated cargo transfer vehicle could be used to conceal the development of a co-orbital ASAT guidance, navigation, and control subsystem. Similarly, a test to confirm the ability to hit a target in space could be concealed in a launch that resulted in a close fly-by of a target satellite or a point in space. Moreover, neither NMM nor negotiated cooperative measures (including declarations and on-site inspection of satellites and their payloads prior to use) would enable verifiers to determine with confidence whether observed changes in orbiting satellites or payloads were due to malfunctions, or deliberate actions as a result of either covert modifications or inherent capabilities. Even the most intrusive of on-site measures prior to launch – measures whose acceptability, for commercial or national security reasons, to any nation is highly doubtful – could do no more than indicate the maneuvering capability of a given system and the degree of sophistication of that capability. Additionally, maneuvering capabilities are the norm for satellites, so neither NMM nor negotiated cooperative measures would enable verifiers to determine with more than low-to-very low confidence whether the intent of that capability extended beyond normal operating and safety requirements. Even then, it would be highly possible for a state to hide its true intent or change it quickly, and to take the necessary actions to exploit a latent or covert capability.<br />

Delivering a speech at the Sixth Annual Ilan Ramon International Space Conference, held at the Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies, General Helms emphasized the need for partnerships that improve space situational-awareness capabilities. The conference brought the space community together to discuss technologies, programs and strategies with representatives from around the world. As the commander of JFCC-Space, General Helms is responsible for executing continuous, integrated space operations to deliver theater and global effects in support of national and combatant commander objectives. A segment of SSA is tracking, cataloging and screening objects in space, which helps prevent collisions or debris-caused damage. However, with more than 60 nations operating in space, it has become a congested, contested and competitive domain, according to JFCC-Space officials. The Joint Space Operations Center, located here, is one of JFCC-Space's operations centers. The JSpOC provides operational employment of worldwide joint space forces and enables the JFCC-Space commander to integrate space power into global military operations. On a daily basis, it also performs satellite screenings on approximately 1,100 active satellites to mitigate the danger of these satellites colliding with the more than 22,000 trackable objects orbiting in space. The framework to strengthen SSA, said General Helms, is found in the new National Space Policy, released by President Barack Obama last summer. A key element to the policy is international cooperation. &quot;We must partner with other nations and enterprises to achieve mutually beneficial goals, and at the top of our priorities is the development of comprehensive SSA,&quot; she said. &quot;The National Space Policy encourages international cooperation, and in pursuit of this goal we will surely break new ground.&quot; Among the reasons why this is important, explained General Helms, is that better SSA allows those who operate in space to make more fully informed and therefore safer decisions, while also removing the mistrust and misperceptions that can lead to mishaps and misunderstandings. National Space Policy wording acknowledges that no single nation has the resources or geography to precisely track every object in space. &quot;It directs us to collaborate with other nations, the private-sector and intergovernmental organizations to improve our space situational awareness -- specifically to enhance our shared ability to rapidly detect, warn of, characterize and attribute natural and man-made disturbances to space systems,&quot; said General Helms. &quot;There are many technical and operational details that have to be worked out before we at JFCC-Space could begin incorporating data from allies and partners, but we are definitely moving in that direction.&quot; JFCC-Space currently has 19 formal standing SSA sharing agreements with private industry to provide advanced tailored SSA services in support of safe space-flight operations. As a result of the JSpOC's vigilance, satellite owners maneuvered their satellites 126 times last year to avoid collisions with other satellites or on-orbit debris, JSpOC officials said. &quot;The United States is committed to safe, responsible and peaceful uses of space,&quot; General Helms said. &quot;Public provision of space situational awareness data through the SSA Sharing Program is evidence of the U.S. government's commitment to provide SSA data to the world, free of charge, in order to enhance safe and responsible space operations and promote transparency.&quot; The general also paid tribute to the memory of Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, a crew member aboard the fatal Space Shuttle Columbia mission Feb. 1, 2003. Their paths crossed briefly while General Helms was preparing to return to her Air Force career from her assignment as an astronaut with NASA, and he was preparing for the Columbia mission. &quot;Ilan's ultimate contributions actually now extend beyond what he likely imagined,&quot; General Helms said. &quot;Who would have thought that as a result of tragedy, there is now this very forum, where people such as me come to reach out in the interest of common goals of cooperation in space operations? It is truly an enduring legacy of which the nation of Israel can be proud.&quot;<br />

Bruce MacDonald, who served as Senior Director of the Congressional Commission on Strategic Posture of the United States, agreed that SSA is a viable area of cooperation. MacDonald, who lauded the inclusion of arms control in the National Space Policy as a &quot;good change,&quot; linked SSA with deterrence, which is, in his view, the appropriate goal of the United States in space: &quot;the more countries know they are [being] observed, the more cautious they'll be.&quot; Plunkett added that the accountability derived from attribution for anti-satellite (ASAT) attacks or other debris-causing behavior &quot;may impact what people do in space.&quot; Dean Cheng, Research Fellow at the Asian Studies Center of the Heritage Foundation, described that assumption as &quot;interesting,&quot; and cautioned that increased SSA or cooperation in that area may not be so easy with actors like China and may not aid deterrence. What were the lessons for China after the 2007 ASAT test, he asked rhetorically. Instead of suffering from this incident, Cheng explained, China learned that there are no consequences to conducting such tests. When considering China, which he described as &quot;a genuine space power&quot;, he asked if knowing more about the behavior of other actors in space would be deterrence or, considering the &quot;asymmetry of interests&quot; between China and the United States, might serve the opposite role. With major challenges in U.S.-China relations, space cooperation with China - which was not ruled out as a possibility in the new policy - still may be some time off. When asked about cooperating with China in human spaceflight missions, the Deputy Administrator of NASA, Lori Garver, who delivered the afternoon's keynote speech, joked &quot;I'm so sorry, that's all the time we have.&quot; She could only add that just like the inclusion of Russia in the International Space Station, &quot;human spaceflight cooperation will not be a NASA decision.&quot; Her response echoed Cheng's earlier comments that &quot;whether we can cooperate in space [with China] depends on whether we can cooperate on the ground&quot; and that &quot;cooperation needs to start with baby steps.&quot; The first challenge may prove to be the United States' own understanding of Chinese activities and motivations, what Cheng described as its &quot;opacity.&quot; Looking to &quot;problems on the horizon,&quot; MacDonald agreed with this description and said that &quot;China is our biggest concern in space...that China will continue to be opaque.&quot; The hope is, he argued, that by showing China that such a stance is counterproductive, it will become &quot;less opaque, more transparent...at least translucent.&quot;<br />

Attaching great importance to international cooperation in the field of nuclear energy, the Chinese government has reached inter-governmental agreements with 23 countries on peaceful use of nuclear energy, introduced advanced nuclear energy technologies into China, and provided every possible assistance to developing countries. In April 2009, organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and hosted by the Chinese government, the International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Energy in the 21st Century was held in Beijing. In accordance with the principle of peaceful use of outer space, China has conducted bilateral cooperation and exchanges with Russia, France, Brazil, Ukraine, the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA) in the fields of space technology, space exploration and space science. It supports the work of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) and Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO), and plays an active role in making use of outer space technologies to conduct multilateral cooperation in Earth science research, disaster prevention and reduction, deep space exploration, and space debris mitigation and protection.<br />

In the first few days of the new Barack Obama administration, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that the US needs &quot;a comprehensive dialogue with China&quot; and space-related matters will certainly be part of this dialogue. Transparency will certainly be one of the most important issues to be addressed. China has kept the world almost completely in the dark about many of its space activities for far too long.<br />
Two years after China conducted its anti-satellite (ASAT) test, fragments of the target, an old Chinese weather satellite, are still out there drifting in space. What is also out there is a lot of lingering doubt and uncertainty about China's intentions in space. Establishing the rules of the roads regarding space launches is one thing, and, maintaining safety measures for existing satellites and space vehicles while providing greater certainty in the commercial space realm is vital. But the search for transparency in this case propels the US onto stormy seas at a time when greater global cooperation is widely seen as a necessity given the adverse economic climate. &quot;[This] cuts straight to the heart of the Obama administration's plans to seek negotiated weapons bans in space, or 'rules based' arms control of any variety. We have been down this road with the former Soviet Union. China will be even tougher, and even more committed to using any arms control measure to disarm its adversaries,&quot; said Richard Fisher, senior fellow at the Washington DC-based International Assessment and Strategy Center, and the author of a new book, China's Military Modernization, Building for Regional and Global Reach. Lesser degrees of transparency will not suffice. Avoiding the guessing, and suspicions that can fuel talk of worst case scenarios requires openness which the Chinese have resisted with much success. &quot;The US is interested in understanding the organizational and funding structure of China's space program. The assumption is that the People's Liberation Army [PLA] controls the space program,&quot; said Dr Jing-dong Yuan, director of the East Asia Non-proliferation Program at the California-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. &quot;In terms of launch organization, such as Shenzhou - China's manned space flights - the military provides the security, logistics and the overall command of the launch portion of the program [including] the taikonauts who are PLA personnel. The research and development, production, and pre-launch activities are pretty much civilian.&quot; Of course, China and the US are as different as night and day in terms of their political systems and the organizational structures of government agencies, so discussions of transparency are never easy nor relaxed. &quot;[In the US], there is a clear path of decision making that includes official policy positions along with doctrine and strategy,&quot; said Brian Weeden, technical consultant at the Colorado-based Secure World Foundation. &quot;In contrast, by these same standards, the Chinese government is very opaque. Little is known about who makes which decisions and what the official policy of the Chinese government is in different situations.&quot; &quot;The risk is that each nation will assume the worst in its neighbors. That could lead to wild speculation about what each is exactly doing. At best, it could lead to runaway military spending,&quot; adds Weeden. &quot;At worst, it could mean that an incident in space, hostile or not, could be misinterpreted by one party and become a flashpoint for armed conflict on the ground.&quot;<br />

There is no reason to think that China would rely solely on its demonstrated direct ascent ASAT as the only weapon in its counterspace arsenal. Indeed, it is only logical that China would employ a full spectrum of capabilities – and it has shown hints at what some of those are. The same concept of jamming for GPS can be applied to communication satellites as demonstrated by the jamming of a Thuraya satellite in 2006 and the (likely) unintentional recent jamming of satellite TV over Lebanon. 12 Lasing satellites to either blind optics or overload the satellite’s thermal control system are also feasible. There is also the alleged 2006 dazzling of a U.S. spy satellite by China. 15 But the real doomsday weapon in counterspace warfare is the electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) – a side effect of certain nuclear detonations. The effects of EMP were first widely noticed following the STARFISH PRIME high-altitude nuclear detonation (NUDET) over a Pacific island. 16 Simply put, a nuclear detonation can generate a pulse which can damage, and in some cases destroy, sensitive satellite electronics. While these electronic components can be hardened against EMP, it requires significant additional costs and added weight. If China really wanted to remove the U.S. communication ability in a conflict over Taiwan, a relatively small nuclear weapon lofted into geosynchronous orbit, maneuvered to position over Asia and then detonated would have devastating consequences. The only known geosynchronous communications satellites designed with survivability in a nuclear environment are the U.S. Milstar satellites. Theoretically, they could withstand such a blast but would be of little benefit. Six Milstar satellites were designed and built but one failed to achieve orbit. 17 As they are intended to provide global secure satellite coverage, it can be assumed that the five remaining satellites are spread out along the equator, meaning that at most only two or three are positioned in the area of Asia. With maximum data rates of 2,400 bps (satellites 1 and 2) or 4.8 kbps (satellites 4 thru 6) there is no way for these to possibly handle the gigabits of bandwidth needed. The concept of “winning” in the above hypothetical scenario should be understood only in the most Pyrrhic sense. We have already seen the damage done by the destruction of just one SSO satellite (Chinese test). If that were repeated a half dozen times or more over a short period the effects would be disastrous, to say nothing of what the space environment would look like if a NUDET were to occur in populated orbits. This counterproductive maxim holds true for any destructive counterspace activity by any nation, including the United States. It is a fact of physics that the permanent disabling of a satellite’s ability to maneuver, or the ability of controllers on the ground to command maneuvers, by any means, transforms that satellite into a piece of debris and increases its chances of a collision in space. Collisions generate more pieces of debris, which in turn increases the probability of additional collisions, creating a feedback loop that we currently do not know how to stop. While it is true that space power is an important foundation of overall U.S. military power, it is also true that U.S. prowess in power is closely linked to America’s economic power and, in turn, the world’s economy as a whole. Any permanent degradation or damage to critical space systems, such as GPS or commercial communications satellites, would have a devastating impact on the American economy, the global economy, and thus the economy of the very nation that brought conflict to outer space. China does possess the ability to significantly affect U.S. space power.<br />

Another diplomatic tack contemplated by those opposed to “weaponizing space” is the adoption of multilateral codes of conduct. To a certain extent, such norms will develop organically on their own, as the growing interdependence between economic and security interests forces government and commercial satellite operators to cooperate, and as Washington increasingly coordinates its space activities with military and civil space authorities in allied and friendly nations. Over time, new norms for shared space situational awareness, debris mitigation, and orbital traffic management may emerge among responsible space-faring nations. But such norms make no sense if the parties have not first built up trust. And if such norms are externally imposed, they will be nothing more than unverifiable arms control agreements in camouflage. Absent the ability to ascertain or enforce compliance, a code-of-conduct rule regime will be weak and, more likely than not, ineffectual. A rules system for space between potential adversaries that relies on voluntary compliance and lacks viable punitive measures will be a hollow one. (Nor, for that matter, would an international treaty “banning” anti-satellite testing be enforceable or verifiable; the ignominious record of enforcing and verifying treaties prohibiting activities on Earth should be proof enough of that.)<br />

Verification and governance are crucial to the success of any space security treaty. A violation of its provisions could undermine the purposes of the agreement. In the context of outer space, there are two types of verification: adequate and effective. Although the differences between the two are not spelled out, it is generally understood that effective verification entails stricter requirements and more rigorous inspections.35 Adequate, however, is a verification standard consistent with the standard needed to wage war in outer space.36 Essentially, in order to conduct physical conflict in space, one would need to be able to discern between military and civilian targets (as required by the Geneva Conventions).37 Moreover, in the absence of a ban on space weapons, militaries would be required to have robust space situational awareness in order to maintain a targeting list of possible threats. This ability to discriminate between military and civilian targets, or to establish an order of priority for targets based on their ability to harm other objects, can also be used as a verification standard for ensuring that space-based weapons are never deployed. The first step toward a robust verification and governance system is a collection of robust SSA systems. As discussed above, it is important to know what functions objects perform in outer space, who is in control of them, what orbits they occupy and how they behave in these orbits. This knowledge will not only act as a deterrent to the weaponization of space, but also reduce the risk of accidental collisions or interference.38 The independent SSA systems of China, the Russian Federation and the United States could become the basis for Regional Space Operation Centres (RSpOCs) that would each maintain extensive knowledge of what activities are taking place in outer space on a real-time basis. These RSpOCs could serve as a form of clearing house, in which sufficient space information would be made available to other states in a format that is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of these three major space powers. As every state will have a significant relationship with at least one of these powers, every spacefaring state could gain access to the necessary and sufficient information for its safe and sustainable use of outer space. This would be particularly true were both China and the Russian Federation to make similar data available to third parties as the United States currently does under its Commercial and Foreign Entities project.39 Looking forward, these RSpOCs, enhanced by Joint Data Exchange Centres established among them, could serve as the foundation for the multilateral verification of a space security treaty.40 The second step toward a robust verification and governance system for space security is an executive council established under a space security treaty designed to report to the UN Security Council on compliance matters relating to the treaty. This executive council could serve as a basis for consultations concerning both compliance and whether or not a given satellite qualifies as a weapon based on its design and behaviour. This sort of governance system would be much more mutually beneficial and adhere to the spirit of Article IX of the OST, in contrast to a system of deterrence and tit-for-tat reprisals which may, in turn, lead to an arms race in outer space.<br />

Increased space situational awareness will be an important component of being able to verify (to some degree) compliance with any norms or codes of conduct. Since most antisatellite programs are classified, they are likely to continue in some form or another with or without norms (e.g., there will be a strong temptation to “cheat”), but this is not a new problem in arms control. The current policy that anti-satellite research is allowable, but testing is not, may be the best starting point for any effort to constrain opponents, and situational awareness, by increasing the chances that a test would be detected, could reinforce norms.<br />

<br />
So, in looking forward, we need to figure out how to protect these space assets. And to do that, we must recognize that the space environment has changed dramatically since the Soviets launched a 2-foot-wide metal ball back in October 1957. First, space is now multinational. For decades, the United States and Soviet Union dominated space, but today more than 50 countries own satellites or a share in one, and nine countries have successfully launched satellites. People in nearly every corner of the globe now depend on the services satellites provide. As a result, space is getting crowded. Over the last five decades, the number of objects in space has increased dramatically. Today, more than 850 operating satellites and nearly 700,000 pieces of debris larger than a marble orbit the Earth. A collision with such a piece of debris could damage or destroy a satellite. Laws and &quot;rules of the road&quot; to guide operations in space, and controls on the production of space debris are increasingly necessary. Meanwhile, some resources are at a premium: Slots in the highly sought-after &quot;geostationary band,&quot; the part of space where satellites can remain over a given point on Earth, are assigned by the International Telecommunications Union on a first-come, first-served basis. Many developing countries are concerned that slots won't be available when they are ready to use one. Second, space is in danger of becoming weaponized. While space has long supported military forces through reconnaissance, navigation, and communication satellites, there currently are no weapons based in space. The Bush administration, however, has been pushing to develop weapons to deny other countries the use of space; these include space-based interceptors, which could be used to attack satellites. Meanwhile, China's successful test of an antisatellite weapon last January dramatically demonstrated that satellites are already at risk. Left unchecked, the fear that controlling space may afford a decisive military advantage threatens to trigger a space arms race. That would divert economic and political resources from other pressing issues, and hinder international cooperation necessary to make progress on such problems as nuclear nonproliferation and terrorism. In addition, increasing reliance on satellites for crucial military functions could cause instability in a crisis. Military war games suggest that the loss of important satellites, such as reconnaissance satellites, could spark a quick escalation in a conflict. Increased congestion and the threat of weaponization pose an important challenge: How do we continue to reap the benefits of space and avoid conflict? That requires a new model for space. Long over are the &quot;Wild West&quot; days when most viewed space as sparsely populated with little need for laws and rules, and so vast that no one was worried about degrading the environment. This new model must reflect our modern, interconnected world. It requires a legal framework to regulate space traffic, allocate limited resources equitably, and provide ways to resolve disputes. Particularly important are limits on potentially harmful or destabilizing technologies, such as a ban on testing and use of weapons that destroy satellites, and verification measures to instill confidence in and strengthen adherence to the regime. Forty years ago this month, the Outer Space Treaty entered into force. The treaty bans stationing weapons of mass destruction in space and extends the UN Charter to cover space operations. It lays out the fundamental principles for governing space, which should be used to create a legal framework that addresses today's issues and technologies. To do this, international negotiations are urgently needed. Some steps have been taken, but much more work is needed, especially on military issues. Since 1994, a handful of countries, including the United States, has blocked efforts to begin international negotiations on space arms control. Given its long history in space, the United States, which owns more than half of the active satellites orbiting today, instead should be promoting negotiations to protect our future in space as well as security on Earth.<br />

<br />
A buildup of space weapons might begin with noble intentions of 'peace through strength' deterrence, but this rationale glosses over the tendency that '… the presence of space weapons…will result in the increased likelihood of their use'.33 This drift toward usage is strengthened by a strategic fact elucidated by Frank Barnaby: when it comes to arming the heavens, 'anti-ballistic missiles and anti-satellite warfare technologies go hand-in-hand'.34 The interlocking nature of offense and defense in military space technology stems from the inherent 'dual capability' of spaceborne weapon components. As Marc Vidricaire, Delegation of Canada to the UN Conference on Disarmament, explains: 'If you want to intercept something in space, you could use the same capability to target something on land'. 35 To the extent that ballistic missile interceptors based in space can knock out enemy missiles in mid-flight, such interceptors can also be used as orbiting 'Death Stars', capable of sending munitions hurtling through the Earth's atmosphere. The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense 'use or lose' pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting Death Stars with automated 'hair trigger' devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed 'complexly interactive, tightly coupled' industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other's flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, '[t]he odd term &quot;normal accident&quot; is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable'.36 Deployment of space weapons with pre-delegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to 'normal accidents'. It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, 'even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage — even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!'. 37 In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: 'One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people'.38 Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear, biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.<br />

Operators continuously and accurately track the locations of their own satellites and rely on in-house close-approach monitoring systems to ensure the safety of their fleets. Most operators also incorporate information from the U.S. Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) when analyzing potential close approaches between satellites or between satellites and trackable debris. The basic information (referred to as Two-Line Element [TLE] data) used in this process is available to authorized users of the U.S. Government’s “Spacetrack.org” website. Operators routinely screen satellites using TLE data, and also exchange data with other operators with near or adjacent satellites during special activities such as satellite relocations and transfer orbit missions. The data exchange usually consists of the latest location information, near-term maneuver plans, transmission frequencies, and contact information for further discussion. There are drawbacks to the current close-approach monitoring process. In addition to a lack of standards for TLE modeling, TLE data does not have the required accuracy for credible collision detection. An operator that relies on TLE data must increase the calculated collision margin to avoid potential close approaches, therefore increasing the number of maneuvers. Maneuvers based on inaccurate data can waste fuel, shorten the life of satellites, and in some cases can introduce uncertainties that decrease the safety of space operations. In most cases, threats identified using basic TLE data are downgraded after coordination with other operators or further evaluation with more precise orbital data. TLE data also lacks reliable planned maneuver information, which limits the usefulness of data for longer-term predictions since future maneuver information is necessary to properly predict the orbital location of active satellites. Today, operators relying on chemical propulsion systems maneuver about once every two weeks to maintain their orbital position. Accurately predicting the orbital location of a satellite will become more challenging with satellites that employ ionic propulsion systems40 and are in essence constantly maneuvering. Adding complexity to this problem is the fact that there is no single standard for representing the position of an object in space. Operators characterize the orbital position of their satellites differently depending on the software used for flight operations. In addition, there is no single agreed-upon protocol for sharing information, and coordinating operators must be prepared to accommodate the practices of other operators. To do this, operators must maintain redundant file transfer protocols and tools to convert and reformat information so that it is consistent with other software systems for computing close approaches. Some operators write their own software tools for monitoring and predicting the close approach of other spacecraft while others contract with third parties for this service. Therefore, separate tools for each operator are necessary to exchange data. The magnitude of the effort to maintain space situational awareness grows quickly as the number of coordinating operators increases. Further, not all satellite companies participate in close-approach monitoring due to lack of financial resources or appropriately skilled technicians.<br />

Deterrence depends upon accurate information, especially in discriminating between intentional and unintentional/natural interference, in assessing the operation of rules of the road, in verification of any future arms control agreements, and in enhanced warning – all elements of an effective deterrence posture. Aside from its role in deterrence, improved SSA is necessary to allow more efficient use of orbital space, for space traffic management and for tracking and mitigation of space debris. The U.S. recognized the importance of SSA by assigning responsibility for this issue to Strategic Command in the Unified Command Plan. This will promote a joint approach to the issue, with the Air Force and sister services providing the capabilities required. Beyond this, however, the United States should: • Invest in better sensors, more satellites, and improved ground equipment, and communication/synergize existing data to create a more effective database and make better use of the information we have. • Undertake a thoroughgoing review of data in the public domain to determine the scope of information that can be exchanged with other spacefaring states without compromising security interests. • Reach agreements with commercial operators to upgrade future satellites to include SSA sensors, either integral to satellite design or as hosted payloads. • Seek agreement with coalition of allies and other spacefaring states on the scope of information exchange with commercial operators. • Establish a clearing house for exchange of SSA information in the form of a limited access “blog” or website on which both governments and private operators can post whatever information they choose; as confidence in such a system builds, better and more complete information will appear, inaccurate information can be identified/isolated, and a broader database will be created. • Encourage rather than discourage likeminded spacefaring states to improve their SSA capabilities.<br />

Their assessment of the strategic imbalance rests on fairly solid empirical data on the characteristics of the Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals, particularly their numbers, explosive yields, and ranges. But high confidence in their estimates of U.S. missile accuracy is unwarranted. Such estimates of missile inaccuracy (circular error probable) found in the public domain vary widely (by 30 percent or more), and their estimates lie on the optimistic end of the spectrum. (The real data are classified and so it is next to impossible to validate any model’s estimates.) Actual accuracy achieved in wartime may also diverge from accuracy demonstrated in peacetime missile tests. The professors assume that accuracy could decline by as much as 20 percent in wartime, but what if their un-degraded peacetime estimate was too optimistic and the 20 percent wartime degradation came on top of it, resulting in a cumulative deviation of, say 40-50 percent from their baseline accuracy figure? The professors’ sensitivity analysis of the effects of degraded accuracy on target destruction is thus too circumscribed, and they do not adequately inform the reader that the probabilities of destroying Russian hard targets such as missile silos would plummet if U.S. missiles missed their targets by a considerably greater distance than assumed by their model<br />

<br />
In sum, aircraft have several distinct advantages over spacecraft in regard to theater ISR collection, but space-derived surveillance and reconnaissance information is critical to diplomatic and military operations because it provides a &quot;first look&quot; into denied areas and at the battlespace and assists planners in finding and coarsely geolocating many targets before terrestrial forces move into the region. As a rule of thumb, today's space-derived surveillance and reconnaissance is useful in finding 80 percent of the targets and is able to determine their location to roughly 80 percent of the accuracy required to conduct precision strikes. In some cases, space systems do better than 80 percent in finding and fixing targets, and in other cases, they do worse. What is important is the tremendous advantage space systems provide politicians and commanders by giving them a highquality first look into the situation they face. With this information, they are able to make decisions about how to employ their limited terrestrial surveillance and reconnaissance assets (aircraft, ships, submarines, reconnaissance ground forces, etc.) more efficiently to refine the surveillance and reconnaissance picture to the quality they desire for the operations they are considering. In some cases, the first look from space may suffice, but usually terrestrial surveillance and reconnaissance assets are required. During combat operations, space-based surveillance and reconnaissance sensors continue to provide data, filling gaps in coverage by theater assets. Space-based surveillance and reconnaissance sensors also frequently cue terrestrially based sensors, as was the case during the Gulf War with missile warning satellites cueing Patriot batteries to intercept Iraq's inbound Scud missiles. Perhaps most important of all, day in and day out, during war and peace, spacepower provides the 80 percent first look on a global scale. It allows analysts to watch the world and report tip-offs, warnings, and indications that give political and military leaders the freedom to employ their terrestrial forces more expeditiously and with greater confidence that another threat is not more pressing. Spacepower literally watches the backs of terrestrial forces to make sure no threat is sneaking up behind them. This allows greater concentration of terrestrial forces in theaters of combat operations because space-based surveillance and reconnaissance assets are sufficient to act as a kind of global sentry. This sort of mission is ideally suited to space systems because they have unimpeded access around the globe and relatively few assets are required to sustain surveillance and reconnaissance missions on a global scale. Much more is possible. By increasing the number of low Earth orbiting sensors, continuously improving the quality of the sensors, and developing the means to service and repair them (either on orbit or by recovery and relaunch), the 80 percent rule of thumb will creep closer toward the 100 percent solution, despite the warfighter's demand for ever-increasing precision. As space systems becomes more capable, is it likely that they will replace terrestrial forms of surveillance and reconnaissance collection? No. Aerial reconnaissance did not eliminate the need for land and sea forces to conduct reconnaissance of their own. There is no reason to believe that space-based reconnaissance will replace any other form of reconnaissance either. Spacepower does not usurp missions from other forces. Spacepower assets give a state new core competencies for its military order of battle. The ability to do anything continuously on a global scale is a new contribution to warfare made possible by spacepower. The various C4ISR capabilities, including weather observation, missile warning, and navigation and timing broadcasts, give space-enabled forces a distinct asymmetric advantage over adversaries in the opening days of the 21st century. This advantage will evaporate over time as other actors on the world stage develop, lease, or borrow similar capabilities.<br />

Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Space-based surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities were first developed during the Cold War to provide access to areas of the Soviet Union that otherwise would have been totally inaccessible to U.S. intelligence. Although manned missions using aircraft such as the U-2 provided valuable intelligence on Soviet military forces, these missions became increasingly dangerous as Soviet air defense capabilities were upgraded. In response, the United States realized the need for advanced, space-based systems capable of identifying small objects from space.26 Unlike manned platforms, space-based assets offered the benefit of global coverage, near invulnerability, and sustained operations over a continuous period of time. Beginning with deployments in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the U.S. has pioneered increas¬ingly sophisticated space-based surveillance and reconnaissance systems for over fifty years. As satellite capabilities have evolved, so too has the role of these advanced systems. In addition to monitoring foreign military forces, such satellites have played a crucial role in verifying arms control agreements. Since the Cold War, the role of satellites in verifying treaties has expanded to include supporting nuclear nonpro¬liferation efforts. With the arrival of precision-guided munitions, reconnaissance satellites have become “the key to post-Cold War defense tactics that rely on highly selective targeting to destroy selected targets with minimal collateral damage.”27 Despite the shroud of secrecy, some general facts are known about the broad elements of U.S. surveillance and reconnaissance satellites. In particular, the systems function primarily in support of two types of missions: imagery intelligence (IMINT) and other, non-visual intelligence information, including signals intelligence (SIGINT), electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT). Within the realm of IMINT, two types of systems are employed: (1) those that collect images using visible and thermal (infrared) light; and (2) those that use radar to image the Earth’s surface. Regarding non-visual intelligence, numerous configurations are utilized to intercept valuable information including enemy voice communications and data transmissions. Within these broad mission areas, the U.S. currently deploys a number of advanced systems. For IMINT collection, the Keyhole series KH-12 (commonly referred to as the Improved Crystal or Advanced KH-11) is the latest and most sophisticated iteration in a series of satellites that have provided imagery for a number of years. Building on technologies contained in the KH-11 used during the 1990-91 Gulf War, the KH-12 is much heavier—weighing nearly 30,000lbs and costing in excess of $1 billion excluding launch costs. Other U.S. surveillance capabilities are summarized in Table 1. The growing number of missions assigned to space-based surveillance and reconnaissance satellites has led the United States to develop a new generation of capabilities. Dubbed BASIC for Broad Area Space-based Imagery Collector, the new system would be launched by 2011 at an estimated cost of $2-4 billion. Although the program is currently in its very early stages, development options include an entirely new photo imagery satellite or a derivative of a commercial imagery satellite, buying a commercial satellite or leasing existing commercial satellite capacity.29<br />

Lack of SSA destroys first strike stability<br />

First-strike instability is made worse by limitations in space situational awareness (SSA). While the United States enjoys better SSA than any other spacefaring nation, it is still dangerously limited. Not all satellites are monitored constantly, and only limited diagnostic and environmental monitoring capabilities exist even for those that are, making it difficult to diagnose causes of sudden satellite failure. Knowing this, adversaries might be tempted to attack satellites covertly, believing that uncertainty regarding the causes of failure would impede retribution, or perhaps even that attacks would be misdiagnosed as naturally occurring failures. Alternatively, a natural failure that occurs during a confrontation or conflict could lead operators or policymakers to assume that the satellite was attacked, prompting unjustified retribution and subsequent escalation of the crisis. This dangerous combination of continued vulnerability, growing dependence, and limited SSA indicate that first-strike stability in space has diminished, and further indications suggest that the rate of erosion is accelerating. While the difficulty of attacking orbital assets remains a stabilizing factor, that factor is shrinking as an increasing number of states acquire capabilities to interrupt space services. Several states are now attempting to develop directed-energy weapons. One of them, Russia, also retains the co-orbital ASAT capability that the Soviet Union developed during the Cold War and has since sold GPS jammers to anyone with the funds to purchase them. As has been the case since the dawn of the space age, any state with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons has the basic components to field a crude but highly destructive ASAT weapon. 16 The proliferation of such threats is troubling, and anxieties have become more acute now that China has begun experimenting with directed-energy weapons and has demonstrated a capability to destroy satellites in low earth orbit (LEO) with a direct-ascent kinetic ASAT weapon. 17 Unfortunately, the infrastructure, policies, and attitudes that both enable and constrain U.S. space operations in the current environment are, in many ways, unchanged from when they were developed during the MAD-induced stability of the Cold War. This leaves the United States exposed to the risk of a surprise attack in space unless a deterrence regime can be developed to restore first-strike stability in that domain. 18<br />

Specifically, it undermines the credibility of our nuclear punishment<br />
Morgan 10 [Forrest E. Morgan Senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, Deterrence and First-Strike Stability in Space A Preliminary Assessment,Prepared for the United States Air Force 2010]<br />
While many options exist for punishing space aggressors and reducing the benefits of their attacks, nearly all of them depend to some degree on improvements in SSA. Poor SSA undermines the credibility of threats of punishment in some scenarios, as the attacker may expect to have a reasonable chance of striking anonymously. Conversely, good SSA has intrinsic deterrent value, because any prospective aggressor, knowing that culpability for an attack might be quickly determined and exposed to the world, would have to weigh the long-term costs of angering the United States and international community, even if no immediate capability existed to inflict punishment. All active defenses require better SSA than what current capabilities provide, and many passive defenses could also be improved with better SSA. Lack of effective SSA could both inhibit the United States from taking reprisals against covert space aggressors and create risks that unjustified reprisals may be taken in response to natural satellite failures occurring during a crisis. Better SSA will improve diagnostic capabilities, helping operators to distinguish satellite malfunction from attack more quickly and reliably, thereby enhancing first-strike stability in space. Improving SSA should be one of the United States’ top priorities in its efforts to develop the capabilities needed for an effective space deterrence regime.<br />

3 scenarios for extinction:<br />
<br />
1st is EMP and 2nd is biological warfare<br />
Mark Schneider, July 2008. Senior Analyst with the National Institute for Public Policy, Ph.D in history at the University of Southern California and JD from George Washington University, former senior officer in the DoD in positions relating to arms control and nuclear weapons policy. “The Future of the U.S. Nuclear Deterrent,” Comparative Strategy 27.4, Ebsco.<br />
<br />
According to the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review, the United States must maintain a “robust nuclear deterrent, which remains a keystone of U.S. national power.”98 The reason should be self evident—without a nuclear deterrent the United States could be destroyed as an industrial civilization and our conventional forces could be defeated by a state with grossly inferior conventional capability but powerful WMD. We cannot afford to ignore existing and growing threats to the very existence of the United States as a national entity. Missile defenses and conventional strike capabilities, while critically important elements of deterrence and national power, simply can't substitute for nuclear deterrence. In light of the emerging “strategic partnership” between Russia and China and their emphasis on nuclear weapons it would be foolish indeed to size U.S. strategic nuclear forces as if the only threat we face is that of rogue states and discard the requirement that the U.S. nuclear deterrent be “second to none.” Ignoring the PRC nuclear threat because of Chinese “no first use” propaganda is just as irresponsible. Absent a nuclear deterrent to their WMD use, rogue states could defeat our forces by the combination of few nuclear EMP weapons and large chemical and biological attacks. The situation would be much worse if they build a more extensive nuclear strike capability as has been reported. Freezing U.S. nuclear forces at the technical level of the Reagan administration will assure that, within two decades, Russia, China, India, and probably others will be technically superior and U.S. deterrence ability against CBW attack will be reduced. United States nuclear forces must be modernized and tailored to enhance deterrence and damage limitation against the rogue WMD threat. WMD capabilities have given otherwise inconsequential states the ability to kill millions of people. The right combination of missile defense and conventional and nuclear strike capabilities provide the best deterrent and damage limiting capability against the rogue state threat. We must not ignore the requirement to provide extended deterrence to our allies. British and French nuclear forces are not large enough, and these nations are not perceived as tough enough, to provide a deterrent for NATO Europe against Russia. In the Far East, there is literally no nuclear deterrent capability against China other than that provided by the United States. Failure to provide a credible deterrent will result in a wave of nuclear proliferation with serious national security implications. When dealing with the rogue states, the issue is not the size of the U.S. nuclear deterrent but the credibility of its use in response to chemical or biological weapons use and its ability to conduct low collateral damage nuclear attacks against WMD capabilities and delivery systems including very hard underground facilities for purposes of damage limitation. We must also have the capability to respond promptly. The United States nuclear guarantee is a major deterrent to proliferation. If we do not honor that guarantee, or devalue it, many more nations will obtain nuclear weapons. If arms control really becomes a substitute for nuclear deterrence and defense, it may very well precipitate the most destructive war in history. Effective verification is essentially impossible, and verification is not a substitute for compliance. Today, arms control has become part of the problem rather than a solution to the problem. The abolition of the in-kind deterrent to CBW use—which deterred CBW use in World War II—is making the world more unsafe almost on a daily basis. The START and Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaties prevent or inhibit the development of conventional strike capabilities with enhanced ability to counter WMD. The demise of the ABM Treaty, while very useful, does not completely address the problem of legacy arms control and its constraints upon U.S. conventional capabilities.<br />

Lastly, the United States should take steps to reduce the vulnerability of the nation and the military to attacks with weapons designed to produce elec- tromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects. We make this recommendation although the Commission is divided over how imminent a threat this is. Some com- missioners believe it to be a high priority threat, given foreign activities and terrorist intentions. Others see it as a serious potential threat, given the high level of vulnerability. Those vulnerabilities are of many kinds. U.S. power projection forces might be subjected to an EMP attack by an enemy calculat- ing—mistakenly—that such an attack would not involve risks of U.S. nuclear retaliation. The homeland might be attacked by terrorists or even state actors with an eye to crippling the U.S. economy and American society. From a technical perspective, it is possible that such attacks could have catastrophic consequences. For example, successful attacks could shut down the electrical system, disable the internet and computers and the economic activity on which they depend, incapacitate transportation systems (and thus the deliv- ery of food and other goods), etc.<br />

Then there are the dolorous consequences of a potential collapse of the world's financial architecture. For decades now, Americans have enjoyed the advantages of being at the center of that system. The worldwide use of the dollar, and the stability of our economy, among other things, made it easier for us to run huge budget deficits, as we counted on foreigners to pick up the tab by buying dollar-denominated assets as a safe haven. Will this be possible in the future? Meanwhile, traditional foreign-policy challenges are multiplying. The threat from al Qaeda and Islamic terrorist affiliates has not been extinguished. Iran and North Korea are continuing on their bellicose paths, while Pakistan and Afghanistan are progressing smartly down the road to chaos. Russia's new militancy and China's seemingly relentless rise also give cause for concern. If America now tries to pull back from the world stage, it will leave a dangerous power vacuum. The stabilizing effects of our presence in Asia, our continuing commitment to Europe, and our position as defender of last resort for Middle East energy sources and supply lines could all be placed at risk. In such a scenario there are shades of the 1930s, when global trade and finance ground nearly to a halt, the peaceful democracies failed to cooperate, and aggressive powers led by the remorseless fanatics who rose up on the crest of economic disaster exploited their divisions. Today we run the risk that rogue states may choose to become ever more reckless with their nuclear toys, just at our moment of maximum vulnerability. The aftershocks of the financial crisis will almost certainly rock our principal strategic competitors even harder than they will rock us. The dramatic free fall of the Russian stock market has demonstrated the fragility of a state whose economic performance hinges on high oil prices, now driven down by the global slowdown. China is perhaps even more fragile, its economic growth depending heavily on foreign investment and access to foreign markets. Both will now be constricted, inflicting economic pain and perhaps even sparking unrest in a country where political legitimacy rests on progress in the long march to prosperity. None of this is good news if the authoritarian leaders of these countries seek to divert attention from internal travails with external adventures.<br />

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE.<br />

3rd is transition wars<br />
Patrick M. Morgan, and T.V. Paul, 2009. professor of political science and the Tierney Chair in Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of California, Irvine; and Professor of International Relations at McGill University. Complex Deterrence: Strategy In the Global Age, p. 9-11.<br />
Among the great powers (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council), nuclear weapons are largely seen as a hedge against the emergence of great-power conflict in the future. The great-power relationships in the post-cold war era are characterized by “recessed general deterrence,” or dissuasion, in which states do not expect immediate militarized conflict, but weapons are kept in the background as insurance given the inherent uncertainties of world politics. The end of the cold war witnessed substantial changes in the deterrence dynamics involving great powers, and, as a result, general deterrence and dissuasion became operational concepts. Although they do maintain large arsenals, neither the United States nor Russia is presumed to hold automatic launch-on-warming attack plans, anymore, although some elements of the previous era are continuing. In addition, they have reduced the number of weapons they possess, although the numbers still exceed a minimum nuclear deterrence posture. The three other old nuclear powers—China, the United Kingdom, and France—also have been maintaining their smaller arsenals, but this might change as Chinese nuclear force modernization plans come to fruition in the coming decades. The logic behind the maintenance of nuclear capabilities is that the great powers want to be prepared in case their relations deteriorate in the future. Nuclear capability can also be construed as an assurance against the expansionist pathologies of great powers as described in perspectives such as offensive realism. Moreover, uncertainties in Russia and China give pause to Western nuclear powers, while, for Moscow, the fear of American influence in its former spheres in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is the cardinal source of anxiety. For the rising power, China, nuclear weapons offer a major insurance against direct assault on its strategic sphere, allowing it to rise peacefully. Nuclear weapons also offer a limited but crucial deterrent against potential conflict escalation between the United States and China involving Taiwan. The great-power deterrence calculations are thus based on “recessed general deterrence” as well as “existential deterrence”: no immediate expectations of war exist among them. However, as Patrick Morgan states, “if serious conflicts emerge again, then deterrence will be in vogue—if not, at least for a lengthy period, then deterrence will operate offstage, held in reserve, and will not be the cornerstone of security management for the system.” This does not mean that the relations in the U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China dyads would remain the same in the long run. Power transition has invariably been turbulent in the international system, and herein lies the role that nuclear weapons may play in deterring a transition war. U.S.-Russia relations could deteriorate, and deterrence could become more relevant if tensions build up over the establishment of missile defenses in Eastern Europe and over Russian efforts to repudiate major arms-control agreements in its effort to regain its lost superpower status. As discussed in Morgan and Paul’s chapter in this volume, nuclear deterrent in this context has offered the major powers greater maneuverability. It has allowed the major power states to sustain their credentials as system managers and has prevented the emergence of active security dilemmas among them that can be caused by conventional arms races and technological breakthroughs. Absent the fear of existential wars, the potentially rival states have engaged in greater economic interactions. The increasing trade relations between the United States and China and China and India, an emerging power, suggest that general nuclear deterrence may offer economic spin-off benefits. To some extent, the stability in relations among the great powers, with no war in sight between them, points to the pacifying role that nuclear weapons may be playing, although other causes are present as well. In that sense, nuclear weapons may act as crucial factors in preventing a power-transition war akin to those that the world experienced in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For Russia, the superpower that declined, nuclear deterrence offers an opportunity not to be excessively alarmed by the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.<br />

<br />
Let me then state my most important conclusion directly: I believe nuclear weapons must have an abiding place in the international scene for the foreseeable future. I believe that the world, in fact, would become more dangerous, not less dangerous, were U.S. nuclear weapons to be absent. The most important role for our nuclear weapons is to serve as a “sobering force,” one that can cap the level of destruction of military conflicts and thus force all sides to come to their senses. This is the enduring purpose of U.S. nuclear weapons in the post-Cold War world. I regret that we have not yet captured such thinking in our public statements as to why the U.S. will retain nuclear deterrence as a cornerstone of our defense policy, and urge that we do so in the upcoming Nuclear Posture Review. Nuclear deterrence becomes in my view a “countervailing” force and, in fact, a potent antidote to military aggression on the part of nations. But to succeed in harnessing this power, effective nuclear weapons strategies and policies are necessary ingredients to help shape and maintain a stable and peaceful world.<br />

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force’s first Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) satellite launched Sept. 25 and is transmitting signals that indicate it is functioning normally and ready to begin orbital maneuvers, prime contractor Boeing Space &amp; Intelligence Systems announced Sept. 26. The long-delayed SBSS spacecraft is designed to use a gimbaled optical telescope to keep tabs on objects in geostationary orbit from its vantage point in low Earth orbit. The satellite was built by Seal Beach, Calif.-based Boeing and Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp. of Boulder, Colo. The SBSS satellite was carried to orbit by an Orbital Sciences Corp.-assembled Minotaur 4 rocket that launched out of Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Boeing operators at Schriever Air Force Base, Colo., received the first signals from the spacecraft indicating it is healthy and ready to begin a two-week checkout phase, a company press release said. After that, payload testing will begin, and Boeing plans to hand the satellite over to the Air Force within 60 days. This was the first orbital launch of the Minotaur 4, which uses refurbished U.S. strategic missile hardware for its first three stages with a commercial fourth-stage motor. The Minotaur 4 was supposed to make its debut a year ago until the Air Force discovered a problem with the rocket’s third-stage motor. A gas generator continued to run after the motor shut off, creating residual thrust that is a problem for a rocket designed to put a satellite into a very precise orbit. New hardware had to be designed and built to correct the problem.<br />

&quot;SBSS will help make our space assets safer and more secure, keeping America at the forefront of space,&quot; says Col. J.R. Jordan, SBSS mission director. &quot;This satellite is going to revolutionize the way we track objects in space by not being constrained by weather, the atmosphere or the time of day. This capability will be essential to our space situational awareness architecture for the near future and beyond.&quot; Equipped with an 11.8-inch telescope and 2.4 megapixel focal plane, the craft will use its optical eyes to image the sky and provide analysts the data they need to keep better tabs on space debris and guard against accidental collisions. What's more, the reconnaissance provided by SBSS will watch for potential risks posed to the military's communications, navigation, weather and spy satellites by enemy interference. &quot;Every day, threats to our nation's valuable satellites and space platforms are growing,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;SBSS will revolutionize our ability to find and monitor objects that could harm the space assets we depend on for security, communications, weather forecasting and many other essential services.&quot; Accidental smashups, such as last year's crash between an Iridium telephone bird and a defunct Russian craft, or the earlier Chinese anti-satellite test that destroyed a spacecraft illustrate how Earth orbit has become a contested environment. Enhancing situational awareness in space has become a major objective for the military. Putting a satellite into orbit to scan the sky will narrow gaps in ground-based space tracking that is limited by geographic locations, nighttime viewing and clouds. &quot;Space situational awareness is an essential component to maintaining space superiority. The benefits that SBSS brings is that by operating solely in space the SBSS satellite will circumvent the current terrestrial restrictions and limitations of weather, Earth line-of-sight and nighttime-only operations. This capability that SBSS will deliver will triple the probability of event detection, double the sensitivity and increase capacity by 10 times,&quot; said Lt. Col. Robert Erickson, SBSS Space Situational Awareness Squadron commander. The Boeing Co. leads the SBSS project and Ball Aerospace built the satellite based on the BCP-2000 bus. A pair of solar wings feed the craft's electricity needs, a two-axis gimbal enables rapid pointing of the optics and the onboard computer can be reprogrammed with updates. &quot;The big advantage from a design perspective of SBSS is by having the camera on a two-axis gimbal we can very rapidly point and take pictures of the sky where we like. That agility is very important,&quot; said Todd Citron, Boeing's director of advanced space and intelligence systems. &quot;The onboard computer that Boeing supplies we can upload new algorithms over time and continue to improve the performance on-orbit.&quot; Early on-orbit testing and commissioning activities for SBSS will last several months. Also, maneuvers are planned to raise the orbit by more than 50 miles to the intended operational perch. Acceptance of the satellite into full service is slated to occur by next spring. So how exactly does the SBSS observing process work? &quot;The system receives tasking from the Joint Space Operations Center. It takes that tasking and converts it into commands that go up to the spacecraft. This satellite has a digital camera that's on a two-axis gimbal. So the commands sent up to the satellite basically tell the satellite where to point the camera and to take a picture. That data then is downlinked to a ground site,&quot; Citron said. &quot;That information could either be what's referred to as metric data -- basically positional information on the objects we're viewing that would allow one to compute orbits, or also it could be what's called space object identification, or SOI, information which one could use to perhaps get a sense of what kind of object one is looking at.&quot; However, officials won't say exactly what size objects SBSS can see. &quot;We will say there are a lot of objects up there that we've lost track on and there are a lot of objects that we think we'll be able to observe that we haven't been able to observe previously. We're going to improve that database and actual tracking on a daily basis,&quot; Jordan said. Many thousands of objects are routinely tracked by the military today using ground-based radars and telescopes. But there's vastly more bits and pieces of space junk circling the planet not being watched that could damage spacecraft that are woven into daily life, such as commercial television satellites. &quot;I think it's clear that our country is very dependent on space,&quot; Citron said. &quot;To the person on the street this is a critical element of ensuring that things essential to our economy and our health as a nation continue.&quot; And even the military's Global Positioning System constellation of satellites has become an intergal part of everyday civilian life. &quot;Just about everything you do is synchronized to GPS time, from your banking transactions or point-of-sale purchases with your credit card and so forth. If that capability went away, it would have a tremendous impact on the economy,&quot; Citron said. &quot;So our economy and our military are very dependent on space, which makes it a potential target for adversaries. Understanding what's going on in space is very important...That's the motivation for space situational awareness.&quot; The SBSS has a seven-year design life, and additional surveillance satellites could be envisioned to further improve the observing capacity. &quot;The Air Force, in general, is pursuing what the longterm architecture should be for space situational awareness. We've been doing our own studies of architectures and when you look at various tradeoffs in terms of the constellation we certainly see advantages to having more than one satellite up there,&quot; Citron said.<br />

Space-Monitoring Satellite Will Enhance Global Security. November 18th, 2010. Timothy A. Ridout. A Massachusetts native, Tim Ridout majored in government at Wesleyan University. In May 2011, he received a master's degree in law and diplomacy from the Fletcher School at Tufts University. At Fletcher, he focused on international security studies and US foreign policy.)<br />
In September, the United States Air Force launched the first satellite capable of monitoring outer space. Currently, the USAF watches objects in Earth orbit through a ground-based system of radar and optical sensors scattered around the globe. Though this Space Surveillance Network is the best in the world, it is insufficient to ensure the security of the hundreds of satellites that are integral to modern life. When the new Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) satellite is operational in about six months, it will be a dramatic improvement. We all depend on satellites, whether or not we know it. From civilian uses such as TV, Internet, banking, GPS, agriculture, and weather forecasting, to military functions such as guiding munitions, operating Predator drones, gathering intelligence, enforcing arms control agreements, and monitoring missile launches, the value of satellites is incalculable. Unfortunately, as Earth orbit becomes crowded and actors proliferate, security threats increase. The anarchy and volatility of outer space are reduced only insofar as we know what is happening there -- a concept known as space situational awareness (SSA). Laws and norms protecting against aggression and harmful negligence are essentially worthless if actions cannot be reliably attributed to guilty parties. Without accurate information, punishment is nearly impossible and its deterrent effect is minimal. Imagine trying to arrest a robber based solely on the description provided by a blind person. Imagine further that all would-be robbers knew beforehand that the only likely witness would be blind. The SBSS satellite gives us eyes. It has a mounted sensor that is capable of pivoting, allowing the camera to focus on different areas of outer space without having to reposition the satellite itself. This enables ground controllers to quickly and frequently shift the area under observation, giving them broad monitoring capabilities without wasting the satellite's valuable fuel. The satellite will be able to track launches, debris, satellites, and other objects without being &quot;encumbered by terrestrial limitations of weather, day-and-night restrictions,&quot; said Lt. Col. Robert Erickson, SBSS Space Situational Awareness Squadron commander. &quot;It enables the (Joint Space Operations Center) to collect data when they need it, not when a ground asset may be able to see the target.&quot; Simply put, it will give us more and better information. This greater awareness of outer space activity can be used to enhance the effectiveness of international laws and norms, or to provide a deterrent to nefarious activity through the credible threat of retaliation. Both avenues will likely be pursued by international actors. Imagine that an American satellite is destroyed by colliding with another object. In debating how to respond, it would be essential to know whether that object was a &quot;space mine&quot; intentionally placed in the path of the satellite's orbit, or if the object was merely a piece of errant debris, perhaps a spent rocket casing left over from an old Apollo mission. If it could be accurately determined that the object was, in fact, a space mine deployed by a specific country, the United States could publicly denounce the guilty party and seek restitution through appropriate international legal channels, maybe taking the case to the UN Security Council. Alternatively, the United States could retaliate against that party in a way deemed proportionate to the offense committed. Though the latter option is more risky, both would enhance space security in the long run by making known the ever-increasing possibility of being caught and by simultaneously providing assured, predictable punishments for transgressions. Although the United States has the best space-monitoring capabilities, places like China, Europe, and India will inevitably catch up. As their SSA improves, so will outer space security due to more accurate information and more observing parties. Mutual monitoring has been highly effective at enforcing arms control agreements and avoiding nuclear exchanges since the Cold War. At the height of U.S.-Soviet tensions, early-warning systems allowed both sides to detect potential missile launches with enough advanced notice to retaliate, thereby eliminating the incentive to strike first, and reconnaissance satellites enabled each country to verify that the other was meeting its arms control obligations. In general, transparency of capabilities and intent are widely acknowledged to reduce misunderstanding and conflict. Though monitoring outer space presents a greater technical challenge than monitoring Earth, this wisdom still applies. Thus, making space safe and secure for both satellites and space travel will depend largely on enhancing space situational awareness. Ground-based monitoring will continue to play an important role, but space-based surveillance is the way of the future.<br />

As the results presented in the previous section indicate, both proliferation opti- mists and proliferation pessimists find validation for some of their key claims. Kenneth Waltz and other proponents of nuclear deterrence find strong empirical sup- port for their claims that nuclear powers are less likely to fight one another—nuclear weapons may indeed help explain the Long Peace. Nevertheless, Scott Sagan and other proliferation pessimists find support for their concerns. At lower levels of escalation, nuclear symmetry does not appear to have a pacifying effect. Worse yet, nuclear asymmetry is generally associated with a higher chance of crises, uses of force, fatalities, and war. On balance, however, these findings support the broader themes of this journal issue. Nuclear weapons do not affect the frequency of conflict, but they do affect the timing, intensity, and outcome of conflict. This study demon- strates that nuclear weapons tend to shift the intensity of disputes toward the lower end of the conflict scale.<br />

All their turns are inevitable - zero chances of willful US restraint – we’ll inevitably be engaged globally – the only question is effectiveness<br />
Shalmon and Horowitz 09 (Dan, total badass, Mike, less of a badass, Orbis, Spring)<br />
It is important to recognize at the outset two key points about United States strategy and the potential costs and benefits for the United States in a changing security environment. First, the United States is very likely to remain fully engaged in global affairs. Advocates of restraint or global withdrawal, while popular in some segments of academia, remain on the margins of policy debates in Washington D.C. This could always change, of course. However, at present, it is a given that the United States will define its interests globally and pursue a strategy that requires capable military forces able to project power around the world. Because ‘‘indirect’’ counter-strategies are the rational choice for actors facing a strong state’s power projection, irregular/asymmetric threats are inevitable given America’s role in the global order.24<br />

Weakened deterrent causes the US to rely on preemption --- triggers your impacts<br />
Jeffrey Record, 7/8/2004. Professor in the Department of Strategy and International Security at the U.S. Air Force's Air War College. “Nuclear Deterrence, Preventive War, and Counterproliferation,” CATO, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3733:http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa519.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa519.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa519.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3733 -->.<br />
<br />
The challenges of sustaining credible deterrence must be judged against the risks and penalties of preventive war, which have been on display ever since the United States convinced itself that a horrific Iraqi assault on the United States or U.S. interests over- seas was inevitable and acted accordingly. Again, according to Gray: [The United States] has no practical choice other than to make of deterrence all that it can be, albeit in some seem- ingly unpromising situations. If this view is rejected, the grim implication is that the United States, as sheriff of the world order, will require heroic performance from those policy instruments charged with cutting-edge duties on behalf of preemptive or preventive military operations. Preemption or prevention have their obvious attractions as contrasted with deterrence, at least when they work. But they carry the risk of encouraging a hopeless quest for total security. In order for it to be sensible to regard preemption as an occasional stratagem, rather than as the operational concept of choice, it is essential that the United States wring whatever effectiveness it can out of a strategy of deterrence.<br />

Enhancing SSA is also related to reducing the likelihood and effectiveness of attacks against US satellites. That the US must improve its SSA is accepted as fact by nearly all policymakers, practitioners, and commentators. If SSA is good enough, it can provide enough information about attacks to attribute them to an adversary, mitigate their effects, or avoid them altogether.<br />

<span class="Underline">A new U.S. Air Force satellite will provide the first full-time, space-based surveillance of hundreds of satellites and thousands of pieces of debris that could crash into American and allied assets circling the Earth. If all goes as planned, the Space-Based Space Surveillance satellite, scheduled for a July 8 launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., will have an unobstructed, around-the-clock view of the increasingly heavy traffic in Earth orbit -- something the Air Force doesn't have now. Currently, the Air Force relies on a ground-based network of radar and optical telescopes around the globe to monitor about 1,000 active satellites and 20,000 pieces of debris. The telescopes can be used only on clear nights, and not all radar stations are powerful enough to detect satellites in deep space orbit, about 22,000 miles from Earth. From its orbit about 390 miles above the Earth, the new satellite will have a clear view of deep space. &quot;It really has tremendous capabilities,&quot; said Todd Citron, director of advanced space and intelligence systems for Boeing Co., prime contractor for the satellite, known as SBSS. Citron said SBSS will revolutionize &quot;space situational awareness,&quot; the military term for knowing not only where the objects are, but where they're headed and what might be in their path.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Their assessment of the strategic imbalance rests on fairly solid empirical data on the characteristics of the Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals, particularly their numbers, explosive yields, and ranges. But high confidence in their estimates of U.S. missile accuracy is unwarranted. Such estimates of missile inaccuracy (circular error probable) found in the public domain vary widely (by 30 percent or more), and their estimates lie on the optimistic end of the spectrum. (The real data are classified and so it is next to impossible to validate any model’s estimates.) Actual accuracy achieved in wartime may also diverge from accuracy demonstrated in peacetime missile tests. The professors assume that accuracy could decline by as much as 20 percent in wartime, but what if their un-degraded peacetime estimate was too optimistic and the 20 percent wartime degradation came on top of it, resulting in a cumulative deviation of, say 40-50 percent from their baseline accuracy figure? The professors’ sensitivity analysis of the effects of degraded accuracy on target destruction is thus too circumscribed, and they do not adequately inform the reader that the probabilities of destroying Russian hard targets such as missile silos would plummet if U.S. missiles missed their targets by a considerably greater distance than assumed by their model </span><br />

<span class="Underline">In sum, aircraft have several distinct advantages over spacecraft in regard to theater ISR collection, but space-derived surveillance and reconnaissance information is critical to diplomatic and military operations because it provides a &quot;first look&quot; into denied areas and at the battlespace and assists planners in finding and coarsely geolocating many targets before terrestrial forces move into the region. As a rule of thumb, today's space-derived surveillance and reconnaissance is useful in finding 80 percent of the targets and is able to determine their location to roughly 80 percent of the accuracy required to conduct precision strikes. In some cases, space systems do better than 80 percent in finding and fixing targets, and in other cases, they do worse. What is important is the tremendous advantage space systems provide politicians and commanders by giving them a highquality first look into the situation they face. With this information, they are able to make decisions about how to employ their limited terrestrial surveillance and reconnaissance assets (aircraft, ships, submarines, reconnaissance ground forces, etc.) more efficiently to refine the surveillance and reconnaissance picture to the quality they desire for the operations they are considering. In some cases, the first look from space may suffice, but usually terrestrial surveillance and reconnaissance assets are required. During combat operations, space-based surveillance and reconnaissance sensors continue to provide data, filling gaps in coverage by theater assets. Space-based surveillance and reconnaissance sensors also frequently cue terrestrially based sensors, as was the case during the Gulf War with missile warning satellites cueing Patriot batteries to intercept Iraq's inbound Scud missiles. Perhaps most important of all, day in and day out, during war and peace, spacepower provides the 80 percent first look on a global scale. It allows analysts to watch the world and report tip-offs, warnings, and indications that give political and military leaders the freedom to employ their terrestrial forces more expeditiously and with greater confidence that another threat is not more pressing. Spacepower literally watches the backs of terrestrial forces to make sure no threat is sneaking up behind them. This allows greater concentration of terrestrial forces in theaters of combat operations because space-based surveillance and reconnaissance assets are sufficient to act as a kind of global sentry. This sort of mission is ideally suited to space systems because they have unimpeded access around the globe and relatively few assets are required to sustain surveillance and reconnaissance missions on a global scale. Much more is possible. By increasing the number of low Earth orbiting sensors, continuously improving the quality of the sensors, and developing the means to service and repair them (either on orbit or by recovery and relaunch), the 80 percent rule of thumb will creep closer toward the 100 percent solution, despite the warfighter's demand for ever-increasing precision. As space systems becomes more capable, is it likely that they will replace terrestrial forms of surveillance and reconnaissance collection? No. Aerial reconnaissance did not eliminate the need for land and sea forces to conduct reconnaissance of their own. There is no reason to believe that space-based reconnaissance will replace any other form of reconnaissance either. Spacepower does not usurp missions from other forces. Spacepower assets give a state new core competencies for its military order of battle. The ability to do anything continuously on a global scale is a new contribution to warfare made possible by spacepower. The various C4ISR capabilities, including weather observation, missile warning, and navigation and timing broadcasts, give space-enabled forces a distinct asymmetric advantage over adversaries in the opening days of the 21st century. This advantage will evaporate over time as other actors on the world stage develop, lease, or borrow similar capabilities. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">First-strike instability is made worse by limitations in space situational awareness (SSA). While the United States enjoys better SSA than any other spacefaring nation, it is still dangerously limited. Not all satellites are monitored constantly, and only limited diagnostic and environmental monitoring capabilities exist even for those that are, making it difficult to diagnose causes of sudden satellite failure. Knowing this, adversaries might be tempted to attack satellites covertly, believing that uncertainty regarding the causes of failure would impede retribution, or perhaps even that attacks would be misdiagnosed as naturally occurring failures. Alternatively, a natural failure that occurs during a confrontation or conflict could lead operators or policymakers to assume that the satellite was attacked, prompting unjustified retribution and subsequent escalation of the crisis. This dangerous combination of continued vulnerability, growing dependence, and limited SSA indicate that first-strike stability in space has diminished, and further indications suggest that the rate of erosion is accelerating. While the difficulty of attacking orbital assets remains a stabilizing factor, that factor is shrinking as an increasing number of states acquire capabilities to interrupt space services. Several states are now attempting to develop directed-energy weapons. One of them, Russia, also retains the co-orbital ASAT capability that the Soviet Union developed during the Cold War and has since sold GPS jammers to anyone with the funds to purchase them. As has been the case since the dawn of the space age, any state with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons has the basic components to field a crude but highly destructive ASAT weapon. 16 The proliferation of such threats is troubling, and anxieties have become more acute now that China has begun experimenting with directed-energy weapons and has demonstrated a capability to destroy satellites in low earth orbit (LEO) with a direct-ascent kinetic ASAT weapon. 17 Unfortunately, the infrastructure, policies, and attitudes that both enable and constrain U.S. space operations in the current environment are, in many ways, unchanged from when they were developed during the MAD-induced stability of the Cold War. This leaves the United States exposed to the risk of a surprise attack in space unless a deterrence regime can be developed to restore first-strike stability in that domain. 18</span><br />

<span class="Underline">While many options exist for punishing space aggressors and reducing the benefits of their attacks, nearly all of them depend to some degree on improvements in SSA. Poor SSA undermines the credibility of threats of punishment in some scenarios, as the attacker may expect to have a reasonable chance of striking anonymously. Conversely, good SSA has intrinsic deterrent value, because any prospective aggressor, knowing that culpability for an attack might be quickly determined and exposed to the world, would have to weigh the long-term costs of angering the United States and international community, even if no immediate capability existed to inflict punishment. All active defenses require better SSA than what current capabilities provide, and many passive defenses could also be improved with better SSA. Lack of effective SSA could both inhibit the United States from taking reprisals against covert space aggressors and create risks that unjustified reprisals may be taken in response to natural satellite failures occurring during a crisis. Better SSA will improve diagnostic capabilities, helping operators to distinguish satellite malfunction from attack more quickly and reliably, thereby enhancing first-strike stability in space. Improving SSA should be one of the United States’ top priorities in its efforts to develop the capabilities needed for an effective space deterrence regime. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">As stated in 2008 by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, U.S. policy with regard to Russia is clearly in the process of change.63 Even before the Russian invasion of Georgia, Secretary of Defense Gates was forced to fire the senior leadership of the Air Force because they simply refused to take the nuclear deterrence mission seriously. There are many causes for this that are beyond the scope of this paper, but the key changes in policy are reflected in Secretary Gate's statement that the nuclear weapons “stewardship remains our most sensitive mission.” Moreover, Secretary Gates observed that, “As Russia and China continue to modernize their strategic nuclear capabilities, as Iran drives relentlessly toward a nuclear weapons capability, as proliferation of weapons of mass destruction continues to be a challenge, a smaller yet still powerful nuclear deterrent remains an essential component of our national defense.”64 Secretary Gates pointed at the Russian strategy of using nuclear weapons in limited war and linked that specifically to our requirements: “So, to the extent that they rely more and more on their nuclear capabilities, as opposed to what historically has been a huge Russian conventional military capability, it seems to me that it underscores the importance of our sustaining a valid—a nuclear deterrent—a modern nuclear deterrent.”65 The Russian invasion of Georgia is a clear turning point. Domination of the former Soviet states was always a Russian objective. This was never the case, and the invasion Georgia has raised the possibility that Russia will use force against former Soviet or Warsaw Pact states. Russian journalist Alexander Golts summed up the current situation: “For the first time in several years the members of this group adopted a political statement without Moscow's participation. The reason is clear: the statement was addressed to Moscow. The foreign ministers of the United States, Great Britain, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, and Italy are sternly demanding that Russia agree to the Georgian cease-fire proposals … And really, why should Russia, which has risen from its knees and gotten into a tank, now participate in all these G8s? After all, Vladimir Putin, 'our forever,' is temporarily unable to attend the summits.”66</span><br />

<span class="Underline">In such an environment of international lawlessness and heightened alarm over military threats, otherwise minor contretemps and even fears of a neighbor's and potential adversary's intents can spark a conflict - and a conflagration. The world has been on edge for a decade now and a form of numbing has set in with many of its inhabitants; a permanent condition of war apprehension and alert has settled over others, particularly those in areas likely to be directly affected. Over the past six years the worst and most immediate fears have centered on the prospects of three major regional conflicts, all of which are fraught with the danger of eventual escalation into nuclear exchanges. The three are a renewed and intensified Indian-Pakistani conflict, an outbreak of hostilities on the Korean Peninsula and an attack by the US, Israel or both in unison against Iran. The first would affect neighbors both in possession of nuclear weapons and a combined population of 1,320,000,000. The second could set Northeast Asia afire with China and Russia, both having borders with North Korea, inevitably being pulled into the vortex. The last could lead to an explosion in the Persian Gulf and throughout the Middle East, with the potential of spilling over into the Caspian Sea Basin, Central and South Asia, the Caucasus and even the Balkans, as the US and NATO have strategic air bases in Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Iraq, Afghanistan and, at least for the time being, Kyrgyzstan that would be employed in any major assault on Iran and the latter would retaliate against both land- and sea-based threats as best it could. In the event that any of the three scenarios reached the level of what in a humane and sensible world would be considered the unthinkable - the use of nuclear weapons - the cataclysmic consequences both for the respective regions involved and for the world would be incalculable. Theoretically, though, all three nightmare models could be geographically contained. There is a fourth spot on the map, however, where most any spark could ignite a powder keg that would draw in and pit against each other the world's two major nuclear powers and immediately and ipso facto develop into a world conflict. That area is the Baltic Sea region. In 2003, months before NATO would grant full membership to the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Russian Defense Minister at the time, Sergei Ivanov, warned that such a development would entail the deployment of NATO, including US, warplanes &quot;a three-minute flight away from St. Petersburg,&quot; Russia's second largest city. And just that occurred. NATO air patrols began in 2004 on a three month rotational basis and US warplanes just completed their second deployment on January 4 of this year. Had history occurred otherwise and Soviet warplanes alternated with those of fellow Warsaw Pact nations in patrolling over, say, the St. Lawrence Seaway or the Atlantic Coast off Nova Scotia, official Washington's response wouldn't be hard to imagine or long in coming. A 2005 report by the Natural Resources Defense Council confirmed that the US maintained 480 nuclear bombs in Europe, hosted by six NATO allies, Belgium, Britain, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Turkey. More recent estimates indicate that over 350 American nuclear weapons remain in Europe to the present time. If the six above-mentioned nations continue to host nuclear arms, what would new NATO members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - the first and third currently governed by former US citizens, president Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Valdas Adamkus, respectively - deny the Pentagon? In the interim between the accession of the three Baltic states and former Soviet republics into NATO and now, the Alliance as a whole and the US in particular have expanded their permanent military presence within all three nations: Estonia and Latvia which both border the main body of Russia and Lithuania which abuts the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Failure properly to maintain the U.S. nuclear deterrent – either by deploying a numerically inadequate force structure or by fielding forces that are qualitatively inappropriate to the evolving threats and the attendant deterrent requirements – could very well encourage the rise of aspiring “peer competitors,” thus exacerbating the very proliferation of nuclear weapons we seek to prevent. The Strategic Posture Commission’s interim report identified this risk with respect to future negotiations with Russia and its impact on the U.S.-China nuclear balance: “The Commission is prepared strongly to endorse negotiations with Russia in order to proceed jointly to further reductions in our nuclear forces, as part of a cooperative effort to stabilize relations, stop proliferation, and promote predictability and transparency. The large Russian arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons must be considered in this regard.”61 The Commission warned though that: “…Any negotiated reduction between Russia and the U.S. should not be carried out in a manner that might incentivize the Chinese to undertake a program to increase their nuclear capabilities in an effort to compete with us.”62 </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The balancing and hedging strategy should involve options to avoid what Traub rightfully describes as &quot;Armageddon.&quot; We call for a myriad of conventional options short of striking the nuclear-armed PRC, in the hope that such a strategy enhances deterrence in the first place and avoids Armageddon should deterrence fail. The strategy aims to slow escalation rather than quicken it. The idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy -- of turning China into an enemy by treating it as one -- is like a unicorn; it is a make believe creature that still has its believers. The United States has done more than any other country to &quot;turn China into a friend&quot; by welcoming it into the international community. Alas, China has not fulfilled this U.S. &quot;prophesy of friendship.&quot; Instead China has built what all credible observers call a destabilizing military that has changed the status quo by holding a gun to Taiwan's head even as Taiwan makes bold attempts at peace, by claiming ever more territory in the South China Sea, and by attempting to bully and intimidate Japan. Traub asks whether our allies and partners will be willing to participate in an &quot;anti-Chinese coalition,&quot; as he describes it. As the paper says, all allies, partners, and potential partners are already modernizing their militaries in response to China. And they will continue to do so regardless of whether the U.S. pursues what Traub would see as an &quot;anti-China&quot; strategy. Even laid-back Australia has plans to double its submarine fleet -- it is not doing so to defend against Fiji. The paper argues that it is time for the United States to offer more serious assistance so that matters do not get out of hand. A strong U.S. presence and commitment to the region's security can help avoid a regional nuclear arms race, for example. The United States can be a force multiplier by providing the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance that only Washington possesses, and by training, and equipping our allies and friends. This strategy is one way of beginning to put Asia back in balance as China changes the status quo. Not doing so, we fear, would lead to Armageddon. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Among the great powers (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council), nuclear weapons are largely seen as a hedge against the emergence of great-power conflict in the future. The great-power relationships in the post-cold war era are characterized by “recessed general deterrence,” or dissuasion, in which states do not expect immediate militarized conflict, but weapons are kept in the background as insurance given the inherent uncertainties of world politics. The end of the cold war witnessed substantial changes in the deterrence dynamics involving great powers, and, as a result, general deterrence and dissuasion became operational concepts. Although they do maintain large arsenals, neither the United States nor Russia is presumed to hold automatic launch-on-warming attack plans, anymore, although some elements of the previous era are continuing. In addition, they have reduced the number of weapons they possess, although the numbers still exceed a minimum nuclear deterrence posture. The three other old nuclear powers—China, the United Kingdom, and France—also have been maintaining their smaller arsenals, but this might change as Chinese nuclear force modernization plans come to fruition in the coming decades. The logic behind the maintenance of nuclear capabilities is that the great powers want to be prepared in case their relations deteriorate in the future. Nuclear capability can also be construed as an assurance against the expansionist pathologies of great powers as described in perspectives such as offensive realism. Moreover, uncertainties in Russia and China give pause to Western nuclear powers, while, for Moscow, the fear of American influence in its former spheres in Eastern Europe and Central Asia is the cardinal source of anxiety. For the rising power, China, nuclear weapons offer a major insurance against direct assault on its strategic sphere, allowing it to rise peacefully. Nuclear weapons also offer a limited but crucial deterrent against potential conflict escalation between the United States and China involving Taiwan. The great-power deterrence calculations are thus based on “recessed general deterrence” as well as “existential deterrence”: no immediate expectations of war exist among them. However, as Patrick Morgan states, “if serious conflicts emerge again, then deterrence will be in vogue—if not, at least for a lengthy period, then deterrence will operate offstage, held in reserve, and will not be the cornerstone of security management for the system.” This does not mean that the relations in the U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China dyads would remain the same in the long run. Power transition has invariably been turbulent in the international system, and herein lies the role that nuclear weapons may play in deterring a transition war. U.S.-Russia relations could deteriorate, and deterrence could become more relevant if tensions build up over the establishment of missile defenses in Eastern Europe and over Russian efforts to repudiate major arms-control agreements in its effort to regain its lost superpower status. As discussed in Morgan and Paul’s chapter in this volume, nuclear deterrent in this context has offered the major powers greater maneuverability. It has allowed the major power states to sustain their credentials as system managers and has prevented the emergence of active security dilemmas among them that can be caused by conventional arms races and technological breakthroughs. Absent the fear of existential wars, the potentially rival states have engaged in greater economic interactions. The increasing trade relations between the United States and China and China and India, an emerging power, suggest that general nuclear deterrence may offer economic spin-off benefits. To some extent, the stability in relations among the great powers, with no war in sight between them, points to the pacifying role that nuclear weapons may be playing, although other causes are present as well. In that sense, nuclear weapons may act as crucial factors in preventing a power-transition war akin to those that the world experienced in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For Russia, the superpower that declined, nuclear deterrence offers an opportunity not to be excessively alarmed by the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Space is a hostile environment. The phenomena resulting from solar emissions can negatively impact the operation of any space system. However, the space environment is better understood today than ever before, but the sun’s activity is continuous and always producing phenomena that will put the operational mission of any space system at risk. This makes space weather monitoring and forecasting a critical mission in regards to space assets. Without the ability to monitor and forecast space weather phenomena, our satellites would become vulnerable which ultimately puts our national security at risk. The discussion that follows provides a discussion of space weather phenomena and impacts, space weather monitoring and forecasting user needs, capability gaps resulting from the dismantled NPOESS program, and the potential solutions offered by small satellites. “The primary force in our corner of the universe is our sun. The sun is constantly radiating enormous amounts of energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum containing x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, and radio waves. The sun also radiates a steady stream of charged particles – primarily protons, electrons, and neutrons – known as the solar wind. [18]” When the energy and charged particles impact the Earth’s atmosphere they interact with spacecraft. The effect of these interactions can negatively impede the operation of the spacecraft. “Space weather effects have the most impact on communications, Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). [4]” For example, solar energetic particles accelerated by a coronal mass ejection (CME) or solar flare can damage electronics onboard spacecraft through induced electric currents, as well as threaten the life of astronauts. Also, changing geomagnetic conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in Low Earth orbit. The space weather effects will always present a threat to the operational mission of those systems. The forces that protect our country’s national security and interests rely on those systems. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that information on the space environment is of paramount interest to the war fighter [18]. The impacts resulting from the three main categories of solar emissions are summarized in Table 5. Since space weather can produce negative effects on spacecraft, there is clearly a need to understand, monitor, and forecast space weather. The military, commercial, and civil sectors have spacecraft performing missions ranging from data collection supporting the national security of the United States to providing GPS directions to millions of travelers across the country. In June 1999 the “Space Weather Architecture Study” was completed to evaluate the ability of the projected baseline support system to mitigate space weather impacts [4]. The study identified and assessed the operational impacts that would be caused by space weather effects. Today the report still serves as a starting point when developing a space architecture that directly studies space weather or uses the data collected to provide support to other space systems. The significance of these impacts is best illustrated by our reliance on space systems. The role of satellite operations has expanded to include an active role in addition to a support role [4]. For example, “In the future, terrestrial weapons will be directly targeted using space” [4]. The Space Weather Architecture Study stated “future National Security operations will require improved capability to accurately locate targets, provide precision navigation, and provide reliable mobile communications in a more time-constrained environment” [4]. Today, over ten years later, our dependence on space systems remains at a critical level providing evidence that it is equally critical to not only monitor and forecast space weather but also to better design satellites to resist these impacts. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">This is the second of two scenarios that consider how U.S. space weapons might create incentives for America’s opponents to behave in dangerous ways. The previous scenario looked at the systemic risk of accidents that could arise from keeping nuclear weapons on high alert to guard against a space weapons attack. This section focuses on the risk that a single accident in space, such as a piece of space debris striking a Russian early-warning satellite, might be the catalyst for an accidental nuclear war. As we have noted in an earlier section, the United States canceled its own ASAT program in the 1980s over concerns that the deployment of these weapons might be deeply destabiliz- ing. For all the talk about a “new relationship” between the United States and Russia, both sides retain thousands of nuclear forces on alert and con•gured to •ght a nuclear war. When briefed about the size and status of U.S. nuclear forces, President George W. Bush reportedly asked “What do we need all these weapons for?”43 The answer, as it was during the Cold War, is that the forces remain on alert to conduct a number of possible contingencies, including a nuclear strike against Russia. This fact, of course, is not lost on the Rus- sian leadership, which has been increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons to compensate for the country’s declining military might. In the mid-1990s, Russia dropped its pledge to refrain from the “•rst use” of nuclear weapons and conducted a series of exercises in which Russian nuclear forces prepared to use nuclear weapons to repel a NATO invasion. In October 2003, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov reiter- ated that Moscow might use nuclear weapons “preemptively” in any number of contingencies, including a NATO attack.44 So, it remains business as usual with U.S. and Russian nuclear forces. And business as usual includes the occasional false alarm of a nuclear attack. There have been several of these incidents over the years. In September 1983, as a relatively new Soviet early-warning satellite moved into position to monitor U.S. missile •elds in North Dakota, the sun lined up in just such a way as to fool the Russian satellite into reporting that half a dozen U.S. missiles had been launched at the Soviet Union. Perhaps mindful that a brand new satel- lite might malfunction, the of•cer in charge of the command center that monitored data from the early-warning satellites refused to pass the alert to his superiors. He reportedly explained his caution by saying: “When people start a war, they don’t start it with only •ve missiles. You can do little damage with just •ve missiles.”45 In January 1995, Norwegian scientists launched a sounding rocket on a trajectory similar to one that a U.S. Trident missile might take if it were launched to blind Russian radars with a high altitude nuclear detonation. The incident was apparently serious enough that, the next day, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated that he had activated his “nuclear football” – a device that allows the Russian president to communicate with his military advisors and review his options for launching his arsenal. In this case, the Russian early-warning satellites could clearly see that no attack was under way and the crisis passed without incident.46 In both cases, Russian observers were con•-dent that what appeared to be a “small” attack was not a fragmentary picture of a much larger one. In the case of the Norwegian sounding rocket, space-based sensors played a crucial role in assuring the Russian leadership that it was not under attack. The Russian command sys-tem, however, is no longer able to provide such reliable, early warning. The dissolution of the Soviet Union cost Moscow several radar stations in newly independent states, creating “attack cor-ridors” through which Moscow could not see an attack launched by U.S. nuclear submarines.47 Further, Russia’s constellation of early-warn-ing satellites has been allowed to decline – only one or two of the six satellites remain operational, leaving Russia with early warning for only six hours a day. Russia is attempting to reconstitute its constellation of early-warning satellites, with several launches planned in the next few years. But Russia will still have limited warning and will depend heavily on its space-based systems to provide warning of an American attack.48 As the previous section explained, the Penta- gon is contemplating military missions in space that will improve U.S. ability to cripple Russian nuclear forces in a crisis before they can execute an attack on the United States. Anti-satellite weapons, in this scenario, would blind Russian reconnaissance and warning satellites and knock out communications satellites. Such strikes might be the prelude to a full-scale attack, or a limited ef- fort, as attempted in a war game at Schriever Air Force Base, to conduct “early deterrence strikes” to signal U.S. resolve and control escalation.49 By 2010, the United States may, in fact, have an arsenal of ASATs (perhaps even on orbit 24/7) ready to conduct these kinds of missions – to coerce opponents and, if necessary, support preemptive attacks. Moscow would certainly have to worry that these ASATs could be used in conjunction with other space-enabled systems – for example, long-range strike systems that could attack targets in less than 90 minutes – to disable Russia’s nuclear deterrent before the Rus- sian leadership understood what was going on. What would happen if a piece of space debris were to disable a Russian early-warning satel-lite under these conditions? Could the Russian military distinguish between an accident in space and the •rst phase of a U.S. attack? Most Russian early-warning satellites are in elliptical Molniya orbits (a few are in GEO) and thus dif•cult to attack from the ground or air. At a minimum, Moscow would probably have some tactical warn-ing of such a suspicious launch, but given the sorry state of Russia’s warning, optical imaging and signals intelligence satellites there is reason to ask the question. Further, the advent of U.S. on-orbit ASATs, as now envisioned50 could make both the more dif•cult orbital plane and any warning systems moot. The unpleasant truth is that the Russians likely would have to make a judgment call. No state has the ability to de•nitively deter-mine the cause of the satellite’s failure. Even the United States does not maintain (nor is it likely to have in place by 2010) a sophisticated space surveillance system that would allow it to distinguish between a satellite malfunction, a debris strike or a deliberate attack – and Russian space surveillance capabilities are much more limited by comparison. Even the risk assessments for col-lision with debris are speculative, particularly for the unique orbits in which Russian early-warning satellites operate. During peacetime, it is easy to imagine that the Russians would conclude that the loss of a satellite was either a malfunction or a debris strike. But how con•dent could U.S. planners be that the Russians would be so calm if the accident in space occurred in tandem with a second false alarm, or occurred during the middle of a crisis? What might happen if the debris strike oc-curred shortly after a false alarm showing a mis-sile launch? False alarms are appallingly common – according to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) experienced 1,172 “moderately seri-ous” false alarms between 1977 and 1983 – an average of almost three false alarms per week. Comparable information is not available about the Russian system, but there is no reason to believe that it is any more reliable.51 Assessing the likelihood of these sorts of co- incidences is dif•cult because Russia has never provided data about the frequency or duration of false alarms; nor indicated how seriously early- warning data is taken by Russian leaders. More- over, there is no reliable estimate of the debris risk for Russian satellites in highly elliptical orbits.52 The important point, however, is that such a coincidence would only appear suspicious if the United States were in the business of disabling satellites – in other words, there is much less risk if Washington does not develop ASATs. The loss of an early-warning satellite could look rather ominous if it occurred during a period of major tension in the relationship. While NATO no longer sees Russia as much of a threat, the same cannot be said of the converse. Despite the warm talk, Russian leaders remain wary of NATO expansion, particularly the effect expan- sion may have on the Baltic port of Kaliningrad. Although part of Russia, Kaliningrad is separated from the rest of Russia by Lithuania and Poland. Russia has already complained about its decreas- ing lack of access to the port, particularly the uncooperative attitude of the Lithuanian govern- ment.53 News reports suggest that an edgy Russia may have moved tactical nuclear weapons into the enclave.54 If the Lithuanian government were to close access to Kaliningrad in a •t of pique, this would trigger a major crisis between NATO and Russia. Under these circumstances, the loss of an early-warning satellite would be extremely suspi-cious. It is any military’s nature during a crisis to interpret events in their worst-case light. For ex- ample, consider the coincidences that occurred in early September 1956, during the extraordinarily tense period in international relations marked by the Suez Crisis and Hungarian uprising.55 On one evening the White House received messages indicating: 1. the Turkish Air Force had gone on alert in response to unidenti•ed aircraft penetrat- ing its airspace; 2. one hundred Soviet MiG-15s were •ying over Syria; 3. a British Canberra bomber had been shot down over Syria, most likely by a MiG; and 4. The Russian •eet was moving through the Dardanelles. Gen. Andrew Goodpaster was reported to have worried that the con•uence of events “might trigger off … the NATO operations plan” that called for a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. Yet, all of these reports were false. The “jets” over Turkey were a •ock of swans; the Soviet MiGs over Syria were a smaller, routine escort returning the president from a state visit to Mos- cow; the bomber crashed due to mechanical dif•culties; and the Soviet •eet was beginning long-scheduled exercises. In an important sense, these were not “coincidences” but rather different manifestations of a common failure – human er- ror resulting from extreme tension of an interna- tional crisis. As one author noted, “The detection and misinterpretation of these events, against the context of world tensions from Hungary and Suez, was the •rst major example of how the size and complexity of worldwide electronic warning systems could, at certain critical times, create momentum of its own.” Perhaps most worrisome, the United States might be blithely unaware of the degree to which the Russians were concerned about its actions and inadvertently escalate a crisis. During the early 1980s, the Soviet Union suffered a major “war scare” during which time its leadership concluded that bilateral relations were rapidly declining. This war scare was driven in part by the rhetoric of the Reagan administration, forti•ed by the selective reading of intelligence. During this period, NATO conducted a major command post exercise, Able Archer, that caused some elements of the Soviet military to raise their alert status. American of•cials were stunned to learn, after the fact, that the Kremlin had been acutely nervous about an American •rst strike during this period.56 All of these incidents have a common theme – that confidence is often the difference between war and peace. In times of crisis, false alarms can have a momentum of their own. As in the second scenario in this monograph, the lesson is that commanders rely on the steady •ow of reli-able information. When that information flow is disrupted – whether by a deliberate attack or an accident – confidence collapses and the re- sult is panic and escalation. Introducing ASAT weapons into this mix is all the more dangerous, because such weapons target the elements of the command system that keep leaders aware, informed and in control. As a result, the mere presence of such weapons is corrosive to the con•dence that allows national nuclear forces to operate safely. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">One major focus of the conference was ESA's SSA programme, and its preparations to launch initial warning services against hazards such as solar storms and magnetic storms. Such natural phenomenon present serious hazards to all satellites in Earth orbit, astronauts on board the ISS and to some infrastructure on the ground, such as communication systems and power distribution networks at northern latitudes. Space weather experts from ESA presented the latest information on current studies to define the first space weather 'precursor services' that will be offered by the SSA system to customers such as satellite operators and developers. The first services are due to be deployed during 2011 and will be followed by more during the course of the SSA Preparatory Programme. &quot;We were very happy to include as part of this year's event, a joint session covering the main SSA space weather activities together with presentations on a broad range of new space weather-focussed R&amp;D studies supported by the European Comission. This was also the first public presentation of these studies, which will be highly complementary to our ongoing SSA work,&quot; said ESA's Alexi Glover, a space weather expert and one of the conference organizers. Solar storms generate large amounts of radiation and particles that can arrive at Earth and harm satellites within less than 24 hours. Satellites orbiting between the Sun and Earth themselves provide some of the best 'early-warning' vantage points. Another SSA study presented at ESWW7 covers identifying the instrumentation that will be needed to perform space-based space weather observations and the optimal locations from which to make these observations. In order to achieve reliable space weather warning services, constant monitoring of the space environment from a range of vantage points on ground and in space will be needed, together with timely dissemination of reliable data to customers. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">(NaturalNews) Forget about the 2012 Mayan calendar, comet Elenin or the Rapture. The real threat to human civilization is far more mundane, and it's right in front of our noses. If Fukushima has taught us anything, it's that just one runaway meltdown of fissionable nuclear material can have wide-ranging and potentially devastating consequences for life on Earth. To date, Fukushima has already released 168 times the total radiation released from the Hiroshima nuclear bomb detonated in 1945, and the Fukushima catastrophe is now undeniably the worst nuclear disaster in the history of human civilization. But what if human civilization faced a far greater threat than a single tsunami destroying a nuclear power facility? What if a global tidal wave could destroy the power generating capacities of all the world's power plants, all at once? Such a scenario is not merely possible, but factually inevitable. And the global tidal wave threatening all the nuclear power plants of the world isn't made of water but solar emissions. The sun, you see, is acting up again. NASA recently warned that solar activity is surging, with a peak expected to happen in 2013 that could generate enormous radiation levels that sweep across planet Earth. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has even issued an urgent warning about solar flares due to strike in 2012 and 2013. IBtimes wrote, &quot;With solar activity expected to peak around 2013, the Sun is entering a particularly active time and big flares like the recent one will likely be common during the next few years. ...A major flare in the mid-19th century blocked the nascent telegraph system, and some scientists believe that another such event is now overdue.&quot; (<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3745:http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194" rel="nofollow">http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3745 -->...)

Moreover, there may also be disruption of power supply for years, or even decades, as geomagnetic currents attracted by the storm could debilitate the transformers.&quot; Why does all this matter? To understand that, you have to understand how nuclear power plants function. Or, put another way, how is nuclear material prevented from &quot;going nuclear&quot; every single day across our planet? Every nuclear power plant operates in a near-meltdown state All nuclear power plants are operated in a near-meltdown status. They operate at very high heat, relying on nuclear fission to boil water that produces steam to drive the turbines that generate electricity. Critically, the nuclear fuel is prevented from melting down through the steady circulation of coolants which are pushed through the cooling system using very high powered electric pumps. If you stop the electric pumps, the coolant stops flowing and the fuel rods go critical (and then melt down). This is what happened in Fukushima, where the melted fuel rods dropped through the concrete floor of the containment vessels, unleashing enormous quantities of ionizing radiation into the surrounding environment. The full extent of the Fukushima contamination is not even known yet, as the facility is still emitting radiation. It's crucial to understand that nuclear coolant pumps are usually driven by power from the electrical grid. They are not normally driven by power generated locally from the nuclear power plant itself. Instead, they're connected to the grid. In other words, even though nuclear power plants are generating megawatts of electricity for the grid, they are also dependant on the grid to run their own coolant pumps. If the grid goes down, the coolant pumps go down, too, which is why they are quickly switched to emergency backup power -- either generators or batteries. As we learned with Fukushima, the on-site batteries can only drive the coolant pumps for around eight hours. After that, the nuclear facility is dependent on diesel generators (or sometimes propane) to run the pumps that circulate the coolant which prevents the whole site from going Chernobyl. And yet, critically, this depends on something rather obvious: The delivery of diesel fuel to the site. If diesel cannot be delivered, the generators can't be fired up and the coolant can't be circulated. When you grasp the importance of this supply line dependency, you will instantly understand why a single solar flare could unleash a nuclear holocaust across the planet. When the generators fail and the coolant pumps stop pumping, nuclear fuel rods begin to melt through their containment rods, unleashing ungodly amounts of life-destroying radiation directly into the atmosphere. This is precisely why Japanese engineers worked so hard to reconnect the local power grid to the Fukushima facility after the tidal wave -- they needed to bring power back to the generators to run the pumps that circulate the coolant. This effort failed, of course, which is why Fukushima became such a nuclear disaster and released countless becquerels of radiation into the environment (with no end in sight). And yet, despite the destruction we've already seen with Fukushima, U.S. nuclear power plants are nowhere near being prepared to handle sustained power grid failures. As IBtimes reports: &quot;Last month, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said U.S. plants affected by a blackout should be able to cope without electricity for at least eight hours and should have procedures to keep the reactor and spent-fuel pool cool for 72 hours. Nuclear plants depend on standby batteries and backup diesel generators. Most standby power systems would continue to function after a severe solar storm, but supplying the standby power systems with adequate fuel, when the main power grids are offline for years, could become a very critical problem. If the spent fuel rod pools at the country's 104 nuclear power plants lose their connection to the power grid, the current regulations aren't sufficient to guarantee those pools won't boil over -- exposing the hot, zirconium-clad rods and sparking fires that would release deadly radiation.&quot; (<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3746:http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194" rel="nofollow">http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3746 -->...) Now, what does all this have to do with solar flares? How the end of modern civilization will most likely occur As any sufficiently informed scientist will readily admit, solar flares have the potential to blow out the transformers throughout the national power grid. That's because solar flares induce geomagnetic currents (powerful electromagnetic impulses) which overload the transformers and cause them to explode. You've probably witnessed this yourself during a lightning storm when lightning unleashes a powerful electromagnetic pulse that causes a local transformer to explode. Solar flares do the same thing on a much larger scale. A global scale, in fact. The upshot of this situation is that suddenly and without warning, the power grid infrastructure across nearly the entire planet could be destroyed. As a bonus, nearly all satellites will be fried, too, leaving GPS inoperable and causing millions of clueless drivers to become forever lost in their own neighborhoods because they never paid attention to the streets and always relied on a GPS voice to tell them, &quot;In fifty feet, turn right.&quot; Communications satellites will be obliterated, too. This, of course, will halt nearly all news propaganda distribution across the planet, causing tens of thousands of people to instantly die out of the sheer fear of suddenly having to think for themselves. As another bonus, nearly all mobile phone service will be disrupted, too, meaning all the teenage text junkies of the world will, for the first time in their lives, be forced to lay down their iPhones and interact with real people in the real world. But the real kicker in all this is that the power grid will be destroyed nearly everywhere. What happens when there's no electricity? Imagine a world without electricity. Even for just a week. Imagine New York City with no electricity, or Los Angeles, or Sao Paulo. Within 72 hours, most cities around the world will devolve into total chaos, complete with looting, violent crime, and runaway fires. But that's not even the bad news. Even if all the major cities of the world burned to the ground for some other reason, humanity could still recover because it has the farmlands: the soils, the seeds, and the potential to recover, right? And yet the real crisis here stems from the realization that once there is no power grid, all the nuclear power plants of the world suddenly go into &quot;emergency mode&quot; and are forced to rely on their on-site emergency power backups to circulate coolants and prevent nuclear meltdowns from occurring. And yet, as we've already established, these facilities typically have only a few hours of battery power available, followed by perhaps a few days worth of diesel fuel to run their generators (or propane, in some cases). Did I also mention that half the people who work at nuclear power facilities have no idea what they're doing in the first place? Most of the veterans who really know the facilities inside and out have been forced into retirement due to reaching their lifetime limits of on-the-job radiation exposure, so most of the workers at nuclear facilities right now are newbies who really have no clue what they're doing. There are 440 nuclear power plants operating across 30 countries around the world today. There are an additional 250 so-called &quot;research reactors&quot; in existence, making a total of roughly 700 nuclear reactors to be dealt with (<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3747:http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/i --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/i" rel="nofollow">http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/i</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3747 -->...). Now imagine the scenario: You've got a massive solar flare that knocks out the world power grid and destroys the majority of the power grid transformers, thrusting the world into darkness. Cities collapse into chaos and rioting, martial law is quickly declared (but it hardly matters), and every nation in the world is on full emergency. But that doesn't solve the really big problem, which is that you've got 700 nuclear reactors that can't feed power into the grid (because all the transformers are blown up) and yet simultaneously have to be fed a steady stream of emergency fuels to run the generators the keep the coolant pumps functioning. How long does the coolant need to circulate in these facilities to cool the nuclear fuel? Months. This is also the lesson of Fukushima: You can't cool nuclear fuel in mere hours or days. It takes months to bring these nuclear facilities to a state of cold shutdown. And that means in order to avoid a multitude of Fukushima-style meltdowns from occurring around the world, you need to truck diesel fuel, generator parts and nuclear plant workers to every nuclear facility on the planet, ON TIME, every time, without fail, for months on end. Now remember, this must be done in the middle of the total chaos breakdown of modern civilization, where there is no power, where law enforcement and emergency services are totally overrun, where people are starving because food deliveries have been disrupted, and when looting and violent crime runs rampant in the streets of every major city in the world. Somehow, despite all this, you have to run these diesel fuel caravans to the nuclear power plants and keep the pumps running. Except there's a problem in all this, even if you assume you can somehow work a logistical miracle and actually deliver the diesel fuel to the backup generators on time (which you probably can't). The problem is this: Where do you get diesel fuel? Why refineries will be shut down, too From petroleum refineries. Most people don't realize it, but petroleum refineries run on electricity. Without the power grid, the refineries don't produce a drop of diesel. With no diesel, there are no generators keeping the coolant running in the nuclear power facilities. But wait, you say: Maybe we could just acquire diesel from all the gas stations in the world. Pump it out of the ground, load it into trucks and use that to power the generators, right? Except there are other problems here: How do you pump all that fuel without electricity? How do you acquire all the tires and spare parts needed to keep trucks running if there's no electricity to keep the supply businesses running? How do you maintain a truck delivery infrastructure when the electrical infrastructure is totally wiped out? Some countries might be able to pull it off with some degree of success. With military escorts and the total government control over all fuel supplies, a few nations will be able to keep a few nuclear power facilities from melting down. But here's the real issue: There are 700 nuclear power facilities in the world, remember? Let's suppose that in the aftermath of a massive solar flare, the nations of the world are somehow able to control half of those facilities and nurse them into cold shutdown status. That still leaves roughly 350 nuclear facilities at risk. Now let's suppose half of those are somehow luckily offline and not even functioning when the solar flare hits, so they need no special attention. This is a very optimistic assumption, but that still leaves 175 nuclear power plants where all attempts fail. Let's be outrageously optimistic and suppose that a third of those somehow don't go into a total meltdown by some miracle of God, or some bizarre twist in the laws of physics. So we're still left with 115 nuclear power plants that &quot;go Chernobyl.&quot; Fukushima was one power plant. Imagine the devastation of 100+ nuclear power plants, all going into meltdown all at once across the planet. It's not the loss of electricity that's the real problem; it's the global tidal wave of invisible radiation that blankets the planet, permeates the topsoil, irradiates everything that breathes and delivers the final crushing blow to human civilization as we know it today. Because if you have 100 simultaneous global nuclear meltdowns, the tidal wave of radiation will make farming nearly impossible for years. That means no food production for several years in a row. And that, in turn, means a near-total collapse of the human population on our planet. How many people can survive an entire year with no food from the farms? Not one in a hundred people. Even beyond that, how many people can essentially live underground and be safe enough from the radiation that they can have viable children and repopulate the planet? It's a very, very small fraction of the total population. Solar flares far more likely to hit nuclear power plants than tidal waves or earthquakes What's the chance of all this actually happening? A report by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory said that &quot;...over the standard 40-year license term of nuclear power plants, solar flare activity enables a 33 percent chance of long-term power loss, a risk that significantly outweighs that of major earthquakes and tsunamis.&quot; (<!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3748:http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194" rel="nofollow">http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3748 -->...) </span><br />

<span class="Underline">In the wake of the Iridium-Cosmos collision the US took additional steps to ramp up their calculations of potential satellite collisions to prevent similar collisions. However, such predictive efforts require frequently-updated observations of satellites and potential debris. Currently the bulk of those observations come from a network of groundbased sensors, both radars and telescopes. If all goes well, it will be joined later this year by the first of a proposed series of space-based sensors. The Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) Pathfinder satellite, built by Boeing and Ball Aerospace, is scheduled for launch this summer on a Minotaur 4 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base into polar orbit. From that orbit it will look out towards geosynchronous orbit (GEO), with the capability of scanning the entire GEO belt once a day and transmitting those observations back to Earth. “SBSS is going to provide a lot of capability to the Air Force,” said Col. James “J.R.” Jordon, SBSS mission director and vice commander of the Air Force’s Space Superiority Systems Wing, during a briefing about SBSS at the National Space Symposium in Colorado Springs last month. “It’s going to provide 24/7 capability, increased timeliness, increased capacity.

<span class="Underline">The growing number of satellite collisions and the danger posed by collision-debris to nuclear-powered satellites will increase the likelihood of a nuclear accident in space. The chief of Russia's Mission Control said in mid-February 2009 that debris from the Iridium 33-Cosmos 2251 satellite collision (in February 2009) will 'threaten numerous satellites.' Cold-War era satellites, although they 'were designed so that their nuclear fuel would survive a launch pad explosion relatively intact, all are vulnerable to breakup if involved in a sufficiently high-energy collision.' (Orbital Debris - A Technical Assessment, National Research Council, 1995). There is disagreement over what will happen to the orbits of the debris resulting from a collision with these satellites. Scientists quoted by the mainstream press say that the radioactive materials would not fall to Earth. One over-quoted Russian space expert said in February 2009 that in the event of such an accident 'radioactive fallout would pose no threat to Earth.' The National Academy Press's book titled Orbital Debris - A Technical Assessment, however, noted that 'Radioactive fragments...might re-enter the atmosphere sooner than they would have if the spacecraft had remained intact. These small fragments would burn up in the atmosphere, potentially resulting in a slight increase in the background health risk.' (p.91) This is what happened with Transit-5BN-3, for example, which added to the world burden of plutonium (all isotopes of radioactive plutonium) from atmospheric nuclear testing by a staggering four percent. The potential of a nuclear-satellite catastrophe was succinctly summarized in the February 2009 article 'The Problem of Space Junk' by RIA Novosti: 'The lurking threat of both Russian and American nuclear satellites is that, should they fall apart upon collision with space debris, vast expanses of near-Earth space would be contaminated. Additionally, if some of the fragments had a velocity after collision and destruction that was below orbital speed, they would fall out of orbit and pollute some parts of the Earth's surface. In the worst-case scenario, the atmosphere could be heavily contaminated.' </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Ironically, even as space has moved away from the center of American culture, it has become ever more integrated with the international system. Global space spending in 2009 reached approximately $262 billion, or 7 percent more than in 2008, despite the global recession. The largest share of that spending, at nearly $91 billion, was for commercial satellite services (communications, remote sensing, satellite positioning), followed by commercial infrastructure (at $84 billion), and spending by the United States government (at $64 billion). Direct spending, however, does not tell the whole story. Space systems lie at the heart of the global infrastructure for moving information, whether that data is collected from remote-sensing systems (such as weather satellites) and high-resolution remote-sensing systems (think Google Earth), or transmitted over communications satellites. Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites transmit precise timing signals, which are used to locate one's position on Earth, aid navigation, and time global financial transactions. A range of spacecraft are studying the planet and its functions, peering into deep space at the origins of the universe, and visiting other planets. Space systems and their applications contribute to efforts and advances in agriculture, development, resource allocation, disaster relief, education, and medicine. Even cable television programming is distributed by satellite. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent stales. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. First, on the systemic level. Pollins (20081 advances Modclski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous shocks such as economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power (see also Gilpin. 19SJ) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the risk of miscalculation (Fcaron. 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately. Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level. Copeland's (1996. 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that 'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. He argues that interdependent states arc likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, if the expectations of future trade decline, particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources, the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 Third, others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Mom berg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write. The linkage, between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict lends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other (Hlomhen? &amp; Hess. 2(102. p. X9&gt; Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blombcrg. Hess. &amp; Wee ra pan a, 2004). which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. &quot;Diversionary theory&quot; suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect. Wang (1996), DcRoucn (1995), and Blombcrg. Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force arc at least indirecti) correlated. Gelpi (1997). Miller (1999). and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that Ihe tendency towards diversionary tactics arc greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked lo an increase in the use of force. In summary, rcccni economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict al systemic, dyadic and national levels.'

<span class="Underline">WASHINGTON — The U.S. Air Force’s first Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) satellite launched Sept. 25 and is transmitting signals that indicate it is functioning normally and ready to begin orbital maneuvers, prime contractor Boeing Space &amp; Intelligence Systems announced Sept. 26. The long-delayed SBSS spacecraft is designed to use a gimbaled optical telescope to keep tabs on objects in geostationary orbit from its vantage point in low Earth orbit. The satellite was built by Seal Beach, Calif.-based Boeing and Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp. of Boulder, Colo. The SBSS satellite was carried to orbit by an Orbital Sciences Corp.-assembled Minotaur 4 rocket that launched out of Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Boeing operators at Schriever Air Force Base, Colo., received the first signals from the spacecraft indicating it is healthy and ready to begin a two-week checkout phase, a company press release said. After that, payload testing will begin, and Boeing plans to hand the satellite over to the Air Force within 60 days. This was the first orbital launch of the Minotaur 4, which uses refurbished U.S. strategic missile hardware for its first three stages with a commercial fourth-stage motor. The Minotaur 4 was supposed to make its debut a year ago until the Air Force discovered a problem with the rocket’s third-stage motor. A gas generator continued to run after the motor shut off, creating residual thrust that is a problem for a rocket designed to put a satellite into a very precise orbit. New hardware had to be designed and built to correct the problem. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">&quot;SBSS will help make our space assets safer and more secure, keeping America at the forefront of space,&quot; says Col. J.R. Jordan, SBSS mission director. &quot;This satellite is going to revolutionize the way we track objects in space by not being constrained by weather, the atmosphere or the time of day. This capability will be essential to our space situational awareness architecture for the near future and beyond.&quot; Equipped with an 11.8-inch telescope and 2.4 megapixel focal plane, the craft will use its optical eyes to image the sky and provide analysts the data they need to keep better tabs on space debris and guard against accidental collisions. What's more, the reconnaissance provided by SBSS will watch for potential risks posed to the military's communications, navigation, weather and spy satellites by enemy interference. &quot;Every day, threats to our nation's valuable satellites and space platforms are growing,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;SBSS will revolutionize our ability to find and monitor objects that could harm the space assets we depend on for security, communications, weather forecasting and many other essential services.&quot; Accidental smashups, such as last year's crash between an Iridium telephone bird and a defunct Russian craft, or the earlier Chinese anti-satellite test that destroyed a spacecraft illustrate how Earth orbit has become a contested environment. Enhancing situational awareness in space has become a major objective for the military. Putting a satellite into orbit to scan the sky will narrow gaps in ground-based space tracking that is limited by geographic locations, nighttime viewing and clouds. &quot;Space situational awareness is an essential component to maintaining space superiority. The benefits that SBSS brings is that by operating solely in space the SBSS satellite will circumvent the current terrestrial restrictions and limitations of weather, Earth line-of-sight and nighttime-only operations. This capability that SBSS will deliver will triple the probability of event detection, double the sensitivity and increase capacity by 10 times,&quot; said Lt. Col. Robert Erickson, SBSS Space Situational Awareness Squadron commander. The Boeing Co. leads the SBSS project and Ball Aerospace built the satellite based on the BCP-2000 bus. A pair of solar wings feed the craft's electricity needs, a two-axis gimbal enables rapid pointing of the optics and the onboard computer can be reprogrammed with updates. &quot;The big advantage from a design perspective of SBSS is by having the camera on a two-axis gimbal we can very rapidly point and take pictures of the sky where we like. That agility is very important,&quot; said Todd Citron, Boeing's director of advanced space and intelligence systems. &quot;The onboard computer that Boeing supplies we can upload new algorithms over time and continue to improve the performance on-orbit.&quot; Early on-orbit testing and commissioning activities for SBSS will last several months. Also, maneuvers are planned to raise the orbit by more than 50 miles to the intended operational perch. Acceptance of the satellite into full service is slated to occur by next spring. So how exactly does the SBSS observing process work? &quot;The system receives tasking from the Joint Space Operations Center. It takes that tasking and converts it into commands that go up to the spacecraft. This satellite has a digital camera that's on a two-axis gimbal. So the commands sent up to the satellite basically tell the satellite where to point the camera and to take a picture. That data then is downlinked to a ground site,&quot; Citron said. &quot;That information could either be what's referred to as metric data -- basically positional information on the objects we're viewing that would allow one to compute orbits, or also it could be what's called space object identification, or SOI, information which one could use to perhaps get a sense of what kind of object one is looking at.&quot; However, officials won't say exactly what size objects SBSS can see. &quot;We will say there are a lot of objects up there that we've lost track on and there are a lot of objects that we think we'll be able to observe that we haven't been able to observe previously. We're going to improve that database and actual tracking on a daily basis,&quot; Jordan said. Many thousands of objects are routinely tracked by the military today using ground-based radars and telescopes. But there's vastly more bits and pieces of space junk circling the planet not being watched that could damage spacecraft that are woven into daily life, such as commercial television satellites. &quot;I think it's clear that our country is very dependent on space,&quot; Citron said. &quot;To the person on the street this is a critical element of ensuring that things essential to our economy and our health as a nation continue.&quot; And even the military's Global Positioning System constellation of satellites has become an intergal part of everyday civilian life. &quot;Just about everything you do is synchronized to GPS time, from your banking transactions or point-of-sale purchases with your credit card and so forth. If that capability went away, it would have a tremendous impact on the economy,&quot; Citron said. &quot;So our economy and our military are very dependent on space, which makes it a potential target for adversaries. Understanding what's going on in space is very important...That's the motivation for space situational awareness.&quot; The SBSS has a seven-year design life, and additional surveillance satellites could be envisioned to further improve the observing capacity. &quot;The Air Force, in general, is pursuing what the longterm architecture should be for space situational awareness. We've been doing our own studies of architectures and when you look at various tradeoffs in terms of the constellation we certainly see advantages to having more than one satellite up there,&quot; Citron said. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">In September, the United States Air Force launched the first satellite capable of monitoring outer space. Currently, the USAF watches objects in Earth orbit through a ground-based system of radar and optical sensors scattered around the globe. Though this Space Surveillance Network is the best in the world, it is insufficient to ensure the security of the hundreds of satellites that are integral to modern life. When the new Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) satellite is operational in about six months, it will be a dramatic improvement. We all depend on satellites, whether or not we know it. From civilian uses such as TV, Internet, banking, GPS, agriculture, and weather forecasting, to military functions such as guiding munitions, operating Predator drones, gathering intelligence, enforcing arms control agreements, and monitoring missile launches, the value of satellites is incalculable. Unfortunately, as Earth orbit becomes crowded and actors proliferate, security threats increase. The anarchy and volatility of outer space are reduced only insofar as we know what is happening there -- a concept known as space situational awareness (SSA). Laws and norms protecting against aggression and harmful negligence are essentially worthless if actions cannot be reliably attributed to guilty parties. Without accurate information, punishment is nearly impossible and its deterrent effect is minimal. Imagine trying to arrest a robber based solely on the description provided by a blind person. Imagine further that all would-be robbers knew beforehand that the only likely witness would be blind. The SBSS satellite gives us eyes. It has a mounted sensor that is capable of pivoting, allowing the camera to focus on different areas of outer space without having to reposition the satellite itself. This enables ground controllers to quickly and frequently shift the area under observation, giving them broad monitoring capabilities without wasting the satellite's valuable fuel. The satellite will be able to track launches, debris, satellites, and other objects without being &quot;encumbered by terrestrial limitations of weather, day-and-night restrictions,&quot; said Lt. Col. Robert Erickson, SBSS Space Situational Awareness Squadron commander. &quot;It enables the (Joint Space Operations Center) to collect data when they need it, not when a ground asset may be able to see the target.&quot; Simply put, it will give us more and better information. This greater awareness of outer space activity can be used to enhance the effectiveness of international laws and norms, or to provide a deterrent to nefarious activity through the credible threat of retaliation. Both avenues will likely be pursued by international actors. Imagine that an American satellite is destroyed by colliding with another object. In debating how to respond, it would be essential to know whether that object was a &quot;space mine&quot; intentionally placed in the path of the satellite's orbit, or if the object was merely a piece of errant debris, perhaps a spent rocket casing left over from an old Apollo mission. If it could be accurately determined that the object was, in fact, a space mine deployed by a specific country, the United States could publicly denounce the guilty party and seek restitution through appropriate international legal channels, maybe taking the case to the UN Security Council. Alternatively, the United States could retaliate against that party in a way deemed proportionate to the offense committed. Though the latter option is more risky, both would enhance space security in the long run by making known the ever-increasing possibility of being caught and by simultaneously providing assured, predictable punishments for transgressions. Although the United States has the best space-monitoring capabilities, places like China, Europe, and India will inevitably catch up. As their SSA improves, so will outer space security due to more accurate information and more observing parties. Mutual monitoring has been highly effective at enforcing arms control agreements and avoiding nuclear exchanges since the Cold War. At the height of U.S.-Soviet tensions, early-warning systems allowed both sides to detect potential missile launches with enough advanced notice to retaliate, thereby eliminating the incentive to strike first, and reconnaissance satellites enabled each country to verify that the other was meeting its arms control obligations. In general, transparency of capabilities and intent are widely acknowledged to reduce misunderstanding and conflict. Though monitoring outer space presents a greater technical challenge than monitoring Earth, this wisdom still applies. Thus, making space safe and secure for both satellites and space travel will depend largely on enhancing space situational awareness. Ground-based monitoring will continue to play an important role, but space-based surveillance is the way of the future. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Space-based surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities were first developed during the Cold War to provide access to areas of the Soviet Union that otherwise would have been totally inaccessible to U.S. intelligence. Although manned missions using aircraft such as the U-2 provided valuable intelligence on Soviet military forces, these missions became increasingly dangerous as Soviet air defense capabilities were upgraded. In response, the United States realized the need for advanced, space-based systems capable of identifying small objects from space.26 Unlike manned platforms, space-based assets offered the benefit of global coverage, near invulnerability, and sustained operations over a continuous period of time. Beginning with deployments in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the U.S. has pioneered increas¬ingly sophisticated space-based surveillance and reconnaissance systems for over fifty years. As satellite capabilities have evolved, so too has the role of these advanced systems. In addition to monitoring foreign military forces, such satellites have played a crucial role in verifying arms control agreements. Since the Cold War, the role of satellites in verifying treaties has expanded to include supporting nuclear nonpro¬liferation efforts. With the arrival of precision-guided munitions, reconnaissance satellites have become “the key to post-Cold War defense tactics that rely on highly selective targeting to destroy selected targets with minimal collateral damage.”27 Despite the shroud of secrecy, some general facts are known about the broad elements of U.S. surveillance and reconnaissance satellites. In particular, the systems function primarily in support of two types of missions: imagery intelligence (IMINT) and other, non-visual intelligence information, including signals intelligence (SIGINT), electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT). Within the realm of IMINT, two types of systems are employed: (1) those that collect images using visible and thermal (infrared) light; and (2) those that use radar to image the Earth’s surface. Regarding non-visual intelligence, numerous configurations are utilized to intercept valuable information including enemy voice communications and data transmissions. Within these broad mission areas, the U.S. currently deploys a number of advanced systems. For IMINT collection, the Keyhole series KH-12 (commonly referred to as the Improved Crystal or Advanced KH-11) is the latest and most sophisticated iteration in a series of satellites that have provided imagery for a number of years. Building on technologies contained in the KH-11 used during the 1990-91 Gulf War, the KH-12 is much heavier—weighing nearly 30,000lbs and costing in excess of $1 billion excluding launch costs. Other U.S. surveillance capabilities are summarized in Table 1. The growing number of missions assigned to space-based surveillance and reconnaissance satellites has led the United States to develop a new generation of capabilities. Dubbed BASIC for Broad Area Space-based Imagery Collector, the new system would be launched by 2011 at an estimated cost of $2-4 billion. Although the program is currently in its very early stages, development options include an entirely new photo imagery satellite or a derivative of a commercial imagery satellite, buying a commercial satellite or leasing existing commercial satellite capacity.29</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Let me then state my most important conclusion directly: I believe nuclear weapons must have an abiding place in the international scene for the foreseeable future. I believe that the world, in fact, would become more dangerous, not less dangerous, were U.S. nuclear weapons to be absent. The most important role for our nuclear weapons is to serve as a “sobering force,” one that can cap the level of destruction of military conflicts and thus force all sides to come to their senses. This is the enduring purpose of U.S. nuclear weapons in the post-Cold War world. I regret that we have not yet captured such thinking in our public statements as to why the U.S. will retain nuclear deterrence as a cornerstone of our defense policy, and urge that we do so in the upcoming Nuclear Posture Review. Nuclear deterrence becomes in my view a “countervailing” force and, in fact, a potent antidote to military aggression on the part of nations. But to succeed in harnessing this power, effective nuclear weapons strategies and policies are necessary ingredients to help shape and maintain a stable and peaceful world.</span><br />

Nevertheless, Scott Sagan and other proliferation pessimists find support for their concerns. At lower levels of escalation, nuclear symmetry does not appear to have a pacifying effect. Worse yet, nuclear asymmetry is generally associated with a higher chance of crises, uses of force, fatalities, and war.

If the US wishes to enjoy the advantages of space-enabled communications, navigation, precision timing, weather, missile warning, and ISR in any potential conflict with China, the National Security Space community should aggressively pursue methods to defend its systems from attack. First and foremost, the Air Force – as Defense Department executive agent for space – must develop better Space Situation Awareness (SSA), both in breadth and depth. In breadth, the Air Force should build and maintain an improved catalog of objects from lowEarth to geosynchronous orbits. The catalog must not only be complete, capturing increasingly smaller objects; it needs also to be timely to ensure maneuvering vehicles are discovered in time to permit defensive action. In depth, America should develop the capacity to better characterize the nature and capabilities of known satellites. The US must improve its ability to identify the existence, origin, and nature of attacks on its space assets—differentiating these attacks from system or environmental anomalies. The need for depth and breadth in SSA extends to ground-based counterspace systems that might be employed against friendly forces. Passive and active defensive systems should follow and leverage SSA improvements to “close the loop” on American vulnerabilities. America stands a better chance of deterring aggression against its critical onorbit assets if it possesses the capability to recognize emerging threats, capture timely indications and warnings, and respond (defensively or offensively) when attacked. To do otherwise presents an inviting vulnerability to an adversary seeking unconventional means to neutralize or defeat a stronger foe.<br />

And, we don’t know where China’s weapons are --- a first strike is impossible and Lieber and Press’s study is flawed.<br />
Bin 06, Professor of the Institute of International Studies, Tsinghua Universit, 06 [Li, “Paper Tiger with<br />
Whitened Teeth”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3762:http://www.wsichina.org/cs4_5.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsichina.org/cs4_5.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsichina.org/cs4_5.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3762 -->]<br />
Rather than exploring why China chooses to do so, Lieber and Press use this fact as evidence to support their point on U.S. nuclear primacy.3 If the authors paid more heed to China’s choice of a small and low-alert nuclear arsenal they would find their deductions faulty, including technical problems in their calculations. All the calculations in their paper, including the sensitivity analyses, focus on the hardness of the targets as well as strike capabilities, which are determined by the lethal distance, accuracy, and reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. However, the calculations in the paper are based on a fundamentally unrealistic assumption: that is, the United States can detect and locate all Russian and Chinese long-range nuclear weapons. The authors never state this assumption in their paper – perhaps unknowingly so, as most former calculations do not discuss the issue of target detection. In other previous studies, where the numbers of surviving nuclear weapons in a calculation are much larger than zero, it may be alright to ignore the factor of intelligence. But, if such a calculation gives a result of almost zero surviving targets in a nuclear exchange, the intelligence factor becomes highly salient and therefore cannot be ignored. The authors understand that “… one surviving mobile ICBM might destroy a U.S. city …” So their sensitivity analysis tries to prove that no single Russian longrange nuclear weapon can survive even if the U.S. nuclear weapons are not as effective as assumed. However, the real problem is that if the United States does not know where some nuclear weapons are in Russia or China, the United With near zero surviving targets in a nuclear exchange, the intelligence factor becomes highly salient. States cannot destroy them even with superior numbers and performance of nuclear weapons. It is instructive to know that once the Soviet Union (and later, Russia) felt that it had a sufficient number of nuclear weapons to survive a first U.S. nuclear strike, it chose to sign the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START) I and II that entail on-site inspections to verify the numbers and locations of the Russian long-range nuclear weapons. If Russia feels that not a single one of its nuclear weapons can survive a first strike by the United States, it may consider not revealing all its nuclear weapons to the United States. In fact, unlike the START treaties, the new Moscow Treaty does not require similar on-site inspections. It is evident, even more so in China’s case, that it has never declared the number or location of its nuclear weapons. Naturally, the United States relies on its intelligence to identify and locate China’s nuclear weapons and then uses this information to decipher which objects and how many objects appear to be nuclear weapons and where they are located. The calculations in their paper do prove that the United States can destroy all the objects that have been identified by U.S. intelligence as nuclear weapons. However, the paper misses the central point of whether the entirety of Chinese long-range nuclear weapons have been identified and located by U.S. intelligence or whether all the objects that are identified in China are real nuclear weapons. The paper simply omits possible deficiencies of intelligence. Furthermore, the performance of U.S. intelligence in the first Iraq war and the Kosovo war suggests that the United States may miss more than just a few large military targets. Technically speaking, it is a relatively simple countermeasure for China to conceal a few actual ICBMs and to deploy decoy missiles – given the large size of the Chinese territory. No matter how the United States increases the number, accuracy, and reliability of its nuclear weapons, even if used in a surprise attack, it has no means of destroying those Chinese ICBMs that its intelligence has not found. Thus, there is no method or model by which Lieber and Press can determine with any certainty that the number of surviving Chinese ICBMs after a surprise U.S. strike (equal to the number of undetected Chinese ICBMs) will be zero, and it seems far more likely survivability would be greater than zero. The definitive conclusion that the surviving Chinese ICBMs must be zero is technically wrong as it omits the intelligence deficiency. The uncertainties of the calculations in the paper are much greater and much more serious than indicated by the authors, and certainly goes beyond their single scenario of an enemy target surviving because a U.S. submarine commander does not believe his launch order. However, the greatest concern is that U.S. leaders actually believe that zero retaliation from China is possible, as predicted by Lieber and Press, and behave incautiously. Zero retaliation is an illusion, and if taken seriously it would bring dire risks to the United States.<br />

<span class="Underline">One problem is that space weapons, just like satellites, would have inherent vulnerabilities (for example, fixed orbital paths), raising the specter of an ever-spiraling need for better weapons and force protection. Just as it is difficult to protect satellites, it is difficult to protect space weapons. For example, satellites or space weapons traveling in fixed paths in low-Earth orbit (LEO) are virtual sitting ducks for ground-based ASATs or even fighter aircraft equipped with rockets, not to mention space-based ASATs. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The other related negative side effect of the inherent vulnerability of orbiting weapons is the pressure to use them first. The strategic dynamic of space-based weapons could perhaps be compared to that of nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles— offense-dominant weapons with inherent vulnerabilities (fixed sites).

<span class="Underline">Spurring other nations to acquire space- based weapons, either ASATs or weapons aimed at terrestrial targets, would undercut the ability of U.S. forces to operate freely on the ground on a global basis and thus negate what today is a unique advantage of being the world’s only military superpower.3 Along with military assets in space, U.S. commercial satellites would also become targets (especially because the U.S. military is heavily reliant on commercial providers, particularly in communications). In other words, the United States could be in the position of creating strategic and military problems for itself, rather than solving them. </span><br />

The destruction of the nine satellites hit during the first hour of the attack considered here could put approximately 19,000 new pieces of debris over 10 cm in diameter into the most populated belt of satellites in LEO. Even more debris would be put into GEO, if China launched an attack against communications satellites. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the debris from each satellite would continue to clump together, much as the debris from China’s 2007 test. Over the next year or so, and assuming the space war with China was resolved well before that, the debris fields would fan out and eventually strike other satellites. These debris fields could cause a run-away chain of collisions that renders space unusable from hundreds to thousands of years.14</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Sustainability has been the subject of much discussion and a steady stream of policy forums since the World Commission on Environment and Development, headed by Dr. Gro Brundtland, put it on the world stage in 1987. The Brundtland Commission defined sustainable development as growth that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Assuch, sustainability carries with it the distinct feeling of a modern problem. But it is not. We have been on a seemingly unsustainable course for hundreds of years, but the rules, stakes, and speed of the game keep changing, in large part because of our ability to use technology to extend limits and to magnify human capabilities. As long as the population continues to consume a finite store of resources, we must continue to change our course or fail. If, with the global population approaching 9-10 billion people by midcentury, we were to lock in current technologies and development patterns, we would likely find ourselves heading toward environmental disaster or worse. Our best hope--perhaps our only hope--is to evolve rapidly enough, using our ingenuity, our technology, and our growing ethical framework of inclusiveness and respect for the diversity of life, to stay ahead of the proverbial wolf. Despite the environmental pessimism of the current age, there are a handful of signs that suggest we are struggling in fits and starts in the right direction, possibly even gaining more ground than we are losing. Farm productivity is one of the most significant of the great reversals in human fortune that have occurred in recent times, reversals that offer both hope and strategic guidance. Largely as a result of crop yields growing at 1-2% per year, the millenniaold pattern of clearing forests and grassland for farms and pastures has begun to be reversed in some regions of the world. According to one of the world's leading scholars on technological change, Arnulf Grubler of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, some 18 million hectares (45 million acres) of cropland in Europe and North America have been reconverted to forest and grassland between 1950 and 2000, while agricultural output in those regions has continued to grow. Great reversals are also beginning to occur in areas as diverse as population, resource utilization, energy, and transportation. Fertility rates continue to drop below the replacement level (2.1 children per woman) in affluent nations. First evident in France more than a century ago, the preference for smaller families is spreading throughout the world as economic development expands. As a result, roughly 90% of the population growth in the next 50 years will occur in today'spoorest nations. Overall, we are looking at a new demographic dynamic in which population is exploding in some parts of the world while imploding in others. Nevertheless, it is significant that year after year the United Nations continues to crank down its projection of global population in the twenty-first century, suggesting greater certainty that the population is leveling off. Although the consumption of resources continues to grow with population and economic prosperity in all parts of the world, there are some intriguing counter-trends. Technology continues to expands [sic] the menu of material resources--for example, alloys, composites, and ceramics--as well as to increase the efficiency with which we use them. Both trends help keep resource depletion at bay Moreover, usage patterns are now rapidly shifting, at least in the developed nations, toward lighter materials (aluminum, plastics, paper) and toward the recycling of heavier materials (steel, copper, zinc) and of manufactured components. Perhaps most important for the future, however, is the trend toward the &quot;immaterial.&quot; The information age is rapidly knitting together a new economy based on immaterial, knowledge-based assets, electronic commerce, and virtual transportation--an economy that is growing much faster than the old economy. We can barely glimpse the networkedworld of the future, but we can assume it will be much less dependent on natural resources. The reversal in energy use is more clearcut. Energy is in the middle of a 300-year trend away from fossil fuels. After more than 100,000 years of wood use, the global energy system began in the nineteenthcentury to move toward progressively cleaner, less carbon-intensive fuels (shifting from wood to coal to oil to gas). In fact, the decarbonization of the global energy system has been systematically proceeding at an average rate of 0.3% per year for the last 150 years, whilethe economic productivity of energy use has been improving at a rateof about 1% per year. The combined result (1.3% per year) is a healthy rate of reduction in the carbon used (and emitted) in producing a dollar of goods and services around the world. Even though the energyproductivity improvements have thus far been eclipsed by the growth in energy consumption (as more people engage in more economic activity), the trend is telling. The eventual result may be the same as in agriculture, with productivity improvements overtaking aggreg ate demand. In terms of decarbonizing the energy system, the transition is likely to be complete sometime in the next 75-150 years, depending on how fast we push the innovation process toward a clean, electricity- and hydrogen-based system. We would eventually get there even without a rigorous push, but as we will see later, the urgency of the climatechange issue may force us to speed up the historical trend by a factor of 2 or 3. The power of technology These historical trends in agriculture, land use, resource consumption, and energy use point to some profound opportunities for the future. There are at least four major ways in which technology has great potential for helping us achieve a sustainable balance in the twenty-first century The first area of opportunity for technology is in the acceleration of productivity growth. In agriculture, for example, corn yields inthe world today average only about 4 tons per hectare, while the United States averages 7 tons per hectare and the best Iowa farmer can get 17 tons. Simply bringing the world as a whole up to today's best practices in the United States would boost farm productivity to unprecedented heights, even without considering what the biological and genetic revolutions may hold in store for agriculture in the next century As for the overall productivity growth rate in industry and business, we are finally starting to register an increase after nearly 30 years of subpar performance at around 1% growth per year. Computerization appears to be taking hold in the economy in new and fundamental ways, not just in speeding up traditional practices but in altering the economic structure itself. One historical analogy would be the introduction of electric unit drives just after World War I, setting in motion a complete reorganization of the manufacturing Floor and leading to a surge in industrial productivity during the 1920s. In the twenty-first century, industrial processes will be revolutionized by new electrotechnologies, including lasers, plasmas, microwaves, and electron beams for materials processing, as well as electrochemical synthesis and electroseparation for chemical processing. Manufacturing will be revolutionized by a host of emerging technology platforms--for example, nanotechnology, biotechnology, biomimetics, high-temperature superconductivity, and network technology including the combining of advanced sensors with information technology to create adaptive, intelligent systems and processes. Future industrial facilities using advanced network technologies will be operated in new ways to simultaneously optimize productivity energy use, materials consumption, and plant emissions. Optimization will extend beyond the immediate facility to webs of facilities supporting industrial and urban ecology with the waste of one stream becoming the feedstock of the next. In the aggregate, the penetration of all the emerging tech nologiesinto the global economy should make it possible to sustain industrial productivity growth rates above 2% per year for many decades. The same technology platforms will be used to improve the efficiency of land, energy and water use, For example, distributed sensors and controls that enable precision farming can improve crop yields and reduce land and water use. And doubling or even tripling global energy efficiency in the next century is well within our means. Given the inefficiencies that now exist at every stage in the process--from mining and drilling for fuel through the use of energy in automobiles, appliances, and processes--the overall efficiency of the energy chain is only about 5%. From a social standpoint, accelerating productivity is not an option but rather an imperative for the future. It is necessary in order to provide the wealth for environmental sustainability, to support anaging population in the industrialized world, and to provide an economic ladder for developing nations. The second area of opportunity for technology lies in its potential to help stabilize global population at 10-12 billion sometime in the twenty-first century, possibly as early as 2075. The key is economics. Global communications, from television to movies to the Internet,have brought an image of the comfortable life of the developed worldinto the homes of the poorest people, firing their own aspirations for a better quality of life, either through economic development in their own country or through emigration to other countries. If we in the developed world can make the basic tools of prosperity--infrastructure, health care, education, and law--more accessible and affordable, recent history suggests that the cultural drivers for producing large families will be tempered, relatively quickly and without coercion. But the task is enormous. The physical prerequisites for prosperity in the global economy are electricity and communications. Today, there are more than 2 billion people living without electricity, or commercial energy in any form, in the very countries where some 5 billion people will be added in the next 50 years. If for no other reason than our enlightened self-interest, we should strive for universal access to electricity, communications, and educational opportunity. We have little choice, because the fate of the developed world is inextricably bound up in the economic and demographic fate of the developingworld. A third, related opportunity for technology is in decoupling population growth from land use and, more broadly, decoupling economic growth from natural resource consumption through recycling, end-use efficiency, and industrial ecology. Decoupling population from land use is well under way. According to Grubler, from 1700 to 1850 nearly 2 hectares of land (5 acres) were needed to support every child born in North America, while in the more crowded and cultivated regions of Europe and Asia only 0.5 hectare (1.2 acres) and 0.2 hectare (0.5 acre) were needed, respectively. During the past century, the amount of land needed per additional child has been dropping in all areas of the world, with Europe and North America experiencing the fastest decreases. Both crossed the &quot;zero threshold&quot; in the past few decades, meaningthat no additional land is needed to support additional children andthat land requirements will continue to decrease in the future. One can postulate that the pattern of returning land to nature will continue to spread throughout the world, eventually stemming and then reversing the current onslaught on the great rain forests. Time is critical if vast tracts are to be saved from being laid bare, and success will largely depend on how rapidly economic opportunities expand for those now trapped in subsistence and frontier farming. In concept, the potential for returning land to nature is enormous. Futurist and scholar Jesse Ausubel of the Rockefeller University calculates that if farmers could lift average grain yields around the world just to the level of today's average U.S. corn grower, one-half of current global cropland--an area the size of the Amazon basin--could be spared. If agriculture is a leading indicator, then the continuous drive to produce more from less will prevail in other parts of the economy Certainly with shrinking agricultural land requirements, water distribution and use around the world can be greatly altered, since nearly two-thirds of water now goes for irrigation. Overall, the technologies of the future will, in the words of Ausubel, be &quot;cleaner, leaner, lighter, and drier&quot;--that is, more efficient and less wasteful of materials and water. They will be much more tightly integrated through microprocessor-based control and will therefore use human and natural resources much more efficiently and productively. Energy intensity, land intensity, and water intensity (and, to a lesser extent, materials intensity) for both manufacturing and agriculture are already heading downward. Only in agriculture are they falling fast enough to offset the surge in population, but, optimistically, advances in science and technology should accelerate the downward trends in other sectors, helping to decouple economic development fromenvironmental impact in the coming century. One positive sign is thefact that recycling rates in North America are now approaching 65% for steel, lead, and copper and 30% for aluminum and paper. A second sign is that economic output is shifting away from resource-intensive products toward knowledge-based, immaterial goods and services. As a result, although the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) increased 200-fold (in real dollars) in the twentieth century, the physical weight of our annual output remains the same as it was in 1900. If anything,this trend will be accelerating. As Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wiredmagazine, noted, &quot;The creations most in demand from the United States [as exports] have lost 50% of their physical weight per dollar of value in only six years.... Within a generation, two at most, the number of people working in honest-to-goodness manufacturing jobs will beno more than the number of farmers on the land--less than a few percent. Far more than we realize, the network economy is pulling us all in.&quot; Even pollution shows clear signs of being decoupled from population and economic growth. Economist Paul Portney notes that, with the exception of greenhouse gases, &quot;in the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries, the favorable experience [with pollution control] has been a triumph of technology That is, the ratio of pollution per unit of GDP has fallen fast enough in the developed world to offset the increase in both GDP per capita and the growing number of 'capitas' themselves.&quot; The fourth opportunity for science and technology stems from their enormous potential to unlock resources not now available, to reduce human limitations, to create new options for policymakers and businesspeople alike, and to give us new levels of insight into future challenges. Technically resources have little value if we cannot unlock them for practical use. With technology, we are able to bring dormant resources to life. For example, it was only with the development of anelectrolytic process late in the nineteenth century that aluminum--the most abundant metal on earth--became commercially available and useful. Chemistry unlocked hydrocarbons. And engineering allowed us to extract and put to diverse use untapped petroleum and gas fields. Over the course of history, technology has made the inaccessible accessible, and resource depletion has been more of a catalyst for change than a longstanding problem. Technology provides us with last-ditch methods (what economists would call substitutions) that allow us to circumvent or leapfrog over crises of our own making. Agricultural technology solved the food crisis of the first half of the nineteenth century. The English &quot;steam crisis&quot; of the 1860s, triggered by the rapid rise of coal-burning steam engines and locomotives, was averted by mechanized mining and the discovery and use of petroleum. The U.S. &quot;timber crisis&quot; that Teddy Roosevelt publicly worried about was circumvented by the use of chemicals that enabled a billion or so railroad ties to last for decades instead of years. The great &quot;manure crisis&quot; of the same era was solved by the automobile, which in a few decades replaced some 25 million horses and freed up 40 million hectares (100 million acres) of farmland,not to mention improving the sanitation and smell of inner cities. Oil discoveries in Texas and then in the Middle East pushed the pending oil crisis of the 1920s into the future. And the energy cr isis of the 1970s stimulated the development of new sensing and drilling technology, sparked the advance of non--fossil fuel alternatives, and deepened the penetration of electricity with its fuel flexibility into the global economy Thanks to underground imaging technology, today's known gas resources are an order of magnitude greater than the resources known 20 years ago, and new reserves continue to be discovered. Technology has also greatly extended human limits. It has given each of us a productive capability greater than that of 150 workers in 1800, for example, and has conveniently put the power of hundreds of horses in our garages. In recent decades, it has extended our voice and our reach, allowing us to easily send our words, ideas, images, and money around the world at the speed of light. But global sustainability is not inevitable. In spite of the tremendous promise that technology holds for a sustainable future, there is the potential for all of this to backfire before the job can be done. There are disturbing indications that people sometimes turn in fear and anger on technologies, industries, and institutions that openlyfoster an ever-faster pace of change. The current opposition to nuclear power genetically altered food, the globalization of the economy and the spread of American culture should give us pause. Technology has always presented a two-edged sword, serving as both cause and effect, solving one problem while creating another that was unintended and often unforeseen. We solved the manure crisis, but automotive smog,congestion, and urban sprawl took its place. We cleaned and transformed the cities with all-electric buildings rising thousands of feet into the sky. But while urban pollution was thereby dramatically reduced, a portion of the pollution was shifted to someone else's sky. Breaking limits &quot;Limits to growth&quot; was a popular theme in the 1970s, and a best-selling book of that name predicted dire consequences for the human race by the end of the century. In fact, we have done much better than those predictions, largely because of a factor the book missed--the potential of new technology to break limits. Repeatedly, human societies have approached seemingly insurmountable barriers only to find the means and tools to break through. This ability has now become a source of optimism, an article of faith, in many parts of the world. Today's perceived limits, however, look and feel different. They are global in nature, multicultural, and larger in scale and complexity than ever before. Nearly 2 billion people in the world are without adequate sanitation, and nearly as many are without access to clean drinking water. AIDS is spreading rapidly in the regions of the world least able to fight it. Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are more than 30% greater than preindustrial levels and are climbing steadily. Petroleum reserves, expected to be tapped by over a billion automobiles worldwide by 2015, may last only another 50-100 years.And without careful preservation efforts, the biodiversity of the planet could become as threatened in this coming century as it was at the end of the last ice age, when more than 70% of the species of large mammals and other vertebrates in North America disappeared (along with 29% in Europe and 86% in Australia). All these perceived limits require innovation of a scope and intensity surpassing human kind's current commitment. The list of real-world problems that could thwart global sustainability is long and sobering. It includes war, disease, famine, political and religious turmoil, despotism, entrenched poverty, illiteracy, resource depletion, and environmental degradation. Technology can help resolve some of these issues--poverty and disease, resource depletion, and environmental impact, for example--but it offers little recourse for the passions and politics that divide the world. The likelihood is that we will not catch up and overtake the moving target of global sustainability in the coming century, but given the prospects fortechnology, which have never been brighter, we may come surprisinglyclose. We should put our technology to work, striving to lift more than 5 billion people out of poverty while preventing irreversible damage to the biosphere and irreversible loss of the earth's natural resources. We cannot see the future of technology any more clearly than our forebears did--and for much the same reason. We are approaching the threshold of profound change, moving at great speed across a wide spectrum of technology, ranging today from the Internet to the Human Genome project. Technology in the twenty-first century will be turning toward biological and ecological analogs, toward microminiature machines, toward the construction of materials atom by atom, and toward the dispersion of microprocessor intelligence into everyday objects subsequently linked into neural networks. Computing power continues to double every 18 months, as postulated in Moore's law, promising to enableus to create much more powerful tools for everyday tasks, optimize business services and processes along new lines, understand complex natural phenomena like the weather and climate, and design technical systems that are self-diagnostic, self-healing, and self-learning. The networked, digital society of the future should be capable o f exponential progress more in tune with biological models of growth than with the incremental progress of industrial societies. If history tells us anything, it is that in the long term we are much more likely to underestimate technology than to overestimate it. We are not unlike the excited crowds that in 1909 tried to imagine the future of flight as they watched Wilbur Wright loop his biplane twice around the Statue of Liberty and head back to Manhattan at the record-breaking speed of 30 miles per hour. As wild as one's imaginationand enthusiasm might have been, it would have been inconceivable that exactly 60 years later humans would fly to the moon and back. Electricity's unique role Electricity lies at the heart of the global quest for sustainability for several reasons. It is the prerequisite for the networked world of the future. It will be the enabling foundation of new digital technology and the vehicle on which most future productivity gains in industry, business, and commerce will depend. And to the surprise of many, it will remain the best pathway to resource efficiency, quality of life, and pollution control. In fact, the National Academy of Engineering just voted the &quot;vast network of electrification&quot; the single greatest engineering achievement of the twentieth century by virtue of its ability to improve people's quality of life. It came out ahead of the automobile, the airplane, the computer, and even health care in its impact on society. The electricity grids of North America, Europe, and Japan are said to be the most complex machines ever built. Although they are not yet full networks--that is, not every node is connected to every other node--these networks have been sufficiently interconnected to become the central enabling technology of the global economy. They will have to be even more interconnected and complex to keep pace with the microprocessors and digital networks they power. In the developed world, electricity has become almost a transparent technology lost in the excitement surrounding its latest progeny--electronics, computers, the Internet, and so forth. Still, its role should be as profound in this century as it was in the last. &quot;How and in what form global electrification goes forward in the next 50 years will determine, as much as anything, how we resolve the global 'trilemma' posed by population, poverty and pollution,&quot; says Kurt Yeager, president and CEO of EPRI. &quot;This trilemma is destined to become a defining issue of the twenty-first century&quot; Chauncey Starr, EPRI's founder, has captured the strong historicalcorrelation between access to electricity economic prosperity and social choices. A large majority of the world's population is now trapped at a low economic level, where the focus of everyday life is on survival and on acquiring the basics now taken for granted in developednations. As Starr shows, only after electricity consumption reaches a threshold of approximately 1000 kWh per capita do people turn theirattention from the basics of immediate survival to the level of &quot;amenities,&quot; including education, the environment, and intergenerational investment. Given the chicken-and-egg nature of the process of socialadvancement, it is not possible to point to electricity as the initial spark, but it is fair to say that economic development does not happen today without electricity. Electricity has been extended to more than 1.3 billion people overthe past 25 years, with leveraged economic impact. In South Africa, for example, 10 to 20 new businesses are started for every 100 homes that are electrified. Electricity frees up human labor--reducing the time people spend in such marginal daily tasks as carrying water and wood--and provides light in the evening for reading and studying. These simple basics can become the stepping stones to a better life and a doorway to the global economy. Because electricity can be effectively produced from a wide variety of local energy sources and because it is so precise at the point of use, it is the ideal energy carrier for economic and social development. Distributed electricity generation can be used to achieve basic rural electrification goals in the developing world, thereby helping to counteract the trend toward massiveurbanization. People in rural areas and villages need to have accessto the opportunities and jobs that are now attainable only by migrating to large cities. Electrification should also help with efforts to improve deteriorating urban air quality in the growing megacities of the world. Mortality from respiratory infections may be as much as five times higher in developing countries than in developed countries. The health costs can be debilitating; it is estimated, for example, that the total health cost of air emissions in Cairo alone now exceeds $1 billion per year. How global electrification proceeds--on a large or a small scale, with clean or dirty technology--will influence the planet socially economically and environmentally for centuries. Ultimately our success or failure in this endeavor will bear heavily on whether we can effectively handle the issues of the habitability and biodiversity of the planet. Ironically, electricity may also become the focal point for growing animosity in the coming century, for the simple reason that it is taking on more and more responsibility for society's energy-related pollution. Electricity accounted for only about 25% of the world's energy consumption in 1970. Today in the developed countries, its share of energy consumption is nearly 40%, and by 2050 that figure may reach60-70%. If transportation is fully electrified through fuel cells, hybrids, and the like, electricity's energy share could climb even higher. This growth accentuates the need to ensure that future electricity generation and use are as clean and efficient as possible and thatbest practices and technologies are available to developing countries as well as affluent ones. Fortunately for the world, electricity has the greatest potential of all the energy forms to deliver in the area of environmental stewardship. Roadmap's call to action The Electricity Technology Roadmap Initiative, which was launched by EPRI in 1998, began by bringing representatives of more than 150 diverse organizations together in a series of workshops and meetings to explore ways to enhance the future value of electricity to society.They staked out some ambitious destinations through time, leading tothe ultimate destination of &quot;managing global sustainability.&quot; They also established some specific goals to ensure that the tools will be in hand by 2025 to reach various sustainability targets, including universal global electrification, by midcentury. Among these goals are the acceleration of electricity-based innovation and R&amp;D and the benchmarking of our progress toward sustainability. Universal global electrification means bringing everyone in the world to at least the &quot;amenities&quot; level defined by Starr. At this level, it becomes more likely that the rich and poor nations will find common ground for pursuing sustainability policies. The roadmap stakeholders are calling for a bare minimum of 1000 kWh per person per year to be available by 2050. This would raise the average in today's developing countries to around 3000 kWh per person per year in 2050, just above the level in the United States a century earlier, around 1950. Moreover, projections suggest that it will be possible to reduce the energy intensity of economic growth by at least 50% over the next 50 years through universal electrification, with about half the reduction resulting from end-use efficiency improvements. Consequently, the 3000 kWh of 2050 will go much further in powering applications--lighting, space conditioning, industrial processes, computing, communications, and the like--than an equivalent amount of electric energy used in the United States in 1950. Already, for example, the manufacturing and widespread application of compact fluorescent lightbulbs has become a priority in China for reasons of both energy efficiency and export potential. Even with the large efficiency improvements that are anticipated in electricity generation and end use, building enough capacity to supply 9-10 billion people with power will be an enormous challenge. Total global generating capacity requirements for 2050 could reach a daunting 10,000 GW--the equivalent of bringing on-line a 1000-MW power plant somewhere in the world every two days for the next 50 years. This is a tall order, and achieving it affordably and with minimal environmental impacts will require an unusual degree of dedicated R&amp;D, supported through public and private collaboration, to accelerate the current pace of technological development. According to the roadmap stakeholders, reaching the destinations that they have defined calls for at least an additional $4 billion peryear in electricity-related R&amp;D by the United States alone. One of the key destinations, resolution of the energy-environment conflict, would in itself require an additional $2 billion per year in U.S. R&amp;D over the next 10 years to speed up the development of clean power generation. This is more than double the nation's current level of funding in this area from both the public and private sectors. The rate of innovation is especially critical to sustainability. The roadmap participants have concluded that a &quot;2% solution&quot; is neededto support a sustainable future. By this, they mean that productivity improvements in a range of areas--including global industrial processes, energy intensity, resource utilization, agricultural yield, emissions reduction, and water consumption--have to occur at a pace of 2% or more per year over the next century. If the advances are distributed on a global basis, this pace should be sufficient to keep the world ahead of growing social and environmental threats. It will also generate the global wealth necessary to progressively eliminate the root cause of these threats and will provide the means to cope with theinevitable surprises that will arise. For example, a 2% annual increase in global electricity supply, if made broadly available in developing countries, would meet the goal of providing 1000 kWh per year toevery person in the world in 2050. This means extending the benefitsof electricity to 100 million new users every year. Maintaining a 2% pace in productivity improvements for a century will be formidable. It is in line with the cumulative advancement in the United States during the twentieth century, but at least twice theworld average over that period. The disparity has been particularly great in the past 25 years, as population growth has outstripped economic development in many parts of the world. The result has been massive borrowing to maintain or enhance short-term standards of living. Staying ahead of population-related challenges is now in the enlightened self-interest of all the world's peoples, and the 2% solution offers a benchmark for success. Sustaining efficiency gains of 2% per year throughout the twenty-first century would allow essential global economic development to continue while sparing the planet. This pace, for example, should help stabilize world population (to the extent that wealth is a primary determinant of population growth), limit atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases to below agreed-upon strat egic limits, provide sufficient food for the bulk of the world's people (as well as the wherewithal to buy it), and return significant amounts of land and water to their natural states. Roadmap participants envision technology and the spread of liberal capitalism as powerful agents for the 2% solution in that they can stimulate global development and foster worldwide participation in market economies. However, the participants have also expressed some concern and caution about unbridled globalization overrunning local cultures and societies and creating instability, unrest, and conflict. Atits worst, globalization could lock weaker nations into commodity-production dependencies, leading to a survival-of-the-fittest global economy in which the rich get richer and most of the poor stay poor. Establishing greater dialogue and cooperation among developed and developing nations is therefore considered critical to ensuring that globalization delivers on its promise to be a vehicle of worldwide progress that honors the diversity of nations and peoples. Targets of sustainability There is no single measure of sustainability; rather, it will require continued progress in a wide variety of areas that reflect the growing efficiency of resource utilization, broad improvements in the quality of life for today's impoverished people, and acceleration of the historical shift away from resource-intensive economic activity. The roadmap's sustainability R&amp;D targets provide a first-order approximation of what will be required. In many cases, the targets representa significant stretch beyond today's levels, but they are all technologically achievable. The roadmap sets an optimistic course, certain that with accelerated R&amp;D and a much stronger technological foundation in hand by 2025, the world could be well on a path to economic and environmental sustainability by midcentury. The goals for sustainability are simply too far-reaching to be achieved solely through governmental directives or policy. Rather, they will be reached most readilyvia a healthy, robust global economy in which accelerated technological innovation in the private sector is strongly encouraged and supported by public policy. The challenges of bringing the world to a state of economic and environmental sustainability in the coming century are immense but not insurmountable. Technology is on the threshold of profound change, quite likely to be broader, faster, and more dramatic in its impact than that which we experienced in the twentieth century. Fortunately, the impact appears to be heading in the right direction. Much of the leading-edge technology is environmentally friendly and, from today's vantage point, is likely to lead to a global economy that is cleaner, leaner, lighter, and drier; many times more efficient, productive, and abundant; and altogether less invasive and less destructive of the natural world. History teaches us that technology can be a liberating force for humanity, allowing us to break through our own self-made limits as well as those posed by the natural world. The next steps will be to extend the benefits of innovation to the billions of people without access and, in the words of Jesse Ausubel, to begin &quot;liberating the environment itself.&quot; This entails meeting our needs with far fewer resources by developing a &quot;hydrogen economy, landless agriculture, and industrial ecosystems in which waste virtually disappears....and by broadening our notions of democracy, as well as our view of the ethical standing of trees, owls, and mountains.&quot; In many ways, the material abundance and extended human capabilities generated through hundreds of years of technology development have led us to a new understanding and heightened respect for the underlying &quot;technologies of life.&quot; Offering four billion years of experience, nature will become one of our best teachers in the new century; we are likely to see new tech nology progressively taking on the character and attributes of living systems. Technology may even begin to disappear into the landscape as microminiaturization and biological design ensue. Still, though technology is heading in the right direction, what remains principally in question is whether the pace of innovation is adequate to stay ahead of the curve of global problems and whether newadvances in technology can be quickly brought down in cost and readily distributed throughout the world. Can we achieve the 2% solution of progressive improvement in economic productivity, land and water use, recycling, emissions reduction, and agricultural yield, year afteryear, decade after decade, in nation after nation? It's a formidable challenge, but with better tools we just might be able to pull it off, If so, the key to success will not be found in one small corner ofthe world. The challenge will be met by making the basic building blocks of innovation--education, R&amp;D, infrastructure, and law--available in full measure to future generations everywhere in the world. Thatfuture begins now.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">In one of those coincidences that add some spice to events, the passage of the $700 billion financial bailout package by the US Congress the other day came at the same time as some dyed-in-wool romantics were marking the 160th anniversary of the publication of the Communist Manifesto. As you know, the slim volume penned by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848 is an almost messianic hymn to the end of capitalism and the advent of the Communist utopia. It is, therefore, no surprise that some commentators have tried to see the current problems in the banking sector of the major Western economies as a fulfillment of the Manifesto's predictions. &quot;Capitalism is dying,&quot; announced he French left wing daily Liberation. &quot;Maybe Marx was right, after all, &quot;noted a British friend who has spent most of his adult life fighting Communism.&quot; I plan to go back and read the Manifesto.&quot; Well, reading and re-reading the Communist Manifesto is always great fun. I first read it more than four decades ago when its very possession could land you in jail in Iran under the Shah. I found it poetical from the very first sentence&quot; a specter is haunting Europe etc etc. However, re-reading it the other day so that I am not caught wanting in a dinner-table discussions, I found it as pompous as the worst kind of religious literature. The kind of capitalism that Marx and Engels foresee in the little volume no longer exists, assuming that it ever did. The world is not divided into an impoverished and increasingly exploited proletariat accounting for more than 99 per cent of the population and the remaining one per cent of bourgeois leeches who suck the blood of humanity. The global economy is not dominated by a handful of giant monopolies, trusts and cartels as Marx called them, who could fix all prices plus working conditions. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that global capitalism is currently passing through a major crisis. How did this happen? Was it not only last year that British Prime Minister Gordon Brown who had made his reputation as a great economics brain was telling everyone that the era of &quot;boom and bust&quot; was gone for good? As always when faced with a political puzzle, the best person to consult is Aristotle. The ancient Greek philosopher, known to his Muslim disciples as &quot;The First Teacher&quot;, had a natural talent for the catching formula, what the Americans call &quot;the sound bite.&quot; Had he been alive today he would have made a smashing career as copywriter in a major advertising agency. At any rate, in one of his formulae he notes: &quot;Every system is corrupted by exaggerating its basic principle.&quot; Translated into plain language, this means that too much love kills love, too much religion kills religion, too much and, for our present purposes, too much capital kills capitalism. It was by following that Aristotelian precept that Muslim philosophers, starting with Farabi and Avicenna, developed their theory of measure and moderation according to which phenomena self-annihilate by going to the extreme of their possibilities. It is important to know precisely how far to go and when to stop. Now let us see how that analysis might help us understand the current crisis. Let us start with a few figures. Towards the end of the Jimmy Carter presidency in 1979, the Dow Jones index of stock values on Wall Street stood at less than 1000. Earlier this year it was hovering around 14,000, registering a 14-fold growth in just three decades. In 1979, just over five million Americans owned shares. Thirty years later, that number had risen to almost 60 million, including indirect ownership through pension funds. At the same time, the number of those who owned their homes rose from 17 per cent to more than 40 per cent. For the first time in history, a majority of the population, at least in the United States, consisted of capitalists, that is to say people who owned capital. What made this dramatic democratization of capital possible? One source of new capital was oil, producing vast sums of cash that the exporters could not invest in their own economies. According to most estimates, over the three decades in question, the oil-rich states pumped in more than a trillion dollars into the Western economies. Next, it was the turn of China to appear on the scene as a source of cheap and abundant capital. China transformed the cheap labor of its people into cash and then deposited that cash in Western banks and government bonds. By 2007, China had joined the top four investors in the US, owning American assets worth $400 billion. All this meant that the average American no longer needed o save in order to maintain the process of capital formation. All he had to do was to spend someone else's money. The Arabs, the Chinese, the Russians, the Latin Americans and, to some extent even the Europeans, did his saving for him. Things did not end there. Investment banks and brokerage houses went through a phase of creativity unprecedented in history. They transformed the already existing debts into new sources of credits and then used these to create new, and obviously notional, capital. In other words, what you owed to others, of sold to third persons, could become your capital. While all this was happening the US Federal Reserve Bank chief Alain Greenspan spoke of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; but did all it could to further encourage it. Keeping interest rates at all-time historical lows, the FED, and following it other central banks, pushed the democratization of capital to limits that no economy could sustain for long. Capital lost its import and its mystique, the respect due to it. It became too accessible, the Alice Available of every economic adventurer. Interviewed on TV the other evening, there was this American gentleman from Missouri, or somewhere like that, who was wondering aloud how the banks had agreed to lend him half a million dollars to buy a luxury house. &quot;How could they lend me that much money?&quot; he asked. &quot;They knew that I had never had two bent dimes to rub against one another.&quot; The answer is that when there is too much capital you cultivate the art of finding borrowers rather than savers. Banks wanted to get rid of all the money that was raining on them; they loved those who borrowed and hated those who saved. So, the insulted, hurt and manhandled capital is taking its revenge. It is asking to be respected again. This brings us to Nietzsche who, though never to be compared with Aristotle, was also a master of catchy formulae. Here is what he said: &quot;What does not kill me makes me stronger!&quot; The current crisis will not kill capitalism- sorry, Karl- but will make it stronger. </span><br />

Miscalculation, first strike incentives and global war<br />
Hitchens, 8 – president of the Center for Defense Information (Theresa, “Space Wars - Coming to the Sky Near You?”, Scientific American, February, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3765:http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3765 -->)<br />
<br />
Perhaps of even greater concern is that several other nations, including one of China’s regional rivals, India, may feel compelled to seek ­offensive as well as defensive capabilities in space. The U.S. trade journal Defense News, for instance, quoted unidentified Indian defense officials as stating that their country had already begun developing its own kinetic-energy (nonexplosive, hit-to-kill) and laser-based antisatellite weapons.<br />
If India goes down that path, its archrival Pakistan will probably follow suit. Like India, Pakistan has a well-developed ballistic missile program, including medium-range missiles that could launch an antisatellite system. Even Japan, the third major Asian power, might join such a space race. In June 2007 the National Diet of Japan began considering a bill backed by the current Fukuda government that would permit the development of satellites for “military and national security” purposes.<br />
As for Russia, in the wake of the Chinese test President Vladimir Putin reiterated Moscow’s stance against the weaponization of space. At the same time, though, he refused to criticize Beijing’s actions and blamed the U.S. instead. The American efforts to build a missile defense system, Putin charged, and the increasingly aggressive American plans for a military position in space were prompting China’s moves. Yet Russia itself, as a major spacefaring power that has incorporated satellites into its national security structure, would be hard-pressed to forgo entering an arms race in space.<br />
Given the proliferation of spacefaring entities, proponents of a robust space warfare strategy believe that arming the heavens is inevitable and that it would be best for the U.S. to get there first with firepower. Antisatellite and space-based weapons, they argue, will be necessary not only to defend U.S. military and commercial satellites but also to deny any future adversary the use of space capabilities to enhance the performance of its forces on the battlefield.<br />
Yet any arms race in space would almost inevitably destabilize the balance of power and thereby multiply the risks of global conflict. In such headlong competition—whether in space or elsewhere—equilibrium among the adversaries would be virtually impossible to maintain. Even if the major powers did achieve stability, that reality would still provide no guarantee that both sides would perceive it to be so. The moment one side saw itself to be slipping behind the other, the first side would be strongly tempted to launch a preemptive strike, before things got even worse. Ironically, the same would hold for the side that perceived itself to have gained an advantage. Again, there would be strong temptation to strike first, before the adversary could catch up. Finally, a space weapons race would ratchet up the chances that a mere technological mistake could trigger a battle. After all, in the distant void, reliably distinguishing an intentional act from an accidental one would be highly problematic.<br />
Hit-to-Kill Interceptors<br />
According to assessments by U.S. military and intelligence officials as well as by independent experts, the Chinese probably destroyed their weather satellite with a kinetic-energy vehicle boosted by a two-stage medium-range ballistic missile. Technologically, launching such direct-ascent antisatellite weapons is one of the simplest ways to take out a satellite. About a dozen nations and consortia can reach low Earth orbit (between roughly 100 and 2,000 kilometers, or 60 to 1,250 miles, high) with a medium-range missile; eight of those countries can reach geostationary orbit (about 36,000 kilometers, or 22,000 miles, above Earth).<br />
But the real technical hurdle to making a hit-to-kill vehicle is not launch capacity; it is the precision maneuverability and guidance technology needed to steer the vehicle into its target. Just how well China has mastered those techniques is unclear. Because the weather satellite was still operating when it was destroyed, the Chinese operators would have known its exact location at all times.<br />
Ground-Based Lasers<br />
The test of China’s direct-ascent antisatellite device came on the heels of press reports in September 2006 that the Chinese had also managed to “paint,” or illuminate, U.S. spy satellites with a ground-based laser [see lower box on page 83]. Was Beijing actually trying to “blind” or otherwise damage the satellites? No one knows, and no consensus seems to have emerged in official Washington circles about the Chinese intent. Per¬haps China was simply testing how well its network of low-power laser-ranging stations could track American orbital observation platforms.<br />
Even so, the test was provocative. Not all satellites have to be electronically “fried” to be put out of commission. A 1997 test of the army’s MIRACL system (for midinfrared advanced chemical laser) showed that satellites designed to collect optical images can be temporarily disrupted—dazzled—by low-power beams. It follows that among the satellites vulnerable to such an attack are the orbital spies.<br />
The U.S. and the former Soviet Union began experimenting with laser-based antisatellite weapons in the 1970s. Engineers in both countries have focused on the many problems of building high-power laser systems that could reliably destroy low-flying satellites from the ground. Such systems could be guided by “adaptive optics”: deformable mirrors that can continuously compensate for atmospheric distortions. But tremendous amounts of energy would be needed to feed high-power lasers, and even then the range and effectiveness of the beams would be severely limited by dispersion, by attenuation as they passed through smoke or clouds, and by the difficulty of keeping the beams on-target long enough to do damage.<br />
During the development of the SDI, the U.S. conducted several laser experiments from Hawaii, including a test in which a beam was bounced off a mirror mounted on a satellite. Laser experiments continue at the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. Pentagon budget documents from fiscal years 2004 through 2007 listed antisatellite operations among the goals of the Starfire research, but that language was removed from budget documents in fiscal year 2008 after Congress made inquiries. The Starfire system incorporates adaptive optics that narrow the outgoing laser beam and thus increase the density of its power. That capability is not required for imagery or tracking, further suggesting that Starfire could be used as a weapon.<br />
Yet despite decades of work, battle-ready versions of directed-energy weapons still seem far away. An air force planning document, for instance, predicted in 2003 that a ground-based weapon able to “propagate laser beams through the atmosphere to [stun or kill low Earth orbit] satellites” could be available between 2015 and 2030. Given the current state of research, even those dates seem optimistic.<br />
Co-orbital Satellites<br />
Recent advances in miniaturized sensors, powerful onboard computers and efficient rocket thrusters have made a third kind of antisatellite technology increasingly feasible: the offensive microsatellite. One example that demonstrates the potential is the air force’s experimental satellite series (XSS) project, which is developing microsatellites intended to conduct “autonomous proximity operations” around larger satellites. The first two microsatellites in the program, the XSS-10 and XSS-11, were launched in 2003 and 2005. Though ostensibly intended to inspect larger satellites, such microsatellites could also ram target satellites or carry explosives or directed-energy payloads such as radio-frequency jamming systems or high-powered microwave emitters. Air force budget documents show that the XSS effort is tied to a program called Advanced Weapons Technology, which is dedicated to research on military laser and microwave systems.<br />
During the cold war the Soviet Union developed, tested and even declared operational a co-orbital antisatellite system—a maneuverable interceptor with an explosive payload that was launched by missile into an orbit near a target satellite in low Earth orbit. In effect, the device was a smart “space mine,” but it was last demonstrated in 1982 and is probably no longer working. Today such an interceptor would likely be a microsatellite that could be parked in an orbit that would cross the orbits of several of its potential targets. It could then be activated on command during a close encounter.<br />
In 2005 the air force described a program that would provide “localized” space “situational awareness” and “anomaly characterization” for friendly host satellites in geostationary orbit. The program is dubbed ANGELS (for autonomous nanosatellite guardian for evaluating local space), and the budget line believed to represent it focuses on acquiring “high value space asset defensive capabilities,” including a “warning sensor for detection of a direct ascent or co-orbital vehicle.” It is clear that such guardian nanosatellites could also serve as offensive weapons if they were maneuvered close to enemy satellites.<br />
And the list goes on. A “parasitic satellite” would shadow or even attach itself to a target in geostationary orbit. Farsat, which was mentioned in an appendix to the [Donald] Rumsfeld Space Commission report in 2001, “would be placed in a ‘storage’ orbit (perhaps with many microsatellites housed inside) relatively far from its target but ready to be maneuvered in for a kill.”<br />
Finally, the air force proposed some time ago a space-based radio-frequency weapon system, which “would be a constellation of satellites containing high-power radio-frequency transmitters that possess the capability to disrupt/-destroy/disable a wide variety of electronics and national-level command and control systems.”<br />
Air force planning documents from 2003 envisioned that such a technology would emerge after 2015. But outside experts think that orbital radio-frequency and microwave weapons are technically feasible today and could be deployed in the relatively near future.<br />
Space Bombers<br />
Though not by definition a space weapon, the Pentagon’s Common Aero Vehicle/Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (often called CAV) enters into this discussion because, like an ICBM, it would travel through space to strike Earth-bound targets. An unpowered but highly maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle, the CAV would be deployed from a future hypersonic space plane, swoop down into the atmosphere from orbit and drop conventional bombs on ground targets. Congress recently began funding the project but, to avoid stoking a potential arms race in space, has prohibited any work to place weapons on the CAV. Although engineers are making steady progress on the key technologies for the CAV program, both the vehicle and its space plane mothership are still likely decades off.<br />
Some of the congressional sensitivity to the design of the CAV may have arisen from another, much more controversial space weapons concept with parallel goals: hypervelocity rod bundles that would be dropped to Earth from orbital platforms. For decades air force planners have been thinking about placing weapons in orbit that could strike terrestrial targets, particularly buried, “hardened” bunkers and caches of weapons of mass destruction. Commonly called “rods from God,” the bundles would be made up of large tungsten rods, each as long as six meters (20 feet) and 30 centimeters (12 inches) across. Each rod would be hurled downward from an orbiting spacecraft and guided to its target at tremendous speed.<br />
Both high costs and the laws of physics, however, challenge their feasibility. Ensuring that the projectiles do not burn up or deform from reentry friction while sustaining a precise, nearly vertical flight path would be extremely difficult. Calculations indicate that the nonexplosive rods would probably be no more effective than more conventional munitions. Furthermore, the expense of lofting the heavy projectiles into orbit would be exorbitant. Thus, despite continued interest in them, rods from God seem to fall into the realm of science fiction.<br />
Obstacles to Space Weapons<br />
What, then, is holding the U.S. (and other nations) back from a full-bore pursuit of space weapons? The countervailing pressures are threefold: political opposition, technological challenges and high costs.<br />
The American body politic is deeply divided over the wisdom of making space warfare a part of the national military strategy. The risks are manifold. I remarked earlier on the general instabilities of an arms race, but there is a further issue of stability among the nuclear powers. Early-warning and spy satellites have traditionally played a crucial role in reducing fears of a surprise nuclear attack. But if antisatellite weapons disabled those eyes-in-the-sky, the resulting uncertainty and distrust could rapidly lead to catastrophe.<br />
One of the most serious technological challenges posed by space weapons is the proliferation of space debris, to which I alluded earlier. According to investigators at the air force, NASA and Celestrak (an independent space-monitoring Web site), the Chinese antisatellite test left more than 2,000 pieces of junk, baseball-size and larger, orbiting the globe in a cloud that lies between about 200 kilometers (125 miles) and 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) above Earth’s surface. Perhaps another 150,000 objects that are a centimeter (half an inch) across and larger were released. High orbital velocities make even tiny pieces of space junk dangerous to spacecraft of all kinds. And ground stations cannot reliably monitor or track objects smaller than about five centimeters (two inches) across in low Earth orbit (around a meter in geostationary orbit), a capability that might enable satellites to maneuver out of the way. To avoid being damaged by the Chinese space debris, in fact, two U.S. satellites had to alter course. Any shooting war in space would raise the specter of a polluted space environment no longer navigable by Earth-orbiting satellites.<br />
Basing weapons in orbit also pre¬sents difficult technical obstacles. They would be just as vulnerable as satellites are to all kinds of outside agents: space debris, projectiles, electromagnetic signals, even natural micrometeoroids. Shielding space weapons against such threats would also be impractical, mostly because shielding is bulky and adds mass, thereby greatly increasing launch costs. Orbital weapons would be mostly autonomous mechanisms, which would make operational errors and failures likely. The paths of objects in orbit are relatively easy to predict, which would make hiding large weapons problematic. And because satellites in low Earth orbit are overhead for only a few minutes at a time, keeping one of them constantly in range would require many weapons.<br />
Finally, getting into space and operating there is extremely expensive: between $2,000 and $10,000 a pound to reach low Earth orbit and between $15,000 and $20,000 a pound for geostationary orbit. Each space-based weapon would require replacement every seven to 15 years, and in-orbit repairs would not be cheap, either.<br />
Alternatives to Space Warfare<br />
Given the risks of space warfare to national and international security, as well as the technical and financial hurdles that must be overcome, it would seem only prudent for spacefaring nations to find ways to prevent an arms race in space. The U.S. focus has been to reduce the vulnerability of its satellite fleet and explore alternatives to its dependence on satellite services. Most other space-capable countries are instead seeking multilateral diplomatic and legal measures. The options range from treaties that would ban antisatellite and space-based weapons to voluntary measures that would help build transparency and mutual confidence.<br />
The Bush administration has adamantly opposed any form of negotiations regarding space weapons. Opponents of multilateral space weapons agreements contend that others (particularly China) will sign up but build secret arsenals at the same time, because such treaty violations cannot be detected. They argue further that the U.S. cannot sit idly as potential adversaries gain spaceborne resources that could enhance their terrestrial combat capabilities.<br />
Proponents of international treaties counter that failure to negotiate such agreements entails real opportunity costs. An arms race in space may end up compromising the security of all nations, including that of the U.S., while it stretches the economic capacities of the competitors to the breaking point. And whereas many advocates of a space weapons ban concede that it will be difficult to construct a fully verifiable treaty—because space technology can be used for both military and civilian ends—effective treaties already exist that do not require strict verification. A good example is the Biological Weapons Convention. Certainly a prohibition on the testing and use (as opposed to the deployment) of the most dangerous class of near-term space weapons—destructive (as opposed to jamming) antisatellite systems—would be easily verifiable, because earthbound observers can readily detect orbital debris. Furthermore, any party to a treaty would know that all its space launches would be tracked from the ground, and any suspicious object in orbit would promptly be labeled as such. The international outcry that would ensue from such overt treaty violations could deter would-be violators.<br />
Since the mid-1990s, however, progress on establishing a new multilateral space regime has lagged. The U.S. has blocked efforts at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to begin negotiations on a treaty to ban space weapons. China, meanwhile, has refused to accept anything less. Hence, intermediate measures such as voluntary confidence-building, space traffic control or a code of responsible conduct for spacefaring nations have remained stalled.<br />
Space warfare is not inevitable. But the recent policy shift in the U.S. and China’s provocative actions have highlighted the fact that the world is approaching a crossroads. Countries must come to grips with their strong self-interest in preventing the testing and use of orbital weapons. The nations of Earth must soon decide whether it is possible to sustain the predominantly peaceful human space exploration that has already lasted half a century. The likely alternative would be unacceptable to all.<br />

United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), Space Security Conference 2011: Building on the Past, Stepping Towards the Future.Geneva, Switzerland. April 4, 2011)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your kind introduction. It is a pleasure to participate in this UNIDIR space security conference and this panel on “Ongoing Processes &amp; Proposals, Next Steps.” My hope today is that our discussion will help inform much of the work we are pursuing to strengthen security and stability in space, and so I’m here to learn as much as I am here to offer remarks. My colleague, Ambassador Laura Kennedy, spoke at last year’s conference and gave a prelude to our new National Space Policy which at that time had not yet been released. The new policy was released in June 2010. Consistent with the President’s guidance in the policy, we are pursuing measures to strengthen security and stability in space. That is what I would like to discuss with you today, and more precisely, how we can strengthen security and stability through shared space situational awareness, called “SSA” for short, and through transparency and confidence building measures, or TCBMs. Why is SSA important to space security? A long-standing principle of U.S. national space policy is that all nations have the right to explore and use space for peaceful purposes, and for the benefit of all humanity, in accordance with international law. Strengthening stability in space fundamentally depends on having awareness and understanding as to who is using the space environment, for what purposes, and under what environmental conditions. The U.S. National Space Policy directs us to collaborate with other nations, the private sector, and intergovernmental organizations to improve our SSA – in other words, to improve our shared ability to rapidly detect, warn of, characterize, and attribute natural and man-made disturbances to space systems. Having this information as early as possible and as accurately as possible is critical for a number of reasons. First, it is critical to NASA, our International Space Station partners, and all spacefaring nations, where human spaceflight safety is of the utmost importance. Second, it is critical for U.S. and allied security – indeed, everyone’s security – to enable us to detect, identify, and attribute actions in space that are contrary to responsible and peaceful use. And third, given the growing dependence we all have on space-derived information, it is critical to our global economies. Cooperation to Prevent Collisions Having information enables us to achieve SSA. However, “awareness” alone is insufficient. We also need to know what to actually do with that vital information – how do we make it “actionable” information? The challenges of increasing congestion in space – over 60 nations with varying interests now operate in space; we are tracking over 22,000 objects, there are 1,100 active systems, and hundreds of thousands of smaller objects we can’t see – and the growing complexities of operating there safely and responsibly, lead to the challenge of collision avoidance. One way that international cooperation enhances SSA is the information exchange between satellite owners and operators to prevent collisions. The United States provides notifications to other governments and commercial satellite operators of potentially hazardous conjunctions between orbiting objects. The State Department also plays a crucial role in this activity because international cooperation is necessary to ensure that we have robust situational awareness of the space environment – no one nation has the resources to be able to do this alone. The State Department continues to be extremely supportive of U.S. Strategic Command’s efforts to establish SSA sharing agreements with foreign satellite operators and to facilitate rapid notifications of potential space hazards. The United States is constantly seeking to improve its ability to share information with other spacefaring nations as well as with our commercial sector partners. For example, at State we are currently reaching out to all spacefaring nations to ensure that the Joint Space Operations Center, or JSpOC, has current contact information for both government and private sector satellite operations centers. Those efforts include ongoing discussions with Russia on measures to enhance safety for robotic space missions as well as for human spaceflight. SSA Cooperation Across the United States Government, we are supporting numerous multilateral and bilateral engagements in SSA. For example, the United States is collaborating with our friends and allies in Europe as they consider developing their own SSA system. We are collaborating with the Department of Defense to engage in technical exchanges with experts from the European Space Agency, the European Union, and individual ESA and EU Member States to ensure our existing and planned SSA systems contribute to a more comprehensive situational awareness picture to ensure the safety, stability, and security of the space domain. In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense has signed bilateral SSA statements of principles with Canada, France, and Australia. Looking ahead, the United States also sees opportunities for cooperation on SSA with other nations around the globe. SSA benefits all responsible spacefaring nations. International “Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities” Another challenge we all face is promoting responsible and peaceful behavior in space. Meeting this challenge depends not only on taking positive steps, both unilaterally and multilaterally, to enhance the sustainability of space activities, but also conducting those activities in an open and transparent manner. Upon their implementation, some TCBMs also have the potential of enhancing our knowledge of the space environment, thereby strengthening security and stability in space. For instance, the United States is continuing to consult with the European Union on its initiative to develop a comprehensive set of multilateral TCBMs, also known as the international &quot;Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities.&quot; We hope to make a decision in the near term as to whether the United States can sign on to this Code, including what, if any, modifications would be necessary. An example where a Code of Conduct could contribute to our shared SSA is its political commitment to provide notifications in a timely manner of malfunctions that might place space objects at risk, as well as any accidents or collisions that might have taken place. The United States is already following such practices – as we did when we promptly notified Russia through diplomatic channels when we detected the collision of a commercial Iridium satellite with an inoperable Russian military spacecraft in February 2009. This experience is contributing to our ongoing dialogue with Russia on developing additional concrete and pragmatic bilateral TCBMs that will enhance spaceflight safety. Non-legally binding measures such as the proposed Code could build on our existing practices as well as U.S. and allied SSA capabilities by mitigating the risk of mishaps, misperceptions, and mistrust. Cooperation on “Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities” Another initiative is the multi-year study of “long-term sustainability of space activities” within the Scientific and Technical Sub-Committee of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). This effort will be forming an experts group to address SSA and space operations. In addition, a separate experts group will examine space weather, which is also an important aspect of SSA. We are hopeful that this effort will lead to the formation of voluntary “best practice guidelines,” which will help reduce operational risks to all space systems. In addition to drawing on the expertise of government experts, this working group also will draw upon the background, experience and best practices that have been developed by commercial satellite operators. Conclusion SSA is essential to strengthen security and stability in space and sustainability of our space activities. To this end, the United States is striving to improve our ability to monitor, track, and provide notifications regarding space objects. However, everyone’s picture of the space environment is greatly enhanced through international cooperation and shared SSA. Furthermore, strengthening security and stability in space is in everyone’s interests. It can be achieved through pursuing TCBMs that promote responsible behavior and the peaceful use of space. Examples of this cooperation include initiatives such as the EU’s proposal for an international Code of Conduct and the COPUOS Agenda Item on Long-Term Sustainability. Such cooperation with established and emerging members of the spacefaring community and with the private sector will help to preserve the space environment for the benefit of all nations and future generations. Thank you. I look forward to your questions and our discussion.<br />

US nuclear deterrence key to prevent miscalculation over Taiwan.<br />

<br />
Unlike the case with Russia, a U.S.-China nuclear crisis or even confrontation is not inconceivable. Precipitous action by Taiwan could be one trigger; a decision by Chinese officials to act against Taiwan another. In any such confrontation over Taiwan, it is conceivable that Chinese offi- cials could miscalculate the readiness of the United States to support Tai- wan. Chinese officials also could miscalculate their ability to manage the risks of escalation. In that regard, some Chinese experts have stated in- formally that such an asymmetry of stakes would put the United States at a fundamental disadvantage in any China-Taiwan-U.S. crisis. That is, in their view, given asymmetric stakes, the United States would be reluctant to es- calate even after a Chinese limited use of a nuclear weapon.30 The U.S.-China strategic relationship also is characterized by mu- tual uncertainties about each other’s longer-term strategic intentions in both Washington and Beijing. In Washington, the scope and goals of China’s planned nuclear modernization as well as its readiness to play a construc- tive role in dealing with pressing non-proliferation problems remain open questions. Beijing’s decision to test an anti-satellite weapon in January, 2007 clearly reinforced those uncertainties. In Beijing, the scope and goals of U.S. deployment of missile defenses and advanced conventional weap- ons is being closely watched given concerns about a possible U.S. pursuit of a disarming first strike against China’s nuclear arsenal. For their part, China’s experts and officials have signaled that the scope and pace of China’s nuclear modernization is linked to those American deployments. So viewed, China is prepared to do whatever it takes to preserve a limited nuclear deterrent.31 Against this backdrop, the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent has a role to play in lessening the risk of Chinese miscalculation over Taiwan. More broadly, as suggested above, the American presence in Asia and the U.S. nuclear deterrent also is seen by some Japanese and other officials as a reassuring factor in the context of China’s growing military capabilities and political rise in Asia. U.S. officials need to continue to make clear U.S. support for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question. U.S. officials need to be prepared to counter Chinese perceptions that an asymmetry of stakes reduces the risks of China of threats or use of force should any con- frontation over Taiwan occur. The steps set out above to buttress the U.S.- Japan and U.S.-Korea alliance relationship also provide a broader reassur- ance vis-à-vis China.<br />

Watts 5/11, 2011 Prepared Statement of Barry D. Watts Senior Fellow, Center for Strategic &amp; Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) Testimony before the U.S.­China Economic and Security Review Commission The Implications of China’s Military and Civil Space Programs<br />
There is extensive evidence that the PLA understands these U.S. dependencies and is making every effort to find ways to be able to exploit them in any future conflict with the United States. The Chinese are investing in everything from jamming to counter­network attack (the offensive form of cyber warfare), anti­ satellite (ASAT) systems, and directed­energy weapons. Retired Vice Admiral Mike McConnell argued in February 2010 that the United States is already engaged in a cyber­war with various competitors, adding that the United States was losing this “war,” particularly against China. 13 As for traditional “kinetic” approaches to undermining U.S. access to space, in January 2007 China demonstrated a direct­ascent ASAT capability by destroying one of its own aging LEO weather satellites with a kinetic­kill vehicle launched by a mobile missile at the Xichang space facility in Sichuan province. 14 Suffice it to say that even if the PLA would hesitate to disarm its own precision­strike capabilities by taking out both sides space systems in a future conflict, the Chinese will certainly do what they can to degrade and interfere with unimpeded U.S. access to space.<br />

<br />
What to do? There are few easy answers. However, the history of US exploration offers insight about places we can start. First, we should accept that “exploration” is a multivalent term, with many meanings, some of which are contradictory, and all of which have historical precedent. For too long we have looked at the history of exploration selectively, seeking to find the antecedents which justify our own vision of exploration: as science, as human adventure, as geopolitical statement. This is a definitional fight which cannot be won. Space policy must acknowledge the multiple visions for space exploration, developing a clear-eyed metric of value which avoids the vagaries of lofty “exploration-speak”. If the merits of human exploration of the Moon and Mars are primarily symbolic and geopolitical, what are these goals worth in terms of federal funding? What are costs and benefits of missions developed to express “soft power” vs. science? Finally, which goals or combination of goals offers the best chance of long-term buy-in by the taxpayer? While historical precedent defines exploration in terms of human explorers who travel to new destinations, that definition is woefully obsolete with regard to discovery in an era in which teleoperation offers virtual presence for explorers who remain on the surface of the Earth. As has been pointed out by many authors, “robots” have come to be less personal assistants who follow us dutifully, and more expendable extensions of our senses. In this respect, science can be viewed as arguably the most important frontier for humankind, and whether it is done by humans in situ or by humans remotely is no longer a particularly relevant distinction.<br />

The Japanese Government’s Space Activities Commission (SAC) has released its latest Long-Term Vision of Japan’s future in the exploration and use of outer space. The Vision will contribute to the formulation of government policy for space development. In this article, the philosophy of space development is defined as follows: ‘It enables space to be used as the common property of all mankind in order to contribute to the enduring prosperity of all those living on Earth.’ Within this philosophy, Japan’s principal objectives are projected into the middle of the twenty-first century as being: construction of a global Earth observation system; promotion of advanced space science programmes; full implementation of space activities using the Japanese Experiment Module of the International Space Station; and development and operation of new space infrastructures.<br />

 Broad definitions good<br />
<br />
Broad definitions are vital to sustaining NASA – requires the advocacy of the space community and is central to topic education<br />

<br />
Spaceflight, especially involving human missions, is still perceived by many in the general public as an optional activity, not necessary for their survival or welfare.29 One lesson to be drawn from the above discussion is that the space program needs to shed its image of being something ‘‘special’’ that involves occasional episodes of interesting and exciting activity. NASA and members of the space community have cultivated the ‘‘special’’ image over the years, but this is no longer fruitful and may invite competition from other national interests seeking to assert that space is no more ‘‘special’’ than they are. For space exploration and development to prosper over the long term, it must be widely perceived as a mainstream activity that benefits the national interest. This will require two things: continuous visibility and public education. To achieve continuous visibility, NASA, with the help of the rest of the space community, needs to demonstrate scientific, technical, social, and economic benefits in its space exploration programs routinely. This will necessitate a broad definition of space exploration that includes not just human spaceflight, but anything that looks out beyond low Earth orbit, from orbiting telescopes like Hubble to robotic probes to planets and moons. Research programs cannot always provide routine displays of progress on a preferred schedule, but a broad definition opens up more possibilities for associating benefits with the program<br />

Humans explore. We have explored unceasingly throughout history, continually advancing the frontiers of our knowledge and understanding as well as our geographical frontiers. Inspired by the feats of such explorers as Columbus and Magellan, Lewis and Clark, Perry and Shackelton, Gagarin and Armstrong, we tend to equate exploration with human exploration—with “boldly going where no one has gone before.” But this definition of exploration is too narrow. It ignores a different mode of exploration, one that uses technology to extend the human senses to places inaccessible or inhospitable to the human presence. Now, human exploration is embarking on an ambitious journey to the nearest planet, Mars. It is a long-term and expensive endeavor, which may well turn out to be worth the effort. But, should other forms of space exploration be cancelled or curtailed to make this new, but limited, exploration vision possible? We think and hope not. Space exploration has never been limited to places where it is feasible to send only humans. The scientific community has identified the critical problems of Solar and Space Physics in a recent Decadal Survey by the National Research Council2. To solve these problems we must continue our robotic exploration of the Sun, the heliosphere, and the space environments and atmospheres of Earth and the other planets. These critical problems are designed to aid and enhance human exploration and human technology. These critical problems are: 1. Understand the structure and dynamics of the Sun’s interior, the generation of solar magnetic fields, the origin of the solar cycle, the causes of solar activity, and the structure and dynamics of the corona. 2. Understand heliospheric structure, the distribution of magnetic fields and matter throughout the solar system, and the interaction of the solar atmosphere with the local interstellar medium. 3. Understand the space environments of Earth and other solar system bodies and their dynamical response to external and internal influences. 4. Understand the basic physical principles manifest in processes observed in solar and space plasmas. 5. Develop near-real-time predictive capability for understanding and quantifying the impact on human activities of dynamical processes at the Sun, in the interplanetary medium, and in Earth’s magnetosphere and ionosphere. The scientists and engineers involved in this study recommended that the government focus on these goals to further fundamental understanding of the space environment and its effects on technologies and human space flight. These individuals continue to believe strongly that by addressing these questions, we will build beyond a decade-long renaissance in understanding the many physical processes that link the Sun’s intrinsic dynamics through interplanetary space to the environments of the Earth and other planets. To solve the critical problems of solar and space physics, new missions are needed that explore and image critical regions and phenomena. In addition, we now recognize the unprecedented power of the diverse array of scientific satellites in space and observatories on Earth, which are complemented by capable computer models that ingest observations to make predictions of increasing value and accuracy. This collective of observatories - a Great Observatory for our Earth and solar system’s space environment (just as the Hubble, Chandra, and Spitzer telescopes are for the distant universe) - has grown to be much greater than the sum of its parts. Extended operation of many existing missions provides an economical way of advancing the understanding of critical space processes. Operating spacecraft often add significant value to the measurements anticipated from newly launched spacecraft because spatially distributed probes are invaluable for understanding the extended spatial domain that influences the Earth, planets, and the solar system as a whole. Continuity of measurements is often needed because many processes must be observed over one or two solar cycles before they can be fully understood. The challenge that NASA faces today is how to advance human exploration while not retreating from robotic and scientific exploration. We urge NASA to continue to explore broadly as it has since its creation. The most fruitful interactions between scientific disciplines, those that transform our view of the world and cosmos, have rarely been planned or foreseen, and they usually were many years in the making. To narrow our vision now will weaken the very fabric of exploration in the future. In short, we urge NASA to maintain the reach of robotic and scientific exploration as it readies a new era of human exploration.<br />

The difficulty with this argument is that it defines exploration as motion in space and reasons that, therefore, we must keep moving in space, or else we're not exploring and will therefore stop improving ourselves. This may have had some validity in an era when there was a lot of usable geography unexplored, and that a curious people who naturally generate people who wanted to see what was Over There. However, it confuses causation; a lack of exploration in such a case would be a SYMPTOM of a non-exploratory attitude, not the CAUSE of the attitude. Today we have physically explored most of our planet; the question is whether the exploratory attitude can be continued without ever-wider physical exploration. It's difficult to see how even the complete lack of a space program would discourage software engineers, artists, biophysicists and so on from usefully exploring their fields. And of course, we'll always have some sort of space exploration; with our telescopes and whatnot we see further every year. It is not necessary to do things physically to experience the adventure, awe and majesty of exploration. Exploration needs to be redefined away from mere motion in space into the gathering of useful information.<br />

What to do? There are few easy answers. However, the history of US exploration offers insight about places we can start. First, we should accept that “exploration” is a multivalent term, with many meanings, some of which are contradictory, and all of which have historical precedent. For too long we have looked at the history of exploration selectively, seeking to find the antecedents which justify our own vision of exploration: as science, as human adventure, as geopolitical statement. This is a definitional fight which cannot be won. Space policy must acknowledge the multiple visions for space exploration, developing a clear-eyed metric of value which avoids the vagaries of lofty “exploration-speak”<br />

The historical record offers a rich set of examples of what we call exploration: Christopher Columbus sailing to the New World, Roald Amundsen driving his dogs towards the South Pole, and Neil Armstrong stepping into the soft dust of the Moon. Yet these examples illustrate the difficulty in pinning down exploration as an activity. If we define exploration as travel through an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it we exclude Columbus, whose discovery was serendipitous rather than purposeful. We would also have to exclude Amundsen and Armstrong, and indeed many of the pantheon of explorers, who tended to dash across new terrain rather than investigate it systematically. Even more expansive terms such as “discovery” sometimes offer a poor fit for the object of modern expeditions: did Robert Peary discover the North Pole in 1909, an axis point that Greek astronomers knew about 2500 years ago? Not in any meaningful sense of the word. Students of exploration, then, must make peace with this uncomfortable fact: “exploration” is a multivalent term, one which has been (and undoubtedly will continue to be) used in different ways by different people. Geographical discovery, scientific investigation, resource extraction, and high-risk travel are activities tucked inside this definitional basket.<br />
<br />
Because of exploration's multiple historical meanings, policy makers and administrators have often used this history selectively and out of context.<br />

<br />
The F-22 is the world's most advanced fifth-generation fighter aircraft. The F-22 offers several unique features: thrust-vectoring engines, which make it highly maneuverable; the latest in stealth technology; an avionics system that can fuse information into a single display; and the ability to cruise at supersonic speeds at 50,000 feet. What makes the Raptor spectacular--and why its capabilities cannot simply be replaced by additional F-35 Joint Strike Fighters--is the F-22A's unique ability to accelerate beyond the threat and reposition for attack. Naturally, Congress is protective of these unrivaled technologies. Even though core allies like Japan and Australia have repeatedly expressed interest in purchasing a modified version of the F-22, Congress has yet to produce a final bill that waives legislation preventing the aircraft from being exported. The continued growth of China's defense budget and the technological advancements of its People's Liberation Army (PLA) have alarmed many of America's allies in the western Pacific, prompting them to invest in expanding their own military capabilities. Since 1998, various allies have inquired about purchasing the F-22. Japan has been the most vocal, persistently lobbying the U.S. government for the opportunity to acquire the aircraft to replace its aging fleet of F-4 Phantoms. A major air combat capability review conducted by the Australian Department of Defence in 2008 also analyzed the benefits of purchasing the F-22. Although Australia's 2009 Defence White Paper proposed buying 100 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, many analysts believe Australia would be interested in taking advantage of the joint air dominance capabilities provided by the tandem operation of the F-22 and F-35 aircraft if the F-22 were available for export. South Korea and Israel have also shown interest in the Raptor. With the F-22 line set to permanently close down in December 2011 if Congress does not purchase additional aircraft, the window for developing a variant of the F-22 that may be sold to allies in the Pacific, including possibly South Korea, is rapidly closing. A modified F-22 would provide these countries with the most advanced fighter on the market and help reinforce America's hedging strategy in the region by increasing interoperability with U.S. military forces. Foreign sales of the F-22 would also reduce the unit cost of the aircraft, potentially paving the way for the procurement of additional F-2As to help fulfill the Air Force's military requirement of 243 aircraft. The original concerns that prompted Congress to prevent the export of the F-22--the need for America to retain its fighter aircraft technological edge--no longer outweigh the two pressing demands: increasing the air superiority capability of America's Asian allies and retaining a national option to keep the production line open should Congress authorize production of more F-22s in the future. Hedging against the medium- and long-term implications of China's military modernization will remain a critical component of America's strategy in the Pacific. Selling the F-22 to core allies that share both America's values and interests, like Japan and Australia (and even South Korea), will only contribute to this effort. Moreover, the U.S.'s relationship with both countries has only deepened in the past decade as concerns over North Korea's nuclear program and China's growing military have drawn their interests closer to those of the U.S. Finally, an allied variant F-22 by default would be designed to alleviate the original concern of giving away too much critical technology. Congress has an opportunity in the pending FY 2010 defense appropriations bill to advance a series of mutually reinforcing goals that will contribute to American national security. While the original ban may have been prudent during the post-Cold War period of the 1990s, America's stronger relationships with Japan and Australia--coupled with the growing sophistication of China's PLA--have raised the stakes in the Pacific. Ensuring a stable balance of power in the region to hedge against uncertainty and stave off miscalculation demands that America's allies have the opportunity to field the most advanced fifth-generation platform on the market. Studying the feasibility and cost of an F-22 allied variant is critical as well for America's shrinking aerospace industrial base. An allied variant in full-rate production for multiple countries would keep most elements of the F-22A production line &quot;hot&quot; for the next decade. Keeping the production open will result in greater efficiency and a reduced per unit cost--thereby creating an opportunity for Congress to purchase the 40 additional Raptors needed to meet the Air Force's &quot;medium&quot; risk air superiority requirement. Congress is faced with a decision that stands to impact the next 30 years of U.S. air power and strategy in the Pacific. The unique opportunity now exists to significantly enhance the military capacity of America's closest allies in the Pacific. Congress should seize this moment and reward allies like Japan, Australia, and possibly South Korea with the option to purchase the F-22.<br />

The people-Congress link. Even more important than the difficulties faced by Congress in holding agencies to account is the difficulty faced by the public in holding Congress to account for what the agencies do. As Justice Pow-ell stated in a concurring opinion in Chadha, &quot;Congress is most ac-countable politically when it prescribes rules of general applicability.&quot;16 The classic notion of accountability required majorities in Congress to take personal, public responsibility for a law. To that end, Article I of the Constitution specifically requires that &quot;the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.'17 So a controversial law can take effect only if a sufficient number of legislators support it explicitly and on the record. In contrast, the oversight notion of accountability allows Congress to sustain an agency law through inaction or to change the agency law through the informal activity of a few influential members. This enables legislators to accede to a controversial law without having to assume any personal or public responsibility for it.<br />

When other major states consider whether to work with the United States or resist it, the fact that it is an open, stable democracy matters. The outside world can see American policymaking at work and can even find opportunities to enter the process and help shape how the overall order operates. Paris, London, Berlin, Moscow, Tokyo and even Beijing-in each of these capitals officials can readily find reasons to conclude that an engagement policy toward the United States will be more effective than balancing against U.S. power. America in large part stumbled into this open, institutionalized order in the 1940s, as it sought to rebuild the postwar world and to counter Soviet communism. In the late 1940s, in a pre-echo of today's situation, the United States was the world's dominant state--constituting 45 percent of world GNP, leading in military power, technology, finance and industry, and brimming with natural resources. But America nonetheless found itself building world order around stable and binding partnerships. Its calling card was its offer of Cold War security protection. But the intensity of political and economic cooperation between the United States and its partners went well beyond what was necessary to counter the Soviet threat. As the historian Geir Lundestad has observed, the expanding American political order in the half century after World War II was in important respects an &quot;empire by invitation.&quot; The remarkable global reach of American postwar hegemony has been at least in part driven by the efforts of European and Asian governments to harness U.S. power, render that power more predictable, and use it to overcome their own regional insecurities. The result has been a vast system of America-centered economic and security partnerships. Even though the United States looks like a wayward power to many around the world today, it nonetheless has an unusual ability to co-opt and reassure. Three elements matter most in making U.S. power more stable, engaged and restrained. First, America's mature political institutions organized around the rule of law have made it a relatively predictable and cooperative hegemon. The pluralistic and regularized way in which U.S. foreign and security policy is made reduces surprises and allows other states to build long-term, mutually beneficial relations. The governmental separation of powers creates a shared decision-making system that opens up the process and reduces the ability of any one leader to make abrupt or aggressive moves toward other states. An active press and competitive party system also provide a service to outside states by generating information about U.S. policy and determining its seriousness of purpose. The messiness of a democracy can, indeed, frustrate American diplomats and confuse foreign observers. But over the long term, democratic institutions produce more consistent and credible policies--policies that do not reflect the capricious and idiosyncratic whims of an autocrat.<br />

The environmental movement is treading water and slowly drowning. There is abundant evidence that our efforts -- and they have been formidable, even heroic -- have largely failed. After 30 years of exceedingly hard work and tremendous sacrifice, we have failed to stem the tide of environmental deterioration. Make no mistake: our efforts have had a beneficial effect. Things would be much worse today if our work of the past 30 years had never occurred. However, the question is, Have our efforts been adequate? Have we succeeded? Have we even come close to stemming the tide of destruction? Has our vision been commensurate with the scale and scope of the problems we set out to solve? To those questions, if we are honest with ourselves, we must answer No. What, then, are we to do? This article is intended to provoke thought and debate, and certainly is not offered as the last word on anything. Openness Open, democratic decision-making will be an essential component of any successful strategy. After the Berlin wall fell, we got a glimpse of what had happened to the environment and the people under the Soviet dictatorship. The Soviets had some of the world's strictest environmental laws on the books, but without the ability for citizens to participate in decisions, or blow the whistle on egregious violations, those laws meant nothing. For the same reason that science cannot find reliable answers without open peer review, bureaucracies (whether public or private) cannot achieve beneficial results without active citizen participation in decisions and strong protection for whistle-blowers. Errors remain uncorrected, narrow perspectives and selfish motives are rewarded, and the general welfare will not usually be promoted. The fundamental importance of democratic decision-making means that our strategies must not focus on legislative battles. Clearly, we must contend for the full power of government to be harnessed toward achieving our goals, but this is quite different from focusing our efforts on lobbying campaigns to convince legislators to do the right thing from time to time. Lobbying can mobilise people for the short term, but mobilising is not the same as organising. During the past 30 years, the environmental movement has had some notable successes mobilising people, but few successes building long-term organisations that people can live their lives around and within (the way many families in the '30s, '40s and '50s lived their lives around and within their unions' struggles). The focus of our strategies must be on building organisations that involve people and, in that process, finding new allies. The power to govern would naturally flow from those efforts. This question of democracy is not trivial. It is deep. And it deeply divides the environmental movement, or rather movements. Many members of the mainstream environmental movement tend to view ordinary people as the enemy (for example, they love to say, “We have met the enemy and he is us”.). They fundamentally don't trust people to make good decisions, so they prefer to leave ordinary people out of the equation. Instead, they scheme with lawyers and experts behind closed doors, then announce their “solution”. Then they lobby Congress in hopes that Congress will impose this latest “solution” on us all. Naturally, such people don't develop a big following, and their “solutions” -- even when Congress has been willing to impose them -- have often proven to be expensive, burdensome and ultimately unsuccessful. Experts In the modern era, open democratic decision-making is essential to survival. Only by informing people, and trusting their decisions, can we survive as a human society. Our technologies are now too complex and too powerful to be left solely in the hands of a few experts. If they are allowed to make decisions behind closed doors, small groups of experts can make fatal errors. One thinks of the old Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) justifying above-ground nuclear weapons testing. In the early 1950s, their atomic fallout was showering the population with strontium-90, a highly radioactive element that masquerades as calcium when it is taken into the body. Once in the body, strontium-90 moves into the bones, where it irradiates the bone marrow, causing cancer. The AEC's best and brightest studied this problem in detail and argued in secret memos that the only way strontium-90 could get into humans would be through cattle grazing on contaminated grass. They calculated the strontium-90 intake of the cows, and the amount that would end up in the cows' bones. On that basis, the AEC reported to Congress in 1953, “The only potential hazard to human beings would be the ingestion of bone splinters which might be intermingled with muscle tissue in butchering and cutting of the meat. An insignificant amount would enter the body in this fashion.” Thus, they concluded, strontium-90 was not endangering people. The following year, Congress declassified many of the AEC's deliberations. As soon as these memos became public, scientists and citizens began asking, “What about the cows' milk?” The AEC scientists had no response. They had neglected to ask whether strontium-90, mimicking calcium, would contaminate cows' milk, which of course it did. Secrecy in government and corporate decision-making continues to threaten the well-being of everyone on the planet as new technologies are deployed at an accelerating pace after inadequate consideration of their effects. Open, democratic decision-making is no longer a luxury. In the modern world, it is a necessity for human survival.<br />

 <br />
<span class="Underline">Private sector alone can’t solve --- too expensive. Initial action by the federal government is key.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Spudis, planetary scientist at the Applied Physics Laboratory and former member of the President’s Commission on the Implementation of US Space Exploration Policy, 7 (1/22/07, Paul, The Space Review, “A full of opportunity; NASA gave six reasons for going back to the Moon when only one was needed,” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3784:http://www.thespacereview.com/article/791/1 --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/791/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thespacereview.com/article/791/1</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3784 -->)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">In short, we are going to the Moon for one clear and understandable reason—to be able to do everything else that we want to do in space. The Moon is our school, laboratory, and foundry. The Vision begins by building a highway through the heart of cislunar space, creating a transportation infrastructure for diverse users: scientists, miners, sellers and buyers, and ultimately, settlers.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">What is the role of NASA and the federal government in all of this? It is not to industrialize space, but to determine if the industrialization of space is possible. To accomplish such an expansive space vision requires us to understand exactly how difficult these tasks really are. Possible in theory is one thing—practical to implement is something else entirely. NASA must push the technical envelope—to address and answer questions and develop new processes too expensive or too difficult for the private sector to tackle. Learning how to live on another world and extract what you need from it is a challenging task, one suitable for a federal R&amp;D effort. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">After understanding the technical difficulties and opening up possibilities, government should step back and let market forces work while still retaining a presence to enforce the law and assure that compelling national strategic interests are served. Thus, while government will never become a resource producer, it is needed to insure that corporations respect property rights and compete fairly in an open market, subject to the same anti-trust and securities regulation as any other modern American business.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">So why are some still asking, “Why are we going to the Moon?” Some space constituencies are clearly uncomfortable with the strategic direction outlined above. For many, the idea of a government-funded program, controlled by and operated for the benefit of the academic science community, is the “right” way to run a space program. In the absence of any national Presidential or Congressional leadership, such a science-driven agenda has been ascendant for the last 15 years. During the Apollo era, the marshalling of national resources by the government to carry out space goals on a wartime footing was the dominant mode of operation.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Using what we find in space to enable exploration and to create new capability has never been attempted. The Vision’s goal is to extend human commerce beyond low Earth orbit, where the universe becomes accessible to everyone. America’s desire to explore and create new wealth has allowed our society to thrive and to prosper. The Vision for Space Exploration extends that opportunity for all humanity into the Solar System and the universe beyond. </span><br />

Consult Kills Hegemony<br />

What are the practical arguments? <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">There is a school of realists who agree that liberal internationalism is nonsense, but who argue plausibly that we need international or allied support</span>, regardless. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">One of their arguments is that if a power consistently shares rulemaking with others, it is more likely to get aid and assistance from them. I have my doubts. The U.S. made an extraordinary effort during the Gulf War to get U.N. support, share decision-making and assemble a coalition.</span> As I have pointed out, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">it even denied itself the fruits of victory in order to honor coalition goals. Did this diminish anti-Americanism in the region</span>? Did it garner support for subsequent Iraq policy - policy dictated by the original acquiescence to that coalition? <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">The</span> attacks of September 11 were planned during the Clinton administration, an administration that made a <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">fetish of consultation and did its utmost to subordi­nate American hegemony. Yet resentments were hardly assuaged, because extremist rage against the U.S. is engendered by the very structure of the international system, not by our management of it. </span>Pragmatic realists value multilateralism in the interest of sharing burdens, on the theory that if you share decision-making, you enlist others in your own hegemony enterprise. As proponents of this school argued recently in Foreign Affairs, “Straining relationships now will lead only to a more challenging policy environment later on.” This is a pure cost-benefit analysis of multilateralism versus unilateralism<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">. If the concern about unilateralism is that American assertiveness be judiciously rationed and that one needs to think long-term, hardly anybody will disagree. One does not go it alone or dictate terms on every issue. There's no need to. </span>On some issues, such as membership in the World Trade Organization, where the long-term benefit both to the U.S. and to the global interest is demonstrable, one willingly constricts sovereignty. Trade agreements are easy calls, however, free trade being perhaps the only mathematically provable political good. Other agreements require great skepticism. The Kyoto Protocol on climate change, for example, would have had a disastrous effect on the American economy, while doing nothing for the global environment. Increased emissions from China, India and other third-world countries which are exempt from its provisions clearly would have overwhelmed and made up for whatever American cuts would have occurred. Kyoto was therefore rightly rejected by the Bush administration. It failed on its merits, but it was pushed very hard nonetheless, because the rest of the world supported it. The same case was made during the Clinton administration for chemical and biological weapons treaties, which they negotiated assiduously under the logic of, “Sure, they're useless or worse, but why not give in, in order to build good will for future needs?” The problem is that appeasing multilateralism does not assuage it; appeasement only legitimizes it. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">Repeated acquiescence on provisions that America deems injurious reinforces the notion that legitimacy derives from international consensus. This is</span> not only a moral absurdity. It is <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">injurious to the U.S., because it undermines any future ability of the U.S. to act unilaterally, if necessary</span>. The key point I want to make about the new <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">unilateralism</span> is that we <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">have to be guided by our own independent judgment, both about our own interests and about global interests. This is true especially on questions of national security, war making, and freedom of action in the deployment of power. America should neither defer nor contract out such decision-making, particularly when the concessions involve per­manent structural constrictio</span>ns, such as those imposed by the International Criminal Court. Should we exercise prudence? Yes. There is no need to act the superpower in East Timor or Bosnia, as there is in Afghanistan or in Iraq. There is no need to act the superpower on steel tariffs, as there is on missile defense. The prudent exercise of power calls for occasional concessions on non-vital issues, if only to maintain some psychological goodwill. There's no need for gratuitous high-handedness or arrogance. <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">We shouldn't</span>, however, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">delude ourselves as to what psychological goodwill can buy. Countries will cooperate with us first out of their own self­interest, and second out of the need and desire to cultivate good relations with the world's unipolar power. Warm feelings are a distant third.</span> After the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, Yemen did everything it could to stymie the American investigation. It lifted not a finger to suppress terrorism at home, and this was under an American administration that was obsessively multilateralist and accommodating. Yet today, <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">under the most unilateralist American administration in memory, Yemen has decided to assist in the war on terrorism. This was</span> not the result of a sudden attack of Yemeni goodwill, or of a quick re-reading of the Federalist Papers. It was <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">a result of the war in Afghanistan, which concentrated the mind of recalcitrant states on the price of non-cooperation. Coalitions are not made by superpowers going begging hat in hand; they are made by asserting a position and inviting others to join.</span> What even pragmatic realists fail to understand is that <span style="font-family: Georgia,serif; text-decoration: none;">unilateralism is the high road to multilateralism</span>. It was when the first President Bush said that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait would not stand, and made it clear that he was prepared to act alone if necessary, that he created the Gulf War coalition.<br />

<strong>US-Russia Relations Resilient</strong><br />
<strong>Vipperman ’10</strong>- Foundation for Russian American Economic Cooperation (July 26, 2010, Carol, Modern Russia, “Broader trade ties as the next step in U.S.-Russia trade relations”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.modernrussia.com/content/broader-trade-ties-next-step-us-russia-trade-relations" rel="nofollow">http://www.modernrussia.com/content/broader-trade-ties-next-step-us-russia-trade-relations</a>)<br />
The U.S.-Russia relationship certainly has been in the news lately with the one year anniversary of the “reset” upon us, likelihood of a new START Treaty, and the recent, highly publicized visit by President Medvedev to the United States. Riding on a surge of good will, the U.S.-Russia relationship was put to the test in July by a spy scandal that had potential to derail this progress. In my mind, the quickness with which this potential setback was resolved affirmed both countries’ commitment to the “reset” in our bilateral relationship. For those of us who care about the U.S. relationship with Russia, this is encouraging. Throughout the last 20+ years it is clear that continuing to develop a strong and durable partnership between Russia and the United States was, and is, important to our mutual long-term regional and global strategic interests.<br />

<strong>No Impact to US-Russia Relations</strong><br />
<strong>Graham 7 – National Security Advisor</strong><br />
Thomas Graham, senior advisor on Russia in the US National Security Council staff 2002-2007, 9- 2007, “The Dialectics of Strength and Weakness,” Russia in Global Affairs, pg. 19<br />
An astute historian of Russia, Martin Malia, wrote several years ago that “Russia has at different times been demonized or divinized by Western opinion less because of her real role in Europe than because of the fears and frustrations, or hopes and aspirations, generated within European society by its own domestic problems.” Such is the case today. To be sure, mounting Western concerns about Russia are a consequence of Russian policies that appear to undermine Western interests, but they are also a reflection of declining confidence in our own abilities and the efficacy of our own policies. Ironically, this growing fear and distrust of Russia come at a time when Russia is arguably less threatening to the West, and the United States in particular, than it has been at <strong>any time</strong> since the end of the Second World War. Russia does not champion a totalitarian ideology intent on our destruction, its military poses no threat to sweep across Europe, its economic growth depends on constructive commercial relations with Europe, and its strategic arsenal – while still capable of annihilating the United States – is under more reliable control than it has been in the past fifteen years and the threat of a strategic strike approaches zero probability. Political gridlock in key Western countries, however, precludes the creativity, risk-taking, and subtlety needed to advance our interests on issues over which we are at odds with Russia while laying the basis for more constructive long-term relations with Russia.<br />

CP fails – coordination and collaboration across the federal level is the only way to overcome the status quo problems<br />

A critical aspect in strengthening the SSA mission is ensuring there is effective coordination and collaboration across the federal government, especially given the many organizations involved with SSA, along with their differing missions. While the Secretary of Defense does not have explicit authority to execute his responsibility to develop capabilities, plans, and options for SSA, his responsibility has been clarified by the National Space Policy and there are some actions in place or under development to facilitate SSA acquisitions, such as a national architecture and initial capabilities document. Nevertheless, given past difficulties in coordinating space acquisitions that span DOD and federal agencies, coordination and collaboration need to be carefully monitored and new oversight tools, such as the National Security Space Strategy, provide opportunities to clearly lay out expectations, responsibilities, and authorities. Because implementation of the National Space Policy is, in part, intended to address these issues, and given the National Security Space Strategy has only recently been issued, we are not making recommendations regarding coordination and collaboration at this time.<br />

Links to politics – all agency action gets tied to Obama<br />

If Ronald Reagan was the classic Teflon president, Barack Obama is made of Velcro. Through two terms, Reagan eluded much of the responsibility for recession and foreign policy scandal. In less than two years, Obama has become ensnared in blame. Hoping to better insulate Obama, White House aides have sought to give other Cabinet officials a higher profile and additional public exposure. They are also crafting new ways to explain the president's policies to a skeptical public. But Obama remains the colossus of his administration — to a point where trouble anywhere in the world is often his to solve. The president is on the hook to repair the Gulf Coast oil spill disaster, stabilize Afghanistan, help fix Greece's ailing economy and do right by Shirley Sherrod, the Agriculture Department official fired as a result of a misleading fragment of videotape. What's not sticking to Obama is a legislative track record that his recent predecessors might envy. Political dividends from passage of a healthcare overhaul or a financial regulatory bill have been fleeting. Instead, voters are measuring his presidency by a more immediate yardstick: Is he creating enough jobs? So far the verdict is no, and that has taken a toll on Obama's approval ratings. Only 46% approve of Obama's job performance, compared with 47% who disapprove, according to Gallup's daily tracking poll. &quot;I think the accomplishments are very significant, but I think most people would look at this and say, 'What was the plan for jobs?' &quot; said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.). &quot;The agenda he's pushed here has been a very important agenda, but it hasn't translated into dinner table conversations.&quot; Reagan was able to glide past controversies with his popularity largely intact. He maintained his affable persona as a small-government advocate while seeming above the fray in his own administration. Reagan was untarnished by such calamities as the 1983 terrorist bombing of the Marines stationed in Beirut and scandals involving members of his administration. In the 1986 Iran-Contra affair, most of the blame fell on lieutenants. Obama lately has tried to rip off the Velcro veneer. In a revealing moment during the oil spill crisis, he reminded Americans that his powers aren't &quot;limitless.&quot; He told residents in Grand Isle, La., that he is a flesh-and-blood president, not a comic-book superhero able to dive to the bottom of the sea and plug the hole. &quot;I can't suck it up with a straw,&quot; he said. But as a candidate in 2008, he set sky-high expectations about what he could achieve and what government could accomplish. Clinching the Democratic nomination two years ago, Obama described the moment as an epic breakthrough when &quot;we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless&quot; and &quot;when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.&quot; Those towering goals remain a long way off. And most people would have preferred to see Obama focus more narrowly on the &quot;good jobs&quot; part of the promise. A recent Gallup poll showed that 53% of the population rated unemployment and the economy as the nation's most important problem. By contrast, only 7% cited healthcare — a single-minded focus of the White House for a full year. At every turn, Obama makes the argument that he has improved lives in concrete ways. Without the steps he took, he says, the economy would be in worse shape and more people would be out of work. There's evidence to support that. Two economists, Mark Zandi and Alan Blinder, reported recently that without the stimulus and other measures, gross domestic product would be about 6.5% lower. Yet, Americans aren't apt to cheer when something bad doesn't materialize. Unemployment has been rising — from 7.7% when Obama took office, to 9.5%. Last month, more than 2 million homes in the U.S. were in various stages of foreclosure — up from 1.7 million when Obama was sworn in. &quot;Folks just aren't in a mood to hand out gold stars when unemployment is hovering around 10%,&quot; said Paul Begala, a Democratic pundit. Insulating the president from bad news has proved impossible. Other White Houses have tried doing so with more success. Reagan's Cabinet officials often took the blame, shielding the boss. But the Obama administration is about one man. Obama is the White House's chief spokesman, policy pitchman, fundraiser and negotiator. No Cabinet secretary has emerged as an adequate surrogate. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is seen as a tepid public speaker; Energy Secretary Steven Chu is prone to long, wonky digressions and has rarely gone before the cameras during an oil spill crisis that he is working to end. So, more falls to Obama, reinforcing the Velcro effect: Everything sticks to him. He has opined on virtually everything in the hundreds of public statements he has made: nuclear arms treaties, basketball star LeBron James' career plans; Chelsea Clinton's wedding. Few audiences are off-limits. On Wednesday, he taped a spot on ABC's &quot;The View,&quot; drawing a rebuke from Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell, who deemed the appearance unworthy of the presidency during tough times. &quot;Stylistically he creates some of those problems,&quot; Eddie Mahe, a Republican political strategist, said in an interview. &quot;His favorite pronoun is 'I.' When you position yourself as being all things to all people, the ultimate controller and decision maker with the capacity to fix anything, you set yourself up to be blamed when it doesn't get fixed or things happen.&quot; A new White House strategy is to forgo talk of big policy changes that are easy to ridicule. Instead, aides want to market policies as more digestible pieces. So, rather than tout the healthcare package as a whole, advisors will talk about smaller parts that may be more appealing and understandable — such as barring insurers from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. But at this stage, it may be late in the game to downsize either the president or his agenda. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said: &quot;The man came in promising change. He has a higher profile than some presidents because of his youth, his race and the way he came to the White House with the message he brought in. It's naive to believe he can step back and have some Cabinet secretary be the face of the oil spill. The buck stops with his office.&quot;<br />

Unilateral presidential action threatens democracy and leads to pointless wars – Congressional oversight is necessary<br />

The long war provoked by the attacks of Sept. 11 is over. The congressional resolutions authorizing combat in Afghanistan and Iraq no longer justify military operations in either country -- or anywhere else. U.S. President Barack Obama gained office by denouncing his predecessor’s assertion of unilateral power to commit the nation to an endless war against terror. Yet, despite the absence of legislative authorization, Obama is moving down George W. Bush’s path to unilateral warfare. This is the real existential threat to American democracy. And it’s why the best way to honor the victims of 9/11 is for Americans to rededicate themselves to the Constitution, which requires the president and Congress to hammer out a new resolution defining war aims for a new decade. The legal authority for America's present military engagements collapsed in two stages. The first involved Iraq. When Congress authorized the use of force in October 2002, it refused to give the president a blank check. Once Saddam Hussein fell, the 2002 resolution only authorized U.S. troops to operate as part of a U.N.-sponsored occupation force. When the U.N. Security Council planned to terminate this authority on Jan. 1, 2009, President George W. Bush's administration devoted its final months to a new agreement with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's government to legalize continuing military operations. But this time, it cut Congress entirely out of the negotiations. Joseph Biden, then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, responded with a proposal declaring that any bilateral agreement with Iraq &quot;should involve a joint decision by the executive and legislative branches.&quot; This was not strong enough for Sen. Barack Obama, who signed onto a bill proposed by Sen. Hillary Clinton that would deny all funds to any agreement not approved by both houses. As she explained, it was &quot;outrageous that the Bush administration would seek to circumvent the U.S. Congress on a matter of such vital interest to national security.&quot; Bush simply ignored these protests and continued his end run around the Constitution. His lame-duck deal with Maliki went into effect on Jan. 1, 2009, and once they took office, Obama, Biden, and Clinton conveniently forgot their objections. They embraced the Dec. 31, 2011, pullout date established by the Bush-Maliki agreement, implicitly endorsing Bush's power grab. A similar pattern is now unfolding in the battle against al Qaeda -- but this time, Obama will be solely responsible for the decision to cut out Congress. The legal authority for the war on terror is a congressional resolution, passed immediately after the 9/11 attacks, approving the use of force against groups that &quot;planned, authorized, committed, or aided&quot; the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center. But a decade later, this resolution can no longer credibly support ongoing military operations. Al Qaeda's operatives in Pakistan are currently reeling from drone attacks that have killed a series of top commanders. Their capacity to coordinate attacks on the United States has been decimated. Official estimates place the entire Pakistan contingent at 500 or less; and the number of al Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan is fewer than 100. These undisputed facts are a tribute to America's success, but they severely undercut the legal basis of the current campaign in Afghanistan. The 2001 resolution targeted only the groups responsible for 9/11, and these are disintegrating before our eyes. While it also authorized assaults on countries and organizations that &quot;harbored&quot; the original terrorist attackers, this grant is also wearing thin. Originally, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan provided safe harbor for Osama bin Laden, but the Taliban who then dominated the government have now fragmented into a loose coalition of rebel groups, each under independent leadership. Nobody can say which, if any, of these insurgent networks are &quot;harboring&quot; the tiny number of al Qaeda members remaining in the country. One thing is plain: The scale of the U.S. military effort is utterly disproportionate to the harboring problem, if there is one. Terrorism remains a serious threat, warranting a serious strategic response. But it is no longer the Afghanistan-centered problem that Congress confronted a decade ago. If another attack hits the homeland, it will likely come from terrorists based in Somalia, Yemen, or some other failed state, acting independently of al Qaeda's increasingly disorganized &quot;central command.&quot; Yet these new groups simply aren't within the scope of Congress's decade-old authorization. Now is the time for the president to declare victory in the war against al Qaeda and return to Congress for a new resolution dealing with the new threats of the coming decade, in a world where trillion-dollar wars are an unaffordable luxury. Yet Obama seems reluctant to declare that, at long last, Americans have indeed earned the right to proclaim &quot;mission accomplished&quot; -- at least as far as this mission has been constitutionally defined by Congress on the statute books. While all presidents love to claim credit, there is something they like even more: power. As long as he pretends to be fighting yesterday's war against al Qaeda and its vaguely defined &quot;affiliates,&quot; Obama can continue to wield the war-making powers granted him by the 2001 resolution. Once he declares that this mission has been accomplished, the Constitution gives him no choice but to deal with troublemakers in Congress in hammering out new strategic principles for the real-world threats we face. But if Obama chooses to preserve his short-term freedom of action, the United States will pay a terrible long-term price. In using legal fictions to transform Congress's decade-old resolution into an open-ended authorization for unilateral war-making, he will be opening up a path for future presidents to launch major military initiatives without regard to the views of Congress or the American people. Is that what we really want?<br />

While China is rising, Europe, like the US, is stumbling. Its decline was also unexpected. It was only in 2005 that talented historian Tony Judt could write in Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 (recently reprinted in paperback) that united Europe is a new beacon and searchlight illuminating the way for the Third World. He called it a model way of regulating social and cross-border relations, a new mix of individual liberty and the welfare state. Judt proudly called the EU and its way of life &quot;a global challenge to the US&quot;. Its success was all the more captivating because it had come in the face of high obstacles and an anti-democratic spirit that was widespread in Europe in the 30s on the eve of World War II. In 2005, before the global crisis, Judt's congratulatory assessment of the reborn Europe was widely accepted. Even then, however, it seemed slightly optimistic. Today it is frayed. The prevailing financial crisis in Ireland, Portugal, Greece and elsewhere has dulled the appeal of what Judt called &quot;a role model and magnet for individuals and countries alike&quot;. NATO's action and inaction, when faced this year with the uprisings in North Africa, is viewed by many as another sign of a divided Europe.<br />

relations are resilient<br />

The idea that the transatlantic alliance has &quot;unravelled&quot; has gained popularity. The two protagonists, according to Richard Sinkin, are &quot;on very different political paths.&quot; 250 &quot;Transatlantic relations,&quot; Christina Schweiss posits, &quot;are arguably worse today than at any point since the Second World War.&quot; 251 Stanley Hoffmann agrees, suggesting that a wide [*38] range of issues, from the Kyoto Protocol to the International Criminal Court and the role of the United Nations, sign these apparently divergent paths. 252 At present, he concludes, EU-U.S. relations are in &quot;limbo,&quot; and the &quot;days of relative harmony&quot; have seemingly passed, at least for now. 253 Metaphorical recourse is common. Joseph Nye prefers to describe a bickering couple who &quot;will remain partners rather than divorce and go their separate ways.&quot; 254 Deploying the same metaphor, Ivo Daalder suggests that whilst &quot;divorce&quot; is unlikely, further &quot;drift&quot; is not. 255 Moreover, he adds pointedly, this may not be to Europe's disadvantage. 256 According to Daalder, there is a stark disparity, in terms of global politics, between the multilateralism of Europe and the unilateralism of the United States. 257<br />

JDEC fails – legal issues, withheld information, and no crisis communication.<br />
Podvig 6 [Pavel, researcher at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, Russia and the Prompt Global Strike Plan, PONARS Policy Memo No. 417, December 2006]<br />
A potential substitute to the 1988 agreement is the Joint Data Exchange Center (JDEC) arrangement, which calls for establishing a jointly operated center that would allow U.S. and Russian military operators to exchange information provided by their early warning systems almost in real time. The JDEC project, however, has serious limitations. First of all, it is not even clear if the center will become operational. In the more than eight years since the agreement was signed in 1998, neither side has expressed sufficient interest in pursuing the idea. No legal issues associated with JDEC have been resolved and the construction of the facilities required has not yet begun. Second, the arrangement is far from comprehensive, allowing, for example, the withholding of information about certain space launches. The most serious problem with a center like JDEC, however, is that it was designed to rely on real-time communication and that it provides no way to corroborate data provided during the exchange. This means that in a crisis situation a center like JDEC is more likely to add to risks than to mitigate them.<br />

NATO decline inevitable<br />
Carpenter ‘9. USA Today. Farmingdale. Vol. 138, Iss. 2774; pg. 26, A HOLLOW ALLIANCE 3 pgs [Headnote]<br />
NATO once was a serious and capable military association with an important purpose. That no longer is the case, and there is little prospect that the process of decay can be reversed. NATO CELEBRATED its 60th birthday this past April. The prevailing view that the alliance is healthy and an essential political and security player in the 2 lsl century is reinforced by the apparent attitude of the new government of die North Atlantic Treaty Organization's leading power, the U.S. The Administration of George W. Bush often seemed to prefer a unilateral approach to foreign affairs. Pres. Barack Obama's foreign policy team repeatedly has emphasized its commitment to multilateralism in general and NATO in particular which helped Obama win the Nobel Peace Prize (albeit in dubious fashion) less than a year into his presidency. Moreover, during her confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed that Washington's policy should be one of &quot;smart power,&quot; the meaning of which includes &quot;strengthening die alliances that have stood the test of time, especially wilh our NATO partners and our allies in East Asia&quot; However, the professed optimism on both sides of the Atlantic cannot conceal growing doubts about NATO's relevance to die policy challenges of the 21st century, and its ability to be an effective security mechanism. There are unmistakable signs of trouble in several areas: die weakness and vulnerability of new members and prospective new members: clumsy alliance policies that have created serious tensions with Russia: growing divisions within the burgeoning alliance over policy toward Russia: NATO's anemic performance in Afghanistan: and the alarming decline in the military capabilities of the alliance's core European members.<br />

NATO expansion causes Russian encirclement<br />
Kydd ‘01 – Professor of Political Science, University of Madison. International Organization, 55.4 pg. 802. (“Building, Trust Breaking: The Dilemma of NATO Enlargement”). LexisNexis.<br />
Critics of NATO enlargement, including many academics, are more dubious of the merits of NATO expansion. John Lewis Gaddis found a near consensus among historians that NATO expansion was &quot;ill-conceived, ill-timed, and above all ill-suited to the realities of the post-Cold War world.&quot;3 They argued that NATO expansion would antagonize Russia, exacerbating its lingering distrust of the West and strengthening anti-Western elements in the Russian political system. This would in turn lead to lower levels of cooperation between Russia and the West. Thus NATO enlargement poses an acute policy dilemma. NATO can be a benign security community that identifies more cooperative states and promotes cooperation among them and yet be perceived as an expanding alliance that Russia finds threatening. Although expanding the security community enlarges the zone of peace and mutual trust, it may generate fear among those still on the outside. This dilemma presents policymakers with a difficult choice. They can choose to expand the community and secure the benefits associated with greater cooperation among the members, paying the costs of a lower level of cooperation with the outside power. Or they can choose to forgo expansion in an effort to reassure the outside power, and suffer the consequences of greater instability among the excluded potential members.<br />

Second, the United States should make developing and fielding a terrestrial and space-based surveillance architecture a national priority. Making such an architecture a reality would support any of the possible strategies proposed in the preceding section of this paper, as space surveillance will support space being protected as a sanctuary, will be required for verification of any space treaties, and would be used to provide intelligence and targeting information should the United States ultimately elect to pursue a policy of space dominance. Making a comprehensive surveillance architecture a national priority would also focus US spending precedence on only one aspect of space control (possibly postponing and/or halting development of space-based weapons as a cost offset), thereby ensuring unity of effort toward a common goal.<br />

With the U.S. Congress pushing back on the Air Force’s proposal to start buying multiple satellites at a time using multiyear advance appropriations, a top service official reiterated the need to rein in the cost of space systems and stabilize the industrial base to prepare for the tough fiscal environment the military will face in the years ahead.<br />
The Air Force’s budget for space programs likely will come under pressure from other Defense Department priorities, which means everyone will have to learn how to do more with less, Air Force Undersecretary Erin Conaton said at an event here hosted by the Space Foundation and Center for Strategic Space Studies.<br />

&quot;The Air Force is investing in critical military space capabilities which directly support our warfighters and benefit our nation's economy, national security, international relationships, scientific discovery and our quality of life,&quot; Ms. Conaton said. Investment areas include satellite communications; advanced missile warning systems; global positioning, navigation and timing; accurate, time-sensitive weather data capabilities; and enhanced space situational awareness, she added. Regarding the Air Force's proposed space acquisition strategy, Ms. Conaton said she was confident that the Evolutionary Acquisition for Space Efficiency, or EASE, would result in better value for the taxpayer, as well as greater stability and predictability for the nation's space industrial base. The EASE strategy is comprised of four basic tenets: block buys of satellites; stable research and development investment; fixed-price contracting; and full funding through advance appropriations. In her written testimony to the subcommittee, Ms. Conaton pointed out the critical need to pursue these basic tenets along with a robust examination of contractor costs and aggressive efforts to achieve cost reductions. &quot;With Congress' support, we are confident that the combination of the major elements of EASE ... in tandem with the rigorous should cost review already under way, will help the Air Force achieve considerable savings in the acquisition of some of our most critical space assets,&quot; she said in her statement. She explained that the current practice of procuring satellites one at a time or on a just-in-time basis has led to increased costs due to production-line breaks, parts obsolescence and inefficient use of labor. The significant cost of space systems has also created challenges, such as spikes in procurement funding for one program and the subsequent lack of funding available for others in the same timeframe, she said. Ms. Conaton added that these effects have led the Air Force to delay other space programs due to the inability to fund them all during the same fiscal year, thereby forcing the service to buy other programs less efficiently. &quot;When the (industrial base gets) breaks in production lines, it drives their cost up, it wreaks havoc on their workforce and it ultimately drives the higher price to the taxpayer when we have to buy that next satellite,&quot; Ms. Conaton said. &quot;For those reasons, we ... need to undertake a new approach that allows us to avoid those funding spikes and provides greater stability to the industrial base.&quot; The EASE strategy seeks to combat this inefficiency and the disruption caused by the status quo approach to satellite procurement, she said. &quot;Block buys of satellites will allow us to purchase economic order quantities of critical parts, run production lines more efficiently and reduce non-recurring engineering costs,&quot; she said. &quot;This approach will result in savings that can be reinvested in research and development which will further improve the performance and lower the cost of follow-on systems.&quot; According to Ms. Conaton, national security space programs comprise 10 percent of the annual Air Force budget and 21 percent of Air Force investment accounts. The Air Force's space contributions represent more than 80 percent of overall Department of Defense space funding and more than 90 percent of the space positions designated under major force program-12. Based on the unique responsibilities of the Air Force Space Command, General Shelton said he established three priorities: supporting the joint fight, gaining control of space system costs and normalizing cyberspace for 21st century military operations. &quot;The FY12 budget advances the command's progress toward these priorities,&quot; General Shelton said. &quot;It modernizes GPS, the world's gold standard for positioning, navigation and timing information. It advances satellite communications to meet ever-increasing demand. It enhances overhead persistent infrared capability essential for missile warning and missile defense.&quot; The president's budget request for fiscal 2012 includes a total of $8.76 billion for research, development testing and evaluation and procurement of Air Force space programs. &quot;Department of Defense contributions to national security via our space programs are enormous,&quot; Ms. Conaton said. &quot;But the Air Force understands that to be good stewards of the space mission in the emerging budget environment, we have to make our programs more cost-effective.&quot;<br />

 Link non-unique and inevitable – X-37.<br />
<br />
Lasker 10 a freelance journalist from Ohio. He has a new book out, &quot;TECHNOIR: 13 Investigations from the Darkside of Technology&quot;. He specializes in cybewarfare and military technology, talking with Gagnon, director of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space (John Lasker, 27 May 2010 “US Space Weapon Now Circling the Globe” <span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/1980/1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/1980/1/</a></span>)<br />
<br />
The US space weapon X-37 is now circling the globe in relative secrecy. It is an unmanned space plane that looks like a smaller version of the Space Shuttle and was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on April 22, 2010. This new weapon poses threats to global peace and risks sparking an arms race in space. &quot;At one time, [the X-37] was going to replace the Space Shuttle,&quot; said Bruce Gagnon, director of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space. The replacement plan was scrapped, however. In 2004 NASA handed over the X-37 to DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and the Phantom Works at Boeing, the major aerospace player racing to develop space weapons and missile defense systems with millions of taxpayer dollars. The X-37 officially is a US Military Space Place or MSP, and like most US space weapons, spreading anxiety across the globe. The Pentagon also has an unknown number of &quot;dual purpose&quot; space planes in the works; the Pentagon has publicly stated in their budgets these prototypes have been tested in wind tunnels. They might be space bombers, but no one is completely sure. They're so secret, no one can say what they'll be used for or how far developed they are. A space vehicle that can repair, deploy and even attack satellites, or insert reconnaissance drones back into the atmosphere - all within hours of orders - is also desired. As one NASA official put it, the space plane will &quot;be the key to opening and conquering the space frontier.&quot; To those trying to keep weapons out of space, such as Gagnon and his Global Network, the orbiting X-37 is a set-back. &quot;I would say it is one of the first (space weapons) to be deployed, so yes the X-37 is now operating in space and should be defined as a space-based weapon,&quot; says Gagnon. &quot;The Pentagon though will claim it is not permanently stationed in space and thus falls outside the Outer Space Treaty - which is why we are strong advocates for a new comprehensive treaty to ban all weapons in space.&quot; The fear of an American space bomber, say experts, has one significant and severe backlash: other nations will develop their own space bombers or space weapons to counter any US MSP. &quot;There are scores of Chinese articles over the last two years that mention a U.S. space bomber,&quot; said Gregory Kulacki, Chinese specialist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, from his office in Berkeley, California. &quot;The Global Times and even television stations like Phoenix TV out of Hong Kong have a track record of hyping military technology and are unreliable, but the space bomber stories also appear in more reputable sources.&quot; Early in the Bush administration, and especially after 9/11, the Pentagon was making overtures that it desperately needed the ultimate quick-strike weapon when US forces, aircraft carriers, and even drones, are far from the target. Soon enough, the Pentagon was salivating over the prospects of acquiring a bomber that could take out a target within two hours of getting eyes-on-the-target intelligence. Katz-Hyman says the space bomber's research is driven by the Pentagon's desire to carry out this &quot;rapid global strike&quot;. Currently, long-range bomber runs using stealth bombers or B-52s take 12 to 24 hours to execute. Their effectiveness also depends whether certain nations will allow the US in their airspace. The X-37 was born from a unique, stand-alone secretive US military program (and as its name states) referred to as the &quot;X&quot; series. Pinpointing how many planes are in the X-series is a challenge many investigative tech-journalists and scientists have been trying to overcome since the beginning of the Cold War. One X-series brother of the X-37 is the X-43. Just 12-feet long, the X-43 is a scramjet or Supersonic Combustion Ramjet; its engine is designed to take oxygen from the atmosphere instead of from a huge and cumbersome liquid oxygen tank on board, like all rockets must do. In November of 2004 the X-43 broke the world record for a jet-powered aircraft by reaching Mach 9.6, or about 7,000 mph. One of the X-series most classified descendents is the spy-plane the Aurora, which unlike the X-37, is manned. Conspiracy theorists believe the &quot;black aircraft&quot; - researched under the Pentagon's black or secret budget - has been tearing through the skies since the 1970s. The Pentagon let it slip the classified Aurora existed when in 1985 the name &quot;Aurora&quot; appeared, accidentally, below a budget request for the SR-71 Blackbird and the U2. Experts claim that billions have been spent on the Aurora, an aircraft that theorists stress must be hypersonic (fly between Mach 5 to Mach 20) due to all the secrecy. Speculation says the Aurora's speed could be one-mile per second, or just over Mach 5 (3,600 mph roughly), giving an armed Aurora the ability to reach a target potentially within minutes. Theorists say the prime contractor must be Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works (now the Lockheed Advanced Development Company), one of the US military's most secretive civilian-run research efforts. As for Aurora witnesses, they are few and far between. In 1989, while working out on the North Sea, engineer Chris Gibson said he saw a strange triangular-shaped craft accompanied by a pair of F-111 bombers. Indeed, a similar craft has been glimpsed several times streaking over the North Pole. Satellite imagery has also captured a single, high-altitude contrail stretching from Area 51 to deep into the Atlantic. Like the X-37 and the Aurora, the Obama administration's future plans for exotic space weapons are cloaked in secrecy. Gagnon says President Obama is perceived as a typical Harry Houdini-like president. &quot;I call Obama the magician, you have to watch both his hands to understand what he is doing,&quot; he said. &quot;On the one hand he talks nice, says good things at times, but he is proving to be the classic politician who says one thing and does another. Obama is clearly comfortable carrying water for the weapons industry which is probably why the military industrial complex gave him more campaign donations than they gave john McCain. Obama is doing virtually nothing to reverse the militarization, weaponization, and nuclearization of space.&quot;<br />

Investing in space surveillance tradesoff with space weapons procurement<br />

Second, the United States should make developing and fielding a terrestrial and space-based surveillance architecture a national priority. Making such an architecture a reality would support any of the possible strategies proposed in the preceding section of this paper, as space surveillance will support space being protected as a sanctuary, will be required for verification of any space treaties, and would be used to provide intelligence and targeting information should the United States ultimately elect to pursue a policy of space dominance. Making a comprehensive surveillance architecture a national priority would also focus US spending precedence on only one aspect of space control (possibly postponing and/or halting development of space-based weapons as a cost offset), thereby ensuring unity of effort toward a common goal.<br />

<strong>Alt cause commercial innovations</strong><br />

<br />
The lessons of history show that absent any restrictions, where social and economic productivity develops, military innovation will not be far behind. The military has always been highly sensitive to changes in the level of social productivity. In fact, the expansion of battlefield and the development of new weaponry have been almost in direct sync with economic and technological development. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that the development of human productivity will ineluctably bring war from land, sea and air into outer space if no constraints are placed on it. One of the key reasons for this is the inherently neutral quality of innovation and technology. Virtually, any advancement in human productivity can be used for peaceful or non-peaceful purposes. The development of atomic energy is a telling example of the organic dual-use nature of technology. Nuclear reactors have not only provided mankind with a new energy source, but have also led to the production of highly destructive weapons. World powers eventually negotiated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but only after nuclear proliferation became a reality. Like nuclear power, mature space technologies also have an inherent dual-use application. Admitting only to the civilian use of space and not its military function would be to deny reality. Likewise, making the same mistake in controlling the use of space will prove both costly and disastrous. The advance of modern human productivity and progress in technology have profoundly transformed the battlefield, weaponry and combatants, all of which are interdependent and often mutually reinforcing. The expansion of the battlefield constitutes an intangible developmental force and can give rise to new weapons. New weapons in turn can also enlarge the battlefield or create a new spatial dimension for warfare. Both affect the way in which the combatants operate. The relationship between them is reflected in the fact that the emergence of every new weapon is the result of a need on the battlefield at the time. When a new weapon appears, the space occupied by the old naturally gives way to the new. When man fought with his bare hands, the battlefield was limited. The advent of gunpowder and firearms created an entirely new reality for warfare, vastly extending the size of the battlefield and virtually eliminating the need for hand-to-hand fighting. Today, combatants have also radically changed from the uniformed rank and file of soldiers to civilians. During the attack on the United States of Sept. 11, 2001, the terrorists responsible were not soldiers in uniform but common civilians. Their weapons of choice were neither fighter jet planes nor tanks, but civilian passenger planes. Such transformation of the battlefield and those fighting on it is unprecedented. The nature of war is undergoing profound and systematic changes. We must redefine the true meaning of security, war, military buildup and modes of battle. Traditional experience no longer applies. In utilizing modern weapons soldiers can achieve maximum damage with relatively little effort. One such modern battlefield that has emerged in recent years is cyberspace. In this environment, information war can begin on one side of the world and strike a target on the other. It can destroy banking systems or paralyze the traffic control system of the target country. It has also given rise to ‘digital troops’ and intangible electromagnetic space and information weapons. While the battlefield may be virtual in nature, its power can nevertheless be equally destructive to dropping an atomic bomb over a city. As battleships brought war to the seas, and airplanes brought war to the sky, mankind’s efforts to conquer outer space has brought warfare there too. Furthermore, it is in the environment of space where the most drastic transformation of the battlefield and weaponry is taking place. Currently, developed countries have made information and space technology the platform and primary means of competition. The widespread application of military satellites, space vehicles and other armaments has appropriated the tranquility of space. Though people have not yet fully envisioned all the new weapons that can be brought about by the integration of information and space technology, we have nevertheless seen the beginning of such trends. In 2000, Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, commander of the U.S. North American Aerospace Defense Command, noted that outer space is increasingly indispensable to ground, sea and air combat. Thus, the United States must focus its attention on space dominance. On Jan. 11, 2001, the U.S. Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization (Space Commission) recognized the need to prevent a “space Pearl Harbor” against the United States. It noted that like land, sea and air, the “mission” of outer space will, without exception, become a venue for military competition and the United States should make early preparations for this eventuality. In fact, when the United Teng Jianqun ~71~ States began its pursuit of space technology over a half century ago, American leaders, including John F. Kennedy, had already begun to understand the military significance of outer space. They realized that whoever controlled outer space would also control the Earth. Today, the advancement of social productivity and technology brings man into outer space, and along with it, military influence will spread to every facet of space development. If the international community allows this trend to continue, the weaponization of outer space will become a reality.<br />

The X-37 was born from a unique, stand-alone secretive US military program (and as its name states) referred to as the &quot;X&quot; series. Pinpointing how many planes are in the X-series is a challenge many investigative tech-journalists and scientists have been trying to overcome since the beginning of the Cold War. One X-series brother of the X-37 is the X-43. Just 12-feet long, the X-43 is a scramjet or Supersonic Combustion Ramjet; its engine is designed to take oxygen from the atmosphere instead of from a huge and cumbersome liquid oxygen tank on board, like all rockets must do. In November of 2004 the X-43 broke the world record for a jet-powered aircraft by reaching Mach 9.6, or about 7,000 mph. One of the X-series most classified descendents is the spy-plane the Aurora, which unlike the X-37, is manned. Conspiracy theorists believe the &quot;black aircraft&quot; - researched under the Pentagon's black or secret budget - has been tearing through the skies since the 1970s. The Pentagon let it slip the classified Aurora existed when in 1985 the name &quot;Aurora&quot; appeared, accidentally, below a budget request for the SR-71 Blackbird and the U2. Experts claim that billions have been spent on the Aurora, an aircraft that theorists stress must be hypersonic (fly between Mach 5 to Mach 20) due to all the secrecy. Speculation says the Aurora's speed could be one-mile per second, or just over Mach 5 (3,600 mph roughly), giving an armed Aurora the ability to reach a target potentially within minutes. Theorists say the prime contractor must be Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works (now the Lockheed Advanced Development Company), one of the US military's most secretive civilian-run research efforts. As for Aurora witnesses, they are few and far between. In 1989, while working out on the North Sea, engineer Chris Gibson said he saw a strange triangular-shaped craft accompanied by a pair of F-111 bombers. Indeed, a similar craft has been glimpsed several times streaking over the North Pole. Satellite imagery has also captured a single, high-altitude contrail stretching from Area 51 to deep into the Atlantic. Like the X-37 and the Aurora, the Obama administration's future plans for exotic space weapons are cloaked in secrecy. Gagnon says President Obama is perceived as a typical Harry Houdini-like president. &quot;I call Obama the magician, you have to watch both his hands to understand what he is doing,&quot; he said. &quot;On the one hand he talks nice, says good things at times, but he is proving to be the classic politician who says one thing and does another. Obama is clearly comfortable carrying water for the weapons industry which is probably why the military industrial complex gave him more campaign donations than they gave john McCain. Obama is doing virtually nothing to reverse the militarization, weaponization, and nuclearization of space.&quot;<br />
No link – legitimacy not based on space and not zero sum<br />
Kulacki and Lewis, ’09 [Gregory Kulacki and Jeffrey G. Lewis, 2009 , “A Place for One’s Mat: China’s Space Program, 1956–2003”, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3803:http://carnegie.org/fileadmin/Media/Publications/PDF/spaceChina.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://carnegie.org/fileadmin/Media/Publications/PDF/spaceChina.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://carnegie.org/fileadmin/Media/Publications/PDF/spaceChina.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3803 -->]<br />
<br />
All peoples have their own myths. Within the Chinese historical sources, the narrative that the Chinese themselves use to explain their own actions is yi xi zhi di—“a place for one’s mat.”The founding myth of modern China is that the Chinese people lost that place when they fell behind the West. The imagined cause of this loss is China’s failure to embrace science and develop technology. Contemporary Chinese leaders are invested in space, human spaceflight in particular, because it is the ultimate expression of what being a scientifically and technologically advanced nation means.Having a space program proves to others and, more importantly, to themselves that the Chinese deserve a seat at the table.<br />
This conception is not one of a zero-sum competition. During the cold war, the dominant metaphor for competition was a “race.”Only one winner could emerge—the first to put a satellite in orbit, the first to put a man in orbit, the first to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth.By contrast, the Chinese metaphor carries the connotation of joining a club, becoming a member. This is subtly different from other explanations. For example, one common explanation is that the Chinese space program provides a unifying sense of national prestige and boosts the legitimacy of the Communist Party. 51 The space program may make many Chinese proud and, as a result, modestly boost the standing of the government (though we doubt it). China’s leaders are not shy about photo opportunities. But a central leadership that based its survival strategy on the space program would be foolish. Human spaceflight is a high-risk activity. Whatever one thinks of the policies of the Chinese government, its leaders are risk-averse and manifestly not foolish.<br />

Second, the United States should make developing and fielding a terrestrial and space-based surveillance architecture a national priority. Making such an architecture a reality would support any of the possible strategies proposed in the preceding section of this paper, as space surveillance will support space being protected as a sanctuary, will be required for verification of any space treaties, and would be used to provide intelligence and targeting information should the United States ultimately elect to pursue a policy of space dominance. Making a comprehensive surveillance architecture a national priority would also focus US spending precedence on only one aspect of space control (possibly postponing and/or halting development of space-based weapons as a cost offset), thereby ensuring unity of effort toward a common goal.<br />

Yet what if the CCP is actually quite responsive? What if it is in tune with popular demands, and finds ways to move and adapt as those demands change? In other words, what if the party stays or goes because of [End Page 173] popular pressures? Pei himself recognizes this possibility. He cites &quot;rising public dissatisfaction&quot; (p.14) as one thing that would prod the regime to change. &quot;A democratic opening may emerge in the end, but not as a regime-initiated strategy undertaken at its own choosing, but more likely as the result of a sudden crisis&quot; (p. 44). Perhaps the word crisis is being used in two different senses here. One crisis and another can, after all, vary in urgency: There are crises and there are crises. The crisis of which Pei speaks seems to be of the more benign sort, a mere shift in public preferences that prods the regime to change. Such a crisis will not require democracy to rise upon the ashes of a razed public square, but rather will stir the regime to recognize that its time has come, and to do the right thing by going fairly gentle into that good night. If so, then the prospects for a relatively smooth democratic transition in China are bright and no collapse is likely.<br />

Transparency stops Japan China war<br />
Edward Friedman, 2000. Hawkins Chair Professor of Political Science at University of Wisconsin. “What if China Doesn’t Democratize? Implications for War and Peace,” p. 99-105.<br />
If China does not democratize, Beijing's hostility to Tokyo could facilitate a war in the twenty-first century. In the section on &quot;Sino-Japanese Relations&quot; in his 1997 study of Asia 's Deadly Triangle, Kent Calder, a senior adviser to the U.S. State Department for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, foresees arms races, tensions, and flashpoints for war.2 The dynamics of these dangerous forces lie deep inside China's authoritarian nationalism. Even during the May 1999 Chinese riots sparked by the murderous NATO bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade, many angry Chinese still focused on Japan. Web postings included, &quot;The Americans are the enemy of the Chinese Communist Party. The Japanese are the enemy of the Chinese people. Which is more dangerous?&quot; &quot;Let me predict that in thirty years the U.S. embassy in Japan will be attacked by ten Chinese guided missiles.&quot; &quot;China should take care of Japan first.&quot; &quot;Right! China should take care of the Japanese devils first. It should start with a boycott of Japanese goods!&quot; &quot;Some say don't forget June 4 [the crushing of the 1989 democracy movement]. If you can't remember September 18 [1931 Japanese invasion], then you are not a true Chinese.&quot; &quot;Where will the Chinese people find their living space in the future? In the ocean! We need to move toward the east, toward the east, toward the east!&quot; Except for the era from 1972 to 1982, a special moment when Mao Zedong's policy line of allying with any nation possible against a threatening Soviet Union dominated Chinese politics, making for a momentary Tokyo-Beijing entente, Japan has been treated by the People's Republic of China as a real or potential enemy. In the original Valentine's Day 1950 military treaty with Stalin, Mao took as China's adversary &quot;aggression on the part of Japan or any other state that may collaborate in any way with Japan.&quot; 3 As Moscow worried after World War II about German revanchism, so Beijing naturally worried about Japanese revanchism. There should be no doubt that what the two Axis powers did to people they conquered was evil, absolute evil. China's foreign minister, however, declared on August 15, 1951, &quot;The United States Government and the Yoshida government are conspiring to rearm Japan, to enslave the Japanese people, and to drive Japan once again onto the path of aggression.&quot; 4 Leninist ideology had imperialism as expansionist and impoverishing. But obviously China's first getting it wrong and then later abandoning Leninism have changed little in Beijing's attitude toward Tokyo. Throughout, China views Japan as tomorrow's military threat. Entering the twenty-first century, even cosmopolitan Chinese intellectuals tend to see Japan as dynamized by right-wing super patriots, as a government and people which are unrepentant for World War II atrocities in China. Chinese patriotism is dangerously out of touch with core Japanese political realities. When Kishi Nobuske became Japan's prime minister, China's foreign minister in 1958 denounced the U.S.-Japan security treaty, claiming, &quot;Under the name of `mutual defense,' the United States could despatch Japanese troops to China's Taiwan and to any place in the West Pacific.&quot; 5 Obviously the charges were untrue. No such thing, or anything close, ever occurred. But China kept drumming up fear of and hate toward Japan. That deadly anger pervades Chinese society. On December 7, 1958 the New China News Agency announced that Japan's arms expansion plans took &quot;nuclear armament as the core&quot; and made Japan the &quot;arsenal for Southeast Asia.&quot; 6 Actually, there were no such plans. Nonetheless, the security treaty that Prime Minister Kishi renegotiated in 1960 was again erroneously denounced by China in 1960: &quot;This treaty not only provides for Japan's unlimited arms expansion and accelerated nuclear armament but also its dispatch of troops to foreign lands.&quot; 7 Obviously, this is a lie. Ruling groups in China, for the first twenty years of the People's Republic, continually revved up indignation toward an alleged revival of Japanese militarism, not informing the Chinese people about the actual attitudes of Japan's people in Japan's antiwar constitutional democracy in opposing nuclear weapons or resisting military involvement in the Cold War. Beijing has successfully kept burning and fomenting in China hate for Japan. A 1984 book noted that, &quot;The political relationship between Beijing and Tokyo reached an all-time low during 1969 and 1970 when the Chinese assailed the revival of Japanese militarism.&quot;8 Just prior to a brief and transient 1972—82 era of good relations, Beijing again launched massive campaigns against Japan, claiming that the result of President Nixon's Guam doctrine of no longer having America fighting ground wars on the continent of Asia would be that Japan would replace America in Asia, that is, Japan would go nuclear and have its military take over for the American military in Southeast Asia. Early in 1972, when Nixon and Kissinger discussed removing the American military from Taiwan, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai asked, &quot;Can the U.S. control the `wild horse' of Japan?&quot; 9 China was especially worried that the United States, while withdrawing its own troops from Taiwan, might encourage its Japanese allies to station their forces on the island.&quot; Hanoi leader Pham Van Dong told Mao in November 1968 that Vietnamese &quot;were very much afraid that Japan would ... participate in the Vietnam war.&quot; 10 During a visit to North Korea in spring 1970, &quot;Zhou [Enlai] argued vigorously that 'Japanese militarism has revived and has become a dangerous force of aggression in Asia.' &quot;&quot; Vietnam's Communist Party Chief Le Duan agreed with Zhou in 1971 that &quot;Japan has a plan for Southeast Asia. It wants to control the region.&quot; 12 As Benito Lim put it in September 1996 in Beijing at the Twenty- First Century Forum, &quot;China may become a superpower ... with a proud 5,000 year history. China currently is already more than a nation; it is a civilization, a cultural force that has influenced her neighbors throughout history. . . . It can shape regional politics.&quot;22 That shaping influence includes the use of force. A former top U.S. official, Charles W. Freeman Jr., after talking with leaders in Beijing, reported that &quot;China's leaders have always said they would go to war to prevent the permanent division of China. They now believe that they are likely to have to do so. China's armed forces have begun a decade-long effort to acquire the capabilities and do the planning required to have a serious chance of overwhelming Taiwan's formidable defenses.&quot; 23 Aware of China's vision of its future and its willingness to use force, former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told the U.S.-Japan Society in Seattle on March 12, 1996 24 that &quot;the most serious issues Japan may confront in the future may well be those related to China.&quot; In China, &quot;nationalistic impulses haven't been entirely fulfilled.... Neighboring countries are aware of a `big China' and must inevitably have strong concerns.&quot; Indeed, &quot;the other newly industrializing countries of Asia along with Japan would not feel comfortable being influenced heavily by China. This is why a continued American presence in the Pacific is necessary.&quot; Most directly worrisome as a cause of war, the Japanese prime minister found, were China's military actions aimed against Taiwan. &quot;The issue of Taiwan for Japan is similar to that of Calais in relations between France and England, or Gibraltar during the Napoleonic wars, or the issue of Iceland or the Azores during World War II. . . . For maritime nations, they are vital lifelines of support.&quot; Actually, the problem has been intensified by post-Mao reform. As Soviet Russian reformer Khrushchev's government was legitimated by the Great Patriotic War against Nazi Germany and made opposition to purported military revanchism in an actually democratic and antiwar Germany central to Moscow's expansionism in East Europe, 25 so unfounded concerns about and against a democratic Japan inflame nationalist passions and war potential even for reformers in post-Mao China 26 The Chinese people continually remind themselves of their suffering at the hands of Japanese aggressors, supposedly from 1874-1945, that is, the entire modern era, and swear that it shall never be allowed to happen again, interpreting virtually every Japanese gesture as if Japanese militarism might soon be on the march all over Asia. Japan is treated as inherently evil. Actions premised on such worst case readings readily create security dilemmas because defensive efforts by Tokyo are taken in Beijing to be threats that must be met in a tit-for-tat way. A vicious spiral has been unleashed. Consequently, peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region in the twenty-first century require a major change in Beijing-Tokyo relations, a move toward genuine reconciliation. This large change may be impossible unless China democratizes. Analogous transitions which illuminate what is at stake include initial efforts at democratization in Russia allowing, at least momentarily, an end to Cold War tensions, and, more clearly, post World War II German-French reconciliation after Germany democratized. Prior to Germany's democratization, from Napoleon's invasion of Germany to Hitler's invasion of France, France and Germany were regularly at war with each other. Mistrust, hate, and desires for vengeance suffused the relationship. Only the trust, transparency, and cooperation facilitated by democratization could, over time, reduce the hates and angers that provided the tinder that could be ignited into war by unfortunate incidents and domestically needed maneuvers. So I believe it is with China and Japan. Democratization, and getting past the passions of early democratization, are required for genuine China-Japan reconciliation. As French and Poles both decided to treat the post-Nazi German democracy as not responsible for Nazi crimes, so Chinese will have to change their view of democratic Japan if peace is to prevail.<br />

Montalbano, 11 (Elizabeth, “NASA Plans Future Missions As Shuttle Era Ends”, Senior writer for IDG News Service, July 21st, 2011, Access Date_7/22/11).<br />
Now that NASA's space shuttle program has ended with the safe return of Atlantis to earth, the agency is looking ahead to future space projects, including a study of the atmosphere of Mars and a project to map the moon's gravity field.<br />
Atlantis landed Thursday at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, ending 30 years of space exploration through shuttle craft, the first of which—Challenger--was launched in 1983. While the event certainly marks the end of an era, it's hardly the swan song for NASA's exploration into space, as the agency has multiple missions in the works.<br />

The Democrats' leading environmental messenger, Al Gore, is declaring that President Barack Obama has failed to lead on the issue of global warming. In a 7,000-word essay posted online Wednesday by Rolling Stone magazine, Gore says the president hasn't stood up for &quot;bold action&quot; on the problem and has done little to move the country forward since he replaced Republican President George W. Bush. Bush infuriated environmentalists by resisting mandatory controls on the pollution blamed for climate change, despite overwhelming scientific evidence that the burning of fossil fuels is responsible. The scientific case has only gotten stronger since, Gore argues, but Obama has not used it to force significant change. &quot;Obama has never presented to the American people the magnitude of the climate crisis,&quot; Gore says. &quot;He has not defended the science against the ongoing withering and dishonest attacks. Nor has he provided a presidential venue for the scientific community ... to bring the reality of the science before the public.&quot; Gore does credit Obama's political appointees with making hundreds of changes that have helped move the country &quot;forward slightly&quot; on the climate issue, but says the president &quot;has simply not made the case for action.&quot; He is the second Clinton administration official this month to express disappointment with Obama on environmental issues. Former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in a speech in early June, said Obama had yet to take up the &quot;mantle of land and water conservation...in a significant way.&quot; Gore's comments mark a turnaround for the nation's most prominent global warming advocate, whose work on the climate problem has earned him a Nobel Prize and was adapted into an Oscar-winning documentary.<br />

NPR, 7 (5/30/2007, Donald J. Dodds M.S. P.E., President of the North Pacific Research, “The Myth of Biodiversity,” northpacificresearch.com/downloads/The_myth_of_biodiversity.doc CS)<br />
<br />
Biodiversity is a corner stone of the environmental movement. But there is no proof that biodiversity is important to the environment. Something without basis in scientific fact is called a Myth. Lets examine biodiversity through out the history of the earth. The earth has been a around for about 4 billion years. Life did not develop until about 500 million years later. Thus for the first 500 million years bio diversity was zero. The planet somehow survived this lack of biodiversity. For the next 3 billion years, the only life on the planet was microbial and not diverse. Thus, the first unexplainable fact is that the earth existed for 3.5 billion years, 87.5% of its existence, without biodiversity. Somewhere around 500 million years ago life began to diversify and multiple celled species appeared. Because these species were partially composed of sold material they left better geologic records, and the number of species and genera could be cataloged and counted. The number of genera on the planet is a indication of the biodiversity of the planet. Figure 1 is a plot of the number of genera on the planet over the last 550 million years. The little black line outside of the left edge of the graph is 10 million years. Notice the left end of this graph. Biodiversity has never been higher than it is today.<br />

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Given the go-ahead at last, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center begins racing today to build &quot;the most powerful rocket ever&quot; to carry American astronauts back into deep space. &quot;That may sound like a long way out,&quot; Marshall Director Robert Lightfoot said Wednesday of his 2017 deadline for the first unmanned test flight, &quot;but we've got a lot to do.&quot; What isn't clear is whether Lightfoot will need many - or any - of the approximately 1,500 contractor workers laid off in Huntsville in the last year. Those workers lost their jobs as NASA ended the space shuttle and Constellation rocket programs. Congressional leaders said Monday they expect new hiring soon to protect NASA's &quot;national asset&quot; - its work force. &quot;You will see that work force start to scale up,&quot; said U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida. However, Lightfoot said, &quot;I'm not looking to grow the center.&quot; Instead, he hopes to &quot;stabilize&quot; his Huntsville work force and prevent further losses. Lightfoot spoke from Washington where he was attending meetings on the plan announced Wednesday morning by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden Jr. and congressional leaders. Lightfoot's Huntsville center will lead development of the new rocket's boosters. The program to develop the new rocket, including launch facility improvements at Kennedy Space Center and a new crew capsule, will cost $3 billion a year through 2017, NASA said. Going beyond the initial test rockets to regular missions could push the total project cost to $35 billion or more in the coming decade, according to some estimates published Wednesday, and that raised the prospect of more funding fights in the future. Bolden also left the rocket's first destination unclear Wednesday, mentioning possible flights to asteroids and Mars. Bolden's announcement was a surprise to many in Washington and the aerospace press. Bogged down all year by detailed budget reviews, the new rocket gained White House approval only in the last week, senators said. Still, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said all of the parties in the decision - Congress, NASA and the White House - &quot;are going forward as one with one goal.&quot; &quot;We are not going to be the also-rans,&quot; Hutchison said of the American space program. &quot;We are going to be the leaders.&quot; Hutchison said key members of both parties, including Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, &quot;have bought in 100 percent.&quot; Mikulski chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees NASA. Funding for the new rocket cleared its first hurdle later Wednesday when Mikulski's panel approved $1.8 billion for the work in 2012. Mikulski said the bill allocates $17.9 billion for NASA, which is the same amount as in 2009, and a reduction of $509 million from the 2011 budget. &quot;NASA will be asked to do more with less,&quot; Mikulski said. Lightfoot described the new rocket as a &quot;good mix&quot; of technology from the space shuttle and the Ares I rocket NASA canceled last year. It will be developed in two phases: first with a smaller version capable of lifting 70 metric tons into space, and then a larger version capable of lifting 130 metric tons. By comparison, NASA said the small rocket will have 10 percent more power at liftoff than the Saturn V rockets that took Americans to the moon in 1969. The larger rocket will be 20 percent more powerful and stand 40 feet taller on the launchpad than the Saturn. The new rocket's core segment will be 8.4 meters in diameter, the same size as the space shuttle's external tank, meaning NASA can save money by using existing manufacturing, transport and launch-related equipment. It will be expendable, however. NASA will not recover any of its parts after launch. The rocket will be powered initially by three space shuttle main engines fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. NASA has 15 of those rockets already stockpiled, Lightfoot said. For the first few flights, it will also depend on five-segment solid rocket boosters similar to those used by the shuttle. NASA will eventually go out for bids on a new booster system depending on the rocket's ultimate performance requirements. Fueling the upper stage will be a variation of the engine already developed for the Ares rocket. That engine was recently test-fired at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. Using &quot;heritage&quot; equipment not only saves money, it lowers the flight risk, Lightfoot said, because the main engines and boosters as they now exist are proven in flight. Rocket team leaders plan to present a &quot;procurement synopsis&quot; to NASA management Monday detailing how they will release work solicitations. Those will be made public Friday. On Sept. 29, NASA plans what it calls an &quot;industry day.&quot; There, it will detail the plan, ask for industry input and give contractors a clear picture of what NASA will put out for bid and when.<br />

In our attempts to envision ETI science and technology we must be wary of slipping from science to science ﬁction.

Several theorems and equations even exist to search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The most famous is known as the Drake Equation, which attempts to calculate the possibility of the existence of intelligent life. Even if the origin of life is an incredibly rare event (we’re talking winning-the-California-SuperLotto-two-times-in-a-row rare), due to the universe’s extraordinary vastness, each of these equations points to tens of thousands of planets that should have life. Say the origin of life is an unlikely event, something in the order of one in 1,000,000,000,000. Ridiculously unlikely, but not impossible. There are about 100,000,000,000 galaxies in the universe. There’s also about 100,000,000,000 stars in each galaxy. Now, estimates for the number of planets in a galaxy vary, but we’ll be absurdly conservative (in order to prove the point) and say the chances of a planet around a star is only one in 1,000,000. Doing the math, you get an interesting result. Even with our highly conservative estimates, we predict that life should have formed on 10,000 planets in the universe. Whoa. Sure, these ideas are at the very fringe of science, but they present legitimate research rather than the flimsy evidence of “I was abducted by aliens” or “We all saw a UFO and the government is covering it up” stories that UFOlogists generally present in favor of their position. The problem with most evidence for aliens and UFOs is that it is completely reliant upon massive media and governmental conspiracies and anecdotal evidence without a smidgen of physical or testable evidence. Granted, it would be great if an advanced civilization came to Earth, but why should descriptions of beings that mastered intergalactic travels seem so reminiscent of the latest sci-fi blockbuster? Maybe it’s part of the conspiracy. Ultimately, it’s the same vastness of space that almost guarantees the existence of life on other worlds that precludes the possibility of human beings ever coming in contact with an alien race. The closest star to our solar system is Alpha Centauri, about four light years away. That doesn’t sound too bad until you realize that’s about 24 trillion miles away. Traveling at a million miles an hour, the trip to Alpha Centauri would take more than 2,500 years. And that’s just one star out of the one million billion billion that inhabit the universe.<br />

Inevitable – China<br />

China plans to launch a space station into orbit by 2020, China Daily reports. The station will be made of three capsules — a core module and two modules for conducting experiments, with total weight of the station being 60 tons. China also plans to develop a cargo spaceship that will transport supplies to the station. At 60 tons, China’s space station will be small compared to the International Space Station, which weighs 419 tons and is the only space station in orbit. Russian Space Station Mir, which was deorbited in 2001, weighed 137 tons. However, Pang Zhihao, a researcher and deputy editor-in-chief of the monthly magazine, Space International, said, “It’s only the world’s third multi-module space station, which usually demands much more complicated technology than a single-module space lab.”<br />

500,000 pieces of debris now – only SSA can solve<br />
Korea Times 10 (“Satellite launched to track space junk”)<br />
There are about 500,000 known pieces of space junk orbiting around our planet. Of those, about 21,000 objects are larger than 4 inches (10.1 centimeters) in diameter, and are being tracked by the Department of Defense, as part of the Space Surveillance Network. These are items like spent rocket stages and broken satellites. The U.S. Air Force lit up the night sky above California Saturday with the launch of a new satellite sentinel to keep tabs on other spacecraft and the growing problem of space junk around Earth. The Space-Based Space Surveillance satellite will monitor the orbital environment as part of the U.S. military's evolving Space Surveillance Network. Air Force officials said the rocket reached its intended orbit and deployed the SBSS spacecraft as planned. &quot;This satellite is going to revolutionize the way we track objects in space by not being constrained by weather, the atmosphere or the time of day,&quot; Col. J.R. Jordan, vice-commander of the Space Superiority Systems Wing at the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, said during a prelaunch briefing. &quot;This capability will be essential to our space situational awareness architecture for the near future and beyond.&quot; The satellite is essential to keep U.S. space assets safer and more secure, as well as &quot;keeping America at the forefront of space,&quot; Jordan added. The overall cost of the SBSS program is about $858 million, Air Force officials have said.<br />

Washington, D.C. - infoZine - American Forces Press Service - U.S. Marine Gen. James E. Cartwright, speaking on the national security ramifications of the collision between an American and a Russian satellite, said the event shows the need for better information sharing and space situational awareness. The American satellite, owned by Iridium Satellite of Bethesda, Md., weighed about 1,200 pounds and collided with a Russian satellite that had been nonoperational for more than a decade. The crash happened 491 miles above Siberia. The collision was confirmed when the active U.S. satellite did not report in and the debris field was picked up by sensors. &quot;My worry is that debris field is going to be up there for about a year, so we're going to have to play a little bit of dodgeball,&quot; Cartwright said. &quot;It's going to be a problem because it will take a month or two for the debris to settle down and for us to understand the scope of the field to be able to track it and understand where at least the larger objects are.&quot; The debris will be around for some time because the satellites were in a high orbit around the earth, Cartwright said. Once the debris field has stabilized, there will be a pattern that all countries can use to navigate around, he said. &quot;It's a field of debris out there that's going to be out there for many years,&quot; he said. &quot;The good news is once it's stabilized, it's relatively predictable. The bad news is, it's a large area. If we're denied that large area for use, it becomes a problem.&quot; Many of the commercial and national security satellites, particularly communications satellites, rely on certain spacing between other objects in order to be effective, Cartwright said. Losing a spot because of debris could have a financial or operational impact on anyone wanting to use the space, he said. &quot;If that's going to be long term, that's a problem for us,&quot; he said. The general said he hopes the incident will result in a better exchange of satellite orbit data between countries. &quot;I'd like to be able to find a way, not only with Russia, but with other nations to make sure that our exchange of data is more complete,&quot; he said. &quot;We would be remiss to not take advantage of this and turn it into good.&quot; The growing number of satellites require improved information sharing, Cartwright said. &quot;It is a crowded place out there today,&quot; he said. &quot;There is just no way around that. The need, first and foremost, for better situational awareness out there is something you have to actively pursue.&quot; The need for space situational awareness has changed drastically in recent years, the general said. &quot;It was acceptable five years ago to know something was out there and check on it every couple weeks,&quot; he said. &quot;Those days are just not tolerable anymore.&quot; Whereas countries previously could wait a few days or weeks to get satellites stabilized in their orbits, the current congestion in space pushes that timeframe down to seconds and minutes, he said.<br />

The “cascade effect” is “the greatest fear of those who study the problem of orbital debris.”50 Even before the February 2009 satellite collision, many scientists agreed “that the number of objects in orbit had surpassed a critical mass,”51 the point at which “orbital debris would collide with other space objects, which in turn would create new debris that would cause [a chain reaction of] even more collisions.”52 This “chain reaction” is often referred to as the cascade effect.53<br />

Third party plays an unpredictable spoiler<br />
McManus 10-27 [Doyle, writer for the LA Times, “McManus: The third-party wild card” <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3810:http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-mcmanus-column-third-party-americans-elect-20111027,0,4671890.column --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-mcmanus-column-third-party-americans-elect-20111027,0,4671890.column" rel="nofollow">http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-mcmanus-column-third-party-americans-elect-20111027,0,4671890.column</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3810 -->]<br />
Until now, handicapping for next year's presidential election has focused on how President Obama might fare in a two-candidate race. Could Obama beat Mitt Romney? Rick Perry? Herman Cain? (In all three cases, the answer is probably yes.) But there's likely to also be a wild card in this election. Americans Elect, a well-funded &quot;virtual third party,&quot; plans to put a centrist presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states, and while he or she is unlikely to win the presidential election, the presence of a third candidate could still have a major impact on the outcome. Americans Elect is a collection of Republicans, Democrats and independents who say they're fed up with the polarization that has poisoned American politics. Some of its backers have previously contributed to Obama, Romney or other candidates. Several are fans of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has flirted with the idea of running as a third-party centrist. The group's central figure is Peter Ackerman, a wealthy investor and former banker who considers himself an independent and who was active four years ago in a similar effort called Unity08. The group plans to hold a national primary election on the Internet — a mass-participation exercise that anyone can join. Candidates can nominate themselves, and voters can form committees to &quot;draft&quot; candidates, including politicians drawn from the major parties — Hillary Rodham Clinton, for example, or Jon Huntsman. Candidates who don't want to be drafted can take their names off the ballot, but only after several rounds of voting — so a Clinton boomlet could happen even if the secretary of State says she's not playing. Meanwhile, the group is collecting signatures to put itself on every state's ballot; it says it has collected 1.6 million signatures in California, which should enable it to qualify. Who will its candidate be? Bloomberg is frequently mentioned, even though he says he doesn't plan to run. So is Huntsman, even though he says he's only interested in the Republican nomination. It might be former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer, who has been trying to break into the Republican race; former Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), who retired after denouncing both parties; or independent business figures such as Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who has called on his fellow moguls to stop giving money to politicians. Americans Elect says it plans to choose a presidential nominee (and a vice presidential candidate, who by the group's rules can't come from the same party) by June. What happens then depends mostly on the shape of the contest between the Democratic and Republican candidates. A candidate like Bayh might draw disaffected moderate and independent voters away from President Obama, making it easier for a Republican like Romney to win. Or a candidate like Bloomberg could attract moderate Republicans if the GOP nominee is seen as too extreme a conservative, a scenario that would benefit Obama. Both Democrats and Republicans in Americans Elect insist that there's no conspiracy here. They don't have a preferred candidate, they say, and they're not launching this effort with a &quot;spoiler&quot; outcome in mind. &quot;I'm in this because I think the system is broken, and this is a way to begin fixing it,&quot; said Darry Sragow, a Los Angeles lawyer and veteran of California Democratic politics who is the group's national political director. &quot;There's no intention here to spoil anybody's candidacy.&quot; On the other hand, he acknowledged, that could be the effect. &quot;The law of unintended consequences is alive and well,&quot; he said. One potential pitfall for this well-intended effort is the opportunity for mischief. Americans Elect, because of recent court rulings, doesn't have to report who its donors are. Its organizers don't intend it to become a spoiler, but Republicans or Democrats could flood it with money to try to make it one. Another is that the group is aiming at the wrong target. Presidential elections aren't the main source of polarization in American politics; neither Obama nor Romney is an extremist. Most of the polarization we're seeing comes from Congress, where districts have been drawn to protect incumbents and where donors and interest groups have more influence on the nominating process. The group's organizers say they understand that. &quot;To change the system, you have to change it at the level of Congress and state legislatures,&quot; Sragow said. &quot;But we think the national level is the best place to get started.&quot; That start is certain to be an interesting experiment no matter what happens. But its real potential will come in 2014 and beyond — if it can stay on the ballot and break the two parties' oligopoly in congressional elections, where the real problem lies.<br />

So why does it feel as if we’ve been here before? Why does it feel as if we’ve heard him “give it to them” before only to have him lighten up and give in later? Because we have, that’s why. Yes, Thursday’s speech was an encouraging shift in tone with a meaty jobs plan of the president’s own design. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, even gave USA Today a glowing review of the plan. The paper reported it this way: “The plan, if enacted would boost economic growth next year by 2 percentage points and create two million additional jobs.” Of course, it will never be passed as is, but the positive analysis is still a nice feather in the president’s cap. But, in the end, it was just another speech. It didn’t answer definitively the larger questions that remain for this president: Has he truly shifted strategy or is his tonal shifting merely temporal? Has he finally realized that you can’t rub the belly of the beast that wants to eat you, that you have to fight your way off the plate and bring the monster to heel? Has he come to understand that Americans value valiant struggle over bloodless surrender? Does he have any interest in becoming the Obama of people’s imaginations, the one they thought they saw through the showers of streamers, and explosions of confetti in 2008 — the man who only ever existed in their own minds? Is the “transformative president” more than an opportunistic transformer, shifting shape to suit the moment, but truly settling on none? And can any adjustment halt the precipitous slide in the number of people who see him as an effective leader? According to a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, the number of people who rated the president “very good” at having strong leadership qualities has steadily dropped from 70 percent the month he took office to 42 percent last month. It’s not that people don’t believe him, it’s that an increasing number don’t believe in him. And that is far more dangerous politically. Obama can and must answer these questions, and quickly. He isn’t only battling a calcifying cynicism about the inefficacy of government in general, he’s battling the rapidly hardening public perception that he himself is a product of what I call the doughnut doctrine of leadership — soft, glazy, hollow in the middle and ideally suited for getting dunked. Americans want him to clearly identify his core beliefs. It’s simple: They want to fully understand his values and how they apply to us as individuals and as a country. Moreover, they want to be completely convinced that he is willing to defend it all. The vacillation between hot and cold, stern and pliable, resolute and accommodating hasn’t inspired that confidence. Americans respect authenticity and conviction even when they don’t fully agree with it. Conviction bespeaks strength; strength bespeaks power; and, for better or worse, this is a culture that applauds and is comforted by power. Obama has a list of accomplishments as long as your arm. But a less-than-masterly use of the bully pulpit has allowed both opponents and supposed allies to minimize them. A very vocal part of the progressive base has painted many of his successes as capitulations, while many on the far right have painted them as a threat to the security and solvency of the republic. That’s the problem with lingering too long in the middle: you take fire from both sides.<br />

Space power contains substantial demonstrated potential for political influence, influence which affects both the domestic population and international actors. The political influence of space power lies within the perception of possibilities. Status as the global space leader provides a critical political overmatch in crafting the perceived possibilities within space commercialization, space militarization, and space exploration into real political influence. The Reykjavik Summit held between President Ronald Reagan and Secretary-General of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev in early October of 1986 is an example of the political influence associated with the possibilities within US space power. The US Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), or star wars program, proved to be the most valuable bargaining chip for the US in negotiating an arms reduction of nuclear weapons with the Soviet Union. Despite the significant technological challenges and limited progress of the SDI Program at the time of the Reykjavik Summit, the perceived possibilities of the program supplied enormous political power to President Reagan. Negotiating for the significant reduction in SDI research, Secretary-General Gorbachev proposed the extreme measure of complete mutual dismantlement of nuclear arms. However, recognizing the political influence of even the possibility of the SDI program, President Reagan countered the offer with limiting the SDI Program to laboratory research while retaining a mutually acceptable level of nuclear arms reduction. The negotiations concluded without reaching an agreement on the continuation of nuclear arms reduction. However, the possibilities of space power overmatch clearly influenced political outcomes. . The political influences of space power are equally mobilizing on domestic populations. Public statements by political leaders stating awe-inspiring goals associated with space exploration create considerable political capital. Political capital is generated through reinforced national pride and confidence in the government to achieve seemingly unfathomable results. Examples include the Saturn Project, the Space Shuttle Program, and the recent global access to position, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities. As the global leader in space, US political influence is only limited by imagination and the audacity to set goals at the edge of the possible.<br />

 <strong>members of Congress are ONLY ideological</strong><br />
<strong>Poole 07</strong> [Keith T. Poole, Department of Political Science, University of California, San Diego, “Changing Minds? Not in Congress!” Public Choice 131:435–451]<br />
The purpose of this paper is to showevidence that members of Congress die in their ideological boots. That is, based upon the roll call voting record, once elected to Congress, members adopt an ideological position and maintain that position throughout their careers – once a liberal or a conservative or a moderate, always a liberal or a conservative or a moderate. The exceptions prove the rule – for every Richard Schweiker who went to the mountaintop with Ronald Reagan in 1976 and saw conservatism, or Charles Goodel who saw the true light of liberalism when he switched from the House to the Senate in 1968, there are hundreds of other Senators who never undergo a conversion experience. Ideology is measured by applying a simple spatial voting model to the roll call voting data for the 80th through the 107th Houses and Senates. This spatial model was proposed by Hinich and Ordeshook (Cahoon, Hinich, &amp; Ordeshook, 1976; Ordeshook, 1976; Hinich &amp; Pollard, 1981) and then developed in depth by Hinich and his colleagues (Enelow and Hinich, 1984; Hinich &amp; Munger, 1994, 1997). The model is also discussed at length in Poole and Rosenthal (1997) and Poole (2005), so I will only sketch the basic ideas here. Simply stated, the Hinich-Ordeshook spatial voting model embodies the fundamental insight of Philip Converse (1964) about ideology – or stated in Conversian terms, a belief system – namely, that issues are interrelated or bundled and that ideology is fundamentally the knowledge of what-goes-with-what. In contemporary American politics the knowledge that a politician opposes raising the minimum wage makes it virtually certain that the politician favors a balanced budget, opposes unfunded federal mandates to the states, opposes universal health care, favors ending the entitlement status of welfare, opposes affirmative action, and so on. In short, a conservative and almost certainly a Republican. Converse called this bundling of issues constraint – the ability, based on one or two issue positions, to predict other (seemingly unrelated) issue positions. In a standard spatial model of Congressional voting each issue is modeled as an ordered dimension of alternatives and each member is assumed to have an ideal point on, and single-peaked preferences over, each issue dimension. The existence of constraint has a straightforward geometric interpretation. It means that the issues lie on a low-dimensional hyperplane. Stated another way, the ideal points in the basic space defined by the hyperplane generate all the issue dimensions through simple linear maps. This is the essence of the Hinich-Ordeshook spatial model. Algebraically, let p denote the number of legislators, n denote the number issue dimensions, and s denote the number of dimensions in the basic space. The spatial model is summarized by the relationship: XW = Y where X is the p by s matrix of individual positions in the basic space,Wis an s by n matrix of linear maps, and Y is the p by n matrix of issue dimensions.Wmaps the basic space onto the issue dimensions. The simplest example is the liberal-moderate-conservative continuum so familiar to journalists and the political cognoscenti. “One judgmental dimension . . . that has been highly serviceable for simplifying and organizing events in mostWestern politics for the past century has been the liberal-conservative continuum.” (Converse, 1964, p. 214). In terms of the algebra given above, every issue dimension would be a simple linear transformation of the liberal-conservative dimension. In an errorless world, the correlation between any pair of issues (the columns of Y) would be one. Although the existence of constraint produces lowdimensionality it also presents problems in interpreting the basic dimensions it produces. In particular, this constraint or bundling of issue positions does not have to be strictly logical. Indeed, in our current political system one party – the Republicans – favors tight regulation of private personal behavior (abortion, homosexual rights, assisted suicide, etc.) and low regulation of the economy; while the opposite party – the Democrats – favor little if any regulation of private personal behavior and much greater regulation of economic behavior. There is no logically consistent philosophy that underlies these issues. To make matters even more incoherent, the issue of gun control does not fit comfortably into the category of an “economic” issue or a “social” issue. Viewed as a “social” issue, gun control has the two parties on the wrong sides – the Republicans oppose further regulation, the Democrats want more regulation. The fact that almost all of these issues can be accounted for by a single voting dimension that is commonly labeled liberal-conservative does not help us understand the “why” of the system. What do “liberal” and “conservative” mean beyond simply the labels for the endpoints of this basic dimension? This problem of interpretation raises the questions: “How do such disparate policy positions get bound together?” and “How could such an incoherent system persist?” The answer is simple – the elites are true believers. Logic in its strict deductive form is not necessary – belief, passionate belief, is the necessary ingredient. “What is important is that the elites familiar with the total shapes of these belief systems have experienced them as logically constrained clusters of ideas, within which one part necessarily follows from another”1 (Converse, pp. 210–211). James Madison in Federalist 10 points out that “as long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves” (Wills, 1982, p. 43). In other words, people hold their political views – even those that are logically organized – with passion. Eric Hoffer in his masterpiece The True Believer analyzes the nature of mass movements – both religious and political – and comes to similar conclusions. Hoffer observes that “the facts on which the true believer bases his conclusions must not be derived from his experience or observation but from holy writ. . ..it is startling to realize how much unbelief is necessary to make belief possible. What we know as blind faith is sustained by innumerable unbeliefs” (Hoffer, 1951, p. 79). For political elites, constraint and intensity of belief (passion) are two sides of the same coin. Constraint coupled with intense belief implies that politicians’ ideal points in the basic space will be stable. True believers do not compromise their principles. This is especially true at the ideological extremes. Realistically, intensity of belief should itself be a function of the position of the legislator in the basic space. The further a legislator is from the center of the space, the more intense the belief and the greater the stability. What can change, however, are the mappings of the basic dimensions onto the issue dimensions (the columns of W). For example, the 9/11 attacks made members of Congress more hawkish. Their basic space positions, X, did not change, but the mapping (the appropriate column of W) of the basic space positions onto a defense spending dimension (the appropriate column of Y) changed in that everyone was shifted towards a more hawkish position. I will return to this aspect of the model after I have presented the evidence for the fundamental stability of the basic space of American politics since the end of World War II.<br />

A powerful House Democrat announced Wednesday that he will fight for a billion dollar-plus space tracking system for missile defense, despite the fact that Republican lawmakers have dropped funding for the system from the defense policy bill. Rep. C. A. &quot;Dutch&quot; Ruppersberger (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee who also sits on the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, said he will push for an additional $168 million in the defense policy bill to cover costs of the Precision Tracking and Surveillance Satellites (PTSS). During a House Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee hearing today, Ruppersberger told his colleagues they were pursuing the &quot;wrong course of action,&quot; pointing to China's strong support for space exploration and technologies as one reason to fund the satellite program. The other reason the U.S. needs the satellites, he argued, is that the country must improve its knowledge of space objects and their locations, or &quot;space situational awareness.&quot; After the Chinese used a missile to destroy one of their satellites in January 2007, President Bush made space situational awareness a top administration space priority.<br />

Heidegger cedes the political.<br />
Rorty 98 – professor emeritus of comparative literature and philosophy, by courtesy, at Stanford University (Richard, “ACHIEVING OUR COUNTRY: Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America”, 1998, Pg. 7-9)<br />
Such people find pride in American citizenship impossi¬ble, and vigorous participation in electoral politics pointless. They associate American patriotism with an endorsement of atrocities: the importation of African slaves, the slaughter of Native Americans, the rape of ancient forests, and the Viet¬nam War. Many of them think of national pride as appropri¬ate only for chauvinists: for the sort of American who re¬joices that America can still orchestrate something like the Gulf War, can still bring deadly force to bear whenever and wherever it chooses. When young intellectuals watch John Wayne war movies after reading Heidegger, Foucault, Stephenson, or Silko, they often become convinced that they live in a violent, inhuman, corrupt country. They begin to think of themselves as a saving remnant-as the happy few who have the insight to see through nationalist rhetoric to the ghastly reality of contemporary America. But this insight does not move them to formulate a legislative program, to join a political movement, or to share in a national hope. The contrast between national hope and national self¬-mockery and self-disgust becomes vivid when one compares novels like Snow Crash and Almanac of the Dead with socialist novels of the first half of the century-books like The Jungle, An American Tragedy, and The Grapes of Wrath. The latter were written in the belief that the tone of the Gettysburg Address was absolutely right, but that our country would have to transform itself in order to fulfill Lincoln's hopes. Transfor¬mation would be needed because the rise of industrial capi¬talism had made the individualist rhetoric of America's first century obsolete. The authors of these novels thought that this rhetoric should be replaced by one in which America is destined to become the first cooperative commonwealth, the first class¬less society. This America would be one in which income and wealth are equitably distributed, and in which the govern¬ment ensures equality of opportunity as well as individual liberty. This new, quasi-communitarian rhetoric was at the heart of the Progressive Movement and the New Deal. It set the tone for the American Left during the first six decades of the twentieth century. Walt Whitman and John Dewey, as we shall see, did a great deal to shape this rhetoric. The difference between early twentieth-century leftist in¬tellectuals and the majority of their contemporary counter¬parts is the difference between agents and spectators. In the early decades of this century, when an intellectual stepped back from his or her country's history and looked at it through skeptical eyes, the chances were that he or she was about to propose a new political initiative. Henry Adams was, of course, the great exception-the great abstainer from •politics. But William James thought that Adams' diagnosis of the First Gilded Age as a symptom of irreversible moral and political decline was merely perverse. James's pragmatist theory of truth was in part a reaction against the sort of de¬tached spectators hip which Adams affected. For James, disgust with American hypocrisy and self¬-deception was pointless unless accompanied by an effort to give America reason to be proud of itself in the future. The kind of proto-Heideggerian cultural pessimism which Adams cultivated seemed, to James, decadent and cowardly. &quot;Democracy,&quot; James wrote, &quot;is a kind of religion, and we are bound not to admit its failure. Faiths and utopias are the no¬blest exercise of human reason, and no one with a spark of reason in him will sit down fatalistically before the croaker's picture. &quot;2<br />

Alternative doesn’t solve - technological thought is ingrained<br />
Riis 11—Carlsberg Research Fellow and Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Science Studies at Roskilde University, Ph.D. from Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg (Søren, 8 February 2011, “Towards the origin of modern technology: reconfiguring Martin Heidegger’s thinking,” RBatra)<br />
<br />
Martin Heidegger’s radical critique of technology has fundamentally stigmatized modern technology and paved the way for a comprehensive critique of contemporary Western society. However, the following reassessment of Heidegger’s most elaborate and influential interpretation of technology, ‘‘The Question Concerning Technology,’’ sheds a very different light on his critique. In fact, Heidegger’s phenomenological line of thinking concerning technology also implies a radical critique of ancient technology and the fundamental being-in-the-world of humans. This revision of Heidegger’s arguments claims that ‘‘The Question Concerning Technology’’ indicates a previous unseen ambiguity with respect to the origin of the rule of das Gestell. The following inquiry departs from Heidegger’s critique of modern technology and connects it to a reassessment of ancient technology and Aristotle’s justification of slavery. The last part of the paper unfolds Heidegger’s underlying arguments in favor of continuity within the history of technology. According to these interpretations, humans have always strived to develop ‘‘modern’’ technology and to become truly ‘‘modern’’ in the Heideggerian sense. The danger stemming from the rule of das Gestell is thus not only transient and solely directed toward contemporary Western society, but also I will argue that humans can only be humans as the ones challenged by the rule of das Gestell.<br />

Calculative and technological thought are the only way to know what issues too address – outweighs and turns the k<br />
Paul C. Santilli, Professor of Philosophy @ Siena College, 5/22/2003 (“Radical Evil, Subjection, and Alain Badiou’s Ethic of the Truth Event” – World Congress of the International Society for Universal Dialogue”) <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3817:http://www.isud.org/papers/pdfs/Santilli.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.isud.org/papers/pdfs/Santilli.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.isud.org/papers/pdfs/Santilli.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3817 --><br />
From the standpoint of an ethics of subjection there is even something unnecessary or superfluous about the void of suffering in the subject bearers of evil. For Levinas, the return to being from the ethical encounter with the face and its infinite depths is fraught with the danger the subject will reduce the other to a &quot;like-me,&quot; totalizing and violating the space of absolute alterity. As Chalier puts it, &quot;Levinas conceives of the moral subject's awakening, or the emergence of the human in being, as a response to that pre-originary subjection which is not a happenstance of being.&quot; But if there really is something inaccessible about suffering itself, about the 'other' side of what is manifestly finite, subjected, and damaged, then to a certain extent it is irrelevant to ethics, as irrelevant as the judgment of moral progress in the subject-agent. Let me take the parent-child relation again as an example. Suppose the child to exhibit the symptoms of an illness. Are not the proper &quot;ethical&quot; questions for the parent to ask questions of measure and mathematical multiples: How high is the fever? How long has it lasted? How far is the hospital? Can she get out of bed? Has this happened before? These are the questions of the doctor, the rescue squads and the police. They are questions about being, about detail, causes and effects. Ethically our response to the needs of must be reduced to a positivity simply because we have access to nothing but the symptoms, which are like mine. Our primary moral responsibility is to treat the symptoms that show up in being, not the radically other with whom I cannot identify. Say we observe someone whose hands have been chopped off with a machete. How would we characterize this? Would it not be slightly absurd to say, &quot;He had his limbs severed and he suffered,&quot; as though the cruel amputation were not horror enough. Think of the idiocy in the common platitude: &quot;She died of cancer, but thank God, she did not suffer&quot;, as though the devastating annihilation of the human by a tumor were not evil itself. For ethics, then, the only suffering that matters are the visible effects of the onslaught of the world. All other suffering is excessive and inaccessible. Therefore, it is in being, indeed in the midst of the most elemental facts about ourselves and other people, that we ethically encounter others by responding to their needs and helping them as best we can It is precisely by identifying being and not pretending that we know any thing about suffering, other than it is a hollow in the midst of being, that we can act responsibly. What worries me about Levinas is that by going beyond being to what he regards as the ethics of absolute alterity, he risks allowing the sheer, almost banal facticity of suffering to be swallowed in the infinite depths of transcendence. Indeed, it seems to me that Levinas too often over emphasizes the importance of the emergence of the subject and the inner good in the ethical encounter, as though the point of meeting the suffering human being was to come to an awareness of the good within oneself and not to heal and repair. I agree with Chalier's observation that Levinas's &quot;analyses adopt the point of view of the moral subject, not that of a person who might be the object of its solicitude.&quot; Ethics has limits; there are situations like the Holocaust where to speak of a moral responsibility to heal and repair seems pathetic. But an ethics that would be oriented to the vulnerabilities of the subjected (which are others, of course, but also myself) needs to address the mutilation, dismemberment, the chronology of torture, the numbers incarcerated, the look of the bodies, the narratives, the blood counts, the mines knives, machetes, and poisons. Evil really is all that. When the mind does its work, it plunges into being, into mathematical multiples and starts counting the cells, the graveyards, and bullet wounds. Rational practical deliberation is always about the facts that encircle the void inaccessible to deliberation and practical reason.<br />

 A focus on representations destroys social change by ignoring political and material constraints<br />
<strong>Taft-Kaufman, 95</strong> (Jill, professor, Department of Speech Communication And Dramatic Arts, atCentralMichiganUniversity, Southern Communication Journal, Spring, proquest)<br />
The postmodern passwords of &quot;polyvocality,&quot; &quot;Otherness,&quot; and &quot;difference,&quot; unsupported by substantial analysis of the concrete contexts of subjects, creates a solipsistic quagmire. The political sympathies of the new cultural critics, with their ostensible concern for the lack of power experienced by marginalized people, aligns them with the political left. Yet, despite their adversarial posture and talk of opposition, their discourses on intertextuality and inter-referentiality isolate them from and ignore the conditions that have produced leftist politics--conflict, racism, poverty, and injustice. In short, as Clarke (1991) asserts, postmodern emphasis on new subjects conceals the old subjects, those who have limited access to good jobs, food, housing, health care, and transportation, as well as to the media that depict them. Merod (1987) decries this situation as one which leaves no vision, will, or commitment to activism. He notes that academic lip service to the oppositional is underscored by the absence of focused collective or politically active intellectual communities. Provoked by the academic manifestations of this problem Di Leonardo (1990) echoes Merod and laments: Has there ever been a historical era characterized by as little radical analysis or activism and as much radical-chic writing as ours? Maundering on about Otherness: phallocentrism or Eurocentric tropes has become a lazy academic substitute for actual engagement with the detailed histories and contemporary realities of Western racial minorities, white women, or any Third World population. (p. 530) Clarke's assessment of the postmodern elevation of language to the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of critical discussion is an even stronger indictment against the trend. Clarke examines Lyotard's (1984) The Postmodern Condition in which Lyotard maintains that virtually all social relations are linguistic, and, therefore, it is through the coercion that threatens speech that we enter the &quot;realm of terror&quot; and society falls apart. To this assertion, Clarke replies: I can think of few more striking indicators of the political and intellectual impoverishment of a view of society that can only recognize the discursive. If the worst terror we can envisage is the threat not to be allowed to speak, we are appallingly ignorant of terror in its elaborate contemporary forms. It may be the intellectual's conception of terror (what else do we do but speak?), but its projection onto the rest of the world would be calamitous....(pp. 2-27) The realm of the discursive is derived from the requisites for human life, which are in the physical world, rather than in a world of ideas or symbols.(4) Nutrition, shelter, and protection are basic human needs that require collective activity for their fulfillment. Postmodern emphasis on the discursive without an accompanying analysis of how the discursive emerges from material circumstances hides the complex task of envisioning and working towards concrete social goals (Merod, 1987). Although the material conditions that create the situation of marginality escape the purview of the postmodernist, the situation and its consequences are not overlooked by scholars from marginalized groups. Robinson (1990) for example, argues that &quot;the justice that working people deserve is economic, not just textual&quot; (p. 571). Lopez (1992) states that &quot;the starting point for organizing the program content of education or political action must be the present existential, concrete situation&quot; (p. 299). West (1988) asserts that borrowing French post-structuralist discourses about &quot;Otherness&quot; blinds us to realities of American difference going on in front of us (p. 170). Unlike postmodern &quot;textual radicals&quot; who Rabinow (1986) acknowledges are &quot;fuzzy about power and the realities of socioeconomic constraints&quot; (p. 255), most writers from marginalized groups are clear about how discourse interweaves with the concrete circumstances that create lived experience. People whose lives form the material for postmodern counter-hegemonic discourse do not share the optimism over the new recognition of their discursive subjectivities, because such an acknowledgment does not address sufficiently their collective historical and current struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic injustice. They do not appreciate being told they are living in a world in which there are no more real subjects. Ideas have consequences. Emphasizing the discursive self when a person is hungry and homeless represents both a cultural and humane failure. The need to look beyond texts to the perception and attainment of concrete social goals keeps writers from marginalized groups ever-mindful of the specifics of how power works through political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.<br />

More serious than this lack of public understanding about space is the serious shortfall in understanding the larger implications of the importance of space. Threats to the world’s space assets, and hence to the world’s vital national interests, come in many forms—some hostile, some not. One of the biggest threats is what we just do not know: about objects in space, the intentions of those who put the objects there, and the strategic landscape of space itself—how it operates, where it poses strategic dangers, and what needs to be monitored and managed. We need to understand how China, the Russian Federation, the United States and others see space stability. How will this shape their space doctrine, acquisition, strategies and diplomacy? There is much we should know and understand, but do not, about this new space-enabled military era the world has recently entered. Given the vital and growing role that space plays in modern life, the world has an overriding interest in maintaining the safety, survival and function of space assets so that the profound civilian, commercial, and military benefits they enable can continue to be available. These vital space assets face three forms of threat, all of them worrisome and growing. First, the proliferation of space and other technologies, and specifically the anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities demonstrated within the past three years, call attention to the risk that an advanced country could exploit this fast-growing world dependence on space in a war. 1 Second, space “traffic” is heavier than it has ever been and getting heavier still, in terms of both vehicles and communications, but there is no space traffic control authority. The current level of simply monitoring space objects is widely regarded as far below what is needed: there is a substantial and growing need for space traffic management capabilities, including enforceable rules of the road and codes of conduct, and space situational awareness to inform a space traffic management capability. Third, space debris poses an insidious and growing threat to all space assets. Debris in space does not quickly fall to the ground: at all but the lowest orbits, debris can stay aloft for centuries and more. In addition to the 19,000 orbiting objects the United States Air Force is tracking, there are hundreds of thousands of potentially lethal objects in orbit, and millions of smaller objects that pose at least some risk. 2 If current space debris trends continue, there will be almost 1000% more debris than today within 25 years. 3 This would greatly increase the risk of satellite collisions and force satellite operators into making frequent, costly and satellite-lifetime shortening manoeuvres. The collision earlier this year between a US Iridium satellite and an older Russian Cosmos dramatically illustrates the problem. 4 The core of the space security problem is that the substantial economic and national security benefits that space assets provide is accompanied by their substantial vulnerability to both natural and man-made threats. In addition to the increasingly worrisome threats of orbital debris, as well as physical and electromagnetic traffic in space, military writings in several countries make clear that developing offensive capabilities against space assets has significant appeal to some military planners.<br />

One is also required to ask: <span style="text-decoration: none;">If war is &quot;not the answer,&quot; what exactly is the question?</span> I wonder if, in her long interludes of geopolitical analysis, Ms. Crow even asks herself that. Perhaps if she did <span style="text-decoration: none;">-- let's say the question is</span> about <span style="text-decoration: none;">the threat of w</span>eapons of <span style="text-decoration: none;">m</span>ass <span style="text-decoration: none;">d</span>estruction <span style="text-decoration: none;">in the hands of terrorists</span> -- we might have an inkling about what her &quot;answer&quot; might actually be. Mercifully, Ms. Crow provides us with what she believes is an argument. Are you sitting down? Here it comes: &quot;I think war is based in greed and there are huge karmic retributions that will follow. I think war is never the answer to solving any problems. The best way to solve problems is to not have enemies.&quot; Let's take this bit by bit. &quot;<span style="text-decoration: none;">War is based in greed.&quot; Some</span> wars<span style="text-decoration: none;">, surely</span>. The pirate wars of the 17th century. Saddam's incursion into Kuwait. Early British forays in the Far East and India<span style="text-decoration: none;">. But all</span> wars? The <span style="text-decoration: none;">U</span>nited <span style="text-decoration: none;">S</span>tates' <span style="text-decoration: none;">intervention in the Second World War</span>? The <span style="text-decoration: none;">Wars of Religion</span> in the 17th century? <span style="text-decoration: none;">Many</span> wars <span style="text-decoration: none;">are fueled by nationalism</span>, or by <span style="text-decoration: none;">ideology, or</span> by <span style="text-decoration: none;">expansionism </span>. And <span style="text-decoration: none;">many</span> wars <span style="text-decoration: none;">have seen their protagonists not enriched but impoverished.</span> Take Britain's entry into the war against Nazi Germany. It would have been far more lucrative for the Brits to have made a deal with Hitler, to preserve their wealth and empire. Instead, they waged war, lost their entire imperial project and ransacked their own domestic wealth. Where would that fit into Ms. Crow's worldview? And then there's the concept of a just war -- wars that have to be fought to defeat a greater evil. Wars of self-defense. Wars of prevention. Wars against tyrants. Ms. Crow's remarks seem to acknowledge no such distinction. Does she believe that <span style="text-decoration: none;">removing Hitler</span> from power <span style="text-decoration: none;">solved nothing</span>? That <span style="text-decoration: none;">preventing </span>further <span style="text-decoration: none;">genocide in the Balkans solved nothing</span>? That ending 50 years of Soviet tyranny meant nothing? <span style="text-decoration: none;">Apparently so. There's only one word for this kind of argument: Asinine. Then we have this wonderful insight: &quot;The best way to solve problems is to not have enemies</span>.&quot; Wow. Like, wow. Like, war. It's bad. Bad karma.

The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change.As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved - perhaps even unrecognized - only to fester more ominously into the future. And such problems (ecological crisis, poverty,urban decay, spread of infectious diseases, technological displacement of workers) cannot be understood outside the larger social and global context of internationalized markets, finance, and communications. Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or side-step these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impo-tence. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to theincreasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions.74 In the meantime, <strong>the fate of the world hangs in the balance</strong>. The unyielding truth is that, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the United States, it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies. This last point demands further elaboration. Theshrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehowdisappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people's lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites - an already familiar dynamic in many lesser-developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world, not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a reassertion of politics in more virulent guise - or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collec-tive interests that had vanished from civil society.75<br />

The central issue here is what causes states to behave as offensive realists predict. Mearsheimer advances a powerful argument that anarchy is the fundamental cause of such behavior. The fact that there is no world government compels the leaders of states to take steps to ensure their security, such as striving to have a powerful military, aggressing when forced to do so, and forging and maintaining alliances. This is what neorealists call a self-help system: leaders of states arc forced to take these steps because nothing else can guarantee their security in the anarchic world of international relations. I argue that evolutionary theory also offers a fundamental cause for offensive realist behavior. Evolutionary theory explains why individuals are motivated to act as offensive realism expects, whether an individual is a captain of industry or a conquistador. My argument is that anarchy is even more important than most scholars of international relations recognize. The human environment of evolutionary adaptation was anarchic; our ancestors lived in a state of nature in which resources were poor and dangers from other humans and the environment were great—so great that it is truly remarkable that a mammal standing three feet high—without claws or strong teeth, not particularly strong or swift—survived and evolved to become what we consider human. Humans endured because natural selection gave them the right behaviors to last in those conditions. This environment produced the behaviors examined here: egoism, domination, and the in-group/out-group distinction. These specific traits arc sufficient to explain why leaders will behave, in the proper circumstances, as offensive realists expect them to behave. That is, even if they must hurt other humans or risk injury to themselves, they will strive to maximize their power, defined as either control over others (for example, through wealth or leadership) or control over ecological circumstances (such as meeting their own and their family's or tribes need for food, shelter, or other resources).<br />

<strong>Perm do both – the alt fails and the perm deploys US hegemony as a progressive force.</strong><br />

Hegemony in international terms without some kind of competing force, such as the Soviets, can clearly lead to the abuse of power and a unilateralist flaunting of international institutions that do not serve at the imperium's whim. But this should not mean that hegemony itself is a negative concept. Although empire is something rightfully reviled, hegemony may not be as bad as everyone thinks. We need to consider what is progressive and transformative in the ideas and values of the western republican and liberal traditions. We need to advocate not an anti-hegemonic stance in form, but an anti-hegemonic and anti-imperialist stance in content, one that advocates the particular interests of capital of the market in more broad terms rather than the universal political interests of others. Rather than choose between western hegemony on the one hand and political and cultural relativism on the other, we need to approach this problem with an eye toward cosmopolitanism and what the political theorist Stephen Eric Bronner has called &quot;planetary life.&quot; Simple resistance to American &quot;imperial&quot; tendencies is no longer enough for a responsible, critical and rational left. Not only does it smack of tiers-mondisme but at the same time it rejects the realities of globalization which are inexorable and require a more sophisticated political response. The real question I am putting forth is simply this: is it the case that hegemony is in itself inherently bad? Or, is it possible to consider that, because it can, at least in theory, consist of the diffusion of western political ideas, values and institutions, it could be used as a progressive force in transforming those nations and regions that have been unable to deal politically with the problems of economic development, political disintegration and ethnic strife?<br />

A focus on discourse destroys social change by ignoring political and material constraints<br />
Taft-Kaufman, 95 (Jill, professor, Department of Speech Communication And Dramatic Arts, at Central Michigan University, Southern Communication Journal, Spring, proquest)<br />
The postmodern passwords of &quot;polyvocality,&quot; &quot;Otherness,&quot; and &quot;difference,&quot; unsupported by substantial analysis of the concrete contexts of subjects, creates a solipsistic quagmire. The political sympathies of the new cultural critics, with their ostensible concern for the lack of power experienced by marginalized people, aligns them with the political left. Yet, despite their adversarial posture and talk of opposition, their discourses on intertextuality and inter-referentiality isolate them from and ignore the conditions that have produced leftist politics--conflict, racism, poverty, and injustice. In short, as Clarke (1991) asserts, postmodern emphasis on new subjects conceals the old subjects, those who have limited access to good jobs, food, housing, health care, and transportation, as well as to the media that depict them. Merod (1987) decries this situation as one which leaves no vision, will, or commitment to activism. He notes that academic lip service to the oppositional is underscored by the absence of focused collective or politically active intellectual communities. Provoked by the academic manifestations of this problem Di Leonardo (1990) echoes Merod and laments: Has there ever been a historical era characterized by as little radical analysis or activism and as much radical-chic writing as ours? Maundering on about Otherness: phallocentrism or Eurocentric tropes has become a lazy academic substitute for actual engagement with the detailed histories and contemporary realities of Western racial minorities, white women, or any Third World population. (p. 530) Clarke's assessment of the postmodern elevation of language to the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of critical discussion is an even stronger indictment against the trend. Clarke examines Lyotard's (1984) The Postmodern Condition in which Lyotard maintains that virtually all social relations are linguistic, and, therefore, it is through the coercion that threatens speech that we enter the &quot;realm of terror&quot; and society falls apart. To this assertion, Clarke replies: I can think of few more striking indicators of the political and intellectual impoverishment of a view of society that can only recognize the discursive. If the worst terror we can envisage is the threat not to be allowed to speak, we are appallingly ignorant of terror in its elaborate contemporary forms. It may be the intellectual's conception of terror (what else do we do but speak?), but its projection onto the rest of the world would be calamitous....(pp. 2-27) The realm of the discursive is derived from the requisites for human life, which are in the physical world, rather than in a world of ideas or symbols.(4) Nutrition, shelter, and protection are basic human needs that require collective activity for their fulfillment. Postmodern emphasis on the discursive without an accompanying analysis of how the discursive emerges from material circumstances hides the complex task of envisioning and working towards concrete social goals (Merod, 1987). Although the material conditions that create the situation of marginality escape the purview of the postmodernist, the situation and its consequences are not overlooked by scholars from marginalized groups. Robinson (1990) for example, argues that &quot;the justice that working people deserve is economic, not just textual&quot; (p. 571). Lopez (1992) states that &quot;the starting point for organizing the program content of education or political action must be the present existential, concrete situation&quot; (p. 299). West (1988) asserts that borrowing French post-structuralist discourses about &quot;Otherness&quot; blinds us to realities of American difference going on in front of us (p. 170). Unlike postmodern &quot;textual radicals&quot; who Rabinow (1986) acknowledges are &quot;fuzzy about power and the realities of socioeconomic constraints&quot; (p. 255), most writers from marginalized groups are clear about how discourse interweaves with the concrete circumstances that create lived experience. People whose lives form the material for postmodern counter-hegemonic discourse do not share the optimism over the new recognition of their discursive subjectivities, because such an acknowledgment does not address sufficiently their collective historical and current struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic injustice. They do not appreciate being told they are living in a world in which there are no more real subjects. Ideas have consequences. Emphasizing the discursive self when a person is hungry and homeless represents both a cultural and humane failure. The need to look beyond texts to the perception and attainment of concrete social goals keeps writers from marginalized groups ever-mindful of the specifics of how power works through political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.<br />

The pessimistic scenario is characterized by political and economic divisions. International cooperation (when and if it exists) is structured and dominated politically and economically by a powerful state (e.g., U.S.) vis-à-vis weaker states based on power asymmetries.This scenario envisions regional polarization politically and economically between the U.S.–Canada, European Community, Russia–Eastern Europe, Japan–Southeast Asia and China. Cooperation is dependent upon the structure of interstate power whereupon states compare the political costs of cooperation (reduced national autonomy) with the pragmatic benefits (economic and technological augmentation). In this scenario, science and technological variables are secondary to the more salient political and economic concerns. States are the dominant and exclusive political actor. The values on initial condition dynamics include asymmetric power patterns, national interests, coordination and augmentation policy preferences and minimum knowledge patterns. Four trends and events are identified that discern the pessimistic from the optimistic scenario: (1) enhanced importance of science and technology relative to politics and economics; (2) economic interdependencies between states to an extent that no one individual state possesses the financial wherewithal to independently develop large-scale human space exploration endeavors; (3) emergence of dramatic political events that shift state interests and policy preferences that are more conducive for cooperation; and (4) development of enabling technologies that reduces space mission costs to a level that matches the current trends in state funding for space. The greater the likelihood of occurrence of these factors, the less probable the pessimistic scenario. Thus, the probability of occurrence of the pessimistic scenario is very high if all factors are not present; high if only one factor is present; 50–50 if two factors are present; low if three factors are present; and zero if all four factors are present. The probability of each model emerging as the determinative political process is assessed and shown in Table 4. Probable cooperative dynamics are limited to structural conditioning and convergence of norms. Structural conditioning implies that a powerful state and respective national space agency (e.g. U.S. and NASA) exploit power asymmetries to realize first and foremost their desired interests and policy preferences. Convergence of norms becomes possible if states emphasize the normative symbolic aspect of space exploration. In this case, symbolism rooted in national identity and international leadership and prestige is what provides the political will for space exploration. If other states reach the same conclusion, then cooperation becomes one vehicle for advancing these symbolic attributes. The pessimistic scenario of international cooperation is reinforced by the various reports that have been publishedregarding the future of the U.S. civilian space program[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. These reports take the position that international cooperation is of secondary importance. Future space program scenarios are conceived in primarily nationalistic terms whereby cooperation with other states is not fundamental to either program design or execution. For example, the space exploration initiative (SEI) was justified on a number of rationale factors—exploration ethos, national prestige, advancing science education, developing technologies, commercializing space and strengthening the U.S. economy—of which international cooperation was not included[6]. The Ride Report[3] provides a systematic analysis of the U.S. civilian space program to show how the U.S. has lost its leadership position in space especially as it relates to maintaining a human presence there. To this end, a space strategic development plan for the 21st century is developed based on restoring U.S. leadership status. This requires that the U.S. have capabilities that enable it to act independently and impressively when and where it chooses. In the NASA Strategic Plan[9] , international cooperation is not considered crucial in realizing four space strategic enterprises (Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS), Space Sciences, Earth Sciences, and Aeronautics and Space Transportation Technology). The strategic plan focuses on developing these enterprises to meet the goals of various governmental (President and Congress) and domestic public constituencies with the ultimate benefactors being policy makers, science communities, aeronautics industry, other governmental agencies, public sector and academic communities all within the U.S. Although, cooperation does emerge as part of the HEDS enterprise (e.g., ISS), it is viewed as an inevitable outcome of the current state of international relations that must be exploited to advance U.S. interests and policy preferences in space exploration.<br />

Focus on white supremacy alone reproduces the most dangerous forms of racism and is doomed to fail<br />
Hartigan 5- prof of anthropology @ UT, PhD from University of California, Santa Cruz<br />
(John, South Atlantic Quarterly 104.3, Summer, “Culture against Race: Reworking the Basis for Racial Analysis”)<br />
One might be tempted to assume that Gilroy’s stance is largely polemical, but his critique is thoroughgoing, as is his call to reject ‘‘this desire to cling on to ‘race’ and go on stubbornly and unimaginatively seeing the world on the distinctive scales that it has specified.’’ In spite of powerful, novel efforts to fundamentally transform racial analysis—such as the emergence of ‘‘whiteness studies’’ or analyses of the ‘‘new racism’’—Gilroy is emphatic in ‘‘demand[ing] liberation not from white supremacy alone, however urgently that is required, but from all racializing and raciological thought, fromracialized seeing, racialized thinking, and racialized thinking about thinking’’ (40). In contrast to Visweswaran—and, interestingly, voicing concerns over ‘‘cultural politics’’ that resonate with Dominguez’s critique—Gilroy sees a host of problems in ‘‘black political cultures’’ that rely on ‘‘essentialist approaches to building solidarity’’ (38).14 Nor does he share Harrison’s confidence in making racism the centerpiece of critical cultural analysis. Gilroy plainly asserts that ‘‘the starting point of this book is that the era of New Racism is emphatically over’’ (34). A singular focus on racism precludes an attention to ‘‘the appearance of sharp intraracial conflicts’’ and does not effectively address the ‘‘several new forms of determinism abroad’’ (38, 34). We still must be prepared ‘‘to give effective answers to the pathological problems represented by genomic racism, the glamour of sameness, and the eugenic projects currently nurtured by their confluence’’ (41). But the diffuse threats posed by invocations of racially essentialized identities (shimmering in ‘‘the glamour of sameness’’) as the basis for articulating ‘‘black political cultures’’ entails an analytical approach that countervails against positing racism as the singular focus of inquiry and critique.15 From Gilroy’s stance, to articulate a ‘‘postracial humanism’’ we must disable any form of racial vision and ensure that it can never again be reinvested with explanatory power. But what will take its place as a basis for talking about the dynamics of belonging and differentiation that profoundly shape social collectives today? Gilroy tries to make clear that it will not be ‘‘culture,’’ yet this concept infuses his efforts to articulate an alternative conceptual approach. Gilroy conveys many of the same reservations about culture articulated by the anthropologists listed above. Specifically, Gilroy cautions that ‘‘the culturalist approach still runs the risk of naturalizing and normalizing hatred and brutality by presenting them as inevitable consequences of illegitimate attempts to mix and amalgamate primordially incompatible groups’’ (27). In contrast, Gilroy expressly prefers the concept of diaspora as a means to ground a new form of attention to collective identities. ‘‘As an alternative to the metaphysics of ‘race,’ nation, and bounded culture coded into the body,’’ Gilroy finds that ‘‘diaspora is a concept that problematizes the cultural and historical mechanics of belonging’’ (123). Furthermore, ‘‘by focusing attention equally on the sameness within differentiation and the differentiation within sameness, diaspora disturbs the suggestion that political and cultural identity might be understood via the analogy of indistinguishable peas lodged in the protective pods of closed kinship and subspecies’’ (125). And yet, in a manner similar to Harrison’s prioritizing of racism as a central concern for social inquiry, when it comes to specifying what diaspora entails and how it works, vestiges of culture reemerge as a basis for the coherence of this new conceptual focus. When Gilroy delineates the elements and dimensions of diaspora, culture provides the basic conceptual background and terminology. In characterizing ‘‘the Atlantic diaspora and its successor-cultures,’’ Gilroy sequentially invokes ‘‘black cultural styles’’ and ‘‘postslave cultures’’ that have ‘‘supplied a platform for youth cultures, popular cultures, and styles of dissent far from their place of origin’’ (178). Gilroy explains how the ‘‘cultural expressions’’ of hip-hop and rap, along with other expressive forms of ‘‘black popular culture,’’ are marketed by the ‘‘cultural industries’’ to white consumers who ‘‘currently support this black culture’’ (181). Granted, in these uses of ‘‘culture’’ Gilroy remains critical of ‘‘absolutist definitions of culture’’ and the process of commodification that culture in turn supports. But his move away from ra<br />

One question that arises today is whether the major successor-state to the Soviet bloc, the Russian Federation, has escaped the quasi-imperial mode of rule in which its predecessor was mired. It is difficult for anyone who examines post-Soviet Russia to argue that this 'nation-state' is not, in important respects, a truncated version of the historic Soviet and indeed Russian empires. As Chechnya shows, Russian rule over peripheral regions remains highly contested and repressive. However the same questions arise with the other major non-Western centres of 'national' state power that have been consolidated since 1945, not only China and other remaining Communist states, but also major non-Communist, often pro-Western 'nation-states' ranging from India and Pakistan to Indonesia and Turkey. Despite significant differences in their political regimes, and despite their different relations to the Cold War and the post-Cold War West, it is striking that in all cases there are highly unequal relations between centres and peripheries, mired in authoritarianism of different kinds. It is plausible to argue that contemporary non-Western state forms suffer from similar disadvantages, as forms of state power, compared to the West, from which the Soviet Union suffered. I have tried to summarise these differences in Table 2. What is particularly important to note is that the tendency in Western state entities is for quasi-imperial contradictions to be increasingly controlled in ways that prevent extensive violence. National/regional conflicts have been largely contained, with only limited violence, e.g. in Canada (Quebec), Belgium (Flanders/Wallonia), UK (N. Ireland, Scotland, Wales), Spain (Basque country, Catalonia), Italy, etc. If anything, the tendencies are for state and paramilitary leaders to seek political solutions, even if these are not always successful and criminalisation tends to reinforce low-level paramilitarism. In contrast, in what I am calling quasi-imperial nation-states, conflicts between state power and secessionist/autonomist movements in the peripheries are much more likely to become violent. There are some cases, in relatively prosperous and relatively pro-Western states, where there have been serious and partially attempts to manage these contradictions in political ways: e.g. the peaceful splitting of Czechoslovakia, and the avoidance of all-out war in South Africa between the ANC, the apartheid regime and Inkatha. It is possible now that the peace process between the new Fox administration and the Zapatistas will avoid continuing violence in Mexico; even that the long-standing war between Turkey and the PKK has come to a conclusion and will lead to genuine reform. However it is clear that the problem of empire is deep-rooted in many quasi-imperial nation-states, and not only the largest, as Table 3 shows: many of these states are rooted in historic empires, and conflicts have long histories; and these are states in which earlier crises of empire, involving revolutionary change, have led to reproductions of imperial power in new forms. Furthermore, it can be argued that because of deep-rooted, imperial and authoritarian modes of power (both Communist and anti-Communist) democratic change in quasi-imperial nation-states throws up contradictions that are often managed by state violence. In these states, rulers do not see democracy as involving real recognition of minority rights, still less the possibility of secession. Likewise, traditions of political struggle are often not democratic, but highly militarised, and oppositional movements often (but not always) look to violent means of change.<br />

Epistemological and Methodological focus is not predictive – Only politically relevant IR can provide critical insight into future contingencies and grasp the political underpinnings of critiques<br />

As in other fields driven by a concern with real-world developments, SIR research has been motivated by both internally- and externally-driven con- cerns. The former are conceptual, epistemological, and methodological mat- ters that scholars believe they need to confront to do their intellectual work: Which research programs are most apt to resolve the field’s core puzzles? What is the meaning of contested concepts? Which empirical evidence or methods are especially useful, convincing, or weak in this field? The latter consist of issues relevant to policy practitioners and citizens: How can people prepare to deal with an uncertain future? More specifically, how can they anticipate future international developments to which they might need to adapt, assess the likely consequences of measures to deal with that future, or at least think about such matters intelligently?12 While the best scholarly work tends to have important ramifications for both types of concerns, the academic emphasis has shifted too far toward work with little relevance out- side academia. This balance must be redressed if SIR is to resonate outside the Ivory Tower. Beyond this, shifting scholars’ attention toward the claims about the world they seek to account for would help improve their work by the standards of academic scholarship itself. If SIR were, at least partly, justified by the light that it sheds on practical foreign policy issues, this would help academics 8 The Theory-Practice Gap in International Relations identify significant substantive questions, and, we feel, provide answers that clearly pass the “so what” question. Curiosity about practical problems and how they can be manipulated is what gives scientists many ideas about what areas of basic research need to be explored, what is generalizable within those areas, which empirical patterns can be explained by existing theory, and which puzzles require further attention.13 Just as important, a grasp of practical issues helps ground theory in the facts for which it seeks to account. In making the case that the balance between internally- and externally- driven concerns could be readjusted without diluting the intellectual value of SIR, it is worth noting that the large emphasis on the former is quite recent. Accordingly, it is worth examining the field’s traditional preoccupa- tion with externally-driven concerns, as a way to see where we have been and why that intellectual stance toward policy-relevance was taken for so long.<br />

Whiteness theory fails—it provides a framework for criticism but can’t articulate practical solutions<br />

<br />
While these are powerful arguments about multiracialism's bend towards revisionist history, I was left wondering how these astute assessments translate into contemporary interracial sexual relationships. The fact that Sexton seemingly categorizes the interracial sex act as always implicitly a product of violence or sexualized racism is troubling. One sharp criticism of this book is that if one is not a careful reader, one might misinterpret Sexton's strong critique of multiracial politics as advocating bigotry towards multiracial individuals or interracial couples. This is perhaps due to the occasional opacity of Sexton's language or the difficulty of the theoretical quandaries themselves. I was left with many questions after reading Sexton's work, most notably, are all mixed race individuals and all interracial couples, according to Sexton's argument, always already implicated in a racist multiracial politics even against their wills or knowledge? Sexton suggests that all &quot;healthy&quot; (i.e., socially recognized) interracial relationships feel the need to define themselves in opposition to pathological constructions of interracial sexuality (175). Is this a fair assessment? Amalgamation Schemes is constructed upon a series of shrewd observations, and is an admirable project because it introduces a timely criticism, but ultimately this work is more concerned with deconstructing the conservative tenants of multiracialism than it is with structuring a new empowered politics. To wit, Sexton ends his work advocating a &quot;creative destruction&quot; (258) of both multiracial politics and concepts of biological racialization in favor of a racialization rearticulated in discourses of power. He does not, however, articulate how such a politics could be structured and practiced. Rich, strong, and provocative, Amalgamation Schemes does a thorough job of critiquing the advocates of multiracialism and its discursive framework, but ultimately leaves the reader with more questions about how to disarticulate racialization from a biological, psychological, pathological, or multiracial politics than perhaps its author is prepared to concretely engage with.<br />

Kritiks of western imperialism and hegemony justify violence and genocide.<br />

The conclusion is inescapable. At the present time, only the West has both the power and, however intermittently, the readiness to act. And by the West, one really means the United States. Obviously, to say that America could act effectively if it chose to do so as, yes, the world's policeman of last resort, is not the same thing as saying that it should. Those who argue, as George Kennan has done, that we overestimate ourselves when we believe we can right the wrongs of the world, must be listened to seriously. So should the views of principled isolationists. And those on what remains of the left who insist that the result of such a broad licensing of American power will be a further entrenchment of America's hegemony over the rest of the world are also unquestionably correct. What Is to Be Done But the implications of not doing anything are equally clear. Those who fear American power are-this is absolutely certain-condemning other people to death. Had the U.S. armed forces not set up the air bridge to eastern Zaire in the wake of the Rwandan genocide, hundreds of thousands of people would have perished, rather than the tens of thousands who did die. This does not excuse the Clinton administration for failing to act to stop the genocide militarily; but it is a fact. And analogous situations were found in Bosnia and even, for all its failings, in the operation in Somalia. Continues Is this proposal tantamount to calling for a recolonization of part of the world? Would such a system make the United States even more powerful than it is already? Clearly it is, and clearly it would. But what are the alternatives? Kosovo demonstrates how little stomach the United States has for the kind of military action that its moral ambitions impel it to undertake. And there will be many more Kosovos in the coming decades. With the victory of capitalism nearly absolute, the choice is not between systems but about what kind of capitalist system we are going to have and what kind of world order that system requires. However controversial it may be to say this, our choice at the millennium seems to boil down to imperialism or barbarism. Half-measures of the type we have seen in various humanitarian interventions and in Kosovo represent the worst of both worlds. Better to grasp the nettle and accept that liberal imperialism may be the best we are going to do in these callous and sentimental times. Indeed, the real task for people who reject both realism and the utopian nihilism of a left that would prefer to see genocide in Bosnia and the mass deportation of the Kosovars rather than strengthen, however marginally, the hegemony of the United States, is to try to humanize this new imperial order-assuming it can come into being-and to curb the excesses that it will doubtless produce. The alternative is not liberation, or the triumph of some global consensus of conscience, but, to paraphrase Che Guevara, one, two, three, many Kosovos.<br />

<span class="Underline">Societies should get worried when Wagner’s music becomes popular because it usually means that distorted interpretations of Nietzsche’s philosophy are not far away. Existentialists create problems about what is, especially identity (Heidegger 1947). Existentialism inevitably leads to an authoritarian worldview: this, my Dionysian world of the eternally self-creating, the eternally self-destroying, this mystery world of twofold voluptuous delight, my “beyond good and evil,” without a goal, unless the joy of the circle itself is a goal; without will, unless a ring feels good will towards itself – do you want a name for this world? A solution to all its riddles? A light for you, too, you best-concealed, strongest, most intrepid, most midnightly men? – This world is the will to power – and nothing besides! And you yourselves are also this will to power – and nothing besides! (Nietzsche 1967/1997). Armed with a volume of Nietzsche, some considerable oratory skills, several Wagner records, and an existentialist University Rector in the form of Martin Heidegger, Hitler managed some truly astounding feats of strategic identity engineering (cf. Bullock, 1991). Upon being appointed to the Freiberg University, Heidegger pronounced the end of thought, history, ideology, and civilisation: ‘No dogmas and ideas will any longer be the laws of your being. The Fuhrer himself, and he alone, is the present and future reality for Germany’ (in Bullock 1991: 345). Heidegger signed up to an ideology-free politics: Hitler’s ‘Third Way’ (Eatwell 1997). The idealised identity, the new symbol of mythological worship, Nietzsche’s European Superman, was to rule from that day hence. Hitler took control of the means of propaganda: the media; the means of mental production: the education system; the means of violence: the police, army, and prison system; and pandered to the means of material production: industry and agriculture; and proclaimed a New beginning and a New world order. He ordered Germany to look forward into the next thousand years and forget the past. Heidegger and existentialism remain influential to this day, and history remains bunk (e.g. Giddens , 1991, Chapt. 2).Giddens’s claims that ‘humans live in circumstances of … existential contradiction’, and that ‘subjective death’ and ‘biological death’ are somehow unrelated, is a an ultimately repressive abstraction: from that perspective, life is merely a series of subjective deaths, as if death were the ultimate motor of life itself (cf. Adorno 1964/1973). History is, in fact, the simple and straightforward answer to the “problem of the subject”. “The problem” is also a handy device for confusing, entertaining, and selling trash to the masses. By emphasising the problem of the ‘ontological self’ (Giddens 1991: 49), informationalism and ‘consumerism’ confines the navel-gazing, ‘narcissistic’ masses to a permanent present which they self-consciously sacrifice for a Utopian future (cf. Adorno 1973: 303; Hitchens 1999; Lasch 1984: 25-59). Meanwhile transnational businesses go about their work, raping the environment; swindling each other and whole nations; and inflicting populations with declining wages, declining working conditions, and declining social security. Slavery is once again on the increase (Castells, 1998; Graham, 1999; ILO, 1998). There is no “problem of the subject”, just as there is no “global society”; there is only the mass amnesia of utopian propaganda, the strains of which have historically accompanied revolutions in communication technologies. Each person’s identity is, quite simply, their subjective account of a unique and objective history of interactions within the objective social and material environments they inhabit, create, and inherit. The identity of each person is their most intimate historical information, and they are its material expression: each person is a record of their own history at any given time. Thus, each person is a recognisably material, identifiable entity: an identity. This is their condition. People are not theoretical entities; they are people. As such, they have an intrinsic identity with an intrinsic value. No amount of theory or propaganda will make it go away. The widespread multilateral attempts to prop up consumer society and hypercapitalism as a valid and useful means of sustainable growth, indeed, as the path to an inevitable, international democratic Utopia, are already showing their disatrous cracks. The “problem” of subjective death threatens to give way, once again, to unprecedented mass slaughter. The numbed condition of a narcissistic society, rooted in a permanent “now”, a blissful state of Heideggerian Dasein, threatens to wake up to a world in which “subjective death” and ontology are the least of all worries.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The permutation solves—the concept of the frontier can never be rejected but we can reshape it to encourage cultural harmony and intellectual expansion</span><br />
<span class="Underline">BILLINGS 1997 (Linda Billings is a doctoral student in the Department of Communication Studies, Indiana University, “Frontier Days in Space: Are They Over?” Space Policy, August)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Patricia Nelson Limerick has recommended that the space community abandon the frontier metaphor. But at the same time she acknowledges that it is 'an enormously persistent and determining pattern of thought'. Ultimately, it may not be feasible to expunge the frontier metaphor from the public discourse about space exploration. But it certainly is possible, and practical, to re-examine it as a motivating force for space exploration. What is the space frontier? It might be useful to think of the space frontier as a vast and distant sort of Brazilian rainforest, Atacama Desert, Antarctic continent a great unknown that challenges humans to think creatively and expansively, to push their capabilities to the limits, a wild and beautiful place to be studied and enjoyed but left unsullied. Curiosity is what brought humans out of caves, took them across oceans and continents, compelled them to invent aeroplanes and now draws them towards the stars. The broad, deep public value of exploring the universe is the value of discovery, learning and understanding; thus the space frontier could be a school for social research, a place where new societies could grow and thrive. This is the space frontier: the vast, perhaps endless frontier of intellectual and spiritual potential. Consider the popularity of director Ron Howard's film Apollo 13. What appealed to audiences about this story was that it was about danger, risk, challenges, hard work, human ingenuity, turning failure to success, life triumphing over death. In his turn of the century essay, 'The moral equivalent of war', American philosopher William James wrote that 'without risks or prizes for the darer, history would be insipid indeed'. Space exploration offers tremendous opportunities to take extraordinary risks and thus it promises great challenges to the human mind and spirit. Intellectual and spiritual growth are more than worthy goals of future space exploration efforts.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">One is also required to ask: If war is &quot;not the answer,&quot; what exactly is the question? I wonder if, in her long interludes of geopolitical analysis, Ms. Crow even asks herself that. Perhaps if she did -- let's say the question is about the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists -- we might have an inkling about what her &quot;answer&quot; might actually be. Mercifully, Ms. Crow provides us with what she believes is an argument. Are you sitting down? Here it comes: &quot;I think war is based in greed and there are huge karmic retributions that will follow. I think war is never the answer to solving any problems. The best way to solve problems is to not have enemies.&quot; Let's take this bit by bit. &quot;War is based in greed.&quot; Some wars, surely. The pirate wars of the 17th century. Saddam's incursion into Kuwait. Early British forays in the Far East and India. But all wars? The United States' intervention in the Second World War? The Wars of Religion in the 17th century? Many wars are fueled by nationalism, or by ideology, or by expansionism . And many wars have seen their protagonists not enriched but impoverished. Take Britain's entry into the war against Nazi Germany. It would have been far more lucrative for the Brits to have made a deal with Hitler, to preserve their wealth and empire. Instead, they waged war, lost their entire imperial project and ransacked their own domestic wealth. Where would that fit into Ms. Crow's worldview? And then there's the concept of a just war -- wars that have to be fought to defeat a greater evil. Wars of self-defense. Wars of prevention. Wars against tyrants. Ms. Crow's remarks seem to acknowledge no such distinction. Does she believe that removing Hitler from power solved nothing? That preventing further genocide in the Balkans solved nothing? That ending 50 years of Soviet tyranny meant nothing? Apparently so. There's only one word for this kind of argument: Asinine. Then we have this wonderful insight: &quot;The best way to solve problems is to not have enemies.&quot; Wow. Like, wow. Like, war. It's bad. Bad karma. But, ahem, what if you have no choice in the matter? What if an enemy decides, out of hatred or fanaticism or ideology, simply to attack you? I'm not sure where Ms. Crow was on Sept. 11, 2001. But the enemy made its point palpably clear. Does wishing that these crazed religious nuts were not our enemies solve any problems? I'm taking her too seriously, of course. I should ignore her. But the &quot;antiwar&quot; movement (I put it in quotation marks because any kind of appeasement this time will only make a bloodier future war inevitable) is happy to use celebrities for its own purposes. And so their presence in the debate has to be acknowledged, if only to be decried. So let's decry this moronic celebrity convergence. The weak arguments of the appease-Saddam left just got a little weaker. And the karmic retributions are gonna be harsh, man. Way harsh. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change.As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved - perhaps even unrecognized - only to fester more ominously into the future. And such problems (ecological crisis, poverty,urban decay, spread of infectious diseases, technological displacement of workers) cannot be understood outside the larger social and global context of internationalized markets, finance, and communications. Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or side-step these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impo-tence. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to theincreasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions.74 In the meantime, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The unyielding truth is that, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the United States, it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies. This last point demands further elaboration. Theshrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehowdisappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people's lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites - an already familiar dynamic in many lesser-developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world, not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a reassertion of politics in more virulent guise - or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collec-tive interests that had vanished from civil society.75</span><br />

A focus on discourse destroys social change by ignoring political and material constraints<br />
Taft-Kaufman, 95 (Jill, professor, Department of Speech Communication And Dramatic Arts, at Central Michigan University, Southern Communication Journal, Spring, proquest)<br />
The postmodern passwords of &quot;polyvocality,&quot; &quot;Otherness,&quot; and &quot;difference,&quot; unsupported by substantial analysis of the concrete contexts of subjects, creates a solipsistic quagmire. The political sympathies of the new cultural critics, with their ostensible concern for the lack of power experienced by marginalized people, aligns them with the political left. Yet, despite their adversarial posture and talk of opposition, their discourses on intertextuality and inter-referentiality isolate them from and ignore the conditions that have produced leftist politics--conflict, racism, poverty, and injustice. In short, as Clarke (1991) asserts, postmodern emphasis on new subjects conceals the old subjects, those who have limited access to good jobs, food, housing, health care, and transportation, as well as to the media that depict them. Merod (1987) decries this situation as one which leaves no vision, will, or commitment to activism. He notes that academic lip service to the oppositional is underscored by the absence of focused collective or politically active intellectual communities. Provoked by the academic manifestations of this problem Di Leonardo (1990) echoes Merod and laments: Has there ever been a historical era characterized by as little radical analysis or activism and as much radical-chic writing as ours? Maundering on about Otherness: phallocentrism or Eurocentric tropes has become a lazy academic substitute for actual engagement with the detailed histories and contemporary realities of Western racial minorities, white women, or any Third World population. (p. 530) Clarke's assessment of the postmodern elevation of language to the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of critical discussion is an even stronger indictment against the trend. Clarke examines Lyotard's (1984) The Postmodern Condition in which Lyotard maintains that virtually all social relations are linguistic, and, therefore, it is through the coercion that threatens speech that we enter the &quot;realm of terror&quot; and society falls apart. To this assertion, Clarke replies: I can think of few more striking indicators of the political and intellectual impoverishment of a view of society that can only recognize the discursive. If the worst terror we can envisage is the threat not to be allowed to speak, we are appallingly ignorant of terror in its elaborate contemporary forms. It may be the intellectual's conception of terror (what else do we do but speak?), but its projection onto the rest of the world would be calamitous....(pp. 2-27) The realm of the discursive is derived from the requisites for human life, which are in the physical world, rather than in a world of ideas or symbols.(4) Nutrition, shelter, and protection are basic human needs that require collective activity for their fulfillment. Postmodern emphasis on the discursive without an accompanying analysis of how the discursive emerges from material circumstances hides the complex task of envisioning and working towards concrete social goals (Merod, 1987). Although the material conditions that create the situation of marginality escape the purview of the postmodernist, the situation and its consequences are not overlooked by scholars from marginalized groups. Robinson (1990) for example, argues that &quot;the justice that working people deserve is economic, not just textual&quot; (p. 571). Lopez (1992) states that &quot;the starting point for organizing the program content of education or political action must be the present existential, concrete situation&quot; (p. 299). West (1988) asserts that borrowing French post-structuralist discourses about &quot;Otherness&quot; blinds us to realities of American difference going on in front of us (p. 170). Unlike postmodern &quot;textual radicals&quot; who Rabinow (1986) acknowledges are &quot;fuzzy about power and the realities of socioeconomic constraints&quot; (p. 255), most writers from marginalized groups are clear about how discourse interweaves with the concrete circumstances that create lived experience. People whose lives form the material for postmodern counter-hegemonic discourse do not share the optimism over the new recognition of their discursive subjectivities, because such an acknowledgment does not address sufficiently their collective historical and current struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic injustice. They do not appreciate being told they are living in a world in which there are no more real subjects. Ideas have consequences. Emphasizing the discursive self when a person is hungry and homeless represents both a cultural and humane failure. The need to look beyond texts to the perception and attainment of concrete social goals keeps writers from marginalized groups ever-mindful of the specifics of how power works through political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.<br />

Johan Norberg, In Defense of Global Capitalism, pg. 98<br />

Capitalism is not a perfect system, and it is not good for everyone all the time. Critics of globalization are good at pointing out individual harms—a factory that has closed down, a wage that has been reduced. Such things do happen, but by concentrating solely on individual instances, one may miss the larger reality of how a political or economic system generally works and what fantastic values it confers on the great majority compared with other alternatives. Problems are found in every political and economic system, but rejecting all systems is not an option. Hunting down negative examples of what can happen in a market economy is easy enough. By that method water or fire can be proved to be bad things, because some people drown and some get burned to death, but this isn't the full picture. A myopic focus on capitalism's imperfections ignores the freedom and independence that it confers on people who have never experienced anything but oppression. It also disregards the calm and steady progress that is the basic rule of a society with a market economy. There is nothing wrong with identifying problems and mishaps in a predominantly successful system if one does so with the constructive intent of rectifying or alleviating them. But someone who condemns the system as such is obligated to answer this question: What political and economic system could manage things better? Never before in human history has prosperity grown so rapidly and poverty declined so heavily. Is there any evidence, either in history or in the world around us, to suggest that another system could do as well?<br />

<br />
First, trade and globalization have reinforced the trend toward democracy, and democracies don't pick fights with each other. Freedom to trade nurtures democracy by expanding the middle class in globalizing countries and equipping people with tools of communication such as cell phones, satellite TV, and the Internet. With trade comes more travel, more contact with people in other countries, and more exposure to new ideas. Thanks in part to globalization, almost two thirds of the world's countries today are democracies -- a record high. Second, as national economies become more integrated with each other, those nations have more to lose should war break out. War in a globalized world not only means human casualties and bigger government, but also ruptured trade and investment ties that impose lasting damage on the economy. In short, globalization has dramatically raised the economic cost of war. Third, globalization allows nations to acquire wealth through production and trade rather than conquest of territory and resources. Increasingly, wealth is measured in terms of intellectual property, financial assets, and human capital. Those are assets that cannot be seized by armies. If people need resources outside their national borders, say oil or timber or farm products, they can acquire them peacefully by trading away what they can produce best at home. Of course, free trade and globalization do not guarantee peace. Hot-blooded nationalism and ideological fervor can overwhelm cold economic calculations. But deep trade and investment ties among nations make war less attractive. Trade wars in the 1930s deepened the economic depression, exacerbated global tensions, and helped to usher in a world war. Out of the ashes of that experience, the United States urged Germany, France, and other Western European nations to form a common market that has become the European Union. In large part because of their intertwined economies, a general war in Europe is now unthinkable.<br />

Environmentalists and globalization foes are united in their fear that greater population and consumption of energy, materials, and chemicals accompanying economic growth, technological change and free trade—the mainstays of globalization—degrade human and environmental well-being. Indeed, the 20th century saw the United States’ population multiply by four, income by seven, carbon dioxide emissions by nine, use of materials by 27, and use of chemicals by more than 100. Yet life expectancy increased from 47 years to 77 years. Onset of major disease such as cancer, heart, and respiratory disease has been postponed between eight and eleven years in the past century. Heart disease and cancer rates have been in rapid decline over the last two decades, and total cancer deaths have actually declined the last two years, despite increases in population. Among the very young, infant mortality has declined from 100 deaths per 1,000 births in 1913 to just seven per 1,000 today. These improvements haven’t been restricted to the United States. It’s a global phenomenon. Worldwide, life expectancy has more than doubled, from 31 years in 1900 to 67 years today. India’s and China’s infant mortalities exceeded 190 per 1,000 births in the early 1950s; today they are 62 and 26, respectively. In the developing world, the proportion of the population suffering from chronic hunger declined from 37 percent to 17 percent between 1970 and 2001 despite a 83 percent increase in population. Globally average annual incomes in real dollars have tripled since 1950. Consequently, the proportion of the planet's developing-world population living in absolute poverty has halved since 1981, from 40 percent to 20 percent. Child labor in low income countries declined from 30 percent to 18 percent between 1960 and 2003. Equally important, the world is more literate and better educated than ever. People are freer politically, economically, and socially to pursue their well-being as they see fit. More people choose their own rulers, and have freedom of expression. They are more likely to live under rule of law, and less likely to be arbitrarily deprived of life, limb, and property. Social and professional mobility have also never been greater. It’s easier than ever for people across the world to transcend the bonds of caste, place, gender, and other accidents of birth. People today work fewer hours and have more money and better health to enjoy their leisure time than their ancestors. Man’s environmental record is more complex. The early stages of development can indeed cause some environmental deterioration as societies pursue first-order problems affecting human well-being. These include hunger, malnutrition, illiteracy, and lack of education, basic public health services, safe water, sanitation, mobility, and ready sources of energy. Because greater wealth alleviates these problems while providing basic creature comforts, individuals and societies initially focus on economic development, often neglecting other aspects of environmental quality. In time, however, they recognize that environmental deterioration reduces their quality of life. Accordingly, they put more of their recently acquired wealth and human capital into developing and implementing cleaner technologies. This brings about an environmental transition via the twin forces of economic development and technological progress, which begin to provide solutions to environmental problems instead of creating those problems. All of which is why we today find that the richest countries are also the cleanest. And while many developing countries have yet to get past the “green ceiling,” they are nevertheless ahead of where today’s developed countries used to be when they were equally wealthy. The point of transition from &quot;industrial period&quot; to &quot;environmental conscious&quot; continues to fall. For example, the US introduced unleaded gasoline only after its GDP per capita exceeded $16,000. India and China did the same before they reached $3,000 per capita. This progress is a testament to the power of globalization and the transfer of ideas and knowledge (that lead is harmful, for example). It's also testament to the importance of trade in transferring technology from developed to developing countries—in this case, the technology needed to remove lead from gasoline. This hints at the answer to the question of why some parts of the world have been left behind while the rest of the world has thrived. Why have improvements in well-being stalled in areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world? The proximate cause of improvements in well-being is a “cycle of progress” composed of the mutually reinforcing forces of economic development and technological progress. But that cycle itself is propelled by a web of essential institutions, particularly property rights, free markets, and rule of law. Other important institutions would include science- and technology-based problem-solving founded on skepticism and experimentation; receptiveness to new technologies and ideas; and freer trade in goods, services—most importantly in knowledge and ideas. In short, free and open societies prosper. Isolation, intolerance, and hostility to the free exchange of knowledge, technology, people, and goods breed stagnation or regression.<br />

Badiou’s system fails—he has no way to overcome the enormous power he attributes to capitalism.<br />
Brown, 04 (Nicholas, University of Illinois at Chicago, Or, Alain Badiou and Slavoj Žižek, Waiting for Something to Happen, CR: The New Centennial Review 4.3 (2004) 289-319).<br />
<br />
But what is strange is the vehemence with which Badiou maintains his distance from the economic—from what classical Marxism called the &quot;base,&quot; the elements of a situation that pertain to its own reproduction. It is perfectly orthodox to say that there can be no purely economic intervention in the economy: even with the best intentions, the World Bank could not solve the problem of Third World poverty. However, in Badiou's system the economy is not merely reduced to one aspect among many, but actively dismissed from consideration. Material reproduction is reduced to the sneering Lacanian contempt for &quot;le service des biens,&quot; the servicing of goods which pertains to the human animal beneath good and evil. Why should Badiou fully endorse Marx's analysis of the world economy (&quot;there is no need for a revision of Marxism itself,&quot; [Ethics, 97]) while keeping Marx's entire problematic at arm's length? In fact, capitalism is the point of impasse in Badiou's own system, the problem which cannot be actively thought without grave danger to the system as a whole. Capital's great power, the tremendous ease with which it colonizes (geographic, cultural, psychic) territory, is precisely that it seizes situations at their evental site. In their paraphrase of a brilliant but much-maligned passage in Marx's Grundrisse, Deleuze and Guattari insist that &quot;capitalism has haunted all forms of society, but it haunts them as their terrifying nightmare, it is the dread they feel of a flow that would elude their codes.&quot;2 Is this flow that eludes every society's codes not identical with generic multiplicity, the void which, eluding every representation, nonetheless haunts every situation? Does not capitalism make its entry at a society's point of impasse—social relations already haunted by variously dissimulated exploitation—and revolutionize them into the capital-labor relation? A safely non-Orientalist version of this would be the eruption from modernist art's evental site—the art market, which belonged to the situation of modernism while being excluded from its represented state—of what we might call the &quot;Warhol-event,&quot; which inaugurates the transition from the formal to the real subsumption of (artistic) labor under Capital. It makes perfect sense to say that this transition is the truth of the [End Page 308] Warhol-event. As we saw earlier, the real subsumption of labor under Capital, the conversion of every relation into a monetary relation, is the origin of formal equality: that is, the foundation of universalism. And far from pertaining to mere animal life beneath the level of the truth-procedure, capitalism itself fits perfectly the form of the revolutionary Event. It would then appear that capitalism is, like religion, eliminated from the art-politics-science-love series only by fiat. And why is this? Because the economic, the &quot;servicing of goods,&quot; cannot enter Badiou's system without immediately assuming the status of a cause. Excluded from direct consideration, capitalism as a condition of set theory is perfectly innocuous; its preconditional status belongs to a different order than what it conditions. It opens up a mode of presentation, but what is presented existed all along: look at Paul, for example. But included as the product of a truth-procedure, capitalism immediately appears as the basis for all the others: it is, in fact, the revolutionary irruption of Capital (in whatever society) that conditions any modern process of science, art, love, or politics. If Badiou's system were to consider capitalism directly, some elements, those pertaining to the &quot;base,&quot; would appear to have more weight than others—the &quot;superstructure.&quot; The effects of such an inclusion of capitalism in Badiou's system—an inclusion which nothing prevents—would be catastrophic. Radical universality (as opposed to the historically conditioned universality imposed by the emergence of capitalism) would become unthinkable. The &quot;eternity&quot; of truth would yield to historicism.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Badiou, his great enemy of capitalism fits perfectly within what he considers a truth event—the alternative merely re-creates the status quo.<br />
Brown, 04 (Nicholas, University of Illinois at Chicago, Or, Alain Badiou and Slavoj Žižek, Waiting for Something to Happen, CR: The New Centennial Review 4.3 (2004) 289-319).<br />
<br />
Badiou cannot think Capital precisely because Capital has already thought Badiou. And let's face it: despite Badiou's inspiring presentation, nothing is more native to capitalism than his basic narrative matrix. The violent seizure of the subject by an idea, fidelity to it in the absence of any guarantee, and ultimate transformation of the state of the situation: these are the elements of the narrative of entrepreneurial risk, &quot;revolutionary innovation,&quot; the &quot;transformation of the industry,&quot; and so on. In pushing away material reproduction, Badiou merely adapts this narrative to the needs of intellectuals, who, in Badiou's conception, have a monopoly over much of the field of truth.<br />

 <span class="Underline">A focus on representations destroys social change by ignoring political and material constraints</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Taft-Kaufman, 95 (Jill, professor, Department of Speech Communication And Dramatic Arts, at Central Michigan University, Southern Communication Journal, Spring, proquest)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The postmodern passwords of &quot;polyvocality,&quot; &quot;Otherness,&quot; and &quot;difference,&quot; unsupported by substantial analysis of the concrete contexts of subjects, creates a solipsistic quagmire. The political sympathies of the new cultural critics, with their ostensible concern for the lack of power experienced by marginalized people, aligns them with the political left. Yet, despite their adversarial posture and talk of opposition, their discourses on intertextuality and inter-referentiality isolate them from and ignore the conditions that have produced leftist politics--conflict, racism, poverty, and injustice. In short, as Clarke (1991) asserts, postmodern emphasis on new subjects conceals the old subjects, those who have limited access to good jobs, food, housing, health care, and transportation, as well as to the media that depict them. Merod (1987) decries this situation as one which leaves no vision, will, or commitment to activism. He notes that academic lip service to the oppositional is underscored by the absence of focused collective or politically active intellectual communities. Provoked by the academic manifestations of this problem Di Leonardo (1990) echoes Merod and laments: Has there ever been a historical era characterized by as little radical analysis or activism and as much radical-chic writing as ours? Maundering on about Otherness: phallocentrism or Eurocentric tropes has become a lazy academic substitute for actual engagement with the detailed histories and contemporary realities of Western racial minorities, white women, or any Third World population. (p. 530) Clarke's assessment of the postmodern elevation of language to the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of critical discussion is an even stronger indictment against the trend. Clarke examines Lyotard's (1984) The Postmodern Condition in which Lyotard maintains that virtually all social relations are linguistic, and, therefore, it is through the coercion that threatens speech that we enter the &quot;realm of terror&quot; and society falls apart. To this assertion, Clarke replies: I can think of few more striking indicators of the political and intellectual impoverishment of a view of society that can only recognize the discursive. If the worst terror we can envisage is the threat not to be allowed to speak, we are appallingly ignorant of terror in its elaborate contemporary forms. It may be the intellectual's conception of terror (what else do we do but speak?), but its projection onto the rest of the world would be calamitous....(pp. 2-27) The realm of the discursive is derived from the requisites for human life, which are in the physical world, rather than in a world of ideas or symbols.(4) Nutrition, shelter, and protection are basic human needs that require collective activity for their fulfillment. Postmodern emphasis on the discursive without an accompanying analysis of how the discursive emerges from material circumstances hides the complex task of envisioning and working towards concrete social goals (Merod, 1987). Although the material conditions that create the situation of marginality escape the purview of the postmodernist, the situation and its consequences are not overlooked by scholars from marginalized groups. Robinson (1990) for example, argues that &quot;the justice that working people deserve is economic, not just textual&quot; (p. 571). Lopez (1992) states that &quot;the starting point for organizing the program content of education or political action must be the present existential, concrete situation&quot; (p. 299). West (1988) asserts that borrowing French post-structuralist discourses about &quot;Otherness&quot; blinds us to realities of American difference going on in front of us (p. 170). Unlike postmodern &quot;textual radicals&quot; who Rabinow (1986) acknowledges are &quot;fuzzy about power and the realities of socioeconomic constraints&quot; (p. 255), most writers from marginalized groups are clear about how discourse interweaves with the concrete circumstances that create lived experience. People whose lives form the material for postmodern counter-hegemonic discourse do not share the optimism over the new recognition of their discursive subjectivities, because such an acknowledgment does not address sufficiently their collective historical and current struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic injustice. They do not appreciate being told they are living in a world in which there are no more real subjects. Ideas have consequences. Emphasizing the discursive self when a person is hungry and homeless represents both a cultural and humane failure. The need to look beyond texts to the perception and attainment of concrete social goals keeps writers from marginalized groups ever-mindful of the specifics of how power works through political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">We shall not speculate here as to the “how and when” of human extinction; rather, we ask why there remains so little discussion of this important topic. We hypothesise that a lethal mix of ignorance and denial is blinding humans from the realization that our own species could soon (a relative concept, admittedly) be as endangered as many other large mammals (Cardillo et al. 2004). For notwithstanding the “overgrown Petri dish” model of human decline now confronting us, the most sinister menace that we face may not be extrinsic selection pressures but complacency. Entrenched in our culture is a knee-jerk “boy who cried wolf ” skepticism aimed at any person who voices concerns about the future—a skepticism fed by a traditionally bullish, growth-addicted economy that eschews caution (Table 1). But the facts of extinction are less exciting and newsworthy than the roller-coaster booms and busts of stock markets.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Two paths lie before us. One leads to death, the other to life. If we choose the first path – if we numbly refuse to acknowledge the nearness of extinction, all the while increasing our preparations to bring it about – then we will in effect become the allies of death and in everything we do our attachment to life will weaken: our vision, blinded to the abyss that has opened at our feet, will dim and grow confused; our will, discouraged by the thought of trying to build on such a precarious foundation anything that is meant to last, will slacken, and we will sink into stupefaction as though we were gradually weaning ourselves from life in preparing from the end.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The second assertion made by supporters of the quality of life as a criterion for decision- making is closely related to the first, but with an added dimension. This assertion suggests that the determination of the value of the quality of a given life is a subjective determi-nation to be made by the person experiencing that life. The important addition here is that the decision is a personal one that, ideally, ought not to be made externally by another person but internally by the individual involved. Katherine Lewis made this decision for herself based on a comparison between two stages of her life. So did James Brady. Without this element, decisions based on quality of life criteria lack salient information and the patients concerned cannot give informed consent. Patients must be given the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they think their lives are worth living or not. To ignore or overlook patients’ judgement in this matter is to violate their autonomy and their freedom to decide for themselves on the basis of relevant informa- tion about their future, and comparative con- sideration of their past. As the deontological position puts it so well, to do so is to violate the imperative that we must treat persons as rational and as ends in themselves. It is important to remember the subjectiv-ity assertion in this context, so as to empha-size that the judgement made about the value of a life ought to be made only by the person concerned and not by others.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Even before the rise of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, the way for the gruesome Nazi Holocaust of human extermination and cruel butchery was being prepared in the 1930 German Weimar Republic through the medical establishment and philosophical elite's adoption of the &quot;quality of life&quot; concept in place of the &quot;sanctity of life.&quot; The Nuremberg trials, exposing the horrible Nazi war crimes, revealed that Germany's trend toward atrocity began with their progressive embrace of the Hegelian doctrine of &quot;rational utility,&quot; where an individual's worth is in relation to their contribution to the state, rather than determined in light of traditional moral, ethical and religious values. This gradual transformation of national public opinion, promulgated through media and education, was described in an article written by the British commentator Malcolm Muggeridge entitled &quot;The Humane Holocaust&quot; and in an article written by former United States Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, M.D., entitled &quot;The Slide to Auschwitz,&quot; both published in The Human Life Review, 1977 and 1980 respectively. Muggeridge stated: &quot;Near at hand, we have been accorded, for those that have eyes to see, an object lesson in what the quest for 'quality of life' without reference to 'sanctity of life' can involve ... [namely] the great Nazi Holocaust, whose TV presentation has lately been harrowing viewers throughout the Western world. In this televised version, an essential consideration has been left out – namely, that the origins of the Holocaust lay, not in Nazi terrorism and anti-Semitism, but in pre-Nazi Weimar Germany's acceptance of euthanasia and mercy-killing as humane and estimable. ... &quot;It took no more than three decades to transform a war crime into an act of compassion, thereby enabling the victors in the war against Nazism to adopt the very practices for which the Nazis had been solemnly condemned at Nuremberg.&quot; The transformation followed thus: The concept that the elderly and terminally ill should have the right to die was promoted in books, newspapers, literature and even entertainment films, the most popular of which were entitled &quot;Ich klage an (I accuse)&quot; and &quot;Mentally Ill.&quot; </span><br />
<span class="Underline">One euthanasia movie, based on a novel by a National Socialist doctor, actually won a prize at the world-famous Venice Film Festival! Extreme hardship cases were cited, which increasingly convinced the public to morally approve of euthanasia. The medical profession gradually grew accustomed to administering death to patients who, for whatever reasons, felt their low &quot;quality of life&quot; rendered their lives not worth living, or as it was put, lebensunwerten Lebens, (life unworthy of life). In an Associated Press release published in the New York Times Oct. 10, 1933, entitled &quot;Nazi Plan to Kill Incurables to End Pain; German Religious Groups Oppose Move,&quot; it was stated: &quot;The Ministry of Justice, in a detailed memorandum explaining the Nazi aims regarding the German penal code, today announced its intentions to authorize physicians to end the sufferings of the incurable patient. The memorandum ... proposed that it shall be possible for physicians to end the tortures of incurable patients, upon request, in the interest of true humanity. &quot;This proposed legal recognition of euthanasia – the act of providing a painless and peaceful death – raised a number of fundamental problems of a religious, scientific and legal nature. The Catholic newspaper Germania hastened to observe: 'The Catholic faith binds the conscience of its followers not to accept this method.' ... In Lutheran circles, too, life is regarded as something that God alone can take. ... Euthanasia ... has become a widely discussed word in the Reich. ... No life still valuable to the State will be wantonly destroyed.&quot; Nationalized health care and government involvement in medical care promised to improve the public's &quot;quality of life.&quot; Unfortunately, the cost of maintaining government medical care was a contributing factor to the growth of the national debt, which reached astronomical proportions. Double and triple digit inflation crippled the economy, resulting in the public demanding that government cut expenses. This precipitated the 1939 order to cut federal expenses. The national socialist government decided to remove &quot;useless&quot; expenses from the budget, which included the support and medical costs required to maintain the lives of the retarded, insane, senile, epileptic, psychiatric patients, handicapped, deaf, blind, the non-rehabilitatable ill and those who had been diseased or chronically ill for five years or more. It was labeled an &quot;act of mercy&quot; to &quot;liberate them through death,&quot; as they were viewed as having an extremely low &quot;quality of life,&quot; as well as being a tax burden on the public. The public psyche was conditioned for this, as even school math problems compared distorted medical costs incurred by the taxpayer of caring for and rehabilitating the chronically sick with the cost of loans to newly married couples for new housing units. The next whose lives were terminated by the state were the institutionalized elderly who had no relatives and no financial resources. These lonely, forsaken individuals were needed by no one and would be missed by no one. Their &quot;quality of life&quot; was considered low by everyone's standards, and they were a tremendous tax burden on the economically distressed state. The next to be eliminated were the parasites on the state: the street people, bums, beggars, hopelessly poor, gypsies, prisoners, inmates and convicts. These were socially disturbing individuals incapable of providing for themselves whose &quot;quality of life&quot; was considered by the public as irreversibly below standard, in addition to the fact that they were a nuisance to society and a seed-bed for crime. The liquidation grew to include those who had been unable to work, the socially unproductive and those living on welfare or government pensions. They drew financial support from the state, but contributed nothing financially back. They were looked upon as &quot;useless eaters,&quot; leeches, stealing from those who worked hard to pay the taxes to support them. Their unproductive lives were a burden on the &quot;quality of life&quot; of those who had to pay the taxes. The next to be eradicated were the ideologically unwanted, the political enemies of the state, religious extremists and those &quot;disloyal&quot; individuals considered to be holding the government back from producing a society which functions well and provides everyone a better &quot;quality of life.&quot; The moving biography of the imprisoned Dietrich Bonhoffer chronicled the injustices. These individuals also were a source of &quot;human experimental material,&quot; allowing military medical research to be carried on with human tissue, thus providing valuable information that promised to improve the nation's health. Finally, justifying their actions on the purported theory of evolution, the Nazis considered the German, or &quot;Aryan,&quot; race as &quot;ubermenschen,&quot; supermen, being more advanced in the supposed progress of human evolution. This resulted in the twisted conclusion that all other races, and in particular the Jewish race, were less evolved and needed to be eliminated from the so-called &quot;human gene pool,&quot; ensuring that future generations of humans would have a higher &quot;quality of life.&quot; Dr. Koop stated: &quot;The first step is followed by the second step. You can say that if the first step is moral then whatever follows must be moral. The important thing, however, is this: Whether you diagnose the first step as being one worth taking or being one that is precarious rests entirely on what the second step is likely to be. ... I am concerned about this because when the first 273,000 German aged, infirm and retarded were killed in gas chambers there was no outcry from that medical profession either, and it was not far from there to Auschwitz.&quot; Can this holocaust happen in America? Indeed, it has already begun. The idea of killing a person and calling it &quot;death with dignity&quot; is an oxymoron. The &quot;mercy-killing&quot; movement puts us on the same path as pre-Nazi Germany. The &quot;quality of life&quot; concept, which eventually results in the Hegelian utilitarian attitude of a person's worth being based on their contribution toward perpetuating big government, is in stark contrast to America's founding principles. This philosophy which lowers the value of human life, shocked attendees at the Governor's Commission on Disability, in Concord, N.H., Oct. 5, 2001, as they heard the absurd comments of Princeton University professor Peter Singer. The Associated Press reported Singer's comments: &quot;I do think that it is sometimes appropriate to kill a human infant,&quot; he said, adding that he does not believe a newborn has a right to life until it reaches some minimum level of consciousness. &quot;For me, the relevant question is, what makes it so seriously wrong to take a life?&quot; Singer asked. &quot;Those of you who are not vegetarians are responsible for taking a life every time you eat. Species is no more relevant than race in making these judgments.&quot; Singer's views, if left unchecked, could easily lead to a repeat of the atrocities of Nazi Germany, if not something worse.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Most states are indeed strongly inclined to seek power. Pursuing goals other than the national interest defined in terms of power often is dangerous, even counterproductive. But even Morgenthau's case for these lesser (although still important) claims is undermined by an exaggerated emphasis on a one-sided account of human nature. The pursuit of power, Morgenthau argues, is an inescapable consequence of the “elemental bio-psychological drives … to live, to propagate, and to dominate [that] are common to all men” (1948: 16–17). “All men lust for power” (1962a: 42). “Man's aspiration for power is not an accident of history; it is not a temporary deviation from a normal state of freedom; it is an all-permeating fact which is of the very essence of human existence” (1948: 312). This appeal to a natural will to power – “the animus dominandi, the desire for power” (1946: 192) – puts a particularly stark face on Morgenthau's realism. “It is this ubiquity of the desire for power which, besides and beyond any particular selfishness or other evil purpose, constitutes the ubiquity of evilness in human action” (1946: 194). Even if we could overcome the Hobbesian drives of competition, diffidence, and glory, we would still lust after power.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Moreover, keeping in mind the sobering lessons of the past century cannot but make us wary about humankind’s supposedly unlimited ability for problemsolving or discovering solutions in time to avert calamities. In fact, the historical track-record of last-minute, technical ‘quick-fixes’ is hardly reassuring. What’s more, most of the serious perils that we face today (e.g., nuclear waste, climate change, global terrorism, genocide and civil war) demand complex, sustained, long-term strategies of planning, coordination, and execution. On the other hand, an examination of fatalism makes it readily apparent that the idea that humankind is doomed from the outset puts off any attempt to minimize risks for our successors, essentially condemning them to face cataclysms unprepared. An a priori pessimism is also unsustainable given the fact that long-term preventive action has had (and will continue to have) appreciable beneficial effects; the examples of medical research, the welfare state, international humanitarian law, as well as strict environmental regulations in some countries stand out among many others. The evaluative framework proposed above should not be restricted to the critique of misappropriations of farsightedness, since it can equally support public deliberation with a reconstructive intent, that is, democratic discussion and debate about a future that human beings would freely self-determine. Inverting Foucault’s Nietzschean metaphor, we can think of genealogies of the future that could perform a farsighted mapping out of the possible ways of organizing social life. They are, in other words, interventions into the present intended to facilitate global civil society’s participation in shaping the field of possibilities of what is to come. Once competing dystopian visions are filtered out on the basis of their analytical credibility, ethical commitments, and political underpinnings and consequences, groups and individuals can assess the remaining legitimate catastrophic scenarios through the lens of genealogical mappings of the future. Hence, our first duty consists in addressing the present-day causes of eventual perils, ensuring that the paths we decide upon do not contract the range of options available for our posterity.42 Just as importantly, the practice of genealogically inspired farsightedness nurtures the project of an autonomous future, one that is socially self-instituting. In so doing, we can acknowledge that the future is a human creation instead of the product of metaphysical and extra-social forces (god, nature, destiny, etc.), and begin to reflect upon and deliberate about the kind of legacy we want to leave for those who will follow us. Participants in global civil society can then take – and in many instances have already taken – a further step by committing themselves to socio-political struggles forging a world order that, aside from not jeopardizing human and environmental survival, is designed to rectify the sources of transnational injustice that will continue to inflict needless suffering upon future generations if left unchallenged.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Fear spurs compassion, mobilizing people to protect each other and giving meaning to life.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Greenspan, 03 (Miriam Greenspan – Pioneer in the Area of Women’s Psychology – 2003 (“An Excerpt from Healing through the Dark Emotions: The Wisdom of Grief, Fear, and Despair by Miriam Greenspan,” www.spiritualityhealth.com/newsh/excerpts/bookreview/excp_5513.html)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">&quot;Fear is a very powerful emotion. When you feel fear in your body, it's helpful to relate to it as an energy that can be mobilized for life. It may feel like a constriction in your chest, throat, or abdomen. Breathe through it without judgment and allow yourself to feel it as a very strong force. If you pray for help, you can begin to expand this energy we call 'fear' and use it for healing and transformation. &quot;In this regard, we can take our model from the heroes of Flight 93 who. realizing that they were bound for death, stormed the plane and brought it down without hitting a civilian target. One cannot even imagine being able to do this without fear. Fear for the lives of others was the energy that mobilized them to do something meaningful with their last moments of life. Some of these people said good-bye to their husbands and wives and wished them happiness before they left this earth. They had found some peace in their last moments, peace in the midst of turbulence. And they found it through their last wish, which they heroically put into action: to help others live. &quot;Perhaps there is nothing that can redeem the dead but our own actions for the good. This is a time to find out what we want to do for the world and do it. And, as every trauma survivor knows, this is the way to make meaning out of pain, perhaps the most effective way: to draw something good out of evil. The heroes of September 11 point us to the choice we each have: to help create a state of global peace and justice that we, like they, will not see before we die. It is in giving ourselves to this vision, out of love for this world that we inhabit together, that we stand a chance of transcending the human proclivity to damage life. And that we honor those we have brought into this world and who must inherit it. . . . &quot;Our only protection is in our interconnectedness. This has always been the message of the dark emotions when they are experienced most deeply and widely. Grief is not just &quot;my&quot; grief; it is the grief of every motherless child, every witness to horror in the world. Despair is not just &quot;my&quot; despair; it is everyone's despair about life in the twentyfirst century. Fear is not just 'my' fear; it is everyone's fear — of anthrax, of nuclear war, of truck bombs, of airplane hijackings, of things falling apart, blowing up, sickening and dying. &quot;If fear is only telling you to save your own skin, there's not much hope for us. But the fact is that in conscious fear, there is a potentially revolutionary power of compassion and connection that can be mobilized en masse. This is the power of fear. Our collective fear, which is intelligent, is telling us now: Find new ways to keep this global village safe. Find new forms of international cooperation that will root out evil in ways that don't create more victims and more evil. Leap out of the confines of national egos. Learn the ways of peace. Find a ceremony of safety so that not just you and I but all of us can live together without fear.&quot; </span><br />

<span class="Underline">A healthy fear of death would be the fear of dying unprepared, as this is a fear we can do something about, a danger we can avert. If we have this realistic fear, this sense of danger, we are encouraged to prepare for a peaceful and successful death and are also inspired to make the most of our very precious human life instead of wasting it. This &quot;sense of danger&quot; inspires us to make preparations so that we are no longer in the danger we are in now, for example by practicing moral discipline, purifying our negative karma, and accumulating as much merit, or good karma, as possible. We put on a seat belt out of a sense of danger of the unseen dangers of traffic on the road, and that seat belt protects us from going through the windshield. We can do nothing about other traffic, but we can do something about whether or not we go through the windscreen if someone crashes into us. Similarly, we can do nothing about the fact of death, but we can seize control over how we prepare for death and how we die. Eventually, through Tantric spiritual practice, we can even attain a deathless body. In Living Meaningfully, Dying Joyfully, Geshe Kelsang says: Dying with regrets is not at all unusual. To avoid a sad and meaningless end to our life we need to remember continually that we too must die. Contemplating our own death will inspire us to use our life wisely by developing the inner refuge of spiritual realizations; otherwise we shall have no ability to protect ourself from the sufferings of death and what lies beyond. Moreover, when someone close to us is dying, such as a parent or friend, we shall be powerless to help them because we shall not know how; and we shall experience sadness and frustration at our inability to be of genuine help. Preparing for death is one of the kindest and wisest things we can do both for ourself and others. The fact of the matter is that this world is not our home. We are travelers, passing through. We came from our previous life, and in a few years, or a few days, we shall move on to our next life. We entered this world empty-handed and alone, and we shall leave empty-handed and alone. Everything we have accumulated in this life, including our very body, will be left behind. All that we can take with us from one life to the next are the imprints of the positive and negative actions we have created. If we ignore death we shall waste our life working for things that we shall only have to leave behind, creating many negative actions in the process, and having to travel on to our next life with nothing but a heavy burden of negative karma. On the other hand, if we base our life on a realistic awareness of our mortality, we shall regard our spiritual development as far more important than the attainments of this world, and we shall view our time in this world principally as an opportunity to cultivate positive minds such as patience, love, compassion, and wisdom. Motivated by these virtuous minds we shall perform many positive actions, thereby creating the cause for future happiness.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">In between these two extremes, deterrence is a security policy that offers a way forward for the United States that is not only more effective because more tailored, but is also more moral. It is more moral because a deterrent posture would entail a strategy that is more proportionate, more necessary, more responsive, and, ultimately, more just. Indeed, deterrence comports with the fundamental human intuition that it is generally only moral to ﬁght when attacked. In this it complies with the classical conception of just war, which mandates that wars only be conducted when one’s cause is just, waged by a legitimate authority, motivated by a right intent, fought with a real prospect of success, conducted proportionately, and undertaken only as a last resort. Deterrence satisﬁes these criteria. It is a defensive strategy that responds to invasions or attacks, and is therefore just; it sets out relatively clear guide- lines for when it mandates that the government ﬁght, and, therefore, is governed by legitimate authority. It is driven by a desire to protect, deter, and avenge, and is therefore motivated by right intent; its realistic red lines and threats are backed up by the awesome power of the United States, and therefore likely to succeed; and it responds when attacked and asks from the rest of the international community only respect for its marked out positions rather than revolutionary transformation, and is therefore propor- tional.22 Finally, by its nature it is undertaken as a last resort rather than preventively.23 It was the fundamental moral attractiveness of this position that continually frustrated both Soviet efforts to decouple Europe from the Amer- ican nuclear umbrella during the Cold War and occasional American efforts to roll back the Soviet empire. But theorizing about war and peace cannot remain at the level of abstraction. It must bear moral responsibility for actual consequence and the power of contingency, as Max Weber pointed out.24 And deterrence, defense by calculation, uniquely satisﬁes the moral requirement that leaders, whatever their benevolent intentions, are basically responsible for the consequences that contingency produces from their actions. This it does by grounding a nation’s security on its own credible threats—not on either changing the world through force, as neo-conservatives advocate, nor by hoping that a more peaceful world will emerge, as the left proposes. Both of these extremes ground security on radical changes in the way the world operates, and, therefore, necessarily enmesh us in the rest of the world’s affairs, thereby exponentially expanding our vulnerability to all the permutations that chance and contingency may produce. Deterrence, rather, narrows our proﬁle, and thereby reduces our exposure to risk. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Fear of Death is key to human survival – confronting death is key to state and individual existence.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Fear of death, the ultimate source of anxiety, is essential to human survival. This is true not only for individuals, but also for states. Without such fear, states will exhibit an incapacity to confront nonbeing that can hasten their disappearance. So it is today with the State of Israel. Israel suffers acutely from insufficient existential dread. Refusing to tremble before the growing prospect of collective disintegration - a forseeable prospect connected with both genocide and war - this state is now unable to take the necessary steps toward collective survival. What is more, because death is the one fact of life which is not relative but absolute, Israel's blithe unawareness of its national mortality deprives its still living days of essential absoluteness and growth. For states, just as for individuals, confronting death can give the most positive reality to life itself. In this respect, a cultivated awareness of nonbeing is central to each state's pattern of potentialities as well as to its very existence. When a state chooses to block off such an awareness, a choice currently made by the State of Israel, it loses, possibly forever, the altogether critical benefits of &quot;anxiety.&quot; </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Grief, fear, and despair are primary human emotions. Without them, we would be less than human, and less likely to survive. Grief arises because we are not alone, and what connects us to others and to the world also breaks our hearts. Grieving our losses allows us to heal and renew our spirits. Fear alerts us to protect our survival, extending beyond our instinct for self-preservation to our concern for others. Despair asks us to find meaning in the midst of apparent chaos or meaninglessness. Making meaning out of suffering is the basis of the human capacity to survive evil and transcend it. The purposefulness of these dark emotions is evident when we can experience them mindfully, tolerate their intense energies, and let them be. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Fear of nuclear weapons has prevented their use – deterrence has checked conflict.</span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">There were a variety of different reasons behind each of these examples of abstinence from using nuclear weapons. But one major common factor contributing to all of them has been an ingrained terror of nuclear devastation. The well documented images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the awesome photographs of giant mushroom clouds emerging from nuclear tests in the Pacific and the numerous movies based on nuclear Armageddon scenarios have all contributed to building up a deep rooted fear of nuclear weapons. This is not limited just to the abhorrence felt by anti-nuclear activists. It permeates to one extent or another the psyche of all but the most pathological of fanatics. It colours the calculations, even if not decisively, of the most hardened of military strategists. The unacceptability of nuclear devastation is the backbone of all deterrence strategies. There is not just a fear of being attacked oneself, but also a strong mental barrier against actually initiating nuclear attacks on enemy populations, no matter how much they may be contemplated in war games and strategies. As a result a taboo has tacitly evolved over the decades preventing nations, at least so far, from actually pressing the nuclear button even in the face of serious military crises. </span><br />

 A focus on representations destroys social change by ignoring political and material constraints<br />
Taft-Kaufman, 95 (Jill, professor, Department of Speech Communication And Dramatic Arts, at Central Michigan University, Southern Communication Journal, Spring, proquest)<br />
The postmodern passwords of &quot;polyvocality,&quot; &quot;Otherness,&quot; and &quot;difference,&quot; unsupported by substantial analysis of the concrete contexts of subjects, creates a solipsistic quagmire. The political sympathies of the new cultural critics, with their ostensible concern for the lack of power experienced by marginalized people, aligns them with the political left. Yet, despite their adversarial posture and talk of opposition, their discourses on intertextuality and inter-referentiality isolate them from and ignore the conditions that have produced leftist politics--conflict, racism, poverty, and injustice. In short, as Clarke (1991) asserts, postmodern emphasis on new subjects conceals the old subjects, those who have limited access to good jobs, food, housing, health care, and transportation, as well as to the media that depict them. Merod (1987) decries this situation as one which leaves no vision, will, or commitment to activism. He notes that academic lip service to the oppositional is underscored by the absence of focused collective or politically active intellectual communities. Provoked by the academic manifestations of this problem Di Leonardo (1990) echoes Merod and laments: Has there ever been a historical era characterized by as little radical analysis or activism and as much radical-chic writing as ours? Maundering on about Otherness: phallocentrism or Eurocentric tropes has become a lazy academic substitute for actual engagement with the detailed histories and contemporary realities of Western racial minorities, white women, or any Third World population. (p. 530) Clarke's assessment of the postmodern elevation of language to the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of critical discussion is an even stronger indictment against the trend. Clarke examines Lyotard's (1984) The Postmodern Condition in which Lyotard maintains that virtually all social relations are linguistic, and, therefore, it is through the coercion that threatens speech that we enter the &quot;realm of terror&quot; and society falls apart. To this assertion, Clarke replies: I can think of few more striking indicators of the political and intellectual impoverishment of a view of society that can only recognize the discursive. If the worst terror we can envisage is the threat not to be allowed to speak, we are appallingly ignorant of terror in its elaborate contemporary forms. It may be the intellectual's conception of terror (what else do we do but speak?), but its projection onto the rest of the world would be calamitous....(pp. 2-27) The realm of the discursive is derived from the requisites for human life, which are in the physical world, rather than in a world of ideas or symbols.(4) Nutrition, shelter, and protection are basic human needs that require collective activity for their fulfillment. Postmodern emphasis on the discursive without an accompanying analysis of how the discursive emerges from material circumstances hides the complex task of envisioning and working towards concrete social goals (Merod, 1987). Although the material conditions that create the situation of marginality escape the purview of the postmodernist, the situation and its consequences are not overlooked by scholars from marginalized groups. Robinson (1990) for example, argues that &quot;the justice that working people deserve is economic, not just textual&quot; (p. 571). Lopez (1992) states that &quot;the starting point for organizing the program content of education or political action must be the present existential, concrete situation&quot; (p. 299). West (1988) asserts that borrowing French post-structuralist discourses about &quot;Otherness&quot; blinds us to realities of American difference going on in front of us (p. 170). Unlike postmodern &quot;textual radicals&quot; who Rabinow (1986) acknowledges are &quot;fuzzy about power and the realities of socioeconomic constraints&quot; (p. 255), most writers from marginalized groups are clear about how discourse interweaves with the concrete circumstances that create lived experience. People whose lives form the material for postmodern counter-hegemonic discourse do not share the optimism over the new recognition of their discursive subjectivities, because such an acknowledgment does not address sufficiently their collective historical and current struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic injustice. They do not appreciate being told they are living in a world in which there are no more real subjects. Ideas have consequences. Emphasizing the discursive self when a person is hungry and homeless represents both a cultural and humane failure. The need to look beyond texts to the perception and attainment of concrete social goals keeps writers from marginalized groups ever-mindful of the specifics of how power works through political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.<br />

Turn: Language-based frameworks guarantee speciesm<br />
Newmyer, ‘6 – Stephen, Professor of Classics @ Duquesne, Animals, Rights, and Reason in Plutarch and Modern Ethics, p. # below in<br />
The purposeful use of tools had long been believed to be a skill that humans shared at most with their ape and monkey relatives, until ethologists beginning in the 1950s challenged this assumption. Elephants, they noted, use sticks to scratch parts of their bodies that they cannot easily reach, while herons drop berries and even inedible objects into water to attract fishes which they spear when the fishes d&gt;me to inspect rhe ohjects.31 In light of such evidence, behavioral scientists who rejected the idea that animals think or plan were forced to alter their position to maintain instead that, while animals may after all use tools, rhey cannot make tools. This claim too has been challenged. Capuchin monkeys, for example, have beeJ,1 observed to strike stones against hard sutfaces an,d to use the stone flakes that result to scrape flesh from bones and to cut through objects.&quot; The intellectual faculty which philosophers have most jealously guarded as the exclusive province of human beings, indeed as the embodiment of what it means to be human, separating man irrevocably from the rest of animal creation, is the ability to learn and use language. In his study of animal thought, psychologist Joseph Mortenson eloquently expresses the importance of this faculty to man's view of himself as the pinnacle of creation, &quot;Language is the most highly regarded human trait. Man is the speaker, the listener, the reader, the symbol-user.&quot;33 Entire ethical systems have been constructed on the proposition that man has the ability to invent and use language because he is rational, while animals do not possess language because they are irrational. Influential philosopher R. G. Frey is most closely associated with the stance that the ability to engage in symbolic communication constitutes the essence of morality. As the author of the first systematic treatise in recent decades that attacks the concept of animal rights on moral grounds, Frey maintains that animals cannot have rights because they cannot have interests, and they cannot have interests because they cannot have desires. This is in turn the case because animals cannot reflect on what their desires might be, and this is so because they do not have language. Since animals have no interests, they cannot be harmed.34 &lt;15&gt;<br />

TURN – the alternative leads to more animal death – eating animals is the most ethical thing to do<br />

The farmer would point out that even vegans have a ''serious clash of interests'' with other animals. The grain that the vegan eats is harvested with a combine that shreds field mice, while the farmer's tractor crushes woodchucks in their burrows, and his pesticides drop songbirds from the sky. Steve Davis, an animal scientist at Oregon State University, has estimated that if America were to adopt a strictly vegetarian diet, the total number of animals killed every year would actually increase, as animal pasture gave way to row crops. Davis contends that if our goal is to kill as few animals as possible, then people should eat the largest possible animal that can live on the least intensively cultivated land: grass-fed beef for everybody. It would appear that killing animals is unavoidable no matter what we choose to eat. When I talked to Joel Salatin about the vegetarian utopia, he pointed out that it would also condemn him and his neighbors to importing their food from distant places, since the Shenandoah Valley receives too little rainfall to grow many row crops. Much the same would hold true where I live, in New England. We get plenty of rain, but the hilliness of the land has dictated an agriculture based on animals since the time of the Pilgrims. The world is full of places where the best, if not the only, way to obtain food from the land is by grazing animals on it -- especially ruminants, which alone can transform grass into protein and whose presence can actually improve the health of the land. The vegetarian utopia would make us even more dependent than we already are on an industrialized national food chain. That food chain would in turn be even more dependent than it already is on fossil fuels and chemical fertilizer, since food would need to travel farther and manure would be in short supply. Indeed, it is doubtful that you can build a more sustainable agriculture without animals to cycle nutrients and support local food production. If our concern is for the health of nature -- rather than, say, the internal consistency of our moral code or the condition of our souls -- then eating animals may sometimes be the most ethical thing to do. There is, too, the fact that we humans have been eating animals as long as we have lived on this earth. Humans may not need to eat meat in order to survive, yet doing so is part of our evolutionary heritage, reflected in the design of our teeth and the structure of our digestion. Eating meat helped make us what we are, in a social and biological sense. Under the pressure of the hunt, the human brain grew in size and complexity, and around the fire where the meat was cooked, human culture first flourished. Granting rights to animals may lift us up from the brutal world of predation, but it will entail the sacrifice of part of our identity -- our own animality. Surely this is one of the odder paradoxes of animal rights doctrine. It asks us to recognize all that we share with animals and then demands that we act toward them in a most unanimalistic way. Whether or not this is a good idea, we should at least acknowledge that our desire to eat meat is not a trivial matter, no mere ''gastronomic preference.'' We might as well call sex -- also now technically unnecessary -- a mere ''recreational preference.'' Whatever else it is, our meat eating is something very deep indeed.<br />

2. Case is a DA – human-centeredness is key to environmental sustainability<br />
David Schmidtz, 2k. Philosophy, University of Arizona, Environmental Ethics, p. 379-408<br />
Like economic reasoning, ecological reasoning is reasoning about equilibria and perturbations that keep systems from converging on equilibria. Like economic reasoning, ecological reasoning is reasoning about competition and unintended consequences, and the internal logic of systems, a logic that dictates how a system responds to attempts to manipulate it. Environmental activism and regulation do not automatically improve the environment. It is a truism in ecology, as in economics, that well-intentioned interventions do not necessarily translate into good results. Ecology (human and nonhuman) is complicated, our knowledge is limited, and environmentalists are themselves only human. Intervention that works with the system’s logic rather than against it can have good consequences. Even in a centrally planned economy, the shape taken by the economy mainly is a function not of the central plan but of how people respond to it, and people respond to central plans in ways that best serve their purposes, not the central planner’s. Therefore, even a dictator is in no position simply to decide how things are going to go. Ecologists understand that this same point applies in their own discipline. They understand that an ecology’s internal logic limits the directions in which it can be taken by would-be ecological engineers. Within environmental philosophy, most of us have come around to something like Aldo Leopold’s view of humans as plain citizens of the biotic community.[21] As Bryan Norton notes, the contrast between anthropocentrism and biocentrism obscures the fact that we increasingly need to be nature-centered to be properly human-centered; we need to focus on &quot;saving the ecological systems that are the context of human cultural and economic activities.&quot; [22] If we do not tend to what is good for nature, we will not be tending to what is good for people either. As Gary Varner recently put it, on purely anthropocentric grounds we have reason to think biocentrically.[23] I completely agree. What I wish to add is that the converse is also true: on purely biocentric grounds, we have reason to think anthropocentrically. We need to be human-centered to be properly nature-centered, for if we do not tend to what is good for people, we will not be tending to what is good for nature either. From a biocentric perspective, preservationists sometimes are not anthropocentric enough. They sometimes advocate policies and regulations with no concern for values and priorities that differ from their own. Even from a purely biocentric perspective, such slights are illegitimate. Policy makers who ignore human values and human priorities that differ from their own will, in effect, be committed to mismanaging the ecology of which those ignored values and priorities are an integral part.<br />

4. Humans and animals are similar but humans are superior<br />
Linker, ‘5 – Damon, Animal Rights: Contemporary Issues (Compilation), Thompson-Gale, p. below in &lt; &gt;<br />
That such arguments have found an audience at this particular cultural moment is not so hard to explain. Our popular and elite media are saturated with scientific and quasi-scientific reports claiming to prove the basic thesis of the animal-rights movement. Having once believed ourselves to be made in the image of God, we now learnfrom the human genome project, the speculations of evolutionary psychologists, and numerous other sources-that humankind, too, is determined by genetic predispositions and the drive to reproduce. We are cleverer than other animals, to be sure, but the difference is one of degree, not of kind. As Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote on the editorial page of the New York Times, &quot;Again and again, after starting from an ancient premise of radical differences between humans and other creatures, scientists have discovered profound similarities.&quot; But have they? Genetics and evolutionary biology may be, indeed, extremely effective at identifying the traits we share with other species. But chemistry, for its part, can tell us about the ways in which we resemble chunks of charcoal, and physics can point to fundamental similarities between a man and all the matter in the universe. The problem with these observations is not that they are untrue. It is that they shed no light whatsoever on, or rather they are designed to obfuscate, what makes humanity unique as a species-the point on which an answer to the likes of Peter Singer and Steven Wise must hinge. For his part, Singer commits the same error that John Stuart Mill found in the system of Jeremy Bentham: he makes no distinction among kinds of pleasure and pain. That animals feel emotions can hardly be doubted; but human beings experience life, even at its most &quot;animalistic&quot; level, in a way that fundamentally differs from other creatures. Thus, Singer can account for the pain that humans and animals alike experience when they are hungry and the pleasure they feel when they eat, but he cannot explain, for example, a person's choice to starve himself for a cause. He understands that human beings, like animals, derive pleasure from sex and sometimes endure pangs of longing when they are deprived of it, but he cannot explain how or why, unlike animals, some choose to embrace celibacy for the sake of its noble purity. He is certainly attuned to the tendency we share with animals to fear and avoid pain and bodily harm, but he is incapable of understanding a man's willingness to face certain death on the battlefield when called upon to do so by his country. Still less can he explain why stories of such sacrifice sometimes move us to tears. In much the same way, the evidence adduced by Steven Wise to suggest that primates are capable of forming rudimentary plans and expectations fails to demonstrate they are equal to human beings in any significant sense. Men and women use their &quot;autonomy&quot; in a world defined not by the simple imperatives of survival but by ideas of virtue and vice, beauty and ugliness, right and wrong. Modern scientific methods, including those of evolutionary psychology, have so far proved incapable of detecting and measuring this world, but that does not make any less real the experience that takes place within it. Western civilization has tended to regard animals as resembling things more than human beings precisely because, like jnanimate objects, and unlike the authors of the real Magna Carta, animals have no perception of morality. Until the day when a single animal stands up and, led by a love of justice and a sense of self-worth, insists that the world recognize and respect its dignity, all the philosophical gyrations of the activists will remain so much sophistry. Putting Human Interests First None of this, of course, exempts human beings from behaving decently toward animals, but it does provide a foundation, when necessary, for giving pride of place to the interests of human beings. This has particular relevance for biomedical research. Among the most vociferous critics of the USDA's capitulation to the animal-rights movement were the nation's leading centers of medical science. The National Association for BiOlnedical Research estimated that the new regulations would cost universities alone as much as $280 million a year. Nor is the issue simply one of dollars. As Estelle Fishbein, counsel for Johns Hopkins University, recently argued in the SHOULD ANIMALS HAVE THE SAME STATUS AS PEOPLE? Journal of the American Medical Association, Genetic research promises to bring new therapies to alleviate human suffering from the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, Parkinson's disease and other neurological diseases, and virtually all other human and animal diseases. However, the promise of this new era of medical research is highly dependent on the ready availability of mice, rats, and birds. 2S Far from being a mere administrative hassle, she concluded, the new regulations would &quot;divert scarce grant funds from actual research use, distract researchers from their scientific work, and overload them with documentation requirements. II Serious as this threat is, a still more troubling one is the effect that the arguments of animal-rights proponents may have, in the long term, on our regard for human life itself. Peter Singer's apPOintment at Princeton caused a stir not because of his writings about animals but because of his endorsement of euthanasia, unrestricted abortion, and, in some instances, infanticide. But all of his views, as he himself maintains, are of a piece. The idea that &quot;human infants and retarded adults II are superior to animaLs can only be based, he writes, on &quot;a bare-faced-and morally indefensible-prejudice for members of our own species. II In much the same way, Steven Wise urges us to reject absolute demarcations between species and instead focus on the capacities of individual humans and individual apes. If we do that, we will find that many adult chimpanzees and bonobos are far more &quot;human&quot; than newborn and mentally disabled human beings, and thus just as worthy of being recognized as IIpersons.&quot; Though Wise's inference is the opposite of Singer's-he does not wish to deprive underdeveloped humans of rights so much as to extend those rights to primates-he is playing the same game of baitand- switch: in this case projecting the noblest human attributes onto animals while quietly limiting his sample of human beings to newborns and the mentally disabled. When raising animals to our level proves to be impossible, as it inevitably must, equal consideration can only be won by attempting to lower us to theirs. &lt;23-25&gt;<br />

He is currently an adjunct staff member at the RAND Corporation. “Restoring Deterrence” Orbis, Science Direct.<br />
<br />
In between these two extremes, deterrence is a security policy that offers a way forward for the United States that is not only more effective because more tailored, but is also more moral. It is more moral because a deterrent posture would entail a strategy that is more proportionate, more necessary, more responsive, and, ultimately, more just. Indeed, deterrence comports with the fundamental human intuition that it is generally only moral to ﬁght when attacked. In this it complies with the classical conception of just war, which mandates that wars only be conducted when one’s cause is just, waged by a legitimate authority, motivated by a right intent, fought with a real prospect of success, conducted proportionately, and undertaken only as a last resort. Deterrence satisﬁes these criteria. It is a defensive strategy that responds to invasions or attacks, and is therefore just; it sets out relatively clear guide- lines for when it mandates that the government ﬁght, and, therefore, is governed by legitimate authority. It is driven by a desire to protect, deter, and avenge, and is therefore motivated by right intent; its realistic red lines and threats are backed up by the awesome power of the United States, and therefore likely to succeed; and it responds when attacked and asks from the rest of the international community only respect for its marked out positions rather than revolutionary transformation, and is therefore propor- tional.22 Finally, by its nature it is undertaken as a last resort rather than preventively.23 It was the fundamental moral attractiveness of this position that continually frustrated both Soviet efforts to decouple Europe from the Amer- ican nuclear umbrella during the Cold War and occasional American efforts to roll back the Soviet empire. But theorizing about war and peace cannot remain at the level of abstraction. It must bear moral responsibility for actual consequence and the power of contingency, as Max Weber pointed out.24 And deterrence, defense by calculation, uniquely satisﬁes the moral requirement that leaders, whatever their benevolent intentions, are basically responsible for the consequences that contingency produces from their actions. This it does by grounding a nation’s security on its own credible threats—not on either changing the world through force, as neo-conservatives advocate, nor by hoping that a more peaceful world will emerge, as the left proposes. Both of these extremes ground security on radical changes in the way the world operates, and, therefore, necessarily enmesh us in the rest of the world’s affairs, thereby exponentially expanding our vulnerability to all the permutations that chance and contingency may produce.

West (1988) asserts that borrowing French post-structuralist discourses about &quot;Otherness&quot; blinds us to realities of American difference going on in front of us (p. 170). Unlike postmodern &quot;textual radicals&quot; who Rabinow (1986) acknowledges are &quot;fuzzy about power and the realities of socioeconomic constraints&quot; (p. 255), most writers from marginalized groups are clear about how discourse interweaves with the concrete circumstances that create lived experience. People whose lives form the material for postmodern counter-hegemonic discourse do not share the optimism over the new recognition of their discursive subjectivities, because such an acknowledgment does not address sufficiently their collective historical and current struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic injustice. They do not appreciate being told they are living in a world in which there are no more real subjects. Ideas have consequences. Emphasizing the discursive self when a person is hungry and homeless represents both a cultural and humane failure. The need to look beyond texts to the perception and attainment of concrete social goals keeps writers from marginalized groups ever-mindful of the specifics of how power works through political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.<br />

Abandoning realism doesn’t eliminate global violence—alternative worldviews will be just as violent or worse<br />
O'Callaghan, 02 (Terry, lecturer in the school of International Relations at the University of South Australia,International Relations and the third debate, ed: Jarvis, 2002, p. 79-80)<br />
In fact, if we explore the depths of George's writings further, we find remarkable brevity in their scope, failing to engage with practical issues beyond platitudes and homilies. George, for example, is concerned about the violent, dangerous and war-prone character of the present international system. And rightly so. The world is a cruel and unforgiving place, especially for those who suffer the indignity of human suffering beneath tyrannous leaders, warrior states, and greedy self-serving elites. But surely the problem of violence is not banished from the international arena once the global stranglehold of realist thinking is finally broken? It is important to try to determine the levels of violence that might be expected in a nonrealist world. How will internecine conflict be managed?How do postmodernists like George go about managing conflict between marginalized groups whose &quot;voices&quot; collide? It is one thing to talk about the failure of current realist thinking, but there is absolutely nothing in George's statements to suggest that he has discovered solutions to handle events in Bosnia, the Middle East, or East Timor. Postmodern approaches look as impoverished in this regard as do realist perspectives. Indeed, it is interesting to note that George gives conditional support for the actions of the United States in Haiti and Somalia &quot;because on balance they gave people some hope where there was none&quot; (George, 1994:231). Brute force, power politics, and interventionism do apparently have a place in George's postmodem world. But even so, the Haitian and Somalian cases are hardly in the same intransigent category as those of Bosnia or the Middle East. Indeed, the Americans pulled out of Somalia as soon as events took a turn for the worse and, in the process, received a great deal of criticism from the international community. Would George have done the same thing? Would he have left the Taliban to their devices in light of their complicity in the events of September 11? Would he have left the Somalians to wallow in poverty and misery? Would he have been willing to sacrifice the lives of a number of young men and women (American, Australian, French, or whatever) to subdue Aidid and his minions in order to restore social and political stability to Somalia? To be blunt, I wonder how much better off the international community would be if Jim George were put in charge of foreign affairs. This is not a fatuous point. After all, George wants to suggest that students of international politics are implicated in the trials and tribulations of international politics. All of us should be willing, therefore, to accept such a role, even hypothetically. I suspect, however, that were George actually to confront some of the dilemmas that policymakers do on a daily basis, he would find that teaching the Bosnian Serbs about the dangers of modernism, universalism and positivism, and asking them to be more tolerant and sensitive would not meet with much success. True, it may not be a whole lot worse than current realist approaches, but the point is that George has not demonstrated how his views might make a meaningful difference. Saying that they will is not enough, especially given that the outcomes of such strategies might cost people their lives. Nor, indeed, am I asking George to develop a &quot;research project&quot; along positivist lines. On the contrary, I am merely asking him to show how his position can make a difference to the &quot;hard cases&quot; in international politics. My point is thus a simple one. Despite George's pronouncements, there is little in his work to show that he has much appreciation for the kind of moral dilemmas that Augustine wrestled with in his early writings and that confront human beings every day. Were this the case, George would not have painted such a black-and- white picture of the study of international politics.<br />

5. Their alternative cedes the political-<br />

The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change.As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved - perhaps even unrecognized - only to fester more ominously into the future. And such problems (ecological crisis, poverty,urban decay, spread of infectious diseases, technological displacement of workers) cannot be understood outside the larger social and global context of internationalized markets, finance, and communications. Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or side-step these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impo-tence. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to theincreasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions.74 In the meantime, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The unyielding truth is that, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the United States, it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies. This last point demands further elaboration. Theshrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehowdisappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people's lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites - an already familiar dynamic in many lesser-developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world, not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a reassertion of politics in more virulent guise - or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collec-tive interests that had vanished from civil society.75<br />

Insecurity and disorder aren’t inevitable, future planning has been effective. Debates amongst citizens are key to assessing probability and effectively planning<br />
Kurasawa 2004 (Constellations Volume 11 Number 4, 2004)<br />
Moreover, keeping in mind the sobering lessons of the past century cannot but make us wary about humankind’s supposedly unlimited ability for problemsolving or discovering solutions in time to avert calamities. In fact, the historical track-record of last-minute, technical ‘quick-fixes’ is hardly reassuring. What’s more, most of the serious perils that we face today (e.g., nuclear waste, climate change, global terrorism, genocide and civil war) demand complex, sustained, long-term strategies of planning, coordination, and execution. On the other hand, an examination of fatalism makes it readily apparent that the idea that humankind is doomed from the outset puts off any attempt to minimize risks for our successors, essentially condemning them to face cataclysms unprepared. An a priori pessimism is also unsustainable given the fact that long-term preventive action has had (and will continue to have) appreciable beneficial effects; the examples of medical research, the welfare state, international humanitarian law, as well as strict environmental regulations in some countries stand out among many others. The evaluative framework proposed above should not be restricted to the critique of misappropriations of farsightedness, since it can equally support public deliberation with a reconstructive intent, that is, democratic discussion and debate about a future that human beings would freely self-determine. Inverting Foucault’s Nietzschean metaphor, we can think of genealogies of the future that could perform a farsighted mapping out of the possible ways of organizing social life. They are, in other words, interventions into the present intended to facilitate global civil society’s participation in shaping the field of possibilities of what is to come. Once competing dystopian visions are filtered out on the basis of their analytical credibility, ethical commitments, and political underpinnings and consequences, groups and individuals can assess the remaining legitimate catastrophic scenarios through the lens of genealogical mappings of the future. Hence, our first duty consists in addressing the present-day causes of eventual perils, ensuring that the paths we decide upon do not contract the range of options available for our posterity.42 Just as importantly, the practice of genealogically inspired farsightedness nurtures the project of an autonomous future, one that is socially self-instituting. In so doing, we can acknowledge that the future is a human creation instead of the product of metaphysical and extra-social forces (god, nature, destiny, etc.), and begin to reflect upon and deliberate about the kind of legacy we want to leave for those who will follow us. Participants in global civil society can then take – and in many instances have already taken – a further step by committing themselves to socio-political struggles forging a world order that, aside from not jeopardizing human and environmental survival, is designed to rectify the sources of transnational injustice that will continue to inflict needless suffering upon future generations if left unchallenged.<br />

A2: K’s of Heg<br />
Anti hegemonic movements cause global genocide.<br />
Shaw, ‘1 (IR Prof – Sussex, Review of International Studies 27)<br />
That these are indeed ‘yesterday’s visions’ is clear from the selective way in which they are used. It is a curious anti-imperialism that attacks the so-called ‘imperialism of human rights’69 but provides the defence of sovereignty to the imperialism of genocidal oppression.70 Something is wrong with the radical tradition, when as distinguished a representative as Edward Said could write of the Kosovo war that what he found ‘most distressing’ was the ‘destruction from the air’ wrought by American power71—not the genocidal massacres by Serbian forces that prompted NATO’s (admittedly problematic) response. Said has reminded us recently of what Thompson called the ‘Natopolitan’ world, in which many intellectuals were indirectly on the payroll of the CIA.72 What he did not acknowledge was its Stalinist counterpart, in which intellectuals sold their souls to the KGB and the Stasi. And there was an anti-Cold War world, in which those who refused the choice of NATO and the Warsaw Pact elaborated their ideas. Although those of us in this intellectual third world turned down the lucre of the blocs, this did not guarantee lasting validity to our ideas. In the new global era, many characteristic assumptions of the old anti-Cold War left appear increasingly as prejudices. A whole generation has not let go of a mindset, four elements of which are problematic in the new situation. Most fundamental is a residual Third Worldist ideology. According to this, Western, especially American, imperialism is the touchstone for all world politics. Said’s anachronistic conclusion about Kosovo was to ask: ‘When will the smaller, lesser, weaker peoples realize that this America is to be resisted at all costs, not pandered to or given in to naively?’73 There are strong criticisms to be made of American and NATO policies in Kosovo. However a systematic blindness lies behind the continuing belief that America is the principal problem, coupled with the failure to recognize the need for international action against genocide.74 From this viewpoint, non-Western states are potential sites of resistance, organizers of ‘underdeveloped political economies’75 which can contest the dominant form. While sovereignty in general may be regarded as a political form of capitalist social relations76, the sovereignty of non-Western states must be defended from Western power. Yet to support Serbian sovereignty over Kosovo, or Chinese over Tibet, gives sustenance to forms of colonial domination deeply mired in blood. Critics find themselves in an inversion of the double standard of which they accuse NATO: if it is right to support Timorese self-determination against Indonesian claims to sovereignty, how can the same right be denied to the Kosovans or Tibetans?77.<br />

And – This outweighs their (K).<br />
Vetleson, ‘2k (Arne Johan, Department of Philosophy University of Oslo, , “Genocide: A Case for the Responsibility of the Bystander”, Journal of Peace Research, July, p. 520-522)<br />
is that not acting is still acting. Brought to bear on the case of genocide as a reported, on going affair, the inaction making a difference is the inaction of the bystander to unfolding genocide. The failure to act when confronted with such action, as is involved in accomplishing genocide, is a failure which carries a message to both the agent and the sufferer: the action may proceed. Knowing, yet still not acting, means-granting acceptance to the action. Such inaction entails letting things be done by someone else - clearly, in the case of acknowledged genocide, 'to the point of criminality', to invoke one of the quotes from Ricoeur. In short, inaction here means complicity; accordingly, it raises the question of responsibility, guilt, and shame on the part of the inactive bystander, by which I mean the bystander who decides to remain inactive.<br />

Kritiks of western imperialism and hegemony justify violence and genocide.<br />
Reiff, ’99 (Famous Author &amp; Columnist, Summer, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3838:http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/rieff2.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/rieff2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/rieff2.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3838 -->, WPJ, XVI, No. 2)<br />
The conclusion is inescapable. At the present time, only the West has both the power and, however intermittently, the readiness to act. And by the West, one really means the United States. Obviously, to say that America could act effectively if it chose to do so as, yes, the world's policeman of last resort, is not the same thing as saying that it should. Those who argue, as George Kennan has done, that we overestimate ourselves when we believe we can right the wrongs of the world, must be listened to seriously. So should the views of principled isolationists. And those on what remains of the left who insist that the result of such a broad licensing of American power will be a further entrenchment of America's hegemony over the rest of the world are also unquestionably correct. What Is to Be Done But the implications of not doing anything are equally clear. Those who fear American power are-this is absolutely certain-condemning other people to death. Had the U.S. armed forces not set up the air bridge to eastern Zaire in the wake of the Rwandan genocide, hundreds of thousands of people would have perished, rather than the tens of thousands who did die. This does not excuse the Clinton administration for failing to act to stop the genocide militarily; but it is a fact. And analogous situations were found in Bosnia and even, for all its failings, in the operation in Somalia. Continues Is this proposal tantamount to calling for a recolonization of part of the world? Would such a system make the United States even more powerful than it is already? Clearly it is, and clearly it would. But what are the alternatives? Kosovo demonstrates how little stomach the United States has for the kind of military action that its moral ambitions impel it to undertake. And there will be many more Kosovos in the coming decades. With the victory of capitalism nearly absolute, the choice is not between systems but about what kind of capitalist system we are going to have and what kind of world order that system requires. However controversial it may be to say this, our choice at the millennium seems to boil down to imperialism or barbarism. Half-measures of the type we have seen in various humanitarian interventions and in Kosovo represent the worst of both worlds. Better to grasp the nettle and accept that liberal imperialism may be the best we are going to do in these callous and sentimental times. Indeed, the real task for people who reject both realism and the utopian nihilism of a left that would prefer to see genocide in Bosnia and the mass deportation of the Kosovars rather than strengthen, however marginally, the hegemony of the United States, is to try to humanize this new imperial order-assuming it can come into being-and to curb the excesses that it will doubtless produce. The alternative is not liberation, or the triumph of some global consensus of conscience, but, to paraphrase Che Guevara, one, two, three, many Kosovos.<br />

The blanket rejection of US power results in genocide- this card will toast their alternative<br />

The point is that this would be a terrible time to give up on internationalism. The simple fact that the US proved victorious in Iraq does not alter the following chain of truths: To push the world toward democratic rights, power must be legitimate; it is only legitimate if it is held to be legitimate; it is very unlikely to be legitimate if it is unilateral or close to unilateral; and the wider the base of power, the more likely it is to appear legitimate. Bush may have no doubt that American armed force in the Middle East is legitimate, and right now Americans may agree, but that won't do. Common sense alone should tell us not to overreach. Even with the best intentions in the world -- which hundreds of millions doubt -- the United States is simply not up to the global mission that the Bush administration embraces. This nation hasn't the staying power, the economic strength, the knowledge, the wisdom, or the legitimacy to command the continents. It is sheerest delusion to think otherwise. Meanwhile, it is an irony of the recent past that as the United States has lost prestige, the United Nations has gained it -- at least outside our borders. For all its demonstrable flaws, it retains some credibility -- no small thing in a world growing more anarchic. Even the U. N.'s sharpest critics concede that it learns from its mistakes. Having failed miserably to stop ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Rwanda, it started talking about the need to keep constabulary forces at the ready. Having been assigned much of the world's dirty work -- peacekeeping, public health, refugee and humanitarian aid -- its institutions accumulate the lore of experience. Resolution 1441, which the Security Council passed unanimously last year, might even be interpreted, strange to say, as a step forward in the enforcement of international law, for if the U. S. had been more adroit and patient diplomatically, the French and others could have been nudged into signing onto limited force a few months hence. In the end, the organization failed to prevent war, but its hopes have never been more necessary, its resurrection more indispensable. If internationalism is toothless, right now, that's not an argument against internationalist principle; it's an argument for implanting teeth. If what's left on the East River is nothing but a clunky hulk, there was still enough prestige left in the hulk that George W. Bush, master unilateralist, felt impelled to dally with the Security Council -- however reluctantly, however deceptively -- for months. No less a figure than his father's consigliore and former Secretary of State James W. Baker urged that course upon the president last summer. Going the Security Council route was the tribute George W. Bush paid to internationalism -- before underscoring his contempt for it by going to war on his own schedule. This is not the first time an international assembly of nation-states has failed abjectly to prove its mettle. Indeed, in 1945, the UN itself was built atop the site of an earlier breakdown. The rubble of the collapsed League of Nations, which had failed to arrest blatant aggression by Italy, Japan, and Germany, had to be cleared away before the UN could rise from the ashes. Yet rise it did. And people were inspired -- and frightened -- by it. Even as a spectral presence, the UN was substantial enough to arouse right-wingers to put up billboards urging the US to flee its clutches. Recently, George W. Bush fondly remembered those signs, conspicuous around Midland, Texas, during his early years. To Midland's America Firsters, the U. N. had a reputation as demonic as it was, to this writer, benign. In the General Assembly building, which my friends and I frequented in high school, the ceiling was left unfinished -- to signal, we were told, that world peace was unfinished. What if the symbolism was indeed a pointer toward a different order of things? It is not always easy to tell the difference between dead symbols and promising ones. Push came to shove, and the UN was mainly an intimation -- at most an inspiration. Neither as peacemaker nor peacekeeper was it the world government-in-the-making that some desired and others feared. It was a force in Korea only because the Russians agreed not to play. It was useless in Vietnam. During the endless Israel-Palestine war, it has been bootless. In the 1990s, it failed miserably to stop Serb aggression in Bosnia and Kosovo. It stood by during the Rwandan genocide, too, though its own military commander on the scene, Canadian General Romeo Dallaire, pleaded desperately for UN reinforcements. You can see why realists like to smirk and claim it's hopelessly idealistic to think that the UN could ever amount to anything more than a debating society whose main achievement has been to reserve a lot of Manhattan parking spots. Interestingly, Dallaire, who was shattered by UN failure in Rwanda, does not sneer. In retirement, he continues campaigning to strengthen world governance. &quot;You can't on one side, say the UN is screwing it up and we're going to go to war, and on other side not give the UN the resources,&quot; he said recently. &quot;It is not the UN that failed [in Iraq]. But it is the permanent five [members of the Security Council] in particular. If they don't want the UN to be effective, it won't be.&quot; Pause with this elementary observation a moment. The reasons for the UN's weakness are several, but not the least is that -- no surprise here -- the most powerful nations want it weak. They like the principle of national sovereignty, and then some, as the recent war amply demonstrates. It will take a long, steady, popular campaign to override the inhibitions. Campaigners might start by underscoring some modest successes. For all the impediments thrown in its way -- and not only by the US -- the UN has done constructive work. It helped restore decent governments in Cambodia, East Timor, and Bosnia. It helps keep the peace on the Golan Heights. On a thousand unnoticed fronts, it daily comes to the aid of refugees, the sick, the malnourished. A top UN official recently told me that Secretary General Kofi Annan was inches away from a partition-ending deal in long-suffering Cyprus, only to lose momentum with the distraction of the Bush-Saddam confrontation. In Afghanistan and Iraq, we need not less of the UN, but much more -- more efficient, better led, better funded. Rebuild The Destroyed Nations: Now there's an agenda for a peace movement. But much of the global movement that sprang up to oppose the Iraq war proceeded to subside into easy chants of &quot;US Out&quot; -- an analogue to the right wing's &quot;US Out of the UN.&quot; This sort of short-circuit unilateralism begs the tough questions about the uses (as well as abuses) of international intervention. &quot;US Out&quot; resounds more ringingly if you refrain from thinking about what actual Afghans and actual Iraqis need -- constitutional rights, law enforcement, infrastructure. Protest has its time and place, but what's needed now is politics -- politics to plan the unilateralists' exit from office, combined with practical pressure, here and now, to solve practical problems. We must not permit ourselves to retreat noisily into protest's good night. Most of all, internationalism needs more than a nudge here and there -- it needs a jump-start, a riveting proof that multilateral action can change facts on the ground. Here's one idea: What if the UN and Europe decided to take on the toughest assignment? There is no more stringent test for internationalism's future than what seems the world's most intractable trauma: The endless Israel-Palestine war, which has outlasted a thousand manifestos, plans, meetings about meetings. The new postwar situation might just be promising, the Bush administration just possibly susceptible to pressure. Practical, peace-seeking Jews and Palestinians ought to get in on the pressure; so should Europeans looking for payback, not least Tony Blair. And we ought to be thinking of a practical role for a UN, or joint UN-NATO constabulary. As Tony Klug of Britain's Council for Jewish-Palestinian Dialogue has pointed out on openDemocracy.net, the two bloodied, intertwined, myopic peoples need far more than a road map: they need enforcement. Klug's idea is an international protectorate for the West Bank and Gaza. Some combination of the UN, NATO, and various national forces would play various parts. The point would be to supplant the Israeli occupation, relieve the immediate suffering, and guarantee secure borders. Such a scheme would seem to have taken leave of this earth. The U. S. won't permit it....Sharon won't permit it....The Europeans won't pay for it....The Israelis won't trust the UN, or the Palestinians, who won't trust the Israeli. But what is the alternative? More living nightmares? Occupation and massacre in perpetuity? Military enforcement on a global scale has been left to ad hoc coalitions -- sometimes with blue helmets, sometimes not. That won't do. To put human rights on the ground, avert genocides to come, and -- not incidentally -- help protect the United States from the more vengeful of empire's resentful subjects (funny, their not understanding how good our power is for them), we need a more muscular global authority -- including a global constabulary. Imagine, say, a flexible force permitted to commit, say, 10,000 troops if a simple majority, eight members, of the Security Council signed on, but expandable to 50,000 if the vote were unanimous. Wouldn't Europe have been in a stronger position to avert Bush's war if such a force had been in readiness to enforce resolutions of the Security Council? A wise superpower would know it needs to share responsibility -- which entails sharing the force that makes responsibility real. Of course such a denouement is scarcely around the corner, nor is there any guarantee that it is destined to come at all. Like the abolition of slavery, or the unity of Europe, it surely will not come without pain or error, nor will it be the work of a single generation. But again, what is the alternative? Tyranny and unilateralism; hubris and mile-high resentment. In the world as it is, effective moral force cannot preclude military force. If internationalists don't press more strongly for international law and multilateralist order, one thing is certain: we shall be left with protests, playing catch-up forever, waiting for &quot;told you so&quot; moments. &quot;No&quot; is not a foreign policy. Coupled with the properly skeptical &quot;no&quot; must be the transformative &quot;yes&quot; -- not a grudging, perfunctory afterthought, but international law with enforcers; not empire, but human rights with guns.<br />

Claiming the right of pre-emptive war would not, by itself, be proof of empire. Even launching a war more accurately defined as an aggressive preventive war (since a preemptive attack implies an imminent threat) does not by itself represent such proof. But the eagerness, of Washington's powerful to launch this war, without United Nations authorization and with such reckless disregard for the consequences, with the expressed aim of toppling the government of an independent country, albeit one mortally wounded from war and twelve years of murderous sanctions, may represent just such proof. Certainly one can argue, as Paul Schroeder does, that there is a critical distinction between hegemony and empire. (The History News Network, Center for History and the New Media, George Mason University, 3 February 2003.) &quot;Hegemony,&quot; he writes, &quot;means clear, acknowledged leadership and dominant influence by one unit within a community of units not under a single authority. A hegemon is first among equals; an imperial power rules over subordinates. A hegemonic power is the one without whom no final decision can be reached within a given system; its responsibility is essentially managerial, to see that a decision is reached. An imperial power rules the system, imposes its decision when it wishes.&quot; Schroeder concludes that the US &quot;is not an empire-not yet.&quot; Writing some weeks before Washington's invasion of Iraq, he describes the US as &quot;at this moment a wannabe empire, poised on the brink. The Bush Doctrine proclaims unquestionably imperialist ambitions and goals, and its armed forces are poised for war for empire-formal empire in Iraq through conquest, occupation, and indefinite political control, and informal empire over the whole Middle East through exclusive paramountcy.&quot; The rapid overthrow of the Iraqi regime, with its attendant moments of exhilaration and long hours of horror for tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians, has pushed Bush administration officials over that brink. Their smug &quot;other Middle Eastern governments better learn their lesson&quot; attitude indicates an even fortified sense of self-righteousness and the justice of their cause. If Washington has not yet consolidated its global empire, the drive towards it is now undeniable. Ultimately though, what is key is less the debate over whether the US today is an aggressive hegemon or an imperial center bound for global domination, than understanding the political significance and consequence of this historical moment. US tanks control the Euphrates valley and US troops occupy the sites of the earliest recorded history of humanity. But US policymakers willing to look out beyond their own euphoria will see not only a devastated and dishonored Iraq facing at best an uncertain and difficult future; not only an Iraqi population whose largest components are calling equally for &quot;No to Saddam Hussein&quot; and &quot;No to the US&quot; in their street protests; but as well a humiliated and enraged Arab world; a shattered system of alliances; and a constellation of international opposition growing that includes Washington's closest allies and an emerging global people's movement saying no to Washington's war, and no to Washington's empire. If war in Iraq were the only clear imperial thrust of the Bush administration, it would be tempting to reduce it to the resource-grabbing of an oil industry administration, the actions of an irresponsible hegemony soon to be taken to task by the rest of the global community of units. Opposition to the war could indeed be reduced to the demand of &quot;no blood for oil.&quot; But when taken in the context of even longer-standing, and more visionary efforts to reshape regional and global power relations, the Iraq war emerges far more as exemplar of a broad and entrenched pattern, than as an isolated proof of US intent.<br />

Hegemony in international terms without some kind of competing force, such as the Soviets, can clearly lead to the abuse of power and a unilateralist flaunting of international institutions that do not serve at the imperium's whim. But this should not mean that hegemony itself is a negative concept. Although empire is something rightfully reviled, hegemony may not be as bad as everyone thinks. We need to consider what is progressive and transformative in the ideas and values of the western republican and liberal traditions. We need to advocate not an anti-hegemonic stance in form, but an anti-hegemonic and anti-imperialist stance in content, one that advocates the particular interests of capital of the market in more broad terms rather than the universal political interests of others. Rather than choose between western hegemony on the one hand and political and cultural relativism on the other, we need to approach this problem with an eye toward cosmopolitanism and what the political theorist Stephen Eric Bronner has called &quot;planetary life.&quot; Simple resistance to American &quot;imperial&quot; tendencies is no longer enough for a responsible, critical and rational left. Not only does it smack of tiers-mondisme but at the same time it rejects the realities of globalization which are inexorable and require a more sophisticated political response. The real question I am putting forth is simply this: is it the case that hegemony is in itself inherently bad? Or, is it possible to consider that, because it can, at least in theory, consist of the diffusion of western political ideas, values and institutions, it could be used as a progressive force in transforming those nations and regions that have been unable to deal politically with the problems of economic development, political disintegration and ethnic strife?<br />

FRONTIER CARD<br />
<br />
The permutation solves—the concept of the frontier can never be rejected but we can reshape it to encourage cultural harmony and intellectual expansion<br />
BILLINGS 1997 (Linda Billings is a doctoral student in the Department of Communication Studies, Indiana University, “Frontier Days in Space: Are They Over?” Space Policy, August)<br />
Patricia Nelson Limerick has recommended that the space community abandon the frontier metaphor. But at the same time she acknowledges that it is 'an enormously persistent and determining pattern of thought'. Ultimately, it may not be feasible to expunge the frontier metaphor from the public discourse about space exploration. But it certainly is possible, and practical, to re-examine it as a motivating force for space exploration. What is the space frontier? It might be useful to think of the space frontier as a vast and distant sort of Brazilian rainforest, Atacama Desert, Antarctic continent a great unknown that challenges humans to think creatively and expansively, to push their capabilities to the limits, a wild and beautiful place to be studied and enjoyed but left unsullied. Curiosity is what brought humans out of caves, took them across oceans and continents, compelled them to invent aeroplanes and now draws them towards the stars. The broad, deep public value of exploring the universe is the value of discovery, learning and understanding; thus the space frontier could be a school for social research, a place where new societies could grow and thrive. This is the space frontier: the vast, perhaps endless frontier of intellectual and spiritual potential. Consider the popularity of director Ron Howard's film Apollo 13. What appealed to audiences about this story was that it was about danger, risk, challenges, hard work, human ingenuity, turning failure to success, life triumphing over death. In his turn of the century essay, 'The moral equivalent of war', American philosopher William James wrote that 'without risks or prizes for the darer, history would be insipid indeed'. Space exploration offers tremendous opportunities to take extraordinary risks and thus it promises great challenges to the human mind and spirit. Intellectual and spiritual growth are more than worthy goals of future space exploration efforts.<br />

In reality, it is more accurate to say that the United States is at a strategic crossroads when it comes to China. With our plate full around the globe, we are understandably reluctant to raise publicly the prospect of a new great power competition. Nevertheless, the administration is doing quite a bit to contain Chinese military power--our upgraded relations with Japan, India, Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia are cases in point. But our reluctance to admit this publicly to ourselves or to our allies, and our rosy rhetoric about our &quot;constructive&quot; relationship with Beijing, leave us at a disadvantage as China ratchets up the competition. As a practical matter, this attitude often leaves us a day late and a dollar short when it comes to matching new Chinese initiatives. Nor is our position sustainable. Beijing is not blind to our reaching out to the powers in the region. For it, the competition has already begun. The Pentagon's report provides ample evidence that this is the case, but then ducks the obvious conclusion. Preparing the Congress and the public for that competition should be a priority of the administration. Unfortunately, this year's report, for all its substantive merit, fails the test.<br />

 Turn: Orientalist authors demonize and essentialize the West—there are alternative causes of colonialism and violence, they instead assume that all western logic is bad – this prevents the good aspects of the west – like the cooperation initiatives within the 1AC. This re-creates their logic by reducing the West to a series of different studies.<br />
Zarnett 08 Graduate Student at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. (David, “Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said’s Orientalism” Democratiya Spring 2008 www.dissentmagazine.org/democratiya/article.php?article=193)<br />
<br />
Said’s ignoring of the Oriental in Orientalism is manifested as well in his political positions. In his analysis of the Iranian Revolution, Said systematically failed to consider the ideas and political programme of the Ayatollah Khomeini. During the Gulf War, he made little mention of the plight of the Kuwaitis who were suffering under a brutal occupation as a result of Ba’athist imperialism. He also failed to speak out for the human rights of the Iraqi Kurds who were victims of the most brutal Iraqi state aggression. Instead, Said felt compelled to only speak of human rights abuses committed by America and Israel. This political position is the product of a view which Varisco acknowledges to be central in Orientalism: ‘The default theory in Orientalism, as well as of Culture and Imperialism, is that somehow Europe is uniquely imperialist and colonialist; Said is willing to take the binary of the West dominating the East as a given, even if only to deconstruct it rhetorically.’ [35] Despite this realisation, Varisco nevertheless believes that Said is ‘an impassioned advocate of human rights for all victims of past imperialism and present neo-colonial co-option’ [36] – the important words in that sentence being ‘all victims.’ Said’s intellectual impact is still strong and it is questionable whether the work of Ibn Warraq and Daniel Martin Varisco will dislodge his influence. Warraq’s views will be roundly dismissed as ‘neo-conservative’ and as an apologia for imperialism. Varisco’s work will contribute to the belief that while Said was wrong about many things in Orientalism his intellectual impact should be understood positively. Varisco foreshadows this approach to Said when he praises Orientalism as a book that ‘had to be written’ to the extent that ‘we can hardly condemn the author for writing it.’ [37] Yet Varisco does condemn Said throughout his book; here are a few examples: ‘A survey of Said’s rhetoric cannot avoid his careless, and at times mischievous, citations of contemporary scholars’ [38]; ‘it is easy to forget that Said is writing a history about a subject about which he has only a selective and superficial knowledge’ [39]; ‘The sheer crassness of what is being quoted [in Orientalism] can overrides a critical caution about what has been left out’ [40]; ‘In terms of intellectual history, [Said’s] interdisciplinary rigor borders on the mortis;’ [41] ‘I am disturbed when Said subsumes biased and shoddy scholarship under the umbrage-laden umbrella of disciplines which he has no credible experience.’<br />

<br />
Unlike twenty-five years ago, increasingly, people are adopting the anarcho-apocalyptic, civilization-must-fall-to-save-the-world attitude. It is a fairly clean and tight worldview, zealously bulletproof, and it scares me. I want the natural world, the greater community of life beyond our species, with all its beautiful and terrifying manifestations, and its vibrant landscapes to survive intact – I think about this a lot. A quick collapse of global civilization, will almost certainly lead to greater explosive damage to the biosphere, than a mediated slower meltdown. When one envisions the collapse of global society, one is not discussing the demise of an ancient Greek city-state, or even the abandonment of an empire like the Mayans. The end of our global civilization would not only result in the death of six billion humans, just wiping nature’s slate clean. We also have something like 5,000 nuclear facilities spread across the planet’s surface. And this is just one obvious and straightforward fact cutting across new radical arguments in favor of a quick fall. We have inserted ourselves into the web of life on planet Earth, into its interstitial fibers, over the last 500 years. We are now a big part of the world’s dynamic biological equation set – its checks and balances. If we get a “fever” and fall into social chaos, even just considering our non-nuclear toys laying about, the damage will be profound. It will be much more devastating than our new visionaries of post-apocalyptic paradise have prophesized. If one expands upon current examples of social chaos that we already see, like Afghanistan or Darfur, extrapolating them across the globe, encompassing Europe, Asia, North and South America, and elsewhere, then one can easily imagine desperate outcomes where nature is sacrificed wholesale in vain attempts to rescue human life. The outcomes would be beyond “ugly”; they would be horrific and enduring. That is why I cannot accept this new wave of puritanical anarcho-apocalyptic theology. The end-point of a quick collapse is quite likely to resemble the landscape of Mars, or even perhaps the Moon. I love life. I do not want the Earth turned barren. I think that those who are dreaming of a world returned to its wilderness state are lovely, naive romantics – dangerous ones. Imagine 100 Chernobyl’s spewing indelible death. Imagine a landscape over-run with desperate and starving humans, wiping out one ecosystem after another. Imagine endless tribal wars where there are no restraints on the use of chemical and biological weapons. Imagine a failing industrial infrastructure seeping massive quantities of deadly toxins into the air, water and soil. This is not a picture of primitive liberation, of happy post-civilized life working the organic farm on Salt Spring Island.<br />

Markets cannot save the environment—industry lies about global warming are a prime example of their social irresponsibility.<br />

[*252] B. Corporations Just Follow the Rules of the Game Another mental framework that does not fit with current reality is that corporations are effectively governed or restrained from antisocial actions by the public sector and are subject to rules of the game set by public authority. Consider Milton Friedman's guidance on corporate social responsibility, 43 which assumes that profit maximization takes place within a set of meaningful rules and boundaries set by public governance. Using this model, some business ethicists have suggested that manufacturers have a duty to obey whatever laws Congress or international institutions prescribe and to not resist the public control of private enterprise. 44 The idea is that, by obeying these rules, corporations fulfill their basic social responsibilities. The current reality, however, is that corporations may (singly or in concert with others): (1) work to undermine policy making by misleading the public, (2) avoid accountability under the rule of law, and (3) lobby for new or continued subsidies and anticompetitive advantages from politicians. 1. Misleading the Public The self-interest of corporations is evident by their use of media to mislead the public on one of the most critical issues of our time--global warming.<br />

6. Biopower is also positive—such as the dramatic decrease in infant mortality.<br />
Dickinson 04 - Associate Professor, History Ph.D., U.C. Berkeley - 2004 (Edward Ross, “Biopolitics, Fascism,<br />
Democracy: Some Reflections on Our Discourse About “Modernity,” Central European History, vol. 37, no. 1, 1–48)<br />
<br />
Of course, at the most simple-minded level, it seems to me that an assessment of the potentials of modernity that ignores the ways in which biopolitics has made life tangibly better is somehow deeply flawed. To give just one example, infant mortality in Germany in 1900 was just over 20 percent; or, in other words, one in five children died before reaching the age of one year. By 1913, it was 15 percent; and by 1929 (when average real purchasing power was not significantly higher than in 1913) it was only 9.7 percent.93 The expansion of infant health programs— an enormously ambitious, bureaucratic, medicalizing, and sometimes intrusive, social engineering project— had a great deal to do with that change. It would be bizarre to write a history of biopolitical modernity that ruled out an appreciation for how absolutely wonderful and astonishing this achievement— and any number of others like it — really was. There was a reason for the “Machbarkeitswahn” of the early twentieth century: many marvelous things were in fact becoming machbar. In that sense, it is not really accurate to call it a “Wahn” (delusion, craziness) at all; nor is it accurate to focus only on the “inevitable” frustration of “delusions” of power. Even in the late 1920s, many social engineers could and did look with great satisfaction on the changes they genuinely had the power to accomplish.<br />

Our politics is necessary to celebrating life. The alternative denies our potential to affirm life and condemns others to unnecessary suffering. Star this card<br />
May ‘5 (Todd May, prof @ Clemson. “To change the world, to celebrate life,” Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism 2005 Vol 31 nos 5–6 pp. 517–531)<br />
To change the world and to celebrate life. This, as the theologian Harvey Cox saw, is the struggle within us. It is a struggle in which one cannot choose sides; or better, a struggle in which one must choose both sides. The abandonment of one for the sake of the other can lead only to disaster or callousness. Forsaking the celebration of life for the sake of changing the world is the path of the sad revolutionary. In his preface to Anti-Oedipus, Foucault writes that one does not have to be sad in order to he revolutionarv. The matter is more urgent than that, however. One cannot be both sad and revolutionary lacking a sense of the wondrous that is already here, among us, one who is bent upon changing the world can only become solemn or bitter. He or she is focused only on the future; the present is what is to be overcome. The vision of what is not but must come to be overwhelms all else, and the point of change itself becomes lost. The history of the left in the 20th century offers numerous examples of this, and the disaster that attends to it should be evident to all of us by now. The alternative is surely not to shift one’s allegiance to the pure celebration of life, although there are many who have chosen this path. It is at best blindness not to see the misery that envelops so many of our fellow humans, to say nothing of what happens to sentient nonhuman creatures. The attempt to jettison world-changing for an uncritical assent to the world as it is requires a self-deception that I assume would be anathema for those of us who have studied Foucault. Indeed, it is anathema for all of us who awaken each day to an America whose expansive boldness is matched only by an equally expansive disregard for those we place in harm’s way. This is the struggle, then. The one between the desire for life celebration and the desire for world-changing. The struggle between reveling in the contingent and fragile joys that constitute our world and wresting it from its intolerability. I am sure it is a struggle that is not foreign to anyone who is reading this. I am sure as well that the stakes for choosing one side over another that I have recalled here are obvious to everyone. The question then becomes one of how to choose both sides at once. III Maybe it happens this way. You walk into a small meeting room at the back of a local bookstore. There are eight or ten people milling about. They’re dressed in dark clothes, nothing fancy, and one or two of them have earrings or dreadlocks. They vary in age. You don’t know any of them. You’ve never seen them before. Several of them seem to know one another. They are affectionate, hugging, letting a hand linger on a shoulder or an elbow. A younger man, tall and thin, with an open face and a blue baseball cap bearing no logo, glides into the room. Two others, a man and a woman, shout, ‘Tim!’ and he glides over to them and hugs them, one at a time. They tell him how glad they are that he could make it, and he says that he just got back into town and heard about the meeting. You stand a little off to the side. Nobody has taken a seat at the rectangle of folding tables yet. You don’t want to be the first to sit down. Tim looks around the room and smiles. Several other people filter in. You’re not quite sure where to put your hands so you slide them into your jean pockets. You hunch your shoulders. Tim’s arrival has made you feel more of an outsider. But then he sees you. He edges his way around several others and walks up to you and introduces himself. You respond. Tim asks and you tell him that this is your first time at a meeting like this. He doesn’t ask about politics but about where you’re from. He tells you he has a friend in that neighborhood and do you know . . . ? Then several things happen that you only vaguely notice because you’re talking with Tim. People start to sit down at the rectangle of tables. One of them pulls out a legal pad with notes on it. She sits at the head of the rectangle; or rather, when she sits down there, it becomes the head. And there’s something you don’t notice at all. You are more relaxed, your shoulders have stopped hunching, and when you sit down the seat feels familiar. The woman at the head of the table looks around. She smiles; her eyes linger over you and a couple of others that you take to be new faces, like yours. She says, ‘Maybe we should begin.’ IV I can offer only a suggestion of an answer here today. It is a suggestion that brings together some thoughts from the late writings of Maurice Merleau-Ponty with those of Foucault, in order to sketch not even a framework for thought, but the mere outlines of a framework. It is not a framework that would seek to find the unconscious of each in the writings of the other. Neither thinker finishes or accomplishes the other. (Often, for example regarding methodology, they do not even agree.) Rather, it is a framework that requires both of them, from their very different angles, in order to be able to think it. My goal in constructing the outlines of this framework is largely philosophical. That is to say, the suggestion I would like to make here is not one for resolving for each of us the struggle of life-celebration and world-changing, but of offering a way to conceive ourselves that allows us to embrace both sides of this battle at the same time. Given the thinkers I have chosen as reference points, it will be no surprise when I say that that conception runs through the body. Let me start with Merleau-Ponty. In his last writings, particularly in The Visible and the Invisible, he offers a conception of the body that is neither at odds nor even entangled with the world, but is of the very world itself. His concept of the flesh introduces a point of contact that is also a point of undifferentiation. The flesh, Merleau-Ponty writes, ‘is the coiling over of the visible upon the seeing body, of the tangible upon the touching body, which is attested in particular when the body sees itself, touches itself seeing and touching the things, such that, as tangible it descends among them’.2 We must recall this economy of the flesh before we turn to Foucault. There is, for Merleau-Ponty, a single Being. Our world is of that Being, and we are of our world. We are not something that confronts the world from outside, but are born into it and do not leave it. This does not mean that we cannot remove ourselves from the immediacy of its grasp. What it means is that to remove ourselves from that immediacy is neither the breaking of a bond nor the discovery of an original dichotomy or dualism. What is remarkable about human beings is precisely our capacity to confront the world, to reflect upon it, understand it, and change it, while still being of a piece with it. To grasp this remarkable character, it is perhaps worth recalling Gilles Deleuze’s concept of the fold. The world is not composed of different parts; there is no transcendent, whether of God or of subjectivity. The world is one. As Deleuze sometimes says, being is univocal. This oneness is not, however, inert or inanimate. Among other things, it can fold over on itself, creating spaces that are at once insides and outsides, at once different from and continuous with one another. The flesh is a fold of Being in this sense. It is of the world, and yet encounters it as if from a perceptual or cognitive distance. It is a visibility that sees, a tangible that touches, an audible that hears. Merleau- Ponty writes: There is vision, touch when a certain visible, a certain tangible, turns back upon the whole of the visible, the whole of the tangible, of which it is a part, or when suddenly it finds itself surrounded by them, or when between it and them, and through their commerce, is formed a Visibility, a Tangible in itself, which belong properly neither to the body qua fact nor to the world qua fact . . . and which therefore form a couple, a couple more real than either of them.3 For Merleau-Ponty, thought and reflection do not attach themselves to this flesh from beyond it, but arise through it. As our body is of this world, our thought is of our bodies, its language of a piece with the world it addresses. ‘[I]f we were to make completely explicit the architectonics of the human body, its ontological framework, and how it sees itself and hears itself, we would see the possibilities of language already given in it.’4 This conception of the body as flesh of the world is not foreign to Foucault, although of course the terms Merleau-Ponty uses are not his. We might read Foucault’s politics as starting from here, inaugurated at the point of undifferentiation between body and world. The crucial addition he would make is that that point of undifferentiation is not historically inert. The body/world nexus is inscribed in a history that leaves its traces on both at the same time, and that crosses the border of the flesh and reaches the language that arises from it, and the thought that language expresses. How does this work?V Maybe it doesn’t happen that way. Maybe it happens another way. Maybe you walk into a room at a local community center. The room is large, but there aren’t many people, at least yet. There’s a rectangular table in the center, and everyone is sitting around it. A couple of people look up as you walk in. They nod slightly. You nod back, even more slightly. At the head of the table is someone with a legal pad. She does not look up. She is reading the notes on the pad, making occasional marks with the pen in her right hand. Other people come in and take places at the table. One or two of them open laptop computers and look for an outlet. Eventually, the table fills up and people start sitting in chairs behind the table. Your feel as though you’re in an inner circle where you don’t belong. You wonder whether you should give up your chair and go sit on the outside with the others who are just coming in now. Maybe people notice you, think you don’t belong there. At this moment you’d like to leave. You begin to feel at once large and small, visually intrusive and an object of scrutiny. You don’t move because maybe this is OK after all. You just don’t know. The room is quiet. A couple of people cough. Then the woman seated at the head of the table looks up. She scans the room as if taking attendance. She says, ‘Maybe we should begin.’ VI Merleau-Ponty’s discussion of the body as flesh is an ontological one. Although he does not see the body as remote from its historical inscription, his discussion does not incorporate the role such inscription plays. For a body to be of the world is also for it to be temporal, to be encrusted in the continuous emerging of the world over time. And this emerging is not abstract; rather, it is concrete. The body/world nexus evolves during particular historical periods. This fold of the flesh, this body, is not nowhere and at any time. It is there, then; or it is here, now. A body is entangled within a web of specific events and relations that, precisely because it is of this world, are inescapably a part of that body’s destiny. As Merleau-Ponty tells us in Phenomenology of Perception, ‘our open and personal existence rests on an initial foundation of acquired and stabilized existence. But it could not be otherwise, if we are temporality, since the dialectic of acquisition and future is what constitutes time.’5 The medium for the body’s insertion into a particular net of events and relations is that of social practices. Our bodies are not first and foremost creatures of the state or the economy, no more than they are atomized wholes distinct from the world they inhabit. Or better, they are creatures of the state and the economy inasmuch as those appear through social practices, through the everyday practices that are the ether of our lives. Social practices are the sedimentation of history at the level of the body. When I teach, when I write this article, when I run a race or teach one of my children how to ride a bicycle, my body is oriented in particular ways, conforming to or rejecting particular norms, responding to the constraints and restraints of those practices as they have evolved in interaction with other practices over time. Through its engagement in these practices, my body has taken on a history that is not of my making but is nevertheless part of my inheritance. It is precisely because, as Merleau-Ponty has written, the body and the world are not separate things but rather in a chiasmic relation that we can think this inheritance. And it is because of Foucault’s histories that we can recognize that this inheritance is granted through specific social practices. And of course, as Foucault has taught us, social practices are where the power is. It is not, or not simply, at the level of the state or the modes of production where power arises. It is, as he sometimes puts it, at the capillaries. One of the lessons of Discipline and Punish is that, if the soul is the prison of the body, this is because the body is inserted into a set of practices that create for it a soul. These practices are not merely the choices of an individual whose thought surveys the world from above, but instead the fate of a body that is of a particular world at a particular time and place. Moreover, these practices are not merely in service to a power that exists outside of them; they are mechanisms of power in their own right. It is not because Jeremy Bentham disliked the prison population that the Panopticon became a grid for thinking about penal institutions. It is instead because the evolution of penal practices at that time created an opening for the economy of visibility that the Panopticon represented. When Foucault writes that . . . the soul has a reality, it is produced permanently around, on, within the body by the functioning of a power that is exercised on those punished – and, in a more general way, on those one supervises, trains and corrects, over madmen, children at home and at school, the colonized, over those who are stuck at a machine and supervised for the rest of their lives6 his claim is informed by four other ones that lie behind it: that bodies are of a piece with the world, that the body/world nexus is a temporal one, that the medium of that corporeal temporality is the practices a body is engaged in, and that that medium is political as well as social. The last three claims are, of course, of the framework of Foucault’s thought. The first one is the ontological scaffolding provided by Merleau-Ponty. And it is by means of all four that we can begin to conceive things so as to be able to choose both world-changing and lifecelebrating at the same time. VII It could happen yet another way. Increasingly, it does. There is no meeting. There are no tables and no legal pads. Nobody sits down in a room together, at least nobody sits down at a place you know about. There may not even be a leaflet. Maybe you just got an email that was forwarded by someone you know slightly and who thought you might be interested. At the bottom there’s a link, in case you want to unsubscribe. If you don’t unsubscribe you get more notices, with petitions to sign or times and places for rallies or teach-ins or marches. Maybe there’s also a link for feedback or a list for virtual conversations or suggestions. If you show up, it’s not to something you put together but to something that was already in place before you arrived. How did you decide on this rally or teach-in? You sat in front of your computer screen, stared at it, pondering. Maybe you emailed somebody you know, asking for their advice. Is it worth going? If it’s on campus you probably did. It matters who will see you, whether you have tenure, how much you’ve published. There are no Tims here. You’ve decided to go. If it’s a teach-in, you’ve got plausible deniability; you’re just there as an observer. If it’s a rally, you can stand to the side. But maybe you won’t do that. The issue is too important. You don’t know the people who will be there, but you will stand among them, walk among them. You will be with them, in some way. Bodies at the same time and place. You agree on the issue, but it’s a virtual agreement, one that does not come through gestures or words but through sharing the same values and the same internet connections. As you march, as you stand there, nearly shoulder to shoulder with others of like mind, you’re already somewhere else, telling this story to someone you know, trying to get them to understand the feeling of solidarity that you are projecting back into this moment. You say to yourself that maybe you should have brought a friend along. There are many ways to conceive the bond between world-changing and life-celebrating. Let me isolate two: one that runs from Merleau-Ponty to Foucault, from the body’s chiasmic relation with the world to the politics of its practices; and the other one running back in the opposite direction. The ontology Merleau-Ponty offers in his late work is one of wonder. Abandoning the sterile philosophical debates about the relation of mind and body, subject and object, about the relation of reason to that which is not reason, or the problem of other minds, his ontology forges a unity of body and world that puts us in immediate contact with all of its aspects. No longer are we to be thought the self-enclosed creatures of the philosophical tradition. We are now in touch with the world, because we are of it. Art, for example, does not appeal solely to our minds; its beauty is not merely a matter of the convergence of our faculties. We are moved by art, often literally moved, because our bodies and the work of art share the same world. As Merleau-Ponty says, ‘I would be at great pains to say where is the painting I am looking at. For I do not look at it as I do a thing; I do not fix it in its place. My gaze wanders in it as in the halos of Being. It is more accurate to say that I see according to it, or with it, than that I see it.’7 It is only because my body is a fold of this world that art can affect me so. But this affection is also a vulnerability. As my look can happen according to a work of art, so it can happen according to a social practice. And even more so in proportion as that social practice and its effects are suffused through the world in which I carry on my life, the world my body navigates throughout the day, every day. I do not have a chance to look according to a painting by Cezanne very often; but I do encounter the effects of normalization as it has filtered through the practices of my employment, of my students’ upbringing, and of my family’s expectations of themselves and one another. The vulnerability of the body, then, is at once its exposure to beauty and its opening to what is intolerable. We might also see things from the other end, starting from politics and ending at the body. I take it that this is what Foucault suggests when he talks about bodies and pleasures at the end of the first volume of the History of Sexuality. If we are a product of our practices and the conception of ourselves and the world that those practices have fostered, so to change our practices is to experiment in new possibilities both for living and, inseparably, for conceiving the world. To experiment in sexuality is not to see where the desire that lies at the core of our being may lead us; that is simply the continuation of our oppression by other means. Rather, it is to construct practices where what is at issue is no longer desire but something else, something that might go by the name of bodies and pleasures. In doing so, we not only act differently, we think differently, both about ourselves and about the world those selves are inseparable from. And because these experiments are practices of our bodies, and because our bodies are encrusted in the world, these experiments become not merely acts of political resistance but new folds in the body/ world nexus. To construct new practices is to appeal to aspects or possibilities of the world that have been previously closed to us. It is to offer novel, and perhaps more tolerable, engagements in the chiasm of body and world. Thus we might say of politics what Merleau-Ponty has said of painting, that we see according to it. Here, I take it, is where the idea of freedom in Foucault lies. For Foucault, freedom is not a metaphysical condition. It does not lie in the nature of being human, nor is it a warping, an atomic swerve, in the web of causal relations in which we find ourselves. To seek our freedom in a space apart from our encrustation in the world is not so much to liberate ourselves from its influence as to build our own private prison. Foucault once said: There’s an optimism that consists in saying that things couldn’t be better. My optimism would consist rather in saying that so many things can be changed, fragile as they are, bound up more with circumstances than with necessities, more arbitrary than self-evident, more a matter of complex, but temporary, historical circumstances than with inevitable anthropological constraints . . .8 That is where to discover our freedom. And what happens from there? From the meetings, from the rallies, from the petitions and the teach-ins? What happens next? There is, after all, always a next. If you win this time – end aid to the contras, divest from apartheid South Africa, force debt-forgiveness by technologically advanced countries – there is always more to do. There is the de-unionization of workers, there are gay rights, there is Burma, there are the Palestinians, the Tibetans. There will always be Tibetans, even if they aren’t in Tibet, even if they aren’t Asian. But is that the only question: Next? Or is that just the question we focus on? What’s the next move in this campaign, what’s the next campaign? Isn’t there more going on than that? After all, engaging in political organizing is a practice, or a group of practices. It contributes to making you who you are. It’s where the power is, and where your life is, and where the intersection of your life and those of others (many of whom you will never meet, even if it’s for their sake that you’re involved) and the buildings and streets of your town is. This moment when you are seeking to change the world, whether by making a suggestion in a meeting or singing at a rally or marching in silence or asking for a signature on a petition, is not a moment in which you don’t exist. It’s not a moment of yours that you sacrifice for others so that it no longer belongs to you. It remains a moment of your life, sedimenting in you to make you what you will become, emerging out of a past that is yours as well. What will you make of it, this moment? How will you be with others, those others around you who also do not cease to exist when they begin to organize or to protest or to resist? The illusion is to think that this has nothing to do with you. You’ve made a decision to participate in world-changing. Will that be all there is to it? Will it seem to you a simple sacrifice, for this small period of time, of who you are for the sake of others? Are you, for this moment, a political ascetic? Asceticism like that is dangerous. Freedom lies not in our distance from the world but in the historically fragile and contingent ways we are folded into it, just as we ourselves are folds of it. If we take Merleau-Ponty’s Being not as a rigid foundation or a truth behind appearances but as the historical folding and refolding of a univocity, then our freedom lies in the possibility of other foldings. Merleau-Ponty is not insensitive to this point. His elusive concept of the invisible seems to gesture in this direction. Of painting, he writes: the proper essence of the visible is to have a layer of invisibility in the strict sense, which it makes present as a certain absence . . . There is that which reaches the eye directly, the frontal properties of the visible; but there is also that which reaches it from below . . . and that which reaches it from above . . . where it no longer participates in the heaviness of origins but in free accomplishments.9 Elsewhere, in The Visible and the Invisible, he says: if . . . the surface of the visible, is doubled up over its whole extension with an invisible reserve; and if, finally, in our flesh as the flesh of things, the actual, empirical, ontic visible, by a sort of folding back, invagination, or padding, exhibits a visibility, a possibility that is not the shadow of the actual but its principle . . . an interior horizon and an exterior horizon between which the actual visible is a partitioning and which, nonetheless, open indefinitely only upon other visibles . . .10 What are we to make of these references? We can, to be sure, see the hand of Heidegger in them. But we may also, and for present purposes more relevantly, see an intersection with Foucault’s work on freedom. There is an ontology of freedom at work here, one that situates freedom not in the private reserve of an individual but in the unfinished character of any historical situation. There is more to our historical juncture, as there is to a painting, than appears to us on the surface of its visibility. The trick is to recognize this, and to take advantage of it, not only with our thoughts but with our lives. And that is why, in the end, there can be no such thing as a sad revolutionary. To seek to change the world is to offer a new form of life-celebration. It is to articulate a fresh way of being, which is at once a way of seeing, thinking, acting, and being acted upon. It is to fold Being once again upon itself, this time at a new point, to see what that might yield. There is, as Foucault often reminds us, no guarantee that this fold will not itself turn out to contain the intolerable. In a complex world with which we are inescapably entwined, a world we cannot view from above or outside, there is no certainty about the results of our experiments. Our politics are constructed from the same vulnerability that is the stuff of our art and our daily practices. But to refuse to experiment is to resign oneself to the intolerable; it is to abandon both the struggle to change the world and the opportunity to celebrate living within it. And to seek one aspect without the other – life-celebration without world-changing, world-changing without life-celebration – is to refuse to acknowledge the chiasm of body and world that is the wellspring of both. If we are to celebrate our lives, if we are to change our world, then perhaps the best place to begin to think is our bodies, which are the openings to celebration and to change, and perhaps the point at which the war within us that I spoke of earlier can be both waged and resolved. That is the fragile beauty that, in their different ways, both Merleau- Ponty and Foucault have placed before us. The question before us is whether, in our lives and in our politics, we can be worthy of it. So how might you be a political body, woven into the fabric of the world as a celebrator and as a changer? You went to the meeting, and then to the demonstration. How was it there? Were the bodies in harmony or in counterpoint? Did you sing with your feet, did your voice soar? Did your mind come alive? Did you see possibilities you had not seen before? Were there people whose words or clothes, or even the way they walked hand in hand (how long has it been since you’ve walked hand in hand with someone out in public?) offer you a possibility, or make you feel alive as well as righteous? And how about those people off to the side, the ones on the sidewalk watching? Maybe they just stared, or maybe nodded as you went past. Or maybe some of them shouted at you to stop blocking the streets with your nonsense. Did you recoil within yourself, see yourself as in a mirror, or as the person at Sartre’s keyhole who’s just been caught? Did you feel superior to them, smug in your knowledge? Or did they, too, show you something you might learn from? Are they you at another moment, a moment in the past or in the future? Are they your parents that you have not explained to, sat down beside, or just shared a meal with? That one over there, the old man slightly stooped in the long overcoat: whom does he remind you of? What message might he have unwittingly brought for you? And why does it have to be a demonstration? You go to a few meetings, a few more demonstrations. You write some letters to legislators. You send an email to the President. And then more meetings. The next thing you know, you’re involved in a political campaign. By then you may have stopped asking why. This is how it goes: demonstrations, meetings with legislators, internet contacts. Does it have to be like this? Are demonstrations and meetings your only means? Do they become, sooner or later, not only means but ends? And what kinds of ends? In some sense they should always be ends: a meeting is a celebration, after all. But there are other ends as well. You go to the meeting because that fulfills your obligation to your political conscience. Does it come to that? There are other means, other ends. Other means/ends. Some people ride bicycles, en masse, slowly through crowded urban streets. You want environmentalism? Then have it. The streets are beautiful with their tall corniced buildings and wide avenues. To ride a bike through these streets instead of hiding in the armor of a car would be exhilarating. If enough of you do it together it would make for a pleasant ride, as well as a little lived environmentalism. Would you want to call it a demonstration? Would it matter? There are others as well who do other things with their bodies, more dangerous things. Some people have gone to Palestine in order to put their bodies between the Palestinians and the Israeli soldiers and settlers who attack them. They lie down next to Palestinians in front of the bulldozers that would destroy homes or build a wall through a family’s olive orchard. They feel the bodies of those they are in solidarity with. They smell the soil of Palestine as they lay there. Sometimes, they are harmed by it. A young woman, Rachel Corrie, was deliberately crushed by a US bulldozer operated by an Israeli soldier as she kneeled in front of a Palestinian home, hoping to stop its demolition. To do politics with one’s body can be like this. To resist, to celebrate, is also to be vulnerable. The world that you embrace, the world of which you are a part, can kill you too. And so you experiment. You try this and you try that. You are a phenomenologist and a genealogist. You sense what is around you, attend to the way your body is encrusted in your political involvements. And you know that that sensing has its own history, a history that often escapes you even as it envelops you. There is always more to what you are, and to what you are involved in, than you can know. So you try to keep vigilant, seeking the possibilities without scorning the realities. It’s a difficult balance. You can neglect it if you like. Many do. But your body is there, woven into the fabric of all the other bodies, animate and inanimate. Whether you like it or not, whether you recognize it or not. The only question is whether you will take up the world that you are of, or leave it to others, to those others who would be more than willing to take your world up for you.<br />

Suffering is not part of the human condition but a result of circumstances. Even if some suffering is inevitable there are degrees<br />

Suffering is the theme of two of my published papers, which both examine the question of how philosophy should respond to suffering. Suffering is a mode of living one's body that usually takes into account the ontic features that impact the body. Social and political events are often the cause of suffering, even if the event is painted as natural (example, famine, cancer whose causes are usually greater than just natural). Suffering is often where the body and the social-liguistic order that Foucault talks about meet. Many of the examples that Foucault talks about are examples of suffering, even though he dispassionately displays it without showing the effects of the individual consciousness. Maybe Foucault with a touch more phenomenology is what I'm after. Also, many of the cases of oppression and human rights violations that I deal with in my teaching are examples of suffering to greater or lesser degrees. One challenge that I face as I continue to try to define suffering is how to give an account of suffering and what constitutes suffering. Will the criteria be subjective or objective? Is suffering relative (say between the West and the developing world)? Can we legitimately compare the suffering of different individuals or groups? All good questions. I could argue along with Adorno that suffering is not natural nor is it a permanent feature of the human condition, but is primarily caused by social and political events and conditions. However, I might want to argue something like there are some seemingly permanent features of this social-political landscape that cause everyone to suffer, but to different degrees (e.g., gender). I'm looking forward to exploring this further.<br />

Discursive focus ignores material conditions and structures – this turns the K – only a more pragmatic approach solves<br />
Rigakos and Law 9 (George, Assistant Professor of Law at Carleton University, and Alexandra, Carleton University, “Risk, Realism and the Politics of Resistance”, Critical Sociology 35(1) 79-103, dml)<br />
McCann and March (1996: 244) next set out the ‘justification for treating everyday practices as significant’ suggested by the above literature. First, the works studied are concerned with proving people are not ‘duped’ by their surroundings. At the level of consciousness, subjects ‘are ironic, critical, realistic, even sophisticated’ (1996: 225). But McCann and March remind us that earlier radical or Left theorists have made similar arguments without resorting to stories of everyday resistance in order to do so. Second, everyday resistance on a discursive level is said to reaffirm the subject’s dignity. But this too causes a problem for the authors because they: query why subversive ‘assertions of self ’ should bring dignity and psychological empowerment when they produce no greater material benefits or changes in relational power … By standards of ‘realism’, … subjects given to avoidance and ‘lumping it’ may be the most sophisticated of all. (1996: 227) Thus, their criticism boils down to two main points. First, everyday resistance fails to tell us any more about so-called false consciousness than was already known among earlier Left theorists; and second, that a focus on discursive resistance ignores the role of material conditions in helping to shape identity. Indeed, absent a broader political struggle or chance at effective resistance it would seem to the authors that ‘powerlessness is learned out of the accumulated experiences of futility and entrapment’ (1996: 228). A lamentable prospect, but nonetheless a source of closure for the governmentality theorist. In his own meta-analysis of studies on resistance, Rubin (1996: 242) finds that ‘discursive practices that neither alter material conditions nor directly challenge broad structures<br />

 Plan solves debris hitting Russian Early Warning System – impact is exctinction<br />
Lewis, ‘4 – postdoctoral fellow in the Advanced Metods of Cooperative Study Program; worked in the office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy [Jeffrey, Center for Defense Information, “What if Space were Weaponized?” July 2004, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:3847:http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/scenarios.pdf --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/scenarios.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/PDFs/scenarios.pdf</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:3847 -->]<br />
This is the second of two scenarios that consider how U.S. space weapons might create incentives for America’s opponents to behave in dangerous ways. The previous scenario looked at the systemic risk of accidents that could arise from keeping nuclear weapons on high alert to guard against a space weapons attack. This section focuses on the risk that a single accident in space, such as a piece of space debris striking a Russian early-warning satellite, might be the catalyst for an accidental nuclear war. As we have noted in an earlier section, the United States canceled its own ASAT program in the 1980s over concerns that the deployment of these weapons might be deeply destabiliz- ing. For all the talk about a “new relationship” between the United States and Russia, both sides retain thousands of nuclear forces on alert and con•gured to •ght a nuclear war. When briefed about the size and status of U.S. nuclear forces, President George W. Bush reportedly asked “What do we need all these weapons for?”43 The answer, as it was during the Cold War, is that the forces remain on alert to conduct a number of possible contingencies, including a nuclear strike against Russia. This fact, of course, is not lost on the Rus- sian leadership, which has been increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons to compensate for the country’s declining military might. In the mid-1990s, Russia dropped its pledge to refrain from the “•rst use” of nuclear weapons and conducted a series of exercises in which Russian nuclear forces prepared to use nuclear weapons to repel a NATO invasion. In October 2003, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov reiter- ated that Moscow might use nuclear weapons “preemptively” in any number of contingencies, including a NATO attack.44 So, it remains business as usual with U.S. and Russian nuclear forces. And business as usual includes the occasional false alarm of a nuclear attack. There have been several of these incidents over the years. In September 1983, as a relatively new Soviet early-warning satellite moved into position to monitor U.S. missile •elds in North Dakota, the sun lined up in just such a way as to fool the Russian satellite into reporting that half a dozen U.S. missiles had been launched at the Soviet Union. Perhaps mindful that a brand new satel- lite might malfunction, the of•cer in charge of the command center that monitored data from the early-warning satellites refused to pass the alert to his superiors. He reportedly explained his caution by saying: “When people start a war, they don’t start it with only •ve missiles. You can do little damage with just •ve missiles.”45 In January 1995, Norwegian scientists launched a sounding rocket on a trajectory similar to one that a U.S. Trident missile might take if it were launched to blind Russian radars with a high altitude nuclear detonation. The incident was apparently serious enough that, the next day, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated that he had activated his “nuclear football” – a device that allows the Russian president to communicate with his military advisors and review his options for launching his arsenal. In this case, the Russian early-warning satellites could clearly see that no attack was under way and the crisis passed without incident.46 In both cases, Russian observers were con•-dent that what appeared to be a “small” attack was not a fragmentary picture of a much larger one. In the case of the Norwegian sounding rocket, space-based sensors played a crucial role in assuring the Russian leadership that it was not under attack. The Russian command sys-tem, however, is no longer able to provide such reliable, early warning. The dissolution of the Soviet Union cost Moscow several radar stations in newly independent states, creating “attack cor-ridors” through which Moscow could not see an attack launched by U.S. nuclear submarines.47 Further, Russia’s constellation of early-warn-ing satellites has been allowed to decline – only one or two of the six satellites remain operational, leaving Russia with early warning for only six hours a day. Russia is attempting to reconstitute its constellation of early-warning satellites, with several launches planned in the next few years. But Russia will still have limited warning and will depend heavily on its space-based systems to provide warning of an American attack.48 As the previous section explained, the Penta- gon is contemplating military missions in space that will improve U.S. ability to cripple Russian nuclear forces in a crisis before they can execute an attack on the United States. Anti-satellite weapons, in this scenario, would blind Russian reconnaissance and warning satellites and knock out communications satellites. Such strikes might be the prelude to a full-scale attack, or a limited ef- fort, as attempted in a war game at Schriever Air Force Base, to conduct “early deterrence strikes” to signal U.S. resolve and control escalation.49 By 2010, the United States may, in fact, have an arsenal of ASATs (perhaps even on orbit 24/7) ready to conduct these kinds of missions – to coerce opponents and, if necessary, support preemptive attacks. Moscow would certainly have to worry that these ASATs could be used in conjunction with other space-enabled systems – for example, long-range strike systems that could attack targets in less than 90 minutes – to disable Russia’s nuclear deterrent before the Rus- sian leadership understood what was going on. What would happen if a piece of space debris were to disable a Russian early-warning satel-lite under these conditions? Could the Russian military distinguish between an accident in space and the •rst phase of a U.S. attack? Most Russian early-warning satellites are in elliptical Molniya orbits (a few are in GEO) and thus dif•cult to attack from the ground or air. At a minimum, Moscow would probably have some tactical warn-ing of such a suspicious launch, but given the sorry state of Russia’s warning, optical imaging and signals intelligence satellites there is reason to ask the question. Further, the advent of U.S. on-orbit ASATs, as now envisioned50 could make both the more dif•cult orbital plane and any warning systems moot. The unpleasant truth is that the Russians likely would have to make a judgment call. No state has the ability to de•nitively deter-mine the cause of the satellite’s failure. Even the United States does not maintain (nor is it likely to have in place by 2010) a sophisticated space surveillance system that would allow it to distinguish between a satellite malfunction, a debris strike or a deliberate attack – and Russian space surveillance capabilities are much more limited by comparison. Even the risk assessments for col-lision with debris are speculative, particularly for the unique orbits in which Russian early-warning satellites operate. During peacetime, it is easy to imagine that the Russians would conclude that the loss of a satellite was either a malfunction or a debris strike. But how con•dent could U.S. planners be that the Russians would be so calm if the accident in space occurred in tandem with a second false alarm, or occurred during the middle of a crisis? What might happen if the debris strike oc-curred shortly after a false alarm showing a mis-sile launch? False alarms are appallingly common – according to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) experienced 1,172 “moderately seri-ous” false alarms between 1977 and 1983 – an average of almost three false alarms per week. Comparable information is not available about the Russian system, but there is no reason to believe that it is any more reliable.51 Assessing the likelihood of these sorts of co- incidences is dif•cult because Russia has never provided data about the frequency or duration of false alarms; nor indicated how seriously early- warning data is taken by Russian leaders. More- over, there is no reliable estimate of the debris risk for Russian satellites in highly elliptical orbits.52 The important point, however, is that such a coincidence would only appear suspicious if the United States were in the business of disabling satellites – in other words, there is much less risk if Washington does not develop ASATs. The loss of an early-warning satellite could look rather ominous if it occurred during a period of major tension in the relationship. While NATO no longer sees Russia as much of a threat, the same cannot be said of the converse. Despite the warm talk, Russian leaders remain wary of NATO expansion, particularly the effect expan- sion may have on the Baltic port of Kaliningrad. Although part of Russia, Kaliningrad is separated from the rest of Russia by Lithuania and Poland. Russia has already complained about its decreas- ing lack of access to the port, particularly the uncooperative attitude of the Lithuanian govern- ment.53 News reports suggest that an edgy Russia may have moved tactical nuclear weapons into the enclave.54 If the Lithuanian government were to close access to Kaliningrad in a •t of pique, this would trigger a major crisis between NATO and Russia. Under these circumstances, the loss of an early-warning satellite would be extremely suspi-cious. It is any military’s nature during a crisis to interpret events in their worst-case light. For ex- ample, consider the coincidences that occurred in early September 1956, during the extraordinarily tense period in international relations marked by the Suez Crisis and Hungarian uprising.55 On one evening the White House received messages indicating: 1. the Turkish Air Force had gone on alert in response to unidenti•ed aircraft penetrat- ing its airspace; 2. one hundred Soviet MiG-15s were •ying over Syria; 3. a British Canberra bomber had been shot down over Syria, most likely by a MiG; and 4. The Russian •eet was moving through the Dardanelles. Gen. Andrew Goodpaster was reported to have worried that the con•uence of events “might trigger off … the NATO operations plan” that called for a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. Yet, all of these reports were false. The “jets” over Turkey were a •ock of swans; the Soviet MiGs over Syria were a smaller, routine escort returning the president from a state visit to Mos- cow; the bomber crashed due to mechanical dif•culties; and the Soviet •eet was beginning long-scheduled exercises. In an important sense, these were not “coincidences” but rather different manifestations of a common failure – human er- ror resulting from extreme tension of an interna- tional crisis. As one author noted, “The detection and misinterpretation of these events, against the context of world tensions from Hungary and Suez, was the •rst major example of how the size and complexity of worldwide electronic warning systems could, at certain critical times, create momentum of its own.” Perhaps most worrisome, the United States might be blithely unaware of the degree to which the Russians were concerned about its actions and inadvertently escalate a crisis. During the early 1980s, the Soviet Union suffered a major “war scare” during which time its leadership concluded that bilateral relations were rapidly declining. This war scare was driven in part by the rhetoric of the Reagan administration, forti•ed by the selective reading of intelligence. During this period, NATO conducted a major command post exercise, Able Archer, that caused some elements of the Soviet military to raise their alert status. American of•cials were stunned to learn, after the fact, that the Kremlin had been acutely nervous about an American •rst strike during this period.56 All of these incidents have a common theme – that confidence is often the difference between war and peace. In times of crisis, false alarms can have a momentum of their own. As in the second scenario in this monograph, the lesson is that commanders rely on the steady •ow of reli-able information. When that information flow is disrupted – whether by a deliberate attack or an accident – confidence collapses and the re- sult is panic and escalation. Introducing ASAT weapons into this mix is all the more dangerous, because such weapons target the elements of the command system that keep leaders aware, informed and in control. As a result, the mere presence of such weapons is corrosive to the con•dence that allows national nuclear forces to operate safely.<br />

One major focus of the conference was ESA's SSA programme, and its preparations to launch initial warning services against hazards such as solar storms and magnetic storms. Such natural phenomenon present serious hazards to all satellites in Earth orbit, astronauts on board the ISS and to some infrastructure on the ground, such as communication systems and power distribution networks at northern latitudes. Space weather experts from ESA presented the latest information on current studies to define the first space weather 'precursor services' that will be offered by the SSA system to customers such as satellite operators and developers. The first services are due to be deployed during 2011 and will be followed by more during the course of the SSA Preparatory Programme. &quot;We were very happy to include as part of this year's event, a joint session covering the main SSA space weather activities together with presentations on a broad range of new space weather-focussed R&amp;D studies supported by the European Comission. This was also the first public presentation of these studies, which will be highly complementary to our ongoing SSA work,&quot; said ESA's Alexi Glover, a space weather expert and one of the conference organizers. Solar storms generate large amounts of radiation and particles that can arrive at Earth and harm satellites within less than 24 hours. Satellites orbiting between the Sun and Earth themselves provide some of the best 'early-warning' vantage points. Another SSA study presented at ESWW7 covers identifying the instrumentation that will be needed to perform space-based space weather observations and the optimal locations from which to make these observations. In order to achieve reliable space weather warning services, constant monitoring of the space environment from a range of vantage points on ground and in space will be needed, together with timely dissemination of reliable data to customers.<br />

An aviation insurance underwriter has estimated that $500 million in satellite insurance claims from 1994 to 1999 were the direct or indirect result of space weather (NOAA 2006, cited under “Satellites” subheading). The DOD has estimated that disruptions to government satellites from space weather cost about $100 million a year (Rodgers et. al. 2000).<br />

Government demand for satellite constellations is vital to capitalizing the entire aerospace and commercial industrial base<br />
Rendleman, 10 - Colonel, U.S. Air Force (Retired), (James, Astropolitics, 8:220–255, 2010, “A Strategy for Space Assurance,” Ebsco Political Science)<br />
<br />
Given the importance of a responsive space infrastructure to space assurance, arguments in favor of such capabilities must be improved and refocused to show they also satisfy strategic and long-term needs, and serve as good economic investment. Cost-effective access can best be achieved by deploying resilient, more populous, and less-complex satellite constellations. Leveraging such architecture, individual spacecraft components could be designed and developed to be less capable, and reliable, than systems dependent on a single or small number of satellites. Reliability would be gained through redundancy. Mission and cost savings advantages could be gained through shortened development cycles that allow for spirally-developed block versions of each platform, its payload(s) and other parts of the system. Increasing the numbers of satellites on-orbit would give the economies of scale needed to support spacelift innovation and encourage investment by the commercial sector. Architectures developed for responsive small satellite systems should be able to effectively use rapidly evolving technology and process innovations. Miniaturization of components in small satellites now offers sophisticated capabilities useful for a wide variety of operational and science and technology missions, and can give the needed flexibility for designing large constellation mission architectures. LEO, multi-plane Walker constellations, insertion of multiple satellites on each launch, selection of mature technology readiness level (TRL) sensor or communication payloads and buses, block acquisition approaches, simplified platforms and busses, and common mission control and ground systems can all be employed. Constellations of simple multi-mission, combined communication-sensor satellites can be developed and deployed to achieve cost-efficient acquisition goals. Commercial and international communities are already deploying smaller, shorter-life, yet capable satellites with streamlined mission control architectures; these approaches are already cost-effectively satisfying mission needs. Acquirers must seize upon the best approaches. National security missions are amenable to LEO and small satellite systems—communications, reconnaissance, missile warning and defense, and weather. As we have seen with GPS, OrbComm, and Iridium systems, large constellations of small satellites can be effectively managed and perform vital missions; they employ well-designed Walker Constellations to provide ubiquitous 24/7 coverage of much of the globe. By operating under a concept of employment that envisions regular, not infrequent or as-needed, replenishment of space systems, decisions makers would potentially have sufficient numbers of systems on hand, or in storage, to sustain rapid reconstitution or augmentation of capabilities in response to an attempted space ‘‘Pearl Harbor’’ or other national emergency. LEO could be selected, so that on mission completion systems are de-orbited in a relatively short period of time compared to present systems in higher orbits, reducing space debris problems. Other secondary benefits could be secured with such a sustainment strategy—the U.S. aerospace industrial base, which has been suffering lately, could be re-energized with acquisition strategies that require continuous engineering improvements and innovations to large constellation space systems. This could ensure that the United States Government, and industrial and commercial base, is adequately capitalized and led, to be able to ‘‘develop and accelerate programs for rapid launch of satellites, to reconstitute lost systems, or bolster constellations in times of crisis.’’88 Costs for responsive space will be difficult to contain, while the underlying industrial base struggles to sustain, re-define, and improve itself.89 Employing large constellation acquisition, operations, and sustainment approach could provide the cost imperatives, effectiveness, resiliency, and opportunity to reconstitute that base. Thus, a responsive infrastructure would also serve as a vital part of a space assurance strategy.<br />

Environmental collapse and extinction are inevitable. A viable commercial space sector is key to get to space.<br />

Investment in low-cost orbital access and other space infrastructure will facilitate the establishment of settlements on the Moon, Mars, asteroids and in man-made space structures. In the ﬁrst phase, development of new regulatory infrastructure in various Earth orbits, including property/usufruct rights, real estate, mortgage ﬁnancing and insurance, trafﬁc management, pilotage, policing and other services will enable the population living in Earth orbits to grow very large. Such activities aimed at making near-Earth space habitable are the logical extension of humans’ historical spread over the surface of the Earth. As trade spreads through near-Earth space, settlements are likely to follow, of which the inhabitants will add to the wealth of different cultures which humans have created in the many different environments in which they live.<br />
Success of such extra-terrestrial settlements will have the additional beneﬁt of reducing the danger of human extinction due to planet-wide or cosmic accidents [27]. These horrors include both man-made disasters such as nuclear war, plagues or growing pollution, and natural disasters such as super-volcanoes or asteroid impact. It is hard to think of any objective that is more important than preserving peace. Weapons developed in recent decades are so destructive, and have such horriﬁc, long-term side-effects that their use should be discouraged as strongly as possible by the international community. Hence, reducing the incentive to use these weapons by rapidly developing the ability to use space-based resources on a large scale is surely equally important [11,16]. The achievement of this depends on low space travel costs which, at the present time, appear to be achievable only through the development of a vigorous space tourism industry.<br />
8. Summary<br />
As discussed above, if space travel services had started during the 1950s, the space industry would be enormously more developed than it is today. Hence the failure to develop passenger space travel has seriously distorted the path taken by humans’ technological and economic development since WW2, away from the path which would have been followed if capitalism and democracy operated as intended. Technological know-how which could have been used to supply services which are known to be very popular with a large proportion of the population has not been used for that purpose, while waste and suffering due to the unemployment and environmental damage caused by the resulting lack of new industrial opportunities have increased.<br />
In response, policies should be implemented urgently to correct this error, and to catch up with the possibilities for industrial and economic growth that have been ignored for so long. This policy renewal is urgent because of the growing dangers of unemployment, economic stagnation, environmental pollution, educational and cultural decline, resource wars and loss of civil liberties which face civilisation today. In order to achieve the necessary progress there is a particular need for collaboration between those working in the two ﬁelds of civil aviation and civil space. Although the word ‘‘aerospace’’ is widely used, it is largely a misnomer since these two ﬁelds are in practice quite separate. True ‘‘aerospace’’ collaboration to realise passenger space travel will develop the wonderful profusion of possibilities outlined above.<br />

<br />
It's no surprise, then, that cyberterrorism now ranks alongside other weapons of mass destruction in the public consciousness. Americans have had a latent fear of catastrophic computer attack ever since a teenage Matthew Broderick hacked into the Pentagon's nuclear weapons system and nearly launched World War III in the 1983 movie WarGames. Judging by official alarums and newspaper headlines, such scenarios are all the more likely in today's wired world. There's just one problem: There is no such thing as cyberterrorism--no instance of anyone ever having been killed by a terrorist (or anyone else) using a computer. Nor is there compelling evidence that al Qaeda or any other terrorist organization has resorted to computers for any sort of serious destructive activity. What's more, outside of a Tom Clancy novel, computer security specialists believe it is virtually impossible to use the Internet to inflict death on a large scale, and many scoff at the notion that terrorists would bother trying. &quot;I don't lie awake at night worrying about cyberattacks ruining my life,&quot; says Dorothy Denning, a computer science professor at Georgetown University and one of the country's foremost cybersecurity experts. &quot;Not only does [cyberterrorism] not rank alongside chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, but it is not anywhere near as serious as other potential physical threats like car bombs or suicide bombers.&quot; Which is not to say that cybersecurity isn't a serious problem--it's just not one that involves terrorists. Interviews with terrorism and computer security experts, and current and former government and military officials, yielded near unanimous agreement that the real danger is from the criminals and other hackers who did $15 billion in damage to the global economy last year using viruses, worms, and other readily available tools. That figure is sure to balloon if more isn't done to protect vulnerable computer systems, the vast majority of which are in the private sector. Yet when it comes to imposing the tough measures on business necessary to protect against the real cyberthreats, the Bush administration has balked.<br />
<br />
Their scenario is utterly impossible<br />

When ordinary people imagine cyberterrorism, they tend to think along Hollywood plot lines, doomsday scenarios in which terrorists hijack nuclear weapons, airliners, or military computers from halfway around the world. Given the colorful history of federal boondoggles--billion-dollar weapons systems that misfire, $600 toilet seats--that's an understandable concern. But, with few exceptions, it's not one that applies to preparedness for a cyberattack. &quot;The government is miles ahead of the private sector when it comes to cybersecurity,&quot; says Michael Cheek, director of intelligence for iDefense, a Virginia-based computer security company with government and private-sector clients. &quot;Particularly the most sensitive military systems.&quot; Serious effort and plain good fortune have combined to bring this about. Take nuclear weapons. The biggest fallacy about their vulnerability, promoted in action thrillers like WarGames, is that they're designed for remote operation. &quot;[The movie] is premised on the assumption that there's a modem bank hanging on the side of the computer that controls the missiles,&quot; says Martin Libicki, a defense analyst at the RAND Corporation. &quot;I assure you, there isn't.&quot; Rather, nuclear weapons and other sensitive military systems enjoy the most basic form of Internet security: they're &quot;air-gapped,&quot; meaning that they're not physically connected to the Internet and are therefore inaccessible to outside hackers. (Nuclear weapons also contain &quot;permissive action links,&quot; mechanisms to prevent weapons from being armed without inputting codes carried by the president.) A retired military official was somewhat indignant at the mere suggestion: &quot;As a general principle, we've been looking at this thing for 20 years. What cave have you been living in if you haven't considered this [threat]?&quot; When it comes to cyberthreats, the Defense Department has been particularly vigilant to protect key systems by isolating them from the Net and even from the Pentagon's internal network. All new software must be submitted to the National Security Agency for security testing. &quot;Terrorists could not gain control of our spacecraft, nuclear weapons, or any other type of high-consequence asset,&quot; says Air Force Chief Information Officer John Gilligan. For more than a year, Pentagon CIO John Stenbit has enforced a moratorium on new wireless networks, which are often easy to hack into, as well as common wireless devices such as PDAs, BlackBerrys, and even wireless or infrared copiers and faxes.<br />

China has overtaken the United States as the world's biggest producer of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, figures released today show. The surprising announcement will increase anxiety about China's growing role in driving man-made global warming and will pile pressure onto world politicians to agree a new global agreement on climate change that includes the booming Chinese economy. China's emissions had not been expected to overtake those from the US, formerly the world's biggest polluter, for several years, although some reports predicted it could happen as early as next year. But according to the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, soaring demand for coal to generate electricity and a surge in cement production have helped to push China's recorded emissions for 2006 beyond those from the US already. It says China produced 6,200m tonnes of CO2 last year, compared with 5,800m tonnes from the US. Britain produced about 600m tonnes.<br />

In a paper published in Systematics and Biodiversity, Willis et al. (2010) consider the IPCC (2007) &quot;predicted climatic changes for the next century&quot; -- i.e., their contentions that &quot;global temperatures will increase by 2-4°C and possibly beyond, sea levels will rise (~1 m ± 0.5 m), and atmospheric CO2will increase by up to 1000 ppm&quot; -- noting that it is &quot;widely suggested that the magnitude and rate of these changes will result in many plants and animals going extinct,&quot; citing studies that suggest that &quot;within the next century, over 35% of some biota will have gone extinct (Thomas et al., 2004; Solomon et al., 2007) and there will be extensive die-back of the tropical rainforest due to climate change (e.g. Huntingford et al., 2008).&quot; On the other hand, they indicate that some biologists and climatologists have pointed out that &quot;many of the predicted increases in climate have happened before, in terms of both magnitude and rate of change (e.g. Royer, 2008; Zachos et al., 2008), and yet biotic communities have remained remarkably resilient (Mayle and Power, 2008) and in some cases thrived (Svenning and Condit, 2008).&quot; But they report that those who mention these things are often &quot;placed in the 'climate-change denier' category,&quot; although the purpose for pointing out these facts is simply to present &quot;a sound scientific basis for understanding biotic responses to the magnitudes and rates of climate change predicted for the future through using the vast data resource that we can exploit in fossil records.&quot; Going on to do just that, Willis et al. focus on &quot;intervals in time in the fossil record when atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased up to 1200 ppm, temperatures in mid- to high-latitudes increased by greater than 4°C within 60 years, and sea levels rose by up to 3 m higher than present,&quot; describing studies of past biotic responses that indicate &quot;the scale and impact of the magnitude and rate of such climate changes on biodiversity.&quot; And what emerges from those studies, as they describe it, &quot;is evidence for rapid community turnover, migrations, development of novel ecosystems and thresholds from one stable ecosystem state to another.&quot; And, most importantly in this regard, they report &quot;there is very little evidence for broad-scale extinctions due to a warming world.&quot; In concluding, the Norwegian, Swedish and UK researchers say that &quot;based on such evidence we urge some caution in assuming broad-scale extinctions of species will occur due solely to climate changes of the magnitude and rate predicted for the next century,&quot; reiterating that &quot;the fossil record indicates remarkable biotic resilience to wide amplitude fluctuations in climate.&quot;<br />

<span class="Underline">No offense – all the risks of proliferation were triggered by the development of nukes and knowledge can’t be unlearned </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Quinlan, 1993 [Sir Michael, July, “The Future of Nuclear Weapons: Policy for Western Possessors,” International Affairs, JSTOR] </span><br />
<span class="Underline">For such reasons as these, Western thinkers and planners must, on any view, deal with a nuclear world for at least 10-15 years ahead; and their concepts and policies have to be concerned accordingly, not just with a technical task of running down and dismantling armouries, but with a continuing strategic need for disciplining and sealing off risks. There are however arguments, at a deeper and more lasting level, which suggest that the need for some war-preventing Western nuclear possession, with concepts and policies to frame it, stretches beyond the impossibility of rapid escape from present circumstances. It is a truism that the scientific and technical knowledge of how to make nuclear weapons cannot now be forgotten. We simply do not have the option of returning to a condition of pre-nuclear innocence (if innocence is an apt way of describing the mindsets and conditions which produced the two world wars). For the rest of history humanity has to live with the reality that almost any substantial and reasonably advanced independent state could eventually, if it so chose and was not forcibly prevented by others, construct a nuclear armoury to support its external goals, be they offensive or defensive. The case for building such an armoury might be especially compelling if the state found itself engaged in, or imminently facing, military conflict where the stakes were of an order it was minded to regard as vital. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Another question is the effect of a spread of nuclear weapons on smaller states. Nuclear at-tacks could have disastrous effects, but the weapons also help to deter wars in the first place. A number of scholars, starting with Viner in fall 1945 and including prominently Gallois, Waltz, and Mearsheimer, have argued that the spread of nuclear weapons can in- deed promote peace. Virtually anyone, so the argument, is deterred from using nuclear weapons if a chance of retaliation exists. Thus after acquiring them, opposing states be- come more careful in actions towards one another. As developing nuclear weapons takes time, proliferants also have time to learn moderation. Waltz expects the risk of escalation to prevent any conflicts on vital issues between NWSs and suggests that major conven- tional and nuclear arms races between new NWSs could be avoided as nuclear weapons remove the need to match an adversary’s capabilities in quantity and quality. In the right circumstances, even a small arsenal can give a second-strike capability. Only an oppo- nent’s achievement of “near-miracles” of a first-strike capability or effective nuclear de- fense would make an arsenal obsolete. Secure second-strike forces can also promote equality of power among great powers and, through clarity about relative power, success- ful balancing.23 The historic record does not contradict the proliferation optimist view. The five acknowl- edged NWSs have not waged direct war against each other after acquiring nuclear weap- ons. The Kashmir conflict did continue after India and Pakistan acquired nuclear capabili- ties and declared themselves as nuclear powers, but that conflict is a blurred border con- flict where Waltz does not argue nuclear deterrence to work. This applies also to the Arab- Israel conflict as far as areas occupied by Israel in 1967 are concerned (moreover, in this conflict, no mutual nuclear deterrence exists). </span><br />

(2010) write that &quot;increasing population and unsustainable exploitation of nature and natural resources have made 'food security' a burning issue in the 21st century,&quot; echoing sentiments much like those expressed by Farrell (2009), who has noted that &quot;the alarming increase in biofuel production, the projected demand for livestock products, and the estimated food to feed the additional 700 million people who will arrive here by 2016, will have unprecedented consequences,&quot; among which are likely to be the unsavory facts that &quot;arable land, the environment, water supply and sustainability of the agricultural system will all be affected,&quot; and not in a positive manner. Furthermore, when the human population of the globe reaches 8.7-11.3 billion by the year 2050 (Bengtsson et al., 2006), the situation will become truly intolerable, unless something is done, far in advance of that date, to dramatically mitigate the situation. Thus, as Sarkar et al. suggest, &quot;a normal approach for any nation/region is to strengthen its agricultural production for meeting future demands and provide food security.&quot; But a major difficulty, which could well spoil mankind's ability to do so, is the ongoing rise in the atmosphere's ozone concentration, which is the subject of Sarkar et al.'s new paper. In a study designed to elucidate the many ways in which ozone (O3) is harmful to plants, the eight researchers grew two high-yielding cultivars (Sonalika and HUW 510) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) out-of-doors at the Agriculture Research Farm of India's Banaras Hindu University. This was done within open-top chambers that they maintained at the ambient O3 concentration and at elevated O3 concentrations of 25% and 50% above ambient during the peak O3 period of the day (10:00 to 15:00 hours local time) for a total of fifty days, during which period they measured numerous responses of the plants to the two levels of ozone enrichment. So what did they find? Sarkar et al. determined, among several other things, that the moderate increases in the air's O3 concentration resulted in higher foliar injury, a reduction in photosynthetic efficiency, induced inhibition in photochemical efficacy of photosystem II, lowered concentrations of photosynthetic pigments and proteins, plus what they describe as &quot;drastic reductions&quot; in RuBisCO large and small subunits, while noting that major leaf photosynthetic proteins and important energy metabolism proteins were also &quot;drastically reduced.&quot; In discussing the results of their study, the scientists from India, Japan and Nepal remark that anthropogenic activities have made ozone a &quot;major environmental pollutant of our time,&quot; while noting that some are predicting it to be an even &quot;greater problem for the future.&quot; And adding this dilemma to the problem of feeding the world over the next few decades and beyond, humanity's future is not looking good. In fact, it's incredibly bleak. So what can be done to help us weather this potentially devastating perfect storm? Sarkar et al. suggest that we focus on &quot;engineering crops for future high O3,&quot; concentrating on maintaining &quot;effective stomatal conductance of plants which can avoid O3 entry but not hamper their productivity.&quot; We agree. But not knowing to what extent we will be successful in this endeavor, we need to do something else that we know will work; and that is to allow the air's CO2 content to rise, unimpeded by the misguided efforts of climate alarmists who would curtail anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the guise of fighting what they claim is anthropogenic-induced global warming. This contention is largely theoretical and wholly unproven; but we know that atmospheric CO2 enrichment nearly always acts to increase both the productivity and water use efficiency of nearly all plants, as a result of literally hundreds, if not thousands, of real-world experiments, while it often more than compensates for the negative effects of O3 pollution. Clearly, we are going to need all of the help we can possibly get to make it unscathed through even the first half of the 21st century; and we cannot afford to throw away any of the means we have at our disposal to help us in this great effort. We have got to see carbon dioxide for what it truly is -- the elixir of life: one of the two raw materials (the other being water) that combine during the process of photosynthesis to produce the substances of plant tissues that provide the food for nearly all human and animal life on the planet, either directly, in the case of herbivores, or indirectly in the case of other life forms. And that makes carbon dioxide just the opposite of what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recently declared it to be -- a dangerous air pollutant. Shame on them! ... and on all those who demonize this life-giving molecule that we expel to the air every time we exhale.<br />

GHG warming is key to prevent an ice age which risks extinction<br />
Hoyle and Wickramashinge 01 (Fred and Chandra, School of Mathematics @ Cardiff U., Astrophysics and Space Science, “Cometary Impacts and Ice-Ages”, Vol. 275, No. 4, March, Springer)<br />
The 18O/16O analysis of Greenland ice cores shows that an immense melting of glacier ice began abruptly about 14.5 kyr ago. The jumps shown in Figure 1 are also matched by similar effects in the South Polar region with major temperature rises of some 12 C occurring over a timespan of only a few decades (Steig et al., 1998). On a more restricted geographical scale, fossil insect records show that the summer temperature in Britain rose by 10 C or more in as little as 50 years (Coope, 1970) on at least two occasions during the Younger Dryas, an essentially decisive indication of a catastrophic event as its cause. It is therefore cometary impacts that we must thank for the equable spell of climate in which human history and civilisation has prospered so spectacularly. The renewal of ice-age conditions would render a large fraction of the world’s major food-growing areas inoperable, and so would inevitably lead to the extinction of most of the present human population. Since bolide impacts cannot be called up to order, we must look to a sustained greenhouse effect to maintain the present advantageous world climate. This might imply the ability to inject effective greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the opposite of what environmentalists are erroneously advocating. 6. Conclusions Ice-age conditions are dry and cold, the local temperature being reduced over the entire Earth. The high atmosphere probably had a haze of small ice crystals while the lower atmosphere was dusty. Such conditions were stable, capable of persisting until a large bolide hit one of the major oceans. The water then thrown high into the stratosphere provided a large temporary greenhouse effect, but sufficient to produce a warming of the world ocean down to a depth of a few hundred metres. It is this warming that maintains the resulting interglacial period. The interglacial climate possesses only neutral equilibrium however. It experiences random walk both up and down, until a situation arises in which the number of steps downward become sufficient for the Earth to fall back into the ice-age trap. Thereafter only a further large bolide impact can produce a departure from the grey, drab ice-age conditions. This will be so in the future unless Man finds an effective way to maintain a suitably large greenhouse effect.<br />
