<strong><span style="font-size: 120%;">Contention 1 is the Transportation Infrastructure AKA The Topic:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Along with the economic boom following the Great Depression, came a car culture where the travel patterns of men were privileged due to the role they had within their family. The 1990’s presented a pivotal shift in social roles for all genders. The model in which transportation infrastructure is designed is still one that privileges masculinity. As Queirós and Marques da Costa explain in 2012, the transportation sector is dominated by male, androcentric policies. Despite the statistics proving feminine travel patterns are more dependent on public transit, the transit systems are still focused on masculine travel patterns, and infrastructure policy is decided and engineered along those lines. That makes transportation policymaking a critical locus point for discussing gender issues.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Status quo transportation infrastructure privileges masculine norms and misrepresent what new studies are calling “the mobility of care” which makes public transportation more challenging for persons in traditionally feminine roles. The gender bias exists in contrast with the actual data of ridership patterns. In 2012, Jaffe reports that transit systems are designed for the traditional male travel patterns of the nine-to-five commute, while ignoring the burden of “care work” that falls to feminine roles. Transit systems fail to accommodate the bulk of their users, who are using them primarily for child and family care. Our transportation policy should be reoriented towards a more gender-equitable form of infrastructure.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bauhardt explains in 2004 that this bias does not only exist in the physical transit systems, but in the actual infrastructure planning process. The re-appropriation of time and space as commodities to be dominated through transportation systems is rooted in masculine ideology – we must accelerate and overcome, never satisfied to work with nature, only against it. This technical thought is pervasive in our transportation planning, converting time, space, and the idea of transport into economic resources rather than social categories. Our feminist perspective dictates a shift from a quantitative analysis of transport to a qualitative perspective that focuses on social and quality of life effects.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Karen Warren and Duane Cady have written several articles on this topic which many of us have probably read but they make very good arguments about how the masculine ideology is at the root cause of things like proliferation, environmental destruction, domestic violence, and war. They say, “… this is because of a patriarchal preoccupation with activities, events, and experiences that reflect historically [masculine] assumptions.” “Patriarchal frameworks legitimate impaired thinking which is manifested in behaviors which, will make life on earth impossible.” But even though we can, we don’t need to win some grand scale impact to outweigh whatever disadvantage the negative might present. It’s common sense and common ethics that drives our planning process.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Thus the plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment by recognizing current transportation infrastructure as gendered and reconfiguring public transportation infrastructure in the United States to be gender neutral.</strong><br />
<br />

<strong>It’s not just posturing – post-plan, there will be significant changes to actual transportation infrastructure in the United States.</strong><br />

<br />
Take, for instance, a recent transportation data set from Spain…<br />
Systems can also conduct what the researchers call &quot;gender audits&quot; to evaluate their ability to meet the transport needs of female riders.<br />
<br />
<strong>Studies show that status quo transportation infrastructure ignores a very important type of mobility – “the mobility of care.” We must recognize these in order for public transport to be equitable to all gender roles.</strong><br />

Researchers examining public transportation often categorize trips according to purpose in order to better understand existing transportation patterns and to better plan for infrastructure changes…<br />

However, if the United States can set a better example for establishing a more diversified repertoire of transportation choices, then hopefully developing countries, such as China, will follow this example rather than continuing down the more conventional but hazardous path toward auto hegemony.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>This has worked in the past – the success of incorporating feminist perspectives into their transportation infrastructure in order to make it gender neutral is proven. The incorporation of a gender perspective in transportation sector in Sweden started within the overall process of designing a policy for a sustainable transportation system. This set the stage for gender mainstreaming within the sector by presenting differences in travel patterns between masculine and feminine roles in society and noting the lack of feminist perspective in the decision-making process. A clear connection is made between the goals of gender equality and sustainable development, especially regarding equal representation and participation in societal decision-making.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The exclusion of feminist perspectives due to patriarchal domination is the root cause of racism, sexism, and all forms of oppression. Perception of sexuality is the initial split – all forms of segregation and domination are part and parcel.</strong><br />

Part of struggling against nuclear weapons involves understanding the ways in which the oppression of particular groups of people supports militarism, makes the institutionalized system of war and violence appear &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;inevitable.&quot;…<br />
When people act from a sense of informed pride in themselves and their own traditions, they will be more effective in all struggles for justice and peace.<br />
<br />
<strong>Even if we disagree on the roots of violence, we can still combine multiple struggles to spur activism against oppression</strong><br />

<br />
We could have several engaged intellectual debates going on at the same time and find ourselves joined in the fight against violence, without having to agree on many epistemological issues…<br />
Indeed, an international coalition of feminist activists and thinkers &quot; a coalition that affirms the thinking of activists and the activism of thinkers and refuses to put them into distinctive categories that deny the actual complexity of the lives in question&quot; will have to accept the array of sometimes incommensurable epistemological and political beliefs and modes and means of agency that bring us into activism.<br />

<strong>Some of you may be asking why we’re reading a plan in the first place. After all, this is St. Vincent’s, isn’t it? But we’ve learned.

<br />
The struggle for individual ethical and political autonomy, the claim for the recognition of separate 'political spaces' and for the 'incommunicability' of political causes, demonstrates the limits of the radical claims for the normative project of global civil society 'from below'…<br />
If the only alternative to the political 'game' is to threaten to 'take our ball home' the anti-politics of rejectionism, the powers that be can sleep peacefully in their beds.<br />

<br />
<strong>I’ll be honest, I love debate. We love debate. It’s an amazing activity; there is no doubt about that. Debate creates a space where young minds can discuss issues that matter to them and develop skills that are critical for their future. I know it is weird to think about it but WE are the future of this country and it is important that we use debate as something that will further assist that development. However, we shouldn’t let out admiration for the activity blind us. There are problems with the debate community. It is traditionally and still today exclusive of the feminine perspective. Our discussions are regrettably and repeatedly centered around a race to the quickest extinction impact and the most hegemonic control and domination. We as a community have allowed the proliferation of prolif impacts to overtake our real focus as policymakers and students: that is, to</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Debate has seen amazing things over the last sixty years, which have closely aligned with what was going on in society. A once young debater, Brian McBride introduced the first critical argument to policy debate, which signified that the activity was opening up to different kinds of education.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Not long ago the community started to realize that impacts no longer needed to be based exclusively off of nuclear war, and that there was an important discussion that has to be had about the different kinds of oppression going on.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>We have reached a point in policy debate where we are more liberal and willing to learn compared to anytime before this, however, there is a discussion that is still being ignored and pushed out of debate.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The discussion of gender is one that seems to be not welcome in debate. This is partially because of the masculine assumptions and norms of debate but that needs to change.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In debate the feminist perspective is violently forced out of the debate space. Don’t get us wrong, there is much discussion of different kinds of oppression but it now seems like we are fetishizing over the newest Zizek card while still ignoring a prevalent type of oppression.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>You can check the wiki - we are the only team currently reading a feminism aff.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>We honestly care about what we are talking about, but our voice needs to be heard. We are not here so we can qualify to NFL Nationals because we want a big trophy. It is more than that. We need our voices to be heard and NFL Nationals is our last chance. Even the tournament site says that it is the most prestigious tournament where everything is posted and debaters around the world are watching and listening to what is going on. What happens at Nationals is truly national – it’s the only chance we get to spread the word on a grand scale. NFLs is specifically the right tournament to break down these mindsets. Let’s face it, a historically conservative lay tournament in Alabama isn’t going to welcome the gender discussion with open arms but that’s all the more reason to bring it there and break down the doors.</strong><br />

<strong>We firmly believe that an aff ballot is not only an endorsement of our affirmative, but a door which you will open for us and debaters around the country to discuss their perspectives and what matters to them without being criticized and pushed out of the activity.</strong><br />

<strong>Discussion of feminism is key to the reinforcing the individual because in a world where we let exclusively policies dominate debate, the individual becomes disempowered because they are excluded. Our affirmative is key for the development of a new social science.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I thought I was flying to a debate tournament, but when I got here and heard the other teams start to speak, I realized I was still in the airport after all.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We begin with a discussion of the nature of airport security. The logic of preemption is a logic of racial categorization – to secure our world against the pervasive threat of terrorism we must identify the individuals who pose the greatest threat. Airport security is no longer a question of “Who is holding the bomb?” but “Which turban is hiding the bomb?”, all the while eschewing the essential question of “Is there a bomb at all?” Through mass media and state propaganda we have been assured that terrorism is inevitable in any future where we don’t conform to the static notions of identity and don’t take out our laptops to put them in a separate bin for the scanner. Through our desperate desire to predict the worst possible outcome we unconsciously adhere to accepted stereotypes of racist discrimination. We hear this in the words of an American Sikh traveler:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The most recent [incident] was at LAX airport in April 2011. I was at security for the gate that leads to American Airlines and I was returning home to New York City [via] JFK airport. I was wearing a turban with Western-style clothing, like I always do. A TSA agent asked me to step aside for additional screening. She searched through all of my bags, unpacking everything. I asked her why I was being singled out, and she said it was because I was wearing a head covering. She said it would be the same if I were wearing a baseball [cap]. I told her my turban was religious and that I don’t take it off in public. She responded rudely and said “Some people call their baseball [cap] a religion.” Then, she put on gloves and started grabbing at my turban from all angles. It really felt like a violation. She was being so rough to [the] point where she almost took my turban off. She didn’t tell me I could have done it myself and she hardly warned me when she was going to start.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The modern airport is an intrinsically securitized space – the physical and behavioral security systems exemplify the political climate of pervasive security. But this is not the defensive, observational security of Foucault’s panopticon. Danger is preemptively accounted for, not reactively addressed. The identity of the terrorist threat is constructed and applied to whomsoever the apparatus sees fit. Each passenger is reduced to a series of numbers on the screen of the biometric analyst and profiled into the rigid and racialized categories of the behavioral detection officer. The political rhetoric of inevitability and catastrophism has required the fluid adaptation of airport security to the omnipresent possibility of an explosive break in the system. The move from prevention to prediction has required the shift from the all-seeing panopticon to the all-knowing ban-opticon.</span></strong><br />

By decreeing that it can know the unknowable, the state/security apparatus enacts a set of security protocols premised on the coercive power that comes from being able to mandate preemptive action in response to unknowable futures…<br />
Rational free will, as a motivating factor in social and political change, by comparison, is not only futile, it becomes potentially life threatening.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The threat of terrorism is preempted by an attempt to homogenize and create a uniform population free of ontological difference. The security-industrial complex thrives on the creation of new dangers to justify its deliberate destruction of ontological difference, a process that intrinsically motivates racial violence and preserve a static society, reproducing its own threats.</span></strong><br />

<br />
The uniformity of beings arising from the emptiness of the abandonment of Being, in which it is only a matter of the calculable security of its order, an order which it subjugates to the will to will, this uniformity also conditions everywhere in advance of all national differences the uniformity of leadership [Führerschaft], for which all forms of government are only one instrument of leadership among others…<br />
Human resources do not die, they perish.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We refuse to allow debate to exist in this state of security. Thus, Josh and I affirm the immanent potential of this resolution and debate itself to break free of the static logic of airport security. With the recognition that representation is essential to understandings of security logic, we offer airport security as our test case. But it is not merely the airports with which we are concerned – the question of the infrastructure topic and of debate itself is one of security. But the securitization of the topic didn’t have to happen. The static status quo is not the inevitable future – in fact, nothing is inevitable. The fluid pedagogy of the 1AC stands in stark opposition to security’s ontological stasis and debate’s epistemological stasis.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Just as policymakers are afraid of breaking the secure stasis of the status quo, the debate community is afraid of leaving its comfort zone. Our resolutions change but our arguments do not. Each round begins with a set of assumptions about how to debate and if these rules are breached, the behavioral detection officers read framework. In this manner, the debate round is analogous to the airport. If you want to access the benefits of debating, then you should fit into our preconceived notions of how to debate. Those who refuse are asked to undergo additional screening while the rest of the debate community regurgitates stale information, and we can only pass through the gates once we get past the “performance detector”. To take advantage of the incredible potential of the debate community, we must create our own unique education, free of these restrictions. If we set off the alarm in the process, so be it.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Debate’s catastrophic impact calculus reflects the absolutist logic of airport security.

One of the deadly traces that has been deposited in our current &quot;reality&quot; and that figures prominently in this study is &quot;race.&quot;…<br />
The price that international relations scholarship pays for its inattention to the issue of representation is perpetuation of the dominant modes of making meaning and deferral of its responsibility and complicity in dominant representations.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Thus, Josh and I affirm the immanent potential of this resolution and debate itself to break free of the static logic of airport security. With the recognition that representation is essential to understandings of security logic, we offer airport security as our test case. But it is not merely the airports with which we are concerned – the question of the infrastructure topic and of debate itself is one of security. But the securitization of the topic didn’t have to happen. The static status quo is not the inevitable future – in fact, nothing is inevitable. The fluid pedagogy of the 1AC stands in stark opposition to security’s ontological stasis and debate’s epistemological stasis.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Contention Two is Insecurity:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Just as policymakers are afraid of breaking the secure stasis of the status quo, the debate community is afraid of leaving its comfort zone. Our resolutions change but our arguments do not. Each round begins with a set of assumptions about how to debate and if these rules are breached, the behavioral detection officers read framework. In this manner, the debate round is analogous to the airport. If you want to access the benefits of debating, then you should fit into our preconceived notions of how to debate. Those who refuse are asked to undergo additional screening while the rest of the debate community regurgitates stale information, and we can only pass through the gates once we get past the “performance detector”. To take advantage of the incredible potential of the debate community, we must create our own unique education, free of these restrictions. If we set off the alarm in the process, so be it.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Debate’s catastrophic impact calculus reflects the absolutist logic of airport security. We are beholden to maintain the status quo because any change in policy ends in nuclear war – we mask over the real world impacts in our race to the quickest extinction scenario, sacrificing our decision-making abilities for the sake of outweighing on magnitude. </span></strong><br />

Those of us who judge debate with some frequency know that while it is difficult to quantify probabilities, risk analysis forces us to assign probabilities to all arguments in a debate…<br />
Of course, the problem with such argumentation is that it frequently borders on the absurd.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s no secret: all of our impact cards are cut from the end of the article where it says “And in the least likely, worst case scenario”. The precautionary principle that justifies security logic is the same as motivates judges’ ballots – if there’s one percent risk of a link, vote neg on the disad. This impossible standard crushes debate’s educational value, resulting in political paralysis, and utterly fails as a model for legitimate decision-making. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Status quo airport security masks a system of racial profiling behind “behavioral detection”. And, the TSA is in the process of expanding this program throughout the United States.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">More than 30 federal officers in an airport program intended to spot telltale mannerisms of potential terrorists say the operation has become a magnet for racial profiling, targeting not only Middle Easterners but also blacks, Hispanics and other minorities…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The assessors look for inconsistencies in the answers and other signs of unusual behavior, like avoiding eye contact, sweating or fidgeting, officials said.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Behavioral screening is nothing more than a euphemism for racist discrimination that becomes engrained in the public conscious.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Because behavioral profiling requires security officials to identify conduct that is perfectly natural in a variety of situations, those whose actions triggers scrutiny under this security method are prone to abuse by security officers based on “race-based preconceptions as to which racial groups are more likely to represent a ‘terrorist’ threat.”…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The brunt of this discrimination, critics warn, will be borne by those who are (or are perceived to be) Muslim, Arab and South Asian, wrongly reinforcing the idea that terrorist suspects can be successfully identified by their race, ethnicity or religion and reiterating prejudicial stereotypes in the mind of the public instead of devoting resources to “genuine threats to security.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Airline security is only the first step to the implementation of a racist security state that spreads its authority across all transportation sectors nationwide.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Critics of this method are likely to argue that such an elaborate, “Big Brother” —style physical security system is untenably expensive and even unnecessary since the overwhelming majority of airline passengers are not terrorists…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Finally, those who opposed CAPPS II’s use of personal data originally supplied to airlines for reasons unrelated to terrorism should be pleased to note that an enhanced, advanced physical security system requires no special data because it presumes that each passenger is equally capable, if not of acting as a terrorist, then of being targeted by one as a “bomb mule.”</span><br />

<br />
Foucault’s analytic of biopower is indicative of his understanding of the inter-national and practices that constitute humanity in terms of racial division...<br />
When the above statement is understood at the level of practices, the enemy can no longer be conceived in biological terms, as is implied by Foucault, but comes to acquire a political subjectivity. Racism as a practice can only be understood in political terms.<br />
<br />
<strong>Racism must be rejected at all costs – every single step is necessary to destroy a culture of separatism and dehumanization. Small reforms matter.</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Rather than spending millions of tax dollars on programs that profile and inadvertently discriminate against minority passengers, the TSA should concentrate on the continued development and expansion of these and other physical security initiatives…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If the implementation of advanced technology security programs forces airports to spend more time and human capital on screening passengers, so be it: not only does this approach avoid unconstitutional scrutinizing of those who fit into protected class categories, but this method will enable TSA to identify individuals like Richard Reid, John Walker Lindh, and Marwan alShehhi (those intending to commit acts of terror) as well as individuals like Jeffrey Goldberg and Nathaniel Heatwole (those merely seeking to underscore the inadequacies of existing national security measures).</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Thus the plan:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States by investing in physical security initiatives in airports, including a computerized system for randomly selecting passengers for secondary searches to replace the Transportation Security Administration’s behavior detection program.</strong><br />

Given the nation’s ongoing economic crises, equity is a critical lens through which we should plan and examine decision-making…<br />

The struggle for individual ethical and political autonomy, the claim for the recognition of separate 'political spaces' and for the 'incommunicability' of political causes, demonstrates the limits of the radical claims for the normative project of global civil society 'from below'…<br />

<br />
Since ‘it is impossible to escape the State’, 70 Levinas insists that the state be made as ethical as possible…<br />
Each of these principles, left to itself, only hastens the contrary of what it wants to secure.<br />

<br />
As he understands it, the ‘political’ implies primarily the subversion of social fixity, the questioning of established order, transformative praxis and the construction of new subjectivities and social aggregations…<br />

<br />
The &quot;worst possible case fixation&quot; is one of the most damaging modes of unrealism in deliberations about risk in real-life situations…<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">More than 30 federal officers in an airport program intended to spot telltale mannerisms of potential terrorists say the operation has become a magnet for racial profiling, targeting not only Middle Easterners but also blacks, Hispanics and other minorities…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The assessors look for inconsistencies in the answers and other signs of unusual behavior, like avoiding eye contact, sweating or fidgeting, officials said.</span><br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Because behavioral profiling requires security officials to identify conduct that is perfectly natural in a variety of situations, those whose actions triggers scrutiny under this security method are prone to abuse by security officers based on “race-based preconceptions as to which racial groups are more likely to represent a ‘terrorist’ threat.”…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The brunt of this discrimination, critics warn, will be borne by those who are (or are perceived to be) Muslim, Arab and South Asian, wrongly reinforcing the idea that terrorist suspects can be successfully identified by their race, ethnicity or religion and reiterating prejudicial stereotypes in the mind of the public instead of devoting resources to “genuine threats to security.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Critics of this method are likely to argue that such an elaborate, “Big Brother” —style physical security system is untenably expensive and even unnecessary since the overwhelming majority of airline passengers are not terrorists…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Finally, those who opposed CAPPS II’s use of personal data originally supplied to airlines for reasons unrelated to terrorism should be pleased to note that an enhanced, advanced physical security system requires no special data because it presumes that each passenger is equally capable, if not of acting as a terrorist, then of being targeted by one as a “bomb mule.”</span><br />

<br />
Foucault’s analytic of biopower is indicative of his understanding of the inter-national and practices that constitute humanity in terms of racial division...<br />
When the above statement is understood at the level of practices, the enemy can no longer be conceived in biological terms, as is implied by Foucault, but comes to acquire a political subjectivity. Racism as a practice can only be understood in political terms.<br />
<br />
<strong>Racism must be rejected at all costs – every single step is necessary to destroy a culture of separatism and dehumanization. Small reforms matter.</strong><br />

To study racism is to study walls. We have looked at barriers and fences, restraints and limitations, ghettos and prisons…<br />
For the sake of the world and ourselves, we dare not allow it to continue.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Binding federal legislation and investment in physical security initiatives is the best way to prevent racial profiling</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Kleiner 10</strong> (Yevgenia, Editor for Boston College Third World Law Journal. “Racial Profiling in the Name of National Security: Protecting Minority Travelers' Civil Liberties in the Age of Terrorism.” Boston College Third World Law Journal, 30:1.)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Rather than spending millions of tax dollars on programs that profile and inadvertently discriminate against minority passengers, the TSA should concentrate on the continued development and expansion of these and other physical security initiatives…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If the implementation of advanced technology security programs forces airports to spend more time and human capital on screening passengers, so be it: not only does this approach avoid unconstitutional scrutinizing of those who fit into protected class categories, but this method will enable TSA to identify individuals like Richard Reid, John Walker Lindh, and Marwan alShehhi (those intending to commit acts of terror) as well as individuals like Jeffrey Goldberg and Nathaniel Heatwole (those merely seeking to underscore the inadequacies of existing national security measures).</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Thus the plan:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States by investing in physical security initiatives in airports, including a computerized system for randomly selecting passengers for secondary searches to replace the Transportation Security Administration’s behavior detection program.</strong><br />

Accept the geo-historical context of the struggle as something that must be reconciled with attempts to create social justice…<br />

<strong>Attempting to predict political outcomes is impossible – linear analysis leads to serial policy failure. Both positive and negatives results are inevitable.</strong><br />

<br />
In many cases, a small choice might lead to overwhelming results that generate either a virtuous cycle or a vicious cycle…<br />
There could be a variety of reasons for this inaccuracy in prediction, but one certain reason is that policies themselves are intrinsically governed by uncertainty, complexity and chaos in policies that produce many different outcomes though they are faced with the same initial internal states, the same environments, and governed by the same causal relationships.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">Instead, we should plan through the lens of racial equity – only a decision-making system founded on a system that resists structural racism can be ethical and effective.</span></strong><br />

<br />
Given the nation’s ongoing economic crises, equity is a critical lens through which we should plan and examine decision-making…<br />
We must be the actors that initiate and when necessary carry out the change, not just in one sector, but at key points in the system that will facilitate real and lasting equity.<br />

Finally, in a chaotic system we would expect that long-term prediction is not only unlikely but also truly impossible…<br />
This paper turns, then, to the debate on the reasons for the outbreak of World War One.<br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">Debate’s fixation on unlikely worst-case-scenario impacts is counterproductive and interferes with risks worth taking.</span></strong><br />

<br />
The &quot;worst possible case fixation&quot; is one of the most damaging modes of unrealism in deliberations about risk in real-life situations…<br />
The worst threat is certainly something to be borne in mind and taken into account, but it is emphatically not a satisfactory index of the overall seriousness or gravity of a situation of hazard.<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Because behavioral profiling requires security officials to identify conduct that is perfectly natural in a variety of situations, those whose actions triggers scrutiny under this security method are prone to abuse by security officers based on “race-based preconceptions as to which racial groups are more likely to represent a ‘terrorist’ threat.”…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The brunt of this discrimination, critics warn, will be borne by those who are (or are perceived to be) Muslim, Arab and South Asian, wrongly reinforcing the idea that terrorist suspects can be successfully identified by their race, ethnicity or religion and reiterating prejudicial stereotypes in the mind of the public instead of devoting resources to “genuine threats to security.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Critics of this method are likely to argue that such an elaborate, “Big Brother” —style physical security system is untenably expensive and even unnecessary since the overwhelming majority of airline passengers are not terrorists…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Finally, those who opposed CAPPS II’s use of personal data originally supplied to airlines for reasons unrelated to terrorism should be pleased to note that an enhanced, advanced physical security system requires no special data because it presumes that each passenger is equally capable, if not of acting as a terrorist, then of being targeted by one as a “bomb mule.”</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Rather than spending millions of tax dollars on programs that profile and inadvertently discriminate against minority passengers, the TSA should concentrate on the continued development and expansion of these and other physical security initiatives…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If the implementation of advanced technology security programs forces airports to spend more time and human capital on screening passengers, so be it: not only does this approach avoid unconstitutional scrutinizing of those who fit into protected class categories, but this method will enable TSA to identify individuals like Richard Reid, John Walker Lindh, and Marwan alShehhi (those intending to commit acts of terror) as well as individuals like Jeffrey Goldberg and Nathaniel Heatwole (those merely seeking to underscore the inadequacies of existing national security measures).</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Thus the plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States by investing in physical security initiatives in airports to replace the Transportation Security Administration’s behavior detection program, including a computerized system for randomly selecting passengers for secondary searches.

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">There could be a variety of reasons for this inaccuracy in prediction, but one certain reason is that policies themselves are intrinsically governed by uncertainty, complexity and chaos in policies that produce many different outcomes though they are faced with the same initial internal states, the same environments, and governed by the same causal relationships.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is a priori likely that most texts display the activity of numerous different genres, and that few or no texts can be adequately described in terms of one genre alone…</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This view of the state as an institutional monolith is fostered by the notion of sovereignty, which calls up the image of the monarch, presiding over his kingdom…</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">We can hardly dispense with the convenient notion that Pakistan claims, Cuba promises, and Italy insists, and we cannot well abandon the formal position that governments speak for and act on behalf of their states, but it is essential that we bear constantly in mind the reality that governments are never fully in charge and never achieve the unity, purposefulness and discipline that theory attributes to them–and that they sometimes claim.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">There could be a variety of reasons for this inaccuracy in prediction, but one certain reason is that policies themselves are intrinsically governed by uncertainty, complexity and chaos in policies that produce many different outcomes though they are faced with the same initial internal states, the same environments, and governed by the same causal relationships.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Science fiction has been a popular genre at least since Jules Verne’s 19th century work, and arguably longer still…</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Miller and Bennett, however, argue otherwise--that not only is science fiction useful for thinking about longer-term consequences, but that the parts about the people--how technologies actually fit into society--are just as, if not more important than the ideas about the technologies themselves.</span><br />

In this analysis, investment in infrastructure is defined as capital spending on transportation, utilities (for example, water and power supply), environmental projects, and schools…<br />
Capital spending under this study’s definition consists of investment in physical capital, such as structures and facilities, rather than intangible capital, which is formed by spending on educational programs or on research and development.<br />

The first major problem identified by the work group as relating to topic selection is the decline in participation in the National Debate Tournament (NDT) policy debate…<br />
In this view, it is the competitive imbalance resulting from the use of broad topics that has led some small schools to cancel their programs.<br />

Very often a dialogue exists only if the persons involved in the communication act observe and respect some rules of dialogism, and some of these main ‘rules’ or principles may be a mutual trust or reciprocity (Rommetveit 1992), a sharing of power and comprehension that gives everybody an equal opportunity to have his or her voice heard…<br />

The last thing to remember is that when an election is quite close, it does not take very much to shift the race from one candidate being a 60/40 favorite to it being about even...<br />
While, on the one hand, it is good not to overreact to new data at this early stage of the race, it is also worth remembering that even a one-point shift in a president’s approval ratings, or a modest change in the economic forecasts, can move a president’s re-election odds at the margin.<br />

Iran’s response to what would initially start as a sustained stand-off bombardment (Desert Fox Heavy) could take a number of different forms that might lead to escalation by the United States and Israel, surrounding states, and non-state actors...<br />

Nowhere is the myth of ideological neutrality – the self-proclaimed Wertfreiheit or value neutrality of so-called ‘rigorous social science’ – stronger than in the field of methodology…<br />
Thus, more than ever before, the task of ideological demystification is inseparable from the investigation of the complex dialectical relationship between methods and values which no social theory or philosophy can escape.<br />

<strong>The aff is just a shift from the coercive strategy of capitalist exclusion to the incorporative strategy for furthering capital production by subsidizing elements of basic consumption and creating new avenues of exploitation. “Integration” is the ruse of choice for elites to ensure that the underprivileged think that they have dignity and rights, when really they are only being abused for their labor.</strong><br />

Despite these evasions, active policies to manage the poor and poverty have been implemented since the sixteenth century…<br />
The state, having initially appeared as a saviour of the poor's living standards, turned out to be remote and controlling.<br />

<br />
I begin with the postmodern (mis)appropriation of Althusser's notion of &quot;overdetermination,&quot; namely the intuition that reality is so complex that it is better understood as a multicausal process rather than as a &quot;structural&quot; or systemic mechanism, as in the traditional Marxist explanation of capitalism...<br />
I will make clear that what ultimately gives internal consistency to many of the critiques of postmodern and post-Marxist theorists is a profound distortion and co-optation of the most critical, unique, and politically mobilizing features of Marxist theory, on one hand, combined with a renaturalization of a capitalism predicated on liberal notions of social and economic reform, on the other.<br />

A third feature of J.K. Gibson-Graham's work, in particular, and of the whole radical democracy tradition, in general, is its post-structuralist extremism…<br />

Technological optimists have tried to argue that the rebound effect is small, and therefore environmental problems can be solved largely by technological innovation alone, with the efficiency gains translating into lower throughput of energy and materials (dematerialization)…<br />
The only real answer for humanity (including future generations) and the earth as a whole is to alter the social relations of production, to create a system in which efficiency is no longer a curse—a higher system in which equality, human development, community, and sustainability are the explicit goals.<br />

<strong>Alt comes first—doing nothing allows us to break with the status quo strategy of intervening without change, and instead risk the impossible</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">In this sense our autonomy is at once more precarious and more radical…</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">A Left politics of subtraction would mean above all standing with the symptomal truths of our age and recognising the way in which its multiculturalism and infra-political engagement are already implicated in, fractalized as part of, the totality of cosmopolitan capitalism and its deliquescence over such issues as global poverty and hunger.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>There can be no compromise – any inclusion of the affirmative is a façade of reformism that only causes capitalism to grow stronger.</strong><br />
<strong>Kovel 2</strong> (Joel, Professor of Social Studies at Bard College, The Enemy of Nature, p142)<br />
<br />
The value-term that subsumes everything into the spell of capital sets going a kind of wheel of accumulation, from production to consumption and back, spinning ever more rapidly as the inertial mass of capital grows, and generating its force field as a spinning magnet generates an electrical field…<br />
For green capital (or 'socially/ecologically responsible investing') exists, by its very capital-nature, essentially to create more value, and this leaches away from the concretely green location to join the great pool, and follows its force field into zones of greater concentration, expanded profitability - and greater ecodestruction.<br />
<br />
<strong>Engaging the politics of capitalism causes extinction – there is no middle ground</strong><br />
<strong>Meszaros 1</strong> (Istvan, prof. emeritus @ Univ. of Sussex, Socialism or Barbarism, pp. 80-81, JM)<br />
<br />
Those who talk about the &quot;third way&quot; as the solution to our dilemma, asserting that there can be no room for the revival of a radical mass movement, either want to deceive us by cynically calling their slavish acceptance of the ruling order &quot;the third way,&quot; or fail to realize the gravity of the situation, putting their faith in a wishfully non-conflictual positive outcome that has been promised for nearly a century but never approximated even by one inch…<br />
This is why the century in front of us is bound to be the century of &quot;socialism or barbarism.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Including the plan kills solvency: we must refuse the call to action in order to remain truly open to revolutionary opportunity</strong><br />
<strong>Zizek 4</strong> (Slavoj, , Professor of Sociology at the Institute for Sociology, Ljubljana University, “Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle” P. 71-73 JF)<br />
<br />
The stance of simply condemning the postmodern Left for its accommodation, however, is also false, since one should ask the obvious difficult question: what, in fact, was the alternative?<br />
The only way to lay the foundations for a true, radical change is to withdraw from the compulsion to act, to ‘do nothing’ – thus opening up the space for a different kind of activity.<br />

Even allowing for the distinctive morphologies, economies, cultures, and planning policies of Western cities, the international breadth of concern raised by disabled people concerning inaccessibility (see Wrightson, 1989) demonstrates that this is a pervasive feature of urban life…<br />
It is not surprising therefore that Hahn (1986, p. 274) sees inaccessibility as a threat both to &quot;principles of democratic freedom and equality for citizens with disabilities.&quot;<br />

Sexism is partly driven by a form of ableism that favours certain abilities, and the labelling of women as not having those certain necessary abilities is used to justify sexism and the dominance of males over females…<br />

The danger otherwise is to continue to reproduce dominant discourses that represent people with disabilities as passive victims lacking agency…<br />

People with physical disabilities in the United States have faced, and continue to struggle against, many social and economic disadvantages…<br />
An ableist society is said to be one that treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of &quot;normal living&quot;, which results in public and private places and services, education, and social work that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby inherently excluding those with various disabilities.<br />

Indeed, there is now clear evidence from several sources that Britain's six and a quarter million disabled people experience a lifestyle characterized by poverty and dependence…<br />
When explaining the outcome of disability, therefore, the likelihood of simultaneous oppression should always be considered.<br />

Much of the current &quot;unmanageability&quot; of contemporary life in patriarchal societies, (d), is then viewed as a consequence of a patriarchal preoccupation with activities, events, and experiences that reflect historically male-gender identified beliefs, values, attitudes, and assumptions…<br />
Its plausibility ties in understanding the conceptual roots of various woman-nature-peace connections in regional, national, and global contexts.<br />

<br />
Mobility is channelled…<br />
So not only did the rail system produce ‘tunneling effects’ by passing through minority areas it was also logically and economically related to a decrease in convenient bus routes and an increase in rates of death and injuries among inner city residents (Cresswell, 2006).<br />

<br />
The French philosopher Gilles Deleuze and his co-author Félix Guattari (1983, 1987) challenge these modern foundations in a postmodern vein…<br />
Striated space is organised in ﬁxed patterns according to a pre-given unitary logic, that of the state.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This represents the certainty with which we are trained to tout the national system and sense of order – this microfascism is what creates violent support of horrific ends and reproduces the impacts of the aff</span></strong><br />

<br />
The second danger, Clarity, seems less obvious…<br />
We have overcome fear, we have sailed from the shores of security, only to enter a system that is no less concentricized, no less organized: the system of petty insecurities that leads everyone to their own black hole in which to turn dangerous, possessing a clarity on their situation, role, and mission even more disturbing than the certitudes of the first line.<br />

<br />
Smooth space, on the other hand, corresponds to nomadic subjectivities (Deleuze &amp; Guattari 1987; Braidotti 1994 2002, 2006)…<br />
From such a vantage point it becomes possible to sketch the outlines of a nomadic politics vis-à-vis the striation introduced by the security discourse; a politics that follows the rhizomatic characteristics of connection, circulation and movement and that draws its impetus from being transitory and transgressive, yet for all that still remains committed.<br />

<strong>Deleuze and Guattari 87</strong> (Gilles and Felix, A Thousand Plateaus Pg. 484-486)<br />
<br />
Earlier we encountered a distinction between &quot;free action&quot; in smooth space and &quot;work&quot; in striated space…<br />
The present-day accelerated forms of the circulation of capital are making the distinctions between constant and variable capital, and even fixed and circulating capital, increasingly relative; the essential thing is instead the distinction between striated capital and smooth capital, and the way in which the former gives rise to the latter through complexes that cut across territories and States, and even the different types of States.<br />

Gilles Deleuze: If we knew the answer to that, we wouldn't be discussing it, we would just go out and do it…<br />

<strong>Guattari 74</strong> (Felix, “On Capitalism and Desire” Desert Islands pg. 244-245)<br />
<br />
Felix Guattari: Exactly…<br />
This raises a simple dilemma: either we find some new type of structure to facilitate the fusion of collective desire and revolutionary organization; or we continue on the present course, heading from one repression to the next, toward a fascism that will make Hitler and Mussolini look like a joke.<br />

<strong>The affirmative constructs the Other through knowledge production and representation that produces a Self/Other dichotomy.</strong><br />
<strong>Sered 96</strong> Danielle Sered, Rhode’s Scholar at Emory University, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4039:http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Orientalism.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Orientalism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Orientalism.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4039 --><br />
<br />
Latent Orientalism is the unconscious, untouchable certainty about what the Orient is…<br />
It is the expression in words and actions of Latent Orientalism.<br />
<br />
<strong>The affirmative’s representations of the Other—the simple act of representation -- is a display of power that renders the Other fixed and knowable, thus laying the path for Orientalist conquest.</strong><br />
<strong>Said 78</strong> [Edward Said, Professor of Comparative Literature at Columbia University, Orientalism, pg. 308-309]<br />
<br />
One can explain such statements by recognizing that a still more implicit and powerful difference posited by the Orientalist as against the Oriental is that the former writes about, whereas the latter is written about…<br />
The relationship between the two is radically a matter of power, for which there are numerous images.<br />
<br />
<strong>Orientalism results in the dehumanization of the Other.</strong><br />
<strong>Said 78</strong> [Edward Said , Professor of Comparative Literature at Columbia University, Orientalism, pg. 108-109]<br />
<br />
In a sense the limitations of Orientalism are, as I said earlier, the limitations that follow upon disregarding, essentializing, denuding the humanity of another culture, people, or geographical region…<br />
In the meantime a growing, more and more dangerous rift separates Orient and Occident.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dehumanization makes conflict, human rights violations and genocide inevitable.</strong><br />
<strong>Maiese 03</strong> [Michelle Maiese, Graduate Student of Philosophy at the University of Colorado, Boulder; Research Staff at the Conflict Research Consortium; “Dehumanization,” <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/dehumanization/" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/dehumanization/</a></span>]<br />
<br />
While deindividuation and the formation of enemy images are very common, they form a dangerous process that becomes especially damaging when it reaches the level of dehumanization…<br />
Similar atrocities have occurred in Rwanda, Cambodia, and the former Yugoslavia.<br />
<br />
<strong>The alternative is to reject the affirmative as an instance of Orientalism in favor of narrative approaches to representation and understanding.</strong><br />
<strong>Sered 96</strong> [Danielle Sered, Rhode’s Scholar at Emory University, <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:4040:http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Orientalism.html --><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Orientalism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Orientalism.html</a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:4040 -->]<br />
<br />
Said calls into question the underlying assumptions that form the foundation of Orientalist thinking…<br />
Scholarship from afar and second-hand representation must take a back seat to narrative and self-representation on the part of the ‘Oriental.’<br />

LindaLisa Natividad is a Chamorro rights advocate and one of the main organizers of the local opposition to the Guam build-up, the imminent transfer of 8,000 Marines and their families from bases in Okinawa to Guam, an under-resourced and environmentally exploited de facto colony of the U.S. military that already controls one-third of Guam's land mass.<br />
Natividad teaches at the University of Guam, where many of her colleagues in the social work department are also active in the struggle for Chamorro self-determination. &quot;This whole build-up is an issue of justice,&quot; Natividad says, &quot;social justice, which is one of our core values in the social work profession.&quot; Pushed into peace work by the signing of this accord, Natividad has since become known as a consistent questioner of the environmental and human cost of the proposed build-up.

With the demise of communism as an overarching organizing principle and crystallization point, Western security doctrines have seen the inclusion of a growing range of different security issues from political, societal, economic and environmental sectors…<br />
Evaluating and ranking all kinds of potential insecurities, from toxic accidents and political unrest to plant diseases, thunderstorms, energy shortages, terrorist strikes, wars and the instability of global financial markets, risk registers stand at the intersection of the broadening of security politics and the adoption of risk logics.<br />
<br />
<strong>The dream of security produces apocalypse – constructions of existential risk produce the annihilation they are meant to escape.</strong><br />
<strong>Coviello 2K</strong> Peter Coviello, Prof. of English @ Bowdoin, 2k [Queer Frontiers, p. 39-40]<br />
Perhaps…<br />
For a state that would arm itself not with the power to kill its population, but with a more comprehensive power over the patterns and functioning of its collective life, the threat of an apocalyptic demise, nuclear or otherwise, seems a civic initiative that can scarcely be done without.<br />
<br />
<strong>Alternative – Reject the affirmative’s security logic – only resistance to the discourse of security can generate genuine political thought</strong><br />
<strong>Neocleous 8</strong> Mark Neocleous, Prof. of Government @ Brunel, 2008 [Critique of Security, 185-6]<br />
<br />
The only way out of such a dilemma, to escape the fetish, is perhaps to eschew the logic of security altogether - to reject it as so ideologically loaded in favour of the state that any real political thought other than the authoritarian and reactionary should be pressed to give it up…<br />
But it certainly requires recognising that security is an illusion that has forgotten it is an illusion; it requires recognising that security is not the same as solidarity; it requires accepting that insecurity is part of the human condition, and thus giving up the search for the certainty of security and instead learning to tolerate the uncertainties, ambiguities and 'insecurities' that come with being human; it requires accepting that 'securitizing' an issue does not mean dealing with it politically, but bracketing it out and handing it to the state; it requires us to be brave enough to return the gift.&quot;'<br />

 <br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">The drive to improve transportation infrastructure is rooted in a worship of speed—time conquers space as we seek endless acceleration which dissolves politics</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Virilio 97</span></strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> – Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School (Paul, Open sky, verso, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rhizomes.net/issue8/kuswa.htm" rel="nofollow">print,</a></span> 81-83) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">But let us get back to Europe’s great engineering projects and the political significance of this initial programme of European infrastructural development…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The former pre-eminence of the spatial situation will then gradually lose its his-torical importance, favouring temporary network access protocols suing; information routing to enable messages instantaneously trans-mitted long-distance to be connected.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Our worship of acceleration makes a catastrophic Accident inevitable—the politics of speed turn the case and guarantee war and extinction</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Sykes 09</span></strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> – graduate student at the university of north texas (Jason, “Paul Virilio’s critique of speed, technology, and institutions”, pdf available online)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">In Virlio’s view, the war machine is the demiurge of technological development and an ultimate threat to humanity, producing a ‘state of emergency’ in which nuclear [annihilation] holocaust threatens the very survival of the human species…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">“We must politicize speed. (Virilio, 1983, pg. 35)”</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">The alternative is to brake—academic discussions must slow down and critically investigate the politics of speed before we come to a decision. Your responsibility as an intellectual is to vote negative to foster democratic engagement and not rush to judgment</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Glezos 09</span></strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> - Ph.D. in political theory and international relations from Johns Hopkins University, now works in the department of political science at University of Regina (<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: initial;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/articles/search?author=Glezos%2C%20Simon" rel="nofollow">Simon</a></span>, “ The politics of speed: Capitalism, the state and war in an accelerating world” [dissertation] pg. 93-94) //BW</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The goal then is thus to politicize the military, to politicize war, to challenge the military from a political standpoint, and return it to civilian control…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">An appeal to slowness is the only defense against historical necessity of the vicious cycle of reinforcement between speed, war and the (Globalitarian) state.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Not really a fatal oscillation between fast technology and slow society, but hyper-technologies of global financial manipulation that can move so quickly because, just as Jean Baudrillard long ago warned, the hyperreal, simulational world of derivatives, credit swaps, and mortgage backed securities long ago blasted off from material reality, reaching escape velocity, and then orbiting the world as star-like high finance satellites -- purely virtual satellites which have no real meaning for the rest of us as long as they stay in space as part of the alienated, recursive loops of advanced capitalism.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Debate is pedagogical activity in which the plan obviously never happens—therefore the judge should be a critical intellectual deciding between competing political strategies, debate is a deliberative process part of a larger democracy—we should examine the assumptions of the plan in the context of speed</span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">‘Brevity is the soul of e-mail,’ Nicholas Negroponte tells internauts in Being Digital…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Once this question on the future of political representation has been raised, one can better understand that the dream of most of the major parties is to have members of parliament who are so ‘soft’, so much like silent soap stars, that no grotesque puppet could be made of them, no stupid comment attributed to them.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Confining discourse to only policy debates constructs a regime of truth that masks the constructed nature of their harms and solvency; this undermines their entire explanation of the world.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">By focusing on the policy debate, we restrict ourselves to the issues of the day, to the tip of the political iceberg…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">In essence, how we know things determines what we see, and the public realm of politics is itself the result of a prior series of (political) epistemological moves which result in the political being seen as either natural or a matter of common sense.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Through this process of actively opposing U.S. aggression and the “America Number 1” mindset fostered to justify it, people can and must be won to increasingly see that this capitalist system and state is utterly un-reformable and that it’s going to take revolution to get rid of it, end its predatory wars once and for all, and bring into being a whole new system and state that is in the actual interests of the people in the U.S. and around the world.</span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Even if he seems paranoid, he’s right about a lot of stuff.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">Indeed, the global spy satellite system that the Pentagon spent the last quarter of the 20th century putting into place made a contribution of its own, since it has over time made it impossible for national armies to function without being detected immediately; a mass mediatization of political bodies reflected also in the tendency of many Americans during the events of September 11, to feel as though they were 'watching a movie' even amongst those who saw it occur directly in front of them…</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">When one considers that PNAC was once headed by Rumsfeld, Virilio's sometimes 'paranoid' sounding arguments thus seem to have considerable weight behind them, just as many of his other predictions have been borne out over time; what he concludes from all of this is that in an era in which &quot;one man = total war&quot;178 the world must take seriously the threat of terrorism of all kinds, while also maintaining one's guard against the instrumental use of these same emotions in order to inspire popular anxieties, softening people up for manipulations of all sorts; as he puts it, to succumb to or to unleash this sort of rhetoric in this way &quot;is to forget, rather quickly, that fear is a poor counselor, as all dictatorships have proven since antiquity&quot;.I7'</span><br />
