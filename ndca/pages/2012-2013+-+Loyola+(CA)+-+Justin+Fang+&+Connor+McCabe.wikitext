==2AC Blocks== 

===Topicality=== 

====2AC T – Military==== 

1. We meet – we’re not military – we simply invest in port infrastructure. We claim military infrastructure as a result of the plan, not from the actual investment.

2. Counter-interpretation –
a.) Port of Guam is transportation infrastructure
Lundberg, Guam Business Magazine, ’11 [Stephanie Lundberg, Guam Business Magazine, December 2011, Guam Business Magazine Vol. 28, “Freight business fortune dependent on buildup play-out,” http://www.guambusinessmagazine.com/?pg=vol28_04_feature02, accessed 9/17/12, JTF]
Similarly, Matson is hoping to arrange its operations so that it can keep up with projects related to the…shipments to the rest of Guam’s customer community.”

b.) Infrastructure that allows military buildup is topical
Brown ’11 (Adam, Guam Buildup News reporter, 2-25-11, “Guam’s Aging Infrastructure Needs Unprecedented Growing Spurt For Buildup,” http://guambuildupnews.com/Buildup-News-Politics/Guams-Aging-Infrastructure-Needs-Unprecedented-Growing-Spurt-for-Buildup.html)
GUAM – By the time the 8,500 Marines arrive with their 9,000 dependents and entourage, the Guam…investment may need to rise to $1.3 billion.

3. Reasons to prefer –

a.) Predictability – Guantanamo and Guam are major parts of military transportation infrastructure – there’s no reason why they can’t predict the aff. Their interpretation assumes investing in military bases.

b.) Limits – they limit out all transportation infrastructure – all our infrastructure is dual-use. The military uses things like ports for surge capacity.

4. Reasonability

===Kritiks=== 

====2AC Security K==== 
A. Our interpretation is that the affirmative should be able to weigh the advantages of the plan against the kritik alternative, which must be enacted by the United States federal government.

B. Vote Aff – key to ground – they access a massive amount of K frameworks, links, and impacts. They can leverage framework to moot the 1AC. We can never predict what we will have to compare the plan to. Even if we get ground, it’s bad and unpredictable.

There is a value to resisting our social location. Exposing ourselves to different modes of understanding is critical to cultivating sympathy for different ways of life
Jenni ’01 [Kathie, Pf Philosophy at Redlands, 2001, Social Theory and Practice, July v27 i3 p437]

The claim on behalf of academics' value to the world at large is that in enhancing the moral reasoning of…improvement in skills of moral reasoning over the course of a college career.

Perm – do both. Engaging the state and locating security discourse in the context of the 1AC is key to change.

I have argued thus far that recognizing the roots of securitization theory within the legacy of a…Seen in this light, the Copenhagen School is insulated from many of the most common criticisms leveled against it.

Perm – do the plan and all non-mutually exclusive parts of the alternative

Realism is inevitable and even if it is bad, alternatives are worse.
Mearsheimer ’95 [John Mearsheimer, Political Science—University of Chicago, 1995 International Security, p. 91-2]
The most revealing aspect of Wendt’s discussion is that he did not respond to the two main charge…critical theory perspective, defending realism might very well be the more responsible policy choice.

The 1AC threats are real – our Rassler and Brown evidence quotes Haqqani militants who actively support jihad against the U.S.

Extend our Lieven evidence – China threat is real – territorial battles and ideological conflicts make conflict inevitable. Framing issue – prefer the specificity and the recency of our evidence. Their Pan link doesn’t assume current events.

Our epistemology is good – evaluate the specific studies our authors cite
Rassler and Brown, Combating Terrorism Center, ’11 [Don Rassler, Instructor in the Department of Social Sciences and an Associate at the Combating Terrorism Center (CTC) at the U.S. Military Academy and Vahid Brown, Harmony Fellow and Senior Instructor at US Military Academy Research Fellow at Combating Terrorism Center, 7/14/11, Combating Terrorism Center, “The Haqqani Nexus and the Evolution of al-Qaida,” http://www.ctc.usma.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CTC-Haqqani-Report_Rassler-Brown-Final_Web.pdf, pgs. 15-6, accessed 9/2/12, JTF]

Disregard the kritik. They foreclose problem-solving which makes all impacts inevitable.

Perhaps more alarming though is the outright violence Ashley recommends in response…long talcen care of these ontological dilemmas that otherwise seem to preoccupy Ashley.40

Our representations are good – the alternative avoids reality.
Lenz ’90 [Science and Policy Professor at SUNY, “Nuclear Age Literature For Youth,” p. 9-10]
A summary of Frank’s thought in “Psychological Determinants of the Nuclear Arms Race”… We only seal our doom more certainly. The repressed fear, moreover, takes a psychic toll.

Huysmans ’02 [Jeff, Lecturer in politics at the department of government at Open University, Alternatives “Defining Social Constructivism in Security Studies: The Normative Dilemma of Writing Security” Feb 2002 p. 59-60.]
There is no solution for the normative dilemma in the social-con¬structivist security analyses…This would require a positive concept of se¬curity that defines liberation from oppression as a good that should be secured.

Pleasure is determined by empirical examinations – life is a prerequisite and its preservation should be an a priori goal.
Kacou ’08 [Amien, Why Even Mind? On the A Priori Value of “Life,” Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy, Vol 4, No 1-2, 2008, cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/92/184]
Furthermore, that manner of finding things good that is in pleasure…Perhaps, our inquiry should be a bit more complex.

====2AC Social Justice K==== 
Perm do both

Perm do the plan and reject racially planned infrastructure in every other instance.
Link turn – failure to upgrade the port of guam means that there’s insufficient utilities on Guam. That’s the only scenario that causes racial injustice for the Guamanians.

Utilitarianism is the only moral framework and alternatives are inevitability self-contradictory
Nye, 86 (Joseph S. 1986; Phd Political Science Harvard. University; Served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs; “Nuclear Ethics” pg. 18-19)

Emphasis on the gender dimension of rape in war is critical not only to surfacing women as full subjects...Every rape is an expression of male domination and misogyny, a vehicle of terrorizing and subordinating women

====2AC Cap K==== 
Case outweighs – China conflict and terrorism are inevitable in the status quo - causes extinction. The shift away from capitalism takes too long to solve.

Perm – vote affirmative and reject capital in all other instances. Either the permutation solves the kritik or the alternative doesn’t solve back the links.

Perm – do the aff as a way to combat the harmful impacts of capitalism. Only using cap to fight cap can be effective
Monthly Review, March 1990, v. 41, no. 10, p 38
No institution is or ever has been a seamless monolith. Although the inherent mechanism of American…perhaps even to the extent of furnishing the margin of success for that very effort.

Alt doesn’t solve –
a.) There’s no way to facilitate the troop movement – that’s the key internal link to our advantages
b.) No way to build infrastructure - Rejection of capitalism means that there’s no institutions to build stuff

Turn – their depiction of a monolithic capitalist system is what makes capitalism so powerful – this strategy makes any anti-capitalist alternative impossible.
Gibson-Graham ’96 [J.K. Gibson-Graham, the pen name of Katherine Gibson, Senior Fellow of Human Geography at Australian National University, and Julie Graham, professor of Geography at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 1996, The End of Capitalism (As We Knew It), p. 1-3]
Understanding capitalism has always been a project of the left, especially within the Marxian tradition…quite local and familiar (not to mention familiar beings that are not what they seem).

Alt fails – individuals won’t change from a capitalist mindset.

We get to weigh 1AC versus the status quo or a competitive policy option – we should get to weigh the aff – there are an infinite amount of frameworks that they could say come first – that’s bad for aff ground and puts the aff at a big time disadvantage versus the block.
And Judge Choice: The 1AC advantages are a justification—the judge can reject them and still vote aff

Global transition causes extinction

Attempts at global economic reform could also lead to a world racked by increasing turbulence, a…old arms race and militarization of regimes, encouraging regional conflagrations and setting the stage for eventual global holocaust.

Cap isn’t the root cause.
Aberdeen 3 – activist and founder, Aberdeen Foundation (Richard, The Way, http://richardaberdeen.com/uncommonsense/theway.html)
A view shared by many modern activists is that capitalism, free enterprise, multi-national corporations…free enterprise and multi-national corporation avarice, thus the root problem obviously goes deeper than this.

Capitalist epistemology is good – Prefer our evidence – their evidence is futile intellectual pride
Saunders ’07 [Peter, Adjunct Professor at the Australian Graduate School of Management, Why Capitalism is Good for the Soul, http://www.cis.org.au/POLICY/summer%2007-08/saunders_summer07.html]

===Counterplans=== 

====2AC Guam CP==== 

Guam clearly can’t solve – our Inspector General evidence indicates that Guam has insufficient funds and that there will be delays in the status quo – that means the CP doesn’t meet the 2014 deadline and prevents the relocation from happening.

Cost overruns are descriptive of the status quo – the affirmative solves that

Solvency deficit –
a.) Delays – the planning period required means that they delay the buildup past 2014 – our Daleno evidence indicates that’s the deadline – case is a DA to the CP

b.) Our Inspector General evidence indicates that status quo cost overruns are over 10% - Guam can’t solve by itself

Perm – do both

Federalism -
a.) The counterplan collapses federalism
Transportation Institute ’09 [Transportation Institute, 8/15/09 – publish date, site has been updated since, “Second to None on Environment and Safety Compliance” http://www.trans-inst.org/environmental-values.html, accessed 9/18/12, JTF]
The United States Coast Guard is the nation’s primary at-sea law enforcement agency and its statutory…but the question of political responsibility between federal and state governments.

b.) Federalism ensures global modeling – solves conflict, trade, and the economy
Calabresi ’95 [Stephen, Associate Professor, Northwestern University School of Law. B.A. 1980, J.D. 1983, Yale, “Reflections on United States v. Lopez: "A GOVERNMENT OF LIMITED AND ENUMERATED POWERS": IN DEFENSE OF UNITED STATES v. LOPEZ,” 94 Mich. L. Rev. 752, Michigan Law Review, December, 1995]
First, the rules of constitutional federalism should be enforced because federalism is a good thing…if only the Justices and the legal academy would wake up to the importance of what is at stake.

50 State Fiat is a voting issue -
A. Not real world - there's no historical basis for all 50 states and territories simultaneously taking up a certain policy - this kills education about things that would actually happen in policy-making
B. Multi-actor fiat is bad - it allows countless different actors at the same time - this is abusive and unpredictable for us to defend
C. Counter interpretation - the negative can read any counter plan on which there is literature and a historical precedent - this insures a solvency advocate and offense for the affirmative.

SMMPO ’12, Southeastern Massachusetts Metropolitan Planning Organization, Chapter 15, Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2012, url: http://www.srpedd.org/transportation/2012-documents/TPLANFINAL/chapter-15.pdf.
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have been defined as: “the application of advanced sensor…in an integrated manner – to improve the safety and efficiency of the surface transportation system.”

Standards
1. Limits: This allows the topic to be blown to anything “infrastructure” blowing up the neg research burden
2. Predictability: The aff now has an infinite amount of affs to run, such as energy or even medical infrastructure
3. Education: The purpose of the topic is to help us learn about Transportation infrastructure, the aff now prevents that

Topicality is a voter for fairness and education

===T – In=== 
Interpretation - “In” indicates a position within the limits or boundaries
Merriam-Webster Dictionary 2012 (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in)

A republic in the N Western Hemisphere comprising 48 conterminous states, the District of Columbia,…Capital: Washington, D.C. Abbreviation: U.S., U

Violation
Limits – their interpretation allows all forms of international transportation infrastructure involving the US. Unlimiting the topic makes it impossible for the negative to prepare for the debate.
Topicality is a voting issue for education and fairness.

===T – Investment=== 
A) Interpretation:
Federal investment in infrastructure is direct grants, loans and loan guarantees, and tax expenditures
Cooper 12 (Donna Cooper is a Senior Fellow with the Economic Policy team at the Center for American Progress, February 16 2012, "Meeting the Infrastructure Imperative," http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2012/02/infrastructure.html pg. 16 CM)
Although the federal government is a large investor in infrastructure, the private sector is by far the…These agencies have three infrastructure funding and financing tools at their disposal: • Direct grants • Loans and loan guarantees • Tax expenditures

B) Violation: The affirmative has an alternative method of infrastructure investment

Vote Neg

Predictable Ground – our interpretation includes the existing forms of transportation infrastructure investment in the status quo. Their aff allows for unpredictable solvency mechanisms that lets them spike out of spending based DA’s and solvency debates

===T - Maintenance=== 

Infrastructure investment is distinct from maintenance – maintenance allows for unpredictable affirmatives
Lemer 11 - worked at The National Academies and studied at Harvard University (Andrew, “How Much Infrastructure Spending Is “Enough?’”, http://www.andrewlemer.com/2011/02/26/how-much-infrastructure-spending-is-%E2%80%9Cenough%E2%80%9D/)
What has been neglected in all of the analyses that I have seen is an AND public works agencies suggest that maintenance budgets are often squeezed, forcing neglect.

===T – Military=== 
Interpretation: The affirmative plan cannot invest in military functions
Transportation infrastructure investment is non-military
Congressional Budget Office 10 (“Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure,”
http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/119xx/doc11940/11-17-infrastructure.pdf Accessed 7/10/12)
Although different definitions of “infrastructure” exist, this report focuses on two types that claim a…and cleanup operations (such as those conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers following Hurricane Katrina in 2005).

Violation – The plan spends capital on military functions
Reasons to prefer:
a.) Ground - military functions explodes the negative research burden, forcing us to link to the military instead of transportation policy
b.) Limits – our interpretation fairly limits the topic to include vehicles, mass transit, aviation, and water transportation affirmatives
Topicality is a voter for fairness and education, and should be evaluated as competing interpretations

===T – Substantial=== 

a) Interpretation - Contextually, substantial transportation infrastructure investment is at least 48 billion dollars
Giamberardino and Pallasch 10 (Marco and Brian, Co-Chairs of the Water Resource Coalition, January 2010, Water Resource Coalition eNewsletter, http://www.waterresourcescoalition.org/files/contrib/January2010.html) Azimi
Before the House of Representatives broke for the holidays the Chamber passed the "Jobs for Main… involve a detailed examination of each of the installations specific site conditions.

1) Limits- Our interpretation is key to limit out unpredictable affs that don’t increase by more than 48 billion dollars. They explode the topic allowing infinite affs and explodes the research burden because any action is topical

2) Neg Ground- We lose our core generics that are based on spending including the Elections and Spending Disads which are key to check unpredictable and new affs. We would also lose our government tradeoff disads because they wouldn’t be a substantial tradeoff to trigger the links.

D) Voting Issue- Voter for fairness and education. Prefer competing interpretations – reasonabality is arbitrary

===T – TI=== 
Topicality
a) Interpretation - Transportation infrastructure means transit, highways, airports, railways, waterways, and intermodal links
Trimbath 11 (Dr. Susanne Trimbath is a former Senior Research Economist in Capital Market Studies at Milken Institute, "Transportation Infrastructure: paving the way," www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/issues/infrastructure/files/2009TPI_Update_Economics_White_Paper_110712.pdf CM)
The strategy applied by the US Chamber of Commerce for the infrastructure performance index project … The structures are: •Transit •Highways •Airports •Railways •Waterways •(Ports) •Intermodal Links

b) The plan includes more than transportation
Benedict and McMahon ‘2 (Mark, director of the Conservation Leadership Network and Edward, vice president and director of Land Use Programs, The Conservation Fund, “Green Infrastructure: Smart Conservation for the 21st Century”, Autumn 2002, Renewable Resources Journal, http://www.greeninfrastructure.net/sites/greeninfrastructure.net/files/GI_RR.pdf)

Green infrastructure’s components include a variety of natural and restored ecosystems and landscape…as well as an on going commitment.

c) Vote Neg
1. Limits - Their definition allows 11 different infrastructure sectors – explodes the literature base

The text also states that the Department would build and maintain a comprehensive assessment of our… banking and finance; energy; chemical; defense industry; postal and shipping; and, national monuments and icons.19

It is time to try to describe, at first abstractly and later concretely, AND who democratically and cooperatively self-determine the shape of their social world.

Your rejection of capitalism has emancipatory results - relentless criticism has a symbolic effect that results in resistance to capitalism
Kovel 02 (Joel, Professor of Social Studies at Bard, The Enemy of Nature, pg 224)
Relentless criticism can delegitimate the system and release people into struggle. And as struggle AND of the masses of people. There is no greater responsibility for intellectuals.

Smith 94 (Sharon, Spring, leading member of the US int’l Socialist Org, ,“Mistaken identity—or can identity politics liberate the oppressed?”, http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=311)
Following this logic, the struggles against exploitation and oppression do not correspond. Within AND the explicit rejection of the centrality of class is something of an obsession.

Assimilation DA-Their politics are incompatible with our rejection of capitalism their form of politics always collapses into neolibralism
Smith 94 (Sharon, Spring, leading member of the US int’l Socialist Org, ,“Mistaken identity—or can identity politics liberate the oppressed?”, http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=311)
In its striking simplicity, Marable’s logic shows that the politics of identity are not AND difference’—the polar opposite of ‘totality’, or a unifying movement.

Identity politics cause oppressed groups to make a forced choice of confronting oppression leads to fragmentation against groups united in the struggle against capitalism
Smith 94 (Sharon, Spring, leading member of the US int’l Socialist Org, ,“Mistaken identity—or can identity politics liberate the oppressed?”, http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=311)
There is yet a further complication in applying post-Marxist concepts to the real AND but is something which is self defined, the complications become even greater.

The affirmative attempt to change a social system through mobility is a tool of the bourgeois – it produces a politics of localism that disguises the way capital has destroyed the modern city.

The aff’s reform will not solve – the issue is primarily economic – disabled people are not viewed as profitable. Even inclusion will fail because the economic system values production that will always view disabled people as inferior and too costly
Russell no date [Marta Russell, no date given, writes on the political, social and economic aspects of disablement. Born with an impairment, Russell began writing when her impairment progressed and she no longer worked in the film industry, Disability and Capitalism, http://tokyoprogressive.org/~tpgn/index3.files/dencity/capdisabil.html]
Society still perceives disability as a medical matter. That is, society associates disability AND Disabled persons are traditionally a part of this ìreserve army of labor.î

Greider 97 (William, the bestselling author of Who Will tell the People and Secrets of the Temple, is the National Editor of Rolling Stone, One World Ready or Not The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism pg 11-12)
Economic revolution always originates with the invention of a new power source-a machine AND order was born in the United States and has been promoted ever since.

====1NC Shell - Warming==== 

The affirmative’s apocalyptic framing of climate change results in denial and despair, undermining the political will to act.

Murphy, Doctoral Student and Graduate Teaching Instructor in the Department of Human Communication Studies at the University of Denver, and Chelsea Stow, Doctoral Student and Graduate Teaching Instructor in the Department of Human Communication Studies at the University of Denver, 2008 [“Global Warming and Apocalyptic Rhetoric: A Critical Frame Analysis of US Popular and Elite Press Coverage from 1997-2007,” Paper Submitted to the Environmental Communication Division of the National Communication Association Convention in San Diego, November 20th, p. 22-23, Available Online at http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p260125_index.html, Accessed 03-18-2009]
Elements of an apocalyptic frame could be said to exist in most of the articles AND necessarily because they are taking collective and personal steps to resolve the issue.

That causes violence and nuclear genocide.
Dean ‘1 (Mitchell, Professor of Sociology at Macquarie University, “Demonic Societies: Liberalism, biopolitics, and sovereignty.” Ethnographic Explorations of the Postcolonial State, ed. Hanson and Stepputat, p. 55-58)
Consider again the contrastive terms in which it is possible to view biopolitics and sovereignty AND according to Foucault. in the functioning of the modern state (232).

====2NC Overview==== 
1. Coviello- in a world where we construct apocalyptic threats the state co-opts these representations and use them to exterminate populations- this is the internal link to all of our irrationality claims. The state takes fear and uses to manage all forms of life.

Aside from the irrationality impact we’ll isolate an independent DA to to the affirmative
Under a framework of fear and security life loses all meaning entire populations can be exterminated in attempt to find security. Under this conception of life there is no meaning other than the security of the whole. Theres no reason to vote for the affirmative impacts when people have no meaning because they have been marginalized by the state.

2. Der derian is the internal link to all of our case turn arguments- he says when we inject security it means our predictions of threats are flawed because of the irrationality security inspires.

3. There’s no way the plan outweighs – they’ve conceded the link argument – it proves that all the 1AC impacts are constructs of the military industrial complex. Means that threats aren’t real and you shouldn’t give their advantages any weight.


====2NC Alt==== 
Extend Burke here Individual advocacy in this round is crucial to the breaking down of security discourse, the way we present arguments influences how we act in terms of political advocacy. Security operates through the lens of state social mapping. People are told they are inherently violent, and it acts as a control mechanism. This round isn’t about whether or not the plan actually happens its about the personal accountability for the impacts. Burke says only through rejecting the way security affects our lives on individual basis and our power to change. The affirmative literally discourse feeds into a power system that makes life meaningless.

Burke indicates that and individual rejection of irrational security is the critical first step in breaking it down. Many movements for liberation have started from the basis of a few individuals. This grassroots movement will be able to change the way the United States operates in foreign policy through proactive change.

Thus the role of the ballot serves as two fold
1. To recognize that humans aren’t inherently violent-ask yourself when the last time you killed someone was. People are only violent in the context of the state lens that’s coviello. This rejection of this cop out is necessary for coalition building- too create a positive basis for change.
2. The alternative should be evaluated before the case, if we win that violence is only inevitable when we accept as being thus we open the possibility for the wholesale rejection of state based security. Means we solve all of the aff’s internal links and avoid our net benefits of state genocide, and the case turns.

====2NC Framework==== 
Our interpretation is that the affirmative should have to present a topical plan action and should have to justify its representations.

Reasons to prefer
A. Ground- if the negative were tied down only to CP’s and the status quo the 2ac would win every round by reading a ton of add-ons.
B. Fairness- Critiques are a key part of negative strategy we need them too to beat back unpredictable affs.
C. Education- The affirmatives interpretation kills all philosophical education by ruling out any critique alternatives. This philosophical education is good in learning about different worldviews.
D. Fiat is illusory- no coherent reason why simulating the case is good at best the judge too default to what he has control over- the discourse in this round.

And, Security discourse defines who deserves authority – these discourses shape policy by determining what can and cannot be thought
Lipschutz 1998
Ronnie, Director – Politics PhD Program, UC Santa Cruz, 1998. “On Security” p. 7
Conceptualizations of security--from which follow policy and practice--are to be found in discourses of security…an attribute not so much of specific agents as it is of discursive practices."

Assuming that politics has an endpoint without looking at the justifications and processes that lead to that politics results in devastating consequences by destroying the agency of discussing the linguistic acts that lead to political choice

====AT: Perm==== 
1. All of our links prove that the alternative is a mutually exclusive with the view of security the affirmative perpetuates.

2. Coviello acts a DA to the permutation extend that under a framework of fear life loses meaning. Theres a risk that all the aff’s body claim don’t matter

3. Combinations of the alternative and the state result in the cooption of intellectuals into a political, interventionist sphere

4. The perm is severance- You can’t kick out of the way you frame your impacts and the necessary responses in the 1ac- it’s a voter
A. Ground- the aff can just kick out of everything in the world where severance is justified- means the neg doesn’t have any kind of basis for writing positions
B. Fairness- If the 1AC can spike out of any position it means that we will also lose on the negative

5. It’s net beneficial to do the alt by itself- only then can we avoid all of the case turn arguments

====AT: Realism Inevitable (Humans)==== 
1. Not true- the idea that humans are biologically destined to be violent is ridiculous. Whens the last time any of the people in this room actually went out and killed someone.

2. there have been plenty of movements and societies throughout history that have used non violent methods to construct social change- our Campbell evidence indicates that a critical interrogation of how we’ve been told to behave is necessary to solve.

3. Coviello indicates this is the internal link to our value life claims the idea that the state can set up social structures where everyone is violent is exactly the reason why state violence is justified.

===Environmental Security K=== 

====1NC Shell==== 
The affirmative expands the concept of security to include the environment, this framing spills over and expands government power and justifying totalitarian projects in the name of the environment

This fact seems to me to stand behind Susan Sontag's incisive observation, from 1989, that, "Apocalypse…the threat of an apocalyptic demise, nuclear or otherwise, seems a civic initiative that can scarcely be done without.

Environmental securitization merely serves the status quo because it is so focused on securing society from a specific environmental harm that it prevents discussions about larger human practices and causes more insecurity and structural violence.

====2NC Overview==== 
Coviello- in a world where we construct apocalyptic threats the state co-opts these representations and use them to exterminate populations- this is the internal link to all of our irrationality claims. The state takes fear and uses to manage all forms of life.

Under this conception of life there is no meaning other than the security of the whole. Theres no reason to vote for the affirmative impacts when people have no meaning because they have been marginalized by the state.

====2NC Link Wall==== 
The plan creates government intervention in the name of environmental security – their water wars and food security impacts are clear links to this arg –

Turns case
-centralized state hurts the environment
-leads to militarized intervention
-us/them dichotomy – leads to use of force that's Coviello

When the government posits itself as being the experts of the environment and those who know best in order for productive things, that causes the problem because it creates the environment as something to be acted upon or controlled, according to what the government thinks is best.

Cx – why does ocean collapse cause extinction? That’s their security threat

They can’t have long term solvency – Barnett – governmental approaches focus on short term quick fixes rather than long term sustainable solutions – two implications
1. Proves serial policy failure – when we try to avoid imminent food crises or environmental collapses we fail to address the root cause of the environment.
2. Root cause – our Barnett evidence indicates that this security framing has ultimately perpetuated the conflict – the warming movement is a perfect example

====2NC Solvency Wall==== 
The counterplan solves the entirety of the case – the internal links to their advantages are based off of the result of the implementation of the plan – not the implementation itself. The CP results in the same form of transportation infrastructure – means the CP solves the advantages.

Extend Levitt 11 – the Chinese Sovereign Wealth Fund would create public private partnerships that would rebuild domestic infrastructure – their investment in Africa proves that they could successfully implement the aff.

Presumption flows negative – the CP is less than the plan – the plan has to borrow money from China to be able to invest means the CP takes less steps through directly funding

Evaluate CP solvency through sufficiency – the CP solves enough of the case to solve the impacts, means the magnitude of the disadvantage outweighs the solvency deficit. The affirmative has to win that the CP solves for 0% of the impact for them to weight their advantages.

China control is most efficient
Yuwei 12 (Zhang, writer for China Daily, February 14 2012, "Chinese funds could help strengthen US infrastructure," http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2012-02/14/content_14606475.htm CM)

====AT: Perm – Do Both==== 
Its Implies possession
The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 2009, (Fourth Edition, http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/its)
its (ĭts) adj. The possessive form of it. Used as a modifier before a noun: The airline canceled its early flight to New York.

Implies ‘of itself’ – excludes new funds
The Oxford American Dictionary and Language Guide 99 (Oxford University Press, Inc., “its,” pg. 523)
Its poss. pron. Of it: of itself

The permutation links to the net benefit

CP competes off the funding of the plan – no reason to fund a plan twice – which means the permutation links more to the net benefit

There’s no reason to prefer the perm – the perm and the CP fully fund the plan – evaluate permutations through net benefits because the affirmative should have to prove the plan is preferable (that was their interpretation on framework)

Political interference prevents solvency and causes China to invest in other countries – decreases competitiveness
McAllister 11 (Geraldine McAllister and Joel H. Moser, “Beyond treasuries: A foreign direct investment program for U.S. infrastructure,” Columbia FDI Perspectives, No. 46, September 12, 2011, http://www.vcc.columbia.edu/content/beyond-treasuries-foreign-direct-investment-program-us-infrastructure)
In his jobs address to a joint session of Congress last week, President Obama returned to a familiar theme…and as contemplated by the Simpson-Bowles commission.


====AT: Perm – Do the CP==== 
Severance is a voting issue:
A. Ground- the aff can just kick out of everything in the world where severance is justified- means the neg doesn’t have any kind of basis for writing positions
B. Fairness- If the 1AC can spike out of any position it means that we will also lose on the negative
The counterplan solves the entirety of the case – the internal links to their advantages are based off of the result of the implementation of the plan – not the implementation itself. The CP results in the same form of transportation infrastructure – means the CP solves the advantages.

====AT: International Fiat==== 
China was part of the 2008 bailout – inclusion of the CP allows us to engage the question of whether or not governments should spend money to help the economy

**[**48] Statutory Interpretation. HN16While the CAA defines a "modification" as any physical or…engine was in perfect condition.

B. Violation: The plan simply reallocates funds from one sector to another

C. Reasons to Prefer
1. Limits- There’s a massive amount of programs the aff could reallocate funding from, and a near infinite amount of possibilities as to what program’s funding goes to what other program. Gives the neg a huge research burden that can’t be overcome
2. Ground- We lose access to all spending, trade-off, and politics disads because the aff isn’t a net increase of the status quo
3. Predictability- Our interpretation allows for a clear brightline for what is and isn’t topical, allows for the most predictable and stable case list.
4. Kills Education- We should be getting good in depth education about new innovative policies rather than stale proposals. Our interp allows for aff creativity within reasonable boundaries.

D. Voter for fairness and education. Default to competing interpretations as it’s the only objective way to analyze the round.

Unfortunately, asserting that any expenditure will create a specific number of jobs is not well … such crude estimates of job creation do not address the longer term economic impacts discussed earlier.

====2NC Deficit Spending Bad – Top Level==== 
Extend Ayotte – more recent current events flow neg
a) Credit downgrade – deficit spending caused the credit downgrade – this means there’s at least the international perception that the US is declining – that's enough to turn their competitiveness impact and cause the power vacuum that Royal discusses.
b) Euro crisis proves – countries like Spain and Greece had massive economic collapses as a RESULT of massive deficits in the short term – prefer more recent empirical evidence because it takes into account the most recent changes in the economy

Extend our Barro evidence – deficit spending leads to debt, which hurts the economy in the long term – we have the most qualified evidence on this question – Barru is a professor of economics at Harvard
it provides multiple warrants
1. Lack of evidence – there is no evidence about the most recent US stimulus that indicates that it saved the economy. Germany and Sweden, on the other hand, practiced austerity, which caused massive growth.
2. At best they create economic growth for 1 year – even if they get a short term stimulus, it results in overall net negative economic growth because it has economic consequences in the years following the stimulus.
3. New stimulus causes a worse debt to GDP ratio – uncontrollable debt prevents our ability to manage the nearing fiscal cliff and triggers a recession

====2NC TI Spending Turns Econ==== 
Infrastructure spending fails- not targeted to the exactly locations of need, not timely, and not temporary.

Today I would like to address three important issues. First, infrastructure spending is a particularly bad…means of providing employment or creating economic growth is unlikely to be effective.

Infrastructure spending is net negative for growth

Does anyone seriously believe that the reason we have high unemployment in America is because we have a substandard infrastructure?…they don’t know what they are doing.

If we win that infrastructure spending specifically is bad, then we win the debate. The private sector would have invested in something else
Cochrane, Prof @ University of Chicago Booth School of Business, 09 (John H. “Fiscal Stimulus, Fiscal Inflation, or Fiscal Fallacies?” Feb. 27, http://faculty.ses.wsu.edu/rayb/420/fiscal_stimulus.pdf)

====2NC Plan Kills Jobs==== 
Extend our two pieces of Wachs evidence - they can’t solve job growth and make it worse
1. They hurt the economy in the short term – construction jobs and expenditure on resources are wasteful spending that doesn’t do anything because it doesn’t immediately increase productivity. This is analogous to the broken window fallacy. We could intentionally break a ton of windows and hire a bunch of workers to repair them, but that doesn’t produce anything or increase the amount of goods in the economy – it merely shifts who has possession of money which proves our crowd out argument.

No solvency – won’t stimulate employment or growth

====2NC Econ D==== 
Extend 1NC 6 – Barnett – their econ impact is empirically denied – the 2008 recession was a global economic collapse, yet it had no impact on the international security landscape.

Air pollution doesn’t cause extinction – past higher levels of pollution prove.

1. No causal link between CO2 and warming – sun cycles better explain climate change

A direct causal relationship between carbon dioxide levels and global temperature has not been…The warm period of the 1930s Dust Bowl and following cool period (1940-1975) correlate closely with sun cycles.

2. Their impact comparisons are made up – not even the most advanced supercomputers can make accurate doomsday climate predictions

BETHESDA, Md. -- That North Pole ice has turned liquid may be the least of our problems. New studies…Likewise, rare chemicals like SF5 CF3 could be controlled without harm to industry.

====2NC Sun Cycles==== 

No link between CO2 and warming – geological data indicates that increases in CO2 occur AFTER increases in temperature – means that sun cycles better explain warming – Balgord

The real cause of warming is the sun
The Business, 2003 (March 2, 2003, SECTION: Pg. 8 “HEADLINE: TOO MUCH HOT AIR ON GLOBAL WARMING”)
Global temperatures have fluctuated dramatically over the past 1m years from purely natural causes,…dioxide works as a fertiliser for most plants, especially wheat and rice, and many scientists expect productivity to increase by about 30%.

Warming not caused by greenhouse gas emissions – satellites prove
Ebell, Georgia, and Horner, 2001 (Myron, Paul J., and Christopher, Competitive Enterprise Institute, “Global Warming and Energy Policy”http://www.cei.org/pdf/2317.pdf)
Myth: Humans Are Key Cause of Warming…Therefore, the observed surface warming during the second half of the 20th century cannot plausibly be attributed to increasing greenhouse concentrations.

====2NC Warming Impacts Made Up==== 
Warming impacts are bullshit – even the most advanced super computers can’t make accurate doomsday climate predictions – to take into account all special scales and make a predictive 40-year forecast would take 10^34 power of supercomputing which makes it impossible – Ridenour

Prefer our evidence – it indicts the methodology of theirs – warming claims are exaggerated and have little scientific basis. Scientists manipulate findings to ensure their funding. To keep Congress interested, they must come up with interesting theories. In addition to this, their reports are rarely reviewed by other scientists because they feel they must get their information out to the public as quickly as possible.

Claims of environmental collapse and global warming are exaggerated and not true-4 reasons
The Economist, 2001 (August 4, 2001 U.S. Edition, “The truth about the environment - By invitation”)
All this contradicts the litany. Yet opinion polls suggest that many people, in the rich world, at least,…
That is just one-12,000th of the area of the entire United States.

Environmentalist and scientists have financial motivations to exaggerate findings-their doomsday predictions cannot be taken literally
Bailey, 1993 (Ronald, Science Correspondent for Reason, guest lecturer at Harvard, Rutgers, the CATO institute, and the American enterprise institute, Eco-Scam, pg. 171)
Reporters and readers should keep firmly in mind the fact that every institution has its own self…Make sure you can distinguish when a scientist is speaking as an expert and when he is speaking merely as a concerned citizen.

Claims of Environmental Apocalypse constructed for many reasons-they are financially and politically motivated and they draw support because people are psychologically attracted to them

====2NC SO2 Screw==== 
SO2 produces both direct and indirect cooling in several key regions of the globe

Charlson and his coauthors say a concerted effort is required to improve understanding of aerosols…have represented the greenhouse aspect of the problem.

====2NC CO2 Ag==== 
First the link – Increasing CO2 boosts ag yields which solves the impact of warming on agriculture – it stimulates faster growth and resistance to the environment – plants will be able to withstand drought, pollutants, and temperature extremes – that’s Balgord. This prevents starvation on a massive scale – our Idso & Idso evidence says that letting CO2 stimulation of plants run its natural evolutionary course is the only way to sustain crop growth which is key to global food sufficiency – empirically CO2 stimulation works and it’s the only way to prevent starvation.

Two impacts

First – it’s a moral side constraint – ignoring the needs of starving people when we have the means to save them is the equivalent of looking another person in the face and killing them – we should not condemn innocents to die in the name of questionable environmental science –Andre & Velasquez.

Second – ag shortages are the root cause of global warfare means their impacts are inevitable – wars empirically have started due to poverty in countries who depend on ag and the reverse is also true, sustainable ag drive growth and development because CO2 plays an important role in the photosynthetic process which is the foundation of life – AND they make future wars inevitable - expanding population growth necessitates increase in food production which is only possible with current levels of CO2 emissions – Idso & Idso

Agricultural failures will cause wars and destroy civilization

With the third world's population expected to grow by 2 billion people in the next few years,…Water scarcity is a spreading global problem and, some say, will be the central source of tension among nations that could lead to war.

Isaac 02 (Professor of Political Science at Indiana-Bloomington, Director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life, PhD from Yale, Jeffery C., Dissent Magazine, Vol. 49, Iss. 2, “Ends, Means, and Politics,” p. Proquest)
As a result, the most important political questions are simply not asked. It AND not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness.

Utilitarianism is the only moral framework and alternatives are inevitability self-contradictory
Nye, Political Science professor, ’86 [Joseph S. 1986; Phd Political Science Harvard. University; Served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs; “Nuclear Ethics” pg. 18-19]

2. Ground – key neg generics like Politics, Tradeoff, Spending, etc., are lost because they only apply to plans that occur THROUGHOUT the country

Not defending North Carolina would be severance – that’s a voting issue
