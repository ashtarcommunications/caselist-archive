**Advantage 3 is Turkey-Syria**

**Turkey-Syrian war is likely and will happen**
**Wright 12** (Robert is a senior editor at The Atlantic and the author, most recently, of [[http://www.evolutionofgod.net/|The Evolution of God]], a New York Times bestseller and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, “Why Turkey and Syria are Heading toward War”, [[http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/why-turkey-and-syria-are-heading-toward-war/263415/]])
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But wars are often fought by countries whose leaders didn't really want them. (See World War I.) A common reason is that neither regime feels it can afford to be seen by its people as backing down. But perhaps more </span>__important are__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> some other </span>__dynamics pushing these countries toward war__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">: [1] </span>__Turkey could decide__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> before long that </span>__war is preferable to the alternatives__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The </span>__Syrian civil war is creating all kinds of problems for Turkey__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There's a </span>__big influx of refugees, and__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> there's also the Kurdish issue: Many of </span>__Syria's Kurds hope to use the civil war as an opportunity to carve out a__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">n autonomous or even </span>__sovereign__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Kurdish </span>__region in Syria__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and </span>__Turkey fears__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span>__this could__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> prove contagious, </span>__embolden__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">ing </span>__Kurdish separatists in Turkey__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and energizing longstanding dreams of a new Kurdish nation that comprises parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran. Both of these issues--refugees and Kurdish nationalism--could lead Turkey to conclude that the sooner the Syrian civil war ends, the better. And helping fight it could help end it--especially if Turkey's fellow members of NATO [[http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/us-syria-crisis-idUSBRE88J0X720121009|help out]].</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [2] Speaking of NATO: The fact that a Turkish-Syrian war </span>__could draw America into__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>__conflict__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> will make such a war more attractive to some backers of American intervention. That includes some influential Americans (largely, but not entirely, drawn from the crowd that got the U.S. into the Iraq war), but it </span>__also__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> includes non-Americans, among them, presumably, the leaders of </span>__some Arab states.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And the more influential players there are who want a war to happen, the more likely it is to happen.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [3] </span>__Syria feels it can't afford to ignore the Turkish border.__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The casual reader of the news might ask: If Syria doesn't want a war, and Syrian shells that fall on the Turkish side of the border could start a war, why doesn't Syria quit firing shells anywhere near the border? Indeed, why not bow to the Turkish demand for a buffer zone on the Syrian side of the border? The answer is simple: The Syrian regime </span>__is fighting for its life__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and along the Turkish-Syrian border lies the lifeline of its enemy//.// The rebels are being supplied with weapons via Turkey and are seizing control of border crossings inside Syria, and their goal is to build, from there, an expanding zone of control. </span>__Can you imagine any__ __regime, in__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>__Syria__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">n regime's situation, </span>__not fighting to keep control__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or retake control, of border crossings, and not trying to disrupt the enemy's supply of arms and ammunition near the point of origin?</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [4] Turkey is, in a sense, already at war with the Syrian regime. The rebels aren't just being supplied //via// Turkey; they're being supplied //by// Turkey--at least in the sense that Turkey has willingly, even eagerly, turned itself into an arms and ammunition conveyer belt that is stocked by such countries as Saudi Arabia and Qatar. (The US is confining its contribution to "non-lethal" supplies such as communications equipment--which, of course, does in fact help the rebels kill people.) So the Turkish indignation at shells landing on Turkish soil is ironic; Turkey is sending lots more ammo into Syria than Syria is sending into Turkey--the difference is that the ammo Turkey is sending actually kills lots of people. That Turkey's role as a conduit of arms and ammunition isn't a passive one may make Syria even less inclined to keep its fire far from the border.</span>

''We told Bashar he needed to find a political solution to the crisis,'' he said. ''We said, 'These are our people that we are killing'.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ''We suggested that we work with the Friends of Syria group, but he </span>__refused to stop__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span>__operations or__ <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to </span>__negotiate__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.''</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Advertisement</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Mr Hijab referred to the war waged against the Muslim Brotherhood by Mr Assad's father, Hafez, which led to the deaths of up to 10,000 people in an assault on the city of Hama.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span>__''Bashar__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> really </span>__thinks that he can settle this militarily__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">,'' he said.

Once formed, the new council would seek to gain formal international recognition, and, crucially, better weapons.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Mr Hijab said the lack of serious action by the West had consolidated Mr Assad's confidence.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ''Bashar </span>__used to be scared of the international community__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - he was really worried that they would impose a no-fly zone over Syria,'' he said. </span>__''But__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> then </span>__he tested the waters, and__<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> pushed and pushed and </span>__nothing happened__<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

''The new minister of defence sent out a communique telling all heads in the military that they should do 'whatever is necessary' to win,'' he said.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ''I am shocked to see Bashar do what he has been doing,'' he said.

**<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Over the course of almost 20 months, the </span>__fighting in Syria__ __has escalated from uprising to armed rebellion to a civil war that__** __threatens the security of the entire Middle East**.**__**<span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶ It has been labelled everything from a new Cold War between Russia (and China) and the West, a proxy war between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia, and a new front for al-Qaeda.¶ </span>__Religious rivalries__ __between Syria's majority Sunni population and the regime's ruling Alawites__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> — an offshoot of Shia Islam — </span>__have been exacerbated__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> by a steady stream of foreign fighters flocking to both sides of the battlefield.¶ And now, a </span>__further escalation is threatened by__ __the nation-seeking Kurds__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> — ensconced </span>__in__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Syria, </span>__Turkey, Iraq and Iran__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> — suddenly </span>__deciding to join the fray__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.¶ Syria's Kurds make up about 10 per cent of the population, and they are long-time opponents of the Bashar al-Assad regime.¶ Until now, they have largely kept out of the conflict, which has left over 36,000 dead.¶ But last Friday, armed members of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) clashed with the opposition Free Syrian Army fighters (FSA) who were trying to take control of a neighbourhood in Aleppo.¶ Hundreds were kidnapped from both sides, presumably to be held as hostages, and skirmishes continued in the neighbouring countryside for days.¶ Turkish media referred to this latest development as the most important, and most troubling of the recent failed ceasefire, brokered by the UN envoy for Syria Lakhdar Brahimi.¶ A tangled web of alliances explains the concern.¶ Turkey embroiled¶ The PYD is the sister party to Turkey's Kurdistan Worker's Party, better known as the PKK, militants who have been fighting successive Turkish governments for 25 years to carve out an area of self-rule in southeast Turkey.¶ The Turkish government considers them a terrorist organization and has thrown many of them in jail, where they have embarked on a months-long hunger strike.¶ At the same time, the Erdogan government has been the strongest international supporter of the Syrian opposition and the FSA since the onset of the conflict.¶ It has offered safe haven to the regime's military and political opponents, and led the diplomatic charge against al-Assad and for NATO to become involved.¶ Fighting between the FSA and militant Kurds in Syria, then, represents an expansion of Turkey's internal struggle with the PKK and adds an element of ethnic strife to an already anarchic battlefield.¶ It also opens the door to the possibility of a new front, one that would distract from the fight against the regime, and that </span>__might drag Turkey__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> even </span>__deeper into__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> the </span>__conflict__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">.¶ Cross-border shelling¶ </span>__Tensions between Turkey and Syria__<span style="font-size: 6pt;">, once close allies, </span>__have been__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> particularly </span>__high__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> since June when the Syrian military downed a Turkish fighter jet.¶ Then, last month, a mortar bomb from Syria exploded in a residential neighbourhood in the Turkish border town of Akçakale, killing five people and wounding others.¶ The </span>__Turkish Parliament__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> quickly </span>__passed legislation allowing the military to retaliate and__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> sporadic shelling and </span>__gunfire have been exchanged__<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> across the border ever since.¶ War talk was rampant for a few days, but it was soon quelled. Large street protests erupted against a possible war with Syria, while other demonstrations have pitted police against Kurds supporting the imprisoned hunger strikers. Tensions are riding high on many fronts.¶ A member of NATO, Turkey has always been in a unique position, and is again now, perhaps more than ever.¶ A former imperial power (the seat of the Ottoman Empire) it is now a staunch Western ally that maintains political and economic ties with Iran and Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood.¶ It ceaselessly fulfills the rather tired adage of being the place where East meets West.¶ At the same time, its prime minister, Erdogan, is a divisive figure to many. He often talks tough, bullies and grandstands, exhibiting a Middle Eastern macho that is seen by many here as charismatic, but that translates poorly in other parts of the world.¶ His crackdown on the Kurds, and journalists alike, have merited Turkey one of the lowest human rights rankings of any democracy.¶ And yet he relentlessly jockeys for central stage in the Middle East, trumpeting Turkey as a model for the nascent democracies of the region.¶ Erdogan is something of a puzzle to the West, and never more so than when he strikes out on his own, as he did again last week.¶ Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davotoglu, announced that Turkey ruled out any dialogue with the Syrian regime, which runs against the grain of the ongoing international negotiations, which continue to seek a political solution over any military intervention.¶ But then, Turkey is unique in that it shares such a long, over-800 kilometre border with Syria, and from almost every perspective — geographical, economic, political alliances and influence — the stakes are simply higher here.¶ The government has now heavily fortified the border – moving troops and tanks all along the frontier – and the military has struck back at the Syrians more than a few times of late.</span>**

**__Naval forces can be employed in support of foreign policy__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, military (theater) strategy, and peace operations. </span>__Navies are an ideal tool__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> for providing support of foreign policy.

Navies are generally much more effective than armies or air forces in terms of their international acceptability and capacity to make the desired impact. They can be used symbolically to send a message to a specific government. When a stronger message is required, naval diplomacy can take the form of employment of carefully tailored forces with a credible offensive capability, signaling that a much more capable force will follow, or it can give encouragement to a friendly country by providing reinforcement. </span>__The threat of the use of__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> limited </span>__offensive action__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> or coercion </span>__might__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> be designed to </span>__deter a possible aggressor__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> or to compel him to comply with a diplomatic demarche or resolution. Naval forces can be used in conflict prevention, coercive diplomacy, and peace operations. Conflict prevention includes diverse military activities conducted either unilaterally or collectively under Chapter VI of the UN Charter and aimed at either preventing escalation of disputes into armed conflict or facilitating resolution of armed violence. These actions range from diplomatic initiatives to preventive deployment of naval forces. </span>__The main purpose of the forward presence of U.S. naval forces in the__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> western Pacific, </span>//<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Arabian Sea, Persian (Arabian) Gulf</span>////,//<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and </span>__Mediterranean is to prevent the outbreak of large-scale hostilities__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> that might affect the national interests of the United States and its allies or friends. </span>__Naval forces deployed in forward areas should__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> be of sufficient size and combat power to </span>__defeat opposing forces quickly__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and decisively.</span>**

Carriers are key
Trombly 12 **(Daniel Trombly, 8/22/12 analyst and writer on international affairs and strategy. Contributor to “Abu Muqawama” and “Slouching Toward Columbia” “The cost of a Syria Intervention” [[http://news.usni.org/news-analysis/news/cost-syrian-intervention]])**
**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Discerning the capability of Syria’s integrated air defense system (IADS) is critical to that question. American officials, such as General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the </span>__Joint Chiefs of Staff, stress__ <span style="font-size: 7pt;">the </span>__sophistication of Syria’s IADS relative to other countries__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> in the region and particularly in comparison with Libya. Syria has faced American air power before, while the embarrassments of Israel defeating of its air force in the 1982 Lebanon War and destroying a Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007 left it acutely aware of the need to deter and defeat hostile air power.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Nevertheless, analysts such as Sam O’Connor, of IHS Jane’s, have asserted that with adequate resources, </span>__America__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> and its allies </span>__could__ __effectively defeat Syrian IADS and achieve air superiority for follow-on operations. Those could include decapitation strikes to directly target Syrian leadership, or the establishment of safe zones to create buffers between cities and the Syrian military__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Libya’s IADS relied on obsolete or aging Soviet-era weapons clustered along the coastline. Enjoying warming Western ties early in the 21st century, Libya did not invest heavily in a capability for defending against modern air power. Syria, in contrast, has sought to extensively upgrade its IADS in recent years. Seeking to counter the Israeli air force and concerned with its tense border with Turkey or an American attack, Syria’s IADS features much deeper and denser coverage, with newer and more effective weapon systems.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> MIT’s Haggerty identifies nearly 450 likely targets for a suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) campaign, including more than 20 C2 (command and control) and early warning facilities, 150 surface-to-air (SAM) sites, 205 aircraft shelters, and 32 additional airfield-related targets, as well as dozens of additional surface-to-surface or anti-ship missile targets that could threaten bases or ships in the theater. Libya had only 31 comparable SAM sites, some of which were already in rebel-controlled territory, and just five airfields required serious strikes, because some were under rebel control. Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) appear to offer an easy solution to initial SEAD needs, but limitations exist.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> First, stocks of TLAMs are limited, particularly in the aftermath of the Libyan effort. By 19 March, the United States and U.K. had launched roughly 100 TLAMs from surface ships and submarines. Within a week, they launched another 100 strikes. With America launching the vast majority of those strikes, Raytheon recently received a contract for an additional 361 TLAMs to replenish Libya-depleted stocks and meet FY2012 needs. Secondly, TLAMs are not always sufficient for destroying hard targets such as aircraft shelters. As Haggerty notes, precision strikes from bombers—likely B-2s, but potentially also B-1Bs or B-52s if SAM suppression is adequate—will likely need to drop multiple precision-guided munitions to destroy Syria’s air force on the ground.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> The </span>__increased need for__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> TLAMs, strategic bombers, and </span>__aircraft specialized for electronic warfare and SEAD missions__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> for these initial strikes alone are all likely to </span>__shift__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the </span>__burden onto American forces__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, relative to both Odyssey Dawn and Allied Force. Not only that, but follow-on strikes will </span>**__require__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> a significantly larger number of strike aircraft and may require </span>**__deployment of a U.S. aircraft carrier__**<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, a commitment unneeded for the Libyan operation.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Haggerty estimates more than 200 remaining targets for strike-aircraft sorties. Simply for delivering adequate munitions, at least 191 strike aircraft would participate, with about 105 additional support aircraft contributing to the air campaign. This lower bound number is roughly equivalent to Operation Allied Force over Kosovo, but </span>__neutralizing Syrian IADS will likely require higher numbers of sorties from electronic warfare (EW) aircraft and other specialized platforms__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> By comparison, in Libya, the U.S. contributed ten F-15Es and eight F-16CJs to efforts associated with SEAD. NATO forces added an additional 28 F-16s, 11 F-18 variants from Canada and Spain, 8 Rafales, 4 Mirages, and 10 Tornados (including 2 Italian SEAD variants). Besides strike aircraft, the United States contributed three B-2s and two B-1 bombers. A NATO effort in Syria would clearly be a much larger effort, in terms of both strategic bombing, TLAM strikes, and strike aircraft. While it would be within the realm of possibility, complicating factors remain.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Although reporting likely exaggerated the degree of ordnance-stock depletion during Libya, the large number of sorties that smaller countries such as Denmark undertook will shift the burden onto larger air forces, such as the United States, U.K., and France. Mitigating that, fortunately, would be presumed Turkish participation in a Syrian air campaign, bringing to bear the world’s third-largest F-16 operator. That said, </span>__given__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> the potential </span>__susceptibility of Turkish aircraft to insufficiently degraded__ __Syrian IADS, the burden they can bear in initial strikes is unclear.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> While Turkey has a clear stake in Syria, the political will for participating in another aerial campaign is also questionable.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span>__While European countries__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">, especially France, </span>__were enthusiastic about intervention in Libya, for Syria there seems no comparable fervor__<span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Even under the aegis of a NATO operation, it is unlikely Germany—sadly, given its advanced SEAD capabilities—would participate, and other countries, such as Britain, France, and Italy, may not be as forthcoming with their aerial support. Yet the Phase 1 of any air campaign in Syria—the reduction of its IADS—is likely to be a massive undertaking, significantly larger in scale than Libya, and in some ways more sophisticated in its technical challenges than the campaign in Kosovo.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Important questions remain, however. The ability of Phase 1 SEAD operations to clear the way for a broader campaign targeting the regime, enforcement of a “safe zone” against concentrated Syrian regime forces, or both, is partially dependent on the response of Syrian forces to initial SEAD efforts. In Libya, the regime had little in the way of mobile or semi-mobile SAMs, and even less cohesion or preparation for doing so. However, despite the inability of Libyans to respond to Odyssey Dawn’s overwhelming force, the will of the Libyan armed forces to resist remained unbroken.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Were Syria to judiciously disperse and delay use of its IADS, as Serbia did in 1999, it would severely limit Allied freedom of action. A persistent, dispersed, and mobile Syrian IADS capability would significantly complicate Allied attempts to enforce a no-fly zone, safe zone, or conduct other strikes against the regime. The threat of hidden or elusive SAMs would lower the rate of follow-on strike sorties and likely significantly increase the cost and potential casualties for the intervening force.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Several commentators, noting the efficacy of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) strikes in U.S. counterterrorism, have suggested using them in lieu of a broader campaign, but past campaigns demonstrate SEAD’s essential role. While UAVs are nigh invulnerable against insurgent groups without antiaircraft weapons, against well-equipped government, this omnipotence evaporates. In 1999, the U.S. Air Force sent five MQ-1 Predators to Serbia, which shot three down. A fourth crashed. In Libya, Predator strikes only began in April, after SEAD operations. Because combat UAVs are more vulnerable to hostile attack than manned aircraft, SEAD is a vital prerequisite.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">¶</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> While Syria is hardly invincible, Haggerty’s analysis is a stark reminder of the requirements simply for clearing the way for any kind of military campaign. The United States and its allies </span>__make unfettered access to aerial battlespace an integral part of their military operations.__<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> Given the cost of fighting without assured IADS suppression and air superiority, they will need to spare no expense in resourcing and prosecuting a comprehensive SEAD campaign over Syria. Though not insurmountable, a sober reading of the military challenges and resources available to meet them suggest that a Syrian air campaign—if it is to be painless—will not come cheaply.</span>
