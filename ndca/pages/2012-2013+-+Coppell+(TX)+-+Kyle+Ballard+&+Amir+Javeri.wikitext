====**Alliance**==== 
**Contention one:** **Alliance**
**1. Deadlock over relocation halts bilateral engagement – realignment makes the alliance effective**
Barnes 12 (Julian E. Barnes, Pentagon reporter at the Wall Street Journal, Yuka Hayashi, staff writer for the Wall Street Journal, Wall Street Journal, 4/27/12, "U.S. and Japan Agree on Deal To Move Forces", http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303990604577368563724460628.html)

The U.S. and Japan reached agreement Thursday on a long-stalled
AND
S. intends to defend their interests and protect the current international order.

**2. Now is key – negotiations are pushing Japan to shoulder a greater share of the realignment cost**
Japan Times 12 Japan Times 3/25/12 ("Japan asked to shell out extra %241 billion over marines~’ transfer to Guam", [[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120325b2.html //-http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120325b2.html// ]])

Washington is pushing Tokyo to pay an additional %241 billion over the transfer of
AND
review proposed that this figure be slashed to just 4,700 marines.

**3. Two internal links to relations**
**A) Burden-sharing – the perception of funding sends a strong signal of commitment to the buildup**
Calvo 12(Eddie Calvo, Governor of the United States territory of Guam, former Senator within the Legislature of Guam, Office of Governor Eddie Baza Calvo, 5/23/12, "NEWS: Calvo Fights for Federal Action on Guam So Buildup Can Start", [[http://governor.guam.gov/2012/05/23/news-calvo-fights-federal-action-guam-buildup-start/-http://governor.guam.gov/2012/05/23/news-calvo-fights-federal-action-guam-buildup-start/]])

The Governor~’s main point – it~’s important for leaders in Washington and Tokyo to recognize
AND
Tokyo that the U.S. government is serious about this commitment.

**B) Military drawdown –realignment transforms the alliance and ameliorates Okinawan resentment over our military footprint**
Schiffer 11 (Michael R. Schiffer, is a program officer in Policy Analysis
AND
, "US Defense Posture in the Asia-Pacific Region", ProQuest )

U.S.-Japan Alliance The U.S.-Japan alliance remains the
AND
disaster response, and capacity-building of partners in Asia more broadly.

**4. An effective alliance integrates China into global institutions —- that prevents war over Taiwan**
Nye 8 (Joseph, Joseph S. Nye, Jr., assistant secretary of defense under Clinton. Currently, Sultan of Oman Professor of International Relations and dean at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Father of Soft Power, "The Future of the Japan-U.S. Alliance," 5/21, [[http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/commentary/data/000057-http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/commentary/data/000057]])
Many analysts currently detect malaise in Japan about its alliance with the United States.

THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full
AND
should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilization.

====**Deterrence**==== 
**Contention two: Deterrence**
**Scenario 1 is the South China Sea**
**1. South China Sea conflict is the most likely scenario for escalation and great power intervention in Asia – multilateral organizations are insufficient to check instability**
Wesley 12 (Michael Wesley, Non-Resident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and an Adjunct Professor at Griffith University and The University of Sydney, former Executive Director of the Lowy Institute for International Policy, former Professor of International Relations and Director of the Griffith Asia Institute at Griffith University, and Senior Lecturer in International Relations at the University of New South Wales, July 2012, "What~’s at stake in the South China Sea?"http://lowyinstitute.cachefly.net/files/wesley_whats_at_stake_snapshot11.pdf)

The South China Sea in effect pits a Chinese expansive claim (sovereignty based on

the South China Sea will become ever more crowded with shipping and commerce.

**2. Lack of Chinese agency coordination makes miscalculation likely**

The conflicting mandates and lack of coordination among Chinese government agencies, many of
AND
and resolve disputes will present a major test of China~’s peaceful rise.

**3. Territorial disputes snowball into nuclear conflict**
Chakraborty 10 (Tuhin Subhro Chakraborty, Research Associate at Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies (RGICS), Masters from U of Delhi, The United States Service Institution of India, 2010, "The Initiation %26 Outlook of ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM) Plus Eight",http://www.usiofindia.org/Article/?pub=Strategic%20Perspective%26pubno=20%26ano=739)

**2. Specifically, North Korea will attack Guam with IRBMs absent US credibility to the region and island**
Kan 12 Shirley A. Kan 12, Specialist in Asian Security Affairs, Congressional Research Service, "Guam: U.S. Defense Deployments", 3-29,http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS22570.pdf

Strategic Target. A concern is that Guam~’s higher military profile could increase its potential
AND
Korea, Japan, Guam, and the U.S. mainland.

**3. That prevents US response and aid to the South, which kills Soko perception to the North**
**Klinger 10** Bruce Klingner 10, Senior Research Fellow, Northeast Asia, Heritage Foundation, "New North Korean Missile Unit Reflects Growing Missile Threat", 3-11, http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2010/03/new-north-korean-missile-unit-reflects-growing-missile-threat

North Korea has established an independent military division responsible for controlling and deploying its intermediate
AND
2 missile flew 2,300 miles during an April 2009 test flight.

**4. North’s underestimation of the South and limited missile capacity ensures escalation**
**Ibo 10/8** Chosun Ilbo 10-8-12, "A Poor Result from Missile Negotiations",http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/10/08/2012100801408.html

====Plan Text==== 
**Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment in transportation infrastructure in Guam.**

====Solvency==== 
**Contention three: Solvency**
**1. Investment in the Guam Road Network is critical ­– new roads are essential to the success of the marine relocation**
**DoN 10** (The United States Department of the Navy, on behalf of the Department of Defense, Guam and CNMI Military Relocation – Final Environmental Impact Statement, July 2010, Volume Six: Related Actions – Utilities and Roadway Projects, "CHAPTER 1.

**Contention 1 is Inherency**
**1. Adoption of a “fix when fail” policy ensures delays and collapse of inland waterways**
Len Boselovic, award winner for business and investigative reporting, 3/18/2012, Pittsburgh Post (“THE NATION'S LOCKS AND DAMS, INCLUDING 23 IN REGION, ARE ON THE BRINK OF FAILURE, ACCORDING TO U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS”)

Faced with flat funding, the Corps has adopted a "fix when fail"

**2. And, there’s no impact to minor delays, but age and poor maintenance makes mass lock failure inevitable**
Boselovic 2012 (Len Boselovic, Journalist for Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 5/9/2012 “Locked and Dammed: Neglect erodes river commerce,” http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/environment/locked-and-dammed-neglect-erodes-river-commerce-617136/)hhs-ps

====**Plan Text**==== 

**Plan: The United States federal government should modernize its system of locks and dams.**

====**Agriculture**==== 
**Contention 2 is Agriculture**

**1. Lock collapse decimates agriculture exports – shipping costs destroy competitiveness**
Kruse et al., Director at the Center for Ports and waterways, 2011 (“America’s Locks & Dams: “A Ticking Time Bomb for Agriculture?”, www.unitedsoybean.org/wp-content/uploads/Americas_Locks_And_Dams.pdf)

Agriculture accounted for 22% of all transported tonnage and 31% of all ton
AND
via barge; for soybeans, the percentage was 87–89%.2

**2. Alternative transportation can’t sustain the influx of freight – shift causes massive spikes in transportation cost and causes exports to plummet**
USB, 12 (United Soybean Board, 2/8/12, “Dilapidated Locks on U.S. Rivers Put Farmers, Consumers at Risk,” http://www.unitedsoybean.org/global-opportunities-briefings/dilapidated-locks-on-u-s-rivers-put-farmers-consumers-at-risk/)

The study expresses grave concern about aging locks and dams along these rivers that serve
AND
and improvement of locks, dams and other important infrastructure for agricultural shipping.

**3 Shipping cost is the biggest internal link to food price spikes**

SUMMARY Recent increases in the price of food and concerns over its availability and access
AND
fruit and vegetables, meat or fish at the domestic or international levels.

**4. The brink is high – economic recessions and recent food crises have put response capacity on the edge**
Brown 11 (LESTER R. BROWN, “The New Geopolitics of Food,” May/June 2011, foreign Policy, United States environmental analyst, founder of the Worldwatch Institute, and founder and president of the Earth Policy Institute, a nonprofit research organization based in Washington, D.C.)hhs-ps

Until recently, sudden price surges just didn't matter as much, as they were
AND
famine. We can't do that anymore; the safety cushion is gone.


=====**Famine**===== 
**Scenario 1 is Famine**
**1. Developing countries are more and more dependent on US food imports**
Kwa 03 “Developing countries are becoming more dependent on food imports,” Aileen Kwa, FOCUS ON TRADE No 86, APRIL 2003

Developing countries are becoming more dependent on food imports – especially in staple commodities.
AND
developing countries is increasing. Not only are developing countries increasingly dependent on imports

**2. Food prices wreck purchasing power in developing countries – causes mass starvation**
Von Braun 08 (DR JOACHIM VON BRAUN, Before becoming IFPRI's Director General in 2002, he served as Director of the Center for Development Research and Professor for Economic and Technological Change at the University of Bonn, Germany. His Doctoral Degree in Agricultural Economics is from the University of Gottingen, Germany, “Rising Food Prices,” Jul 29th 2008, http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/155)hhs-ps

The most disturbing consequence of high food prices is an increase in hunger and malnutrition
AND
selling their productive assets and withdrawing children, especially girls, from school.


**3. Famine is a d-rule**
LaFollette 03 [Hugh, Cole Chair in Ethics University of South Florida St. Petersburg, "World Hunger" Blackwell Companion to Applied Ethics, ed. Ray Frey and Christopher Heath Wellman, Blackwell 2003, http://www.stpt.usf.edu/hhl/papers/World.Hunger.htm]

Those who claim the relatively affluent have this strong obligation must, among other things
AND
for all than to continue to live at the expense of the starving.

=====**China**===== 
**Scenario 2 is China**
**1. Domestic production shortfalls means China is shifting heavily to food imports – price hikes tank food security and cause domestic instability**
Shea 5/29 (Paul Shea, an Irish Economics, Finance and Investment writer. His work has been featured on the front page Google News and Google Finance, “The US Has a Very Important Resource which China Doesn’t: Food,” May 29, 2012 )hhs-ps
As China’s economy grows, so too will its demand for food. It’s own
AND
deal with them at least as fervently as we deal with our own.

**2. US imports are the only internal link to collapse – other countries can’t fill in immediately due to opposite growing seasons and small market share**
WSJ 12 “UPDATE: Brazil Seen Running Out of Soybeans for Export,” June 6, 2012; hhs-ps

Because the Southern Hemisphere's planting schedule is opposite that of the U.S.,
AND
keeping the current accounts in pretty good shape," Mr. Thin said.

**3. That escalates to full political upheaval in China**
Smith 98 (Paul J. Smith is a research fellow with the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. He specializes in transnational security issues and has published numerous articles on these subjects.], “FOOD SECURITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION,” ASIA-PACIFIC CENTER FOR SECURITY STUDIES, SEPTEMBER 11, 1998http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Report_Food_Security_98.html )hhs-ps
Food security and political stability are often inextricably linked in many countries. Historically,
AND
even political revolution. Food security thus becomes an issue of regime survival.

**4. Chinese instability causes extinction**
Yee and Storey 2002 (Herbert Yee, Professor of Politics and International Relations at the Hong Kong Baptist University, and Ian Storey, Lecturer in Defence Studies at Deakin University, 2002 (The China Threat: Perceptions, Myths and Reality, RoutledgeCurzon, pg 5
The fourth factor contributing to the perception of a China threat is the fear of
AND
disintegrating China would also pose a threat to its neighbours and the world.

====**Deforestation**====

US soybean exporters have only a "narrow window" when they will have the
AND
stocks will have been disposed of and South American exports are seasonally small".

**3. Growth of Brazilian soybean exports triggers deforestation of the Amazon rainforest that is key for biodiversity**
Brown, 9 President of the Earth Policy Institute (Lester R. Brown, the recipient of many prizes and awards, including 25 honorary degrees, a MacArthur Fellowship, the 1987 United Nations' Environment Prize, In 2012, he was inducted into the Earth Hall of Fame Kyoto, “Growing Demand for Soybeans Threatens Amazon Rainforest”, December 30, 2009, http://www.earth-policy.org/plan_b_updates/2009/update86)

So biodiversity keeps the world running. It has value and of itself, as
AND
of the next century - not with a bang but a whimper.14

====**Economy**==== 
**Contention 4 is the Economy**
**1. Lack of investment in lock modernization is stifling economic recovery – the plan is key to prevent the collapse of multiple economic sectors**

We're the silent industry" because waterways are less visible, he says.

**2. Inland waterway renewal achieves short and long term economic competitiveness and job security**
Gibbs 12 (Bob, representative of Ohio, Political Transcript of a hearing of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, proquest)

But when it comes to inland waterway system, we have been investing too slowly
AND
about keeping American farms and manufacturers and businesses competitive and growing American jobs.

**3. Even if there are no catastrophic failures the lack of investment injects uncertainty that will undermine the viability of the inland waterway system**

Congress bears the prime responsibility. The buck has literally stopped on Capitol Hill.
AND
